      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to put more on.</li>
      <li>So cute.</li>
      <li>The teddy bears are more like brown bear blobs.</li>
      <li>I have to say I haven&#x27;t used these yet, but I am very excited to have them for mom&#x27;s day and summer.</li>
      <li>Great for those who are new to nail art.</li>
      <li>Plenty of variety but feels like a sampler package since you won&#x27;t be able to do a full set of fingers and toes with what is included.</li>
      <li>These are very cute, but i got 2 of the same kind, and took 3 weeks to get here</li>
      <li>Overall happy with the product.</li>

      <li>I was so excited.</li>

      <li>Love them, they came quicker than expected and they are adorable!</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>my whole family has gotten into the nail art I love this so much will always buy from cheeky</li>
      <li>My daughters have a lot of fun doing their nails with these</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used them before so it should be fun when I do.</li>
      <li>Most are about 1/2mm off the nail, but with a few good top coats no big deal.</li>
      <li>I put on 3 different flower ones and got so many complements.</li>
      <li>ive seen better their all mixed up and seller would not respond to any of my e mails</li>
      <li>I was psyched to get the starfish because they looked so adorable, but several of the things I wanted were not included in the slices I got.</li>
      <li>I actually requested to cancel these after I ordered a better package from Fimo</li>
      <li>Will definitely be coming back for more!</li>
      <li>But I probably wouldn&#x27;t have used them much anyway.</li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t get them to stay very well.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>they really did it just rite</li>
      <li>Lots of different designs to choose from and even a perfect fit for small nails for the little ones!</li>
      <li>I love these fimo slices just add a little nail glue to the slice and apply to nail</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a little bit glad they sent it anyway because I can now do a comparison between the two brands.</li>
      <li>I try and get new designs when they come out..</li>
      <li>They are small and thin, perfect for putting on nails.</li>
      <li>and they last the whole time your nail polish does..</li>
      <li>It took a minute to get them but because of where they r shipped from completely understandable.</li>
      <li>I had never tried fimo nail art because at my beauty supple store it is expensive, but these were a good price</li>
      <li>Fast delivery-way early than what was to be expected.</li>
      <li>When I opened the package I noticed that a few were mixed up and 3 were cut funny</li>

<li> I am super impatient when it comes to these things so waiting two and a half weeks was not very pleasant, but it was worth it when they arrived.</li>
<li> The Cheeky slices seemed to be a bit better quality than the Fimo ones, but I was super disappointed when I found out that the Cheeky ones didn&#x27;t come with the starfish!</li>
<li> Cute for little girls but cut thick and a little bulky.</li>
<li> I still think the cherrys can double upside down as rat faces.</li>
<li> I just received these after two and a half WEEKS of waiting for them to arrive.</li>
<li> Out of all 5 cases about 2-3 compartments have 1-2 half pieces in them in each case.</li>
<li> Less of each shape than anticipated.</li>
<li> these are to thick and the material is not cute</li>
<li> Have been having a hard time finding a nail supply store where the decals are sold since moving.</li>
<li> Shipping was rather slow but product arrived undamaged.</li>
<li> Seriously, for the price you can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
<li> Their really not a good deal their very small get them at sallys</li>
<li> Some slices were extremely thin or had noticeable imperfections.</li>
<li> the look ugly</li>
<li> But there is no way to adhere them to my nails  &#x3D;(</li>
<li> But with those pieces you can place them up against the base, side or edge of the nail.</li>

    <li> cute but I couldn&#x27;t get them to stay very well.</li>
    <li> I love these. A must have for anyone who loves to design their nails n do it easily and quickly. It took a minute to get them but because of where they r shipped from completely understandable. I&#x27;ll wait again when I order again and from the same seller. Love,love.</li>
    <li> So neat!!!!  These last forever, and I love all the choices!!!!</li>
    <li> I love them. Have been having a hard time finding a nail supply store where the decals are sold since moving. So happy to have found these cute little wheels. Will definitely be coming back for more!</li>
    <li> I just got these in the mail today. I was so excited. I had never tried fimo nail art because at my beauty supple store it is expensive, but these were a good price so I figured why not try them. When I opened the package I noticed that a few were mixed up and 3 were cut funny so I couldn&#x27;t use them, but no big deal. I put on 3 different flower ones and got so many complements. I love with them</li>
    <li> I just received these after two and a half WEEKS of waiting for them to arrive. I actually requested to cancel these after I ordered a better package from Fimo but I checked two days later and they shipped it despite my request. I&#x27;m a little bit glad they sent it anyway because I can now do a comparison between the two brands. The Cheeky slices seemed to be a bit better quality than the Fimo ones, but I was super disappointed when I found out that the Cheeky ones didn&#x27;t come with the starfish! I was psyched to get the starfish because they looked so adorable, but several of the things I wanted were not included in the slices I got. Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product. I am super impatient when it comes to these things so waiting two and a half weeks was not very pleasant, but it was worth it when they arrived.</li>
    <li> I love these fimo slices just add a little nail glue to the slice and apply to nail and they last the whole time your nail polish does.. I just love these easy to use easy to put on very stylish I have tones of these and different designs.. I try and get new designs when they come out..I would defiantly recommend these..</li>
    <li> Having typed that header..... 98% of the colors bang on. I still think the cherrys can double upside down as rat faces. LOL The teddy bears are more like brown bear blobs. You can see they are bears, but not to happy about them. But I probably wouldn&#x27;t have used them much anyway. Most are about 1/2mm off the nail, but with a few good top coats no big deal. Out of all 5 cases about 2-3 compartments have 1-2 half pieces in them in each case. (got that?) But with those pieces you can place them up against the base, side or edge of the nail. I have to say I haven&#x27;t used these yet, but I am very excited to have them for mom&#x27;s day and summer. I change out my nails every 5-7 days, and with all these flowers I can&#x27;t wait to overlap and cut them to make bouquets on my fingers.</li>
    <li> These fimos are so cute. I haven&#x27;t used them before so it should be fun when I do. The turn wheels were taped so that the wheel wouldn&#x27;t move and the fimos fall out. Fast delivery-way early than what was to be expected. I would buy more.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these decorations are adorable. (And I understand they are 3d) But there is no way to adhere them to my nails  &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I am in love with these! Seriously, for the price you can&#x27;t beat them. I got one or two duplicates, but they&#x27;re actually the ones I like best so I can&#x27;t complain. You may need nail glue if your nails are especially curved like mine. And I got them in 3 weeks, which is pretty impressive considering they came from China. Next I&#x27;m going to order their stamping plates!!</li>
    <li> Nice , i like it !!!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Great deal for the price. Would purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Shipping was rather slow but product arrived undamaged. Some slices were extremely thin or had noticeable imperfections. Less of each shape than anticipated. About 10-15 pieces per wedge. Overall happy with the product. Probably wont be able to use most of them on clients but will work fine for personal use. Plenty of variety but feels like a sampler package since you won&#x27;t be able to do a full set of fingers and toes with what is included. Great for those who are new to nail art.</li>
    <li> Love them, they came quicker than expected and they are adorable!</li>
    <li> Cute for little girls but cut thick and a little bulky.</li>
    <li> These are very cute, but i got 2 of the same kind, and took 3 weeks to get here</li>
    <li> These are so cute!  They also stay put.  I was a bit concerned about how well they would stick to the polish, but they are great.  The designs are fun and bright.  I can&#x27;t wait to put more on.</li>
    <li> These are just perfect! They are small and thin, perfect for putting on nails. And so cute - I love you Cheeky &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> quality decals from Cheeky. this is really nice!</li>
    <li> These are just rite when ya wanta decorate your nails awesome I love cheecky they really did it just rite my whole family has gotten into the nail art I love this so much will always buy from cheeky</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase! Lots of different designs to choose from and even a perfect fit for small nails for the little ones!</li>
    <li> My daughters have a lot of fun doing their nails with these</li>
    <li> I like them they are very nice I will buy more!</li>
