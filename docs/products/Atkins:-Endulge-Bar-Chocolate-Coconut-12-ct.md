      <li>I love these Atkins bars.  </li>

      <li>I love these.  </li>

      <li>This bar is rich and flavorful.  </li>
      <li>I think there is a market for ingredients to make your own low carb bars or a more affordable bar , also a friend of mine bit into a bone or something that llooked like a bone in one of the frozen dinners</li>

      <li>Sweet, chocolate coconut goodness.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend, but watch out, you have a tendency to eat more than one.</li>
      <li>These are great for a mid afternoon snack at work, have only 1 gram of sugar, 170 calories.  </li>
      <li>but they &amp;#34;graciously&amp;#34; were willing to refund the $11.99 for the product.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re on a low carb diet and Jonesing for something yummy, this more than hits the spot.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend if you are craving a candy bar!!</li>
      <li>very good-tastes like Mounds bars!</li>
      <li>I noted that many other UPS shipments of items purchase from Amazon had arrived safely and on time, I was given an &amp;#34;explanation&amp;#34; of their &amp;#34;policies.&amp;#34; As far as I am concerned they may have NEVER even sent the product</li>
      <li>The product was reasonably priced and delivered right away.</li>

<li> This has milk chocolate rather than dark like a Mounds bar, but truly I think it is sweeter than a mounds.</li>
<li> Tastles like a mounds bar and is not ridiculously sweet.  </li>
<li> I get no cramps from the maltilol, a long used, and well vetted, slow metabolizing alcohol used by diabetics to sweeten foods.</li>
<li> I would recommend just passing on these and having some fruit or at least other atkins treats with protein in them.</li>
<li> These bars usually come to a dollar twenty cents</li>
<li> the bars are all small</li>
<li> without destroying my diet goals!!</li>
<li> some are very small and they are overpriced.  </li>
<li> This product is the least artificial snack Atkins makes.</li>

    <li> If you like coconut, you&#x27;ll love this bar. Just the right size to feel like you&#x27;re indulging but not going overboard. Also light on the &#x27;sweet&#x27; content, which I find preferable.</li>
    <li> Closest thing to a real candy bar without all the carbs.  Great taste and sure helps with a sweet tooth.  I highly recommend, but watch out, you have a tendency to eat more than one.</li>
    <li> This Atkin&#x27;s bar is very good. I like almond joy, so I add 3 almonds to the top of the bar. I highly recommend if you are craving a candy bar!!</li>
    <li> This product is the least artificial snack Atkins makes. Definitely does not taste or feel like diet food.</li>
    <li> This bar is rich and flavorful.  It taste every bit as good as the non low carb equivalent.  There is no aftertaste, what a treat!!</li>
    <li> Atkins chocolate coconut bars tast just like an amoundjoy.. helps so much with my evening cho. cravings.. without destroying my diet goals!!</li>
    <li> Tastes good, but..any regular chocolate bar this size will satisfy your sweet tooth cravings as well with lesser amount of calories. And Inulin(fiber)-this what gives you gas...lots of it[[ASIN:B001OI3QM6 Atkins - Endulge Chocolate Coconut, 12 bars]]</li>
    <li> I use to love the Mounds bar by Hershey, but refuse to eat it now as it has 21 grams of sugar per bar.  No, I&#x27;m not Diabetic, just don&#x27;t want to eat all that sugar.  This tastes as good...I think better...than Mounds and has 1 gr of sugar per bar.  It&#x27;s great when the \\&quot;sweet tooth\\&quot; is nudging me.  It&#x27;s also wonderful with lunch to finish filling me so I&#x27;m not looking for something to munch on all afternoon.</li>
    <li> These are fabulous - only they give you gas.  I would guess it is due to the alternate type of sweetner - or the sugar alcohols.</li>
    <li> I love these bars; however, I was sent &amp;#34;Power Crunch&amp;#34; bars - not even Atkins.  There is a label stuck to the box that says Akins Endulge Chocolate Coconut Bars, so they were miss labeled.</li>
    <li> if you love chocolate and coconut theses are great to eat. Sure its not real sugar BUT DAMN CLOSE..MUST BUY THEM</li>
    <li> These are delicious! They taste almost exactly like normal coconut chocolate bars without the sugar issues. I get no cramps from the maltilol, a long used, and well vetted, slow metabolizing alcohol used by diabetics to sweeten foods. If you&#x27;re on a low carb diet and Jonesing for something yummy, this more than hits the spot. It&#x27;s got 9g of fiber even! Amazing!</li>
    <li> These have an artificial taste to them, no protein value and are so sweet they always send me out in search of the real thing. Seriously, I stopped eating them because they would arouse my taste buds and leave me wanting better tasting sweets. I would recommend just passing on these and having some fruit or at least other atkins treats with protein in them.</li>
    <li> I am a coconut lover and these are ok not bad not great , ive tried all the bars they are decent the ones with whole peanuts seem to be the better tasting ones  bottom line the bars are all small some are very small and they are overpriced.  These bars usually come to a dollar twenty cents each  75 cents would be a plenty  I think there is a market for ingredients to make your own low carb bars or a more affordable bar , also a friend of mine bit into a bone or something that llooked like a bone in one of the frozen dinners, I cant even give her one now i have offered her one and she said no way.  That was the first one she had and the last</li>
    <li> Good, delicious, and filling.</li>
    <li> These bars are like dessert.  If you like coconut, you have to try these bars.</li>
    <li> Great. Will reorder. Thank you.</li>
    <li> 5 for taste, but one star taken off for the continuously shrinking size yet price increases.</li>
    <li> I love these Atkins bars.  They remind me of &amp;#34;Mounds&amp;#34; bars.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Excellent for those on Atkins with a sweet tooth!  Arrived fresh, and taste very good, a good substitute for the high calorie easter eggs out this time of year!</li>
    <li> I love these.  Give me a sweet fix without ruining my diet.</li>
    <li> I love coconut, and these bars are very good, have real coconut in the filling.  These are great for a mid afternoon snack at work, have only 1 gram of sugar, 170 calories.  Definately much better than grabbing chips and soda!</li>
    <li> Tastles like a mounds bar and is not ridiculously sweet.  Wish they still sold it.</li>
    <li> Best substitute to bounty :) no guilt</li>
    <li> Coconut never tasted so good. This has milk chocolate rather than dark like a Mounds bar, but truly I think it is sweeter than a mounds. Only 2 net carbs removes all guilt from eating this bar, especially if you are carb watching. You can find these in the pharmacy section at any Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger pharmacy and avoid the shipping charges. that is what I recommend.</li>
    <li> Not exactly a Mounds bar, but a super substitute for those of us who have to watch our carbs. Since I can&#x27;t find them in a grocery store in my area any longer, I&#x27;m glad I can get them via Amazon -- and usually in better condition than I found them when the grocery store did have them.</li>
    <li> I started the Program just before my lovely Cadbury chocolate bars arrived so was thankful to get these which taste just like a candy bar.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product while abroad (among about 10 other orders while I was away - all of which arrived without a hitch) but this one from the Vitamin Shoppe never arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home, I found that I was charged $100 (!) for the shipping but they &amp;#34;graciously&amp;#34; were willing to refund the $11.99 for the product. Well thank you, really!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I noted that many other UPS shipments of items purchase from Amazon had arrived safely and on time, I was given an &amp;#34;explanation&amp;#34; of their &amp;#34;policies.&amp;#34; As far as I am concerned they may have NEVER even sent the product - I have no way of knowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE of the Vitamin Shoppe - more concerned with $ than customer satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shameful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rozzy</li>
    <li> very good-tastes like Mounds bars! Low carb and excellent treat on Paleo or Ketogenic food plan.</li>
    <li> If you like Mounds  then you&#x27;ll like these too. Sweet, chocolate coconut goodness. I like to freeze them but they&#x27;re quite nice at room temp too. I&#x27;ve tried other bars from other companies and they&#x27;re not even close.</li>
    <li> Way too good.  Taste just like a Mounds Candy Bar but without the guilt</li>
    <li> If you miss mounds or almond joy candy, you&#x27;ll live these!!</li>
    <li> I love these things.  Not too sweet but good chocolate taste and lots of coconut.  Not quite a Mounds but close.</li>
    <li> The product was reasonably priced and delivered right away.</li>
