      <li>But I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t see anything that impressed me.</li>
      <li>Its a happy medium.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work that great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this  </li>
      <li>Its very effective.</li>
      <li>This company needs to do more advertising to get this AWESOME product out there.  </li>
      <li>Omg this thing works so good on my edges,  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this for my hair!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read all of the reviews for this product before deciding to give it a try on my own.</li>
      <li>It was honestly okayyy...</li>
      <li>but it seemed to work kind of.</li>
      <li>Burnt my hair in 2 seconds.....not worth the time or money!!!</li>
      <li>I have to go through a couple of times and then tie my hair up to make sure it holds like I would like it too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be satisfied with the outcome.</li>
      <li>You probably already know this but be sure to use a heat protection product in the hair and an oil like Chi with a bit of avocado oil helps</li>
      <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
      <li>Would recommend if you know for sure what this item does.</li>
      <li>It works okay.</li>
      <li>A ceramic iron that you may already have works better.</li>
      <li>Red by kiss Ceramic Root Straightener, is the best product that I could have bought.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Very Nice, Great Price, and fast shipping Thanks</li>
      <li>It heats up real fast and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Depending how curly the hair, you may have to go over it more than once to get your hair smooth and straight.  </li>
      <li>It gets right to the problem areas much better than a flat iron which works great on the rest of my hair, and doesn&#x27;t have the risk of burning like the hot comb does.</li>
      <li>love it gets edges straight..</li>
      <li>but i thought it would get closer to the root and straighten the hair out more, but I do highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as good as a flat iron</li>
      <li>Does not get very hot to straighten edges</li>
      <li>it is definitely worth buying</li>
      <li>like i got a fresh relaxer.</li>
      <li>I decided  that I wanted to transition from relaxers aka creamy crack to just working with my natural healthy hair.</li>
      <li>Its great for weaves, if your edges are short and natural doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
      <li>so my hair is fair and kinks at the ends all it did was made it a little softer even with the pressing oil.</li>
      <li>My teen son has very curly kind of frizzy short hair (longer on top) and with this root straightener his hair comes out straight and shiny.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pretty close</li>
      <li>Since you&#x27;re working with thicker hair and the bristles aren&#x27;t particularly hot themselves</li>
      <li>it gets really hot.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really get your roots that straight in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I received the items fast,it heated up fast</li>
      <li>It really didn&#x27;t straighten my roots</li>
      <li>Flat iron works better to tame edges, but it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>just add a little hair pressing product (hair grease, hair oil) and slowly work your way from your roots to your ends for the best results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m natural and have been for 4years now.</li>
      <li>I went natural almost two years ago</li>
      <li>It really get the areas that the flat iron miss, and it does it without burning you.</li>
      <li>This product, in my opinion, does not get hot enough to manage the roots of naturally coarse hair.</li>
      <li>It gets down to the roots and just presses your hair to pure perfection</li>
      <li>Not sure if I was using this item right</li>

<li> If you keep it flat against the head you don&#x27;t have to worry about that.  </li>
<li> You use it flat against the head and you can turn it to the side and comb through but watch the barrel doesn&#x27;t hit the ears when it&#x27;s turned on the side.  </li>
<li> This product puts a stop to all of that, it lays down my edges and roots like NO OTHER!</li>
<li> and i use it to tame my new growth in between my relaxers.</li>
<li> Also, don&#x27;t keep in one spot too long</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t see myself using it other than for touch ups because it would be a royal pain to use the blow dryer, flat iron and this thing each time</li>
<li> I usually have it on the highest setting as far as heat goes.</li>
<li> My natural hair is thick and loose spirals.</li>
<li> only issue I have is that the little comb bristles can take hair out.</li>
<li> I expected straighter hair with no results.</li>
<li> didn&#x27;t work on my roots as expected</li>
<li> I use this to straighten my hair after I mistakenly get it wet during a bath and to re-straighten the nape of my neck after showers.</li>
<li> Its not the end of the world, not much hair is lost</li>
<li> I was one of those children burned with hot combs because I have thick, thick roots that just needed to be pressed out to accomplish any style.</li>
<li> all that i have to say is the product is saving my teen&#x27;s hair and scalp.and her decreased usage of a straightner.</li>
<li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> Not sure I would recommend.</li>
<li> The results were not positively notable.</li>
<li> I have very thick, curly roots that not even the smallest straightener can lay down .</li>
<li> Very disappointing as I wanted to like it for our natural roots.</li>

    <li> I straighten my hair once and used this to do my edges; it does the job and I didn&#x27;t get burned.</li>
    <li> Its great for weaves, if your edges are short and natural doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
    <li> Flat iron works better to tame edges, but it&#x27;s ok.  Not sure I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money! Did not straigthen my roots or my daugthers roots. Recieved it and processed return within 30 minutes. Very disappointing as I wanted to like it for our natural roots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read all of the reviews for this product before deciding to give it a try on my own. I&#x27;m natural and have been for 4years now. I have very thick, curly roots that not even the smallest straightener can lay down . This product puts a stop to all of that, it lays down my edges and roots like NO OTHER! I love it! Yes Kiss!</li>

    <li> love it gets edges straight..</li>
    <li> I love this for my hair! Im relaxed and i use it to tame my new growth in between my relaxers. I go 6 months without a relaxer at a time and this keeps my hair looking like i got a fresh relaxer. It heats up real fast and is easy to use. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months now</li>
    <li> It was honestly okayyy... But I wasn&#x27;t impressed. A ceramic iron that you may already have works better. No need to purchase this product😞.</li>
    <li> Red by kiss Ceramic Root Straightener, is the best product that I could have bought.  I love it.  It really get the areas that the flat iron miss, and it does it without burning you. Love it, love it, love it.</li>

    <li> It works okay. It doesn&#x27;t really get your roots that straight in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t perform as advertised.  It really didn&#x27;t straighten my roots</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that great.</li>
    <li> Burnt my hair in 2 seconds.....not worth the time or money!!!</li>
    <li> This product, in my opinion, does not get hot enough to manage the roots of naturally coarse hair. I would not recommend. The results were not positively notable.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I was using this item right but it seemed to work kind of. Came on time with no problem. Would recommend if you know for sure what this item does.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair. My natural hair is thick and loose spirals. I use this to straighten my hair after I mistakenly get it wet during a bath and to re-straighten the nape of my neck after showers. Its very effective. I usually have it on the highest setting as far as heat goes. It gets right to the problem areas much better than a flat iron which works great on the rest of my hair, and doesn&#x27;t have the risk of burning like the hot comb does. Its a happy medium. I don&#x27;t see myself using it other than for touch ups because it would be a royal pain to use the blow dryer, flat iron and this thing each time I do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is that the little comb bristles can take hair out. Since you&#x27;re working with thicker hair and the bristles aren&#x27;t particularly hot themselves, I don&#x27;t see any way to get around this. Its not the end of the world, not much hair is lost</li>
    <li> I seen one review on YouTube about this root straightener and was sold. I was one of those children burned with hot combs because I have thick, thick roots that just needed to be pressed out to accomplish any style. I decided  that I wanted to transition from relaxers aka creamy crack to just working with my natural healthy hair. This root straightener is like heaven. It gets down to the roots and just presses your hair to pure perfection just add a little hair pressing product (hair grease, hair oil) and slowly work your way from your roots to your ends for the best results. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be satisfied with the outcome. I&#x27;ve been waiting for this item my entire life!!!</li>
    <li> I received the items fast,it heated up fast but I didn&#x27;t see anything that impressed me. I went natural almost two years ago so my hair is fair and kinks at the ends all it did was made it a little softer even with the pressing oil. I expected straighter hair with no results.</li>
    <li> This company needs to do more advertising to get this AWESOME product out there.  My wife had been looking for such a product and when she searched she found this and purchased it immediately.  My teen son has very curly kind of frizzy short hair (longer on top) and with this root straightener his hair comes out straight and shiny.  You use it flat against the head and you can turn it to the side and comb through but watch the barrel doesn&#x27;t hit the ears when it&#x27;s turned on the side.  If you keep it flat against the head you don&#x27;t have to worry about that.  Also, don&#x27;t keep in one spot too long it gets really hot.  Depending how curly the hair, you may have to go over it more than once to get your hair smooth and straight.  It&#x27;s not as good as a flat iron but it&#x27;s pretty close and we haven&#x27;t found any tool that works so well on short hair.  Does wonders on the edge hairs when combed through turned on its side.  You probably already know this but be sure to use a heat protection product in the hair and an oil like Chi with a bit of avocado oil helps too.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> It does what it said it would do but i thought it would get closer to the root and straighten the hair out more, but I do highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t straighten my edges as I thought it would. I have to go through a couple of times and then tie my hair up to make sure it holds like I would like it too.</li>
