      <li>I find they&#x27;re two &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; to hold much hair, and if I do get them in right they aren&#x27;t comfortable!</li>
      <li>and they will no longer be useful.</li>
      <li>I wish these were just a bit bigger, but they stay in my shoulder length hair and are very light.</li>
      <li>These combs are good quality but not wide enough for my use.  </li>

      <li>These look like a better grade of plastic than the combs from local retailers.</li>

<li> These combs are about 2&amp;#34; wide and hold my hair very well.</li>
<li> Side combs for fine hair are difficult to find at a reasonable price.  </li>
<li> They&#x27;re not perfect (they&#x27;re a bit too narrow), but they&#x27;re reasonably sturdy, do NOT have razor sharp teeth that slice your scalp, and they really stay put, which is rare.  </li>
<li> However here it is two weeks later and three of the four combs I purchased are missing teeth, with one comb missing a large number of them.</li>
<li> Then in desperation I ordered these, because it goes against the grain to spend $12 per comb, and I figured if these were rejects too, at least I wouldn&#x27;t lose much money.  </li>
<li> This was a long shot.  </li>
<li> My hair is long and is worn up for work; the combs keep the stray curls in control.</li>
<li> These combs are 2 3/8 inches long.</li>
<li> I like using side combs for my long hair and these work well.  </li>
<li> They are sturdy and stay in place all day long.</li>
<li> If you have thick hair it won&#x27;t hold much.</li>
<li> These might be worth how uncomfortable they are if they actually worked.  </li>
<li> These hair combs are the right size, not too big or small, and hold well, but my hair has some body to it, so I can&#x27;t speak for how they would hold in hair that is either thin or lacks body.</li>
<li> These are just a little smaller than the type to which I am accustomed.</li>
<li> These don&#x27;t compare well and the color was not really turquoise.</li>
<li> These were exactly as I expected and do the job well.</li>
<li> My local salon quit importing the nice side combs they used to sell, so I finally ordered a pair online that turned out to be terrible quality and color.  </li>
<li> but they&#x27;re slightly too small for keeping all my hair back.</li>
<li> If you have gobs of thick hair, this could come up short for you.</li>
<li> they make my hair feel tight!</li>
<li> They are too small for me.</li>
<li> These are small.</li>
<li> Even after reading the dimensions (which I believe were listed in cm.), they were smaller than I expected - so was disappointed when they turned out to be the size of a pair I already had.</li>
<li> So hard to find matching combs in stores these days.</li>
<li> These are hard to find on the ground</li>
<li> Not good.</li>
<li> Poorly made.  </li>
<li> poor quality...broke almost immediately</li>
<li> Useless.  </li>
<li> I  was disappointed to find out there are the small combs.</li>
<li> Ordered wrong size.  </li>
<li> I mean, awful.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought I was just buying regular combs. I wear my hair in a bun a lot and these really help keep the shorter fly aways in place. These combs are better quality than I have bought in the past. Boy to they make my hair feel tight!</li>
    <li> These hair combs are much better quality than the ones available in cvs. I highly recommend them. They&#x27;re made of nice sturdy plastic.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I find they&#x27;re two &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; to hold much hair, and if I do get them in right they aren&#x27;t comfortable!</li>
    <li> These are small. If you have thick hair it won&#x27;t hold much.</li>
    <li> Poorly made.  Can not get them in my hair!</li>
    <li> The teeth of these combs are wider than I thought. They don&#x27;t slip into the hair or stay as well as the Goody&#x27;s combs. Would not buy them again.</li>
    <li> These are the only combs that will stay in my fine hair. They look nice, too.</li>
    <li> Even after reading the dimensions (which I believe were listed in cm.), they were smaller than I expected - so was disappointed when they turned out to be the size of a pair I already had.</li>
    <li> These were exactly as I expected and do the job well. I have fine hair so I need combs with teeth that are closer together.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful combs, they stay in your hair very well.  They are a great size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I found them!</li>
    <li> Not good. Can&#x27;t get the hair combs in my hair to stay. Waisted my money on this one!</li>
    <li> I like the look of these combs, but they will not stay in place in my hair, which is fairly coarse.</li>
    <li> Perfect size but only by luck.  Please post size of combs.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t work in  my hair.</li>
    <li> These are very nice combs for my thick, shoulder length hair. They are sturdy and stay in place all day long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying some new hairstyles that require combs so I ordered these. I was pleased when they arrived and immediately put them to use and received compliments. However here it is two weeks later and three of the four combs I purchased are missing teeth, with one comb missing a large number of them. A few more days and they will no longer be useful.</li>
    <li> perfect size. feel very comfortable. much better than any other side combs i&#x27;ve purchased. i bought many brands only this one makes me feel comfortable.</li>
    <li> So hard to find matching combs in stores these days. I was so glad to find them here. I use them several times a week. The price was good and they are the perfect size.</li>
    <li> These hair combs are the right size, not too big or small, and hold well, but my hair has some body to it, so I can&#x27;t speak for how they would hold in hair that is either thin or lacks body.</li>
    <li> Was looking for something comparable to the old Goody combs that used to be so available.  These don&#x27;t compare well and the color was not really turquoise.</li>
    <li> Much better than Goody-what happened to them? Anyway. These are not the cheapo plastic they are the real deal, and excellent $.</li>
    <li> I have a few old combs from the 70s and was looking to pick up more because I constantly misplace them. These combs are just what I have been looking for to hold back my hair on the sides. I couldn&#x27;t find any tortoise shell in retail stores. I did not want to buy a package that contained white and tan combs that I would never use. These look like a better grade of plastic than the combs from local retailers. They are not real large but the right size to do the job for me. If you have gobs of thick hair, this could come up short for you. But if you have regular or thinnish hair, perfect.</li>
    <li> poor quality...broke almost immediately</li>
    <li> These are the best combs for the price that I have found. They function perfectly and they are elegant and understated.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon Medium Side Combs, Tortoise, 2 Count. They may not be just for me. They did not work on my hair.</li>
    <li> I wear combs in my hair often. My source for them locally is no longer available. I was hoping these would be the same. This plastic is more rigid than what I prefer, but they are still quite functional. It would have been nice if the size of the combs were included in the description. These are just a little smaller than the type to which I am accustomed. These combs are 2 3/8 inches long.</li>
    <li> These might be worth how uncomfortable they are if they actually worked.  I used to buy the Goody combs but Amazon didn&#x27;t have them on Prime or at all, can&#x27;t remember.  I don&#x27;t even want to donate these to Goodwill because I wouldn&#x27;t wish these on a stranger.</li>
    <li> I like using side combs for my long hair and these work well.  Now if they could just come up with some with dog repellant on it so my dog doesn&#x27;t use as a chew toy!</li>
    <li> They are too small for me.</li>
    <li> These do not hold my hair back.  I have very fine silver hair and these do nothing, nor do they stay put.</li>
    <li> These are not fancy but they work very well as they don&#x27;t fall out or scratch my scalp. I like them alot and plan to get another set to make sure I have a spare set.</li>
    <li> I gave these as a gift and as far as I know they have had no issues with them. They arrived in good shape and they were exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> The combs are well made and the perfect size for my hair needs.  The plastic is smooth so my hair does not snag and therefore does not break.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> Nice combs,sturdy but very hard to get into my hair. I would not buy again. Feels like I&#x27;m tearing my hair out when I try to use them.</li>
    <li> Side combs for fine hair are difficult to find at a reasonable price.  My hair is long and is worn up for work; the combs keep the stray curls in control. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I  was disappointed to find out there are the small combs. I have ordered the larger combs on here , before, and thought they were the same ones. My fault , I guess. If they don&#x27;t have the large combs, will not order them again. These just aren&#x27;t good enuf to hold a large amount of hair.</li>
    <li> This was a long shot.  My local salon quit importing the nice side combs they used to sell, so I finally ordered a pair online that turned out to be terrible quality and color.  I mean, awful.  Then in desperation I ordered these, because it goes against the grain to spend $12 per comb, and I figured if these were rejects too, at least I wouldn&#x27;t lose much money.  They&#x27;re not perfect (they&#x27;re a bit too narrow), but they&#x27;re reasonably sturdy, do NOT have razor sharp teeth that slice your scalp, and they really stay put, which is rare.  Now if I can only find a wider pair....  (Nice color, too, by the way.)</li>
    <li> Just what my mom was looking for.</li>
    <li> Not only have these combs become more cheaply made over last few years, but now these &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; combs have shrunk to SMALL !  Useless.  Will return.</li>
    <li> These combs are about 2&amp;#34; wide and hold my hair very well. These are hard to find on the ground so I was glad to find them here for cheap!</li>
    <li> Combs have nicely rounded tips.  The teeth don&#x27;t dig into my scalp. I have very fine hair these combs hold it in place.</li>
    <li> I should buy these by the case because I keep losing&lt;br /&gt;them.....</li>
    <li> I have very think hair and was worried these would not apply to me. To my surprise they hold my hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these combs when you want to pull your hair back.</li>
    <li> Asa daily wearer I&#x27;d side combs, I have purchased many types over the years, and these do the job ate well...they are smooth, not snagging delicate scalps, and they hold my hair very well, even though it is quite thin and fine. Highly recommend these combs for anyone looking for an effective pair of combs.</li>
    <li> Love these but they&#x27;re slightly too small for keeping all my hair back.</li>
    <li> These combs are good quality but not wide enough for my use.  I have a lot of hair and it may depend on the shape of your head.</li>
    <li> Excellent combs.  Hold hair securely and are sturdy. I have fine hair and they grip it well.</li>
    <li> I wish these were just a bit bigger, but they stay in my shoulder length hair and are very light.</li>
    <li> This is good but I like the earlier one a bit better as it had more of a tortoise design.</li>
    <li> Ordered wrong size.  Wanted mini size</li>
