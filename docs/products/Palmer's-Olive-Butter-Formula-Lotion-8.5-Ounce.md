    <li> This lotion is fab. Your skin will glow. You do not have to use to much. Palmers is great at making your skin beautiful. Awesome price you can get ready  for summer.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever!  I have been using Palmer&#x27;s Olive Butter for quite a while and my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> I have pale, dry skin and a deep hatred for most lotions until I finally came across this one.  It&#x27;s pretty tough to find.  Once I realized how much I loved it, I couldn&#x27;t recall where I bought it and spent a ton of time running from store to store to buy more.  In fact, only one place in Canada close to me even sells it and it&#x27;s called The Real Canadian Superstore.  And it&#x27;s priced Very Reasonably.    The smell is devine.  The feel is even better.  It&#x27;s Not a thick greasy formula yet it leaves my skin feeling completely quenched, REFRESHED and REHYDRATED for HOURS.  I use it from head to toe and can&#x27;t stop smelling and touching my skin I love it so much.  I&#x27;m stocking up in case they ever stop selling it and suggest you do the same.      I live in an area where the tempreature can range from -50 degrees celcius to +40 degrees celcius and this is the only lotion that keeps my skin happy through every season.  Plus, these ingredients are known to decrease wrinkles!     ALL IN ALL A GREAT PRICE, VERY EFFECTIVE AND BEST SMELLING LOTION I HAVE EVER USED.  NO MORE NEED TO SHOP AROUND, THIS IS IT!!!!  HIGH RECOMMEND!!!  I spent a lot of money on a variety of other products and have never found one I like this much.  Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> Great lotion.Moisturizers very  good with out leaving an oily residue. I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect lotion for my skin</li>
    <li> Ive looked for this everywhere</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have very dry, rough skin and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works for me. The concentrated creme is also great, but I like this body lotion for everyday use.</li>
    <li> my wife is happy.thats always a five star.lol</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Palmers Olive Butter Lotion and I was delighted to find it on Amazon since I had no luck finding it at my local stores (other Palmers, yes, but no Olive Butter - I bought my first bottle in Florida).  The lotion is thick but not greasy and absorbs quickly.  It keeps my skin soft and moisturized, especially the elbows, and has a very pleasant, mild, fragrance.  Being fragrance sensitive, I assure you that one only really smells it while applying the lotion, and then it disappears.  Great lotion and reasonable, too, considering how well it works!</li>
    <li> Love it. Absorbs quickly. nice smell. first bottle lasted a couple years since I only use on my face.  ive looked for it in stores knowing I would be needing again and have not seen it anywhere since I bought first bottle. of course found it on amazon. will probably be more generous with it all over now that I can order</li>
    <li> This works really well. The scent is very pleasant. All scents wear on me after a time but this is not terrible. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I lost a bunch of weight and Think it made a difference with my sagging facial skin from weight loss.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. MY WIFE AND HER COUSIN LOVES THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> The best lotion I have used in years.  My biggest regret is that it is not readily available on store shelves.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes nicely. Scent OK but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> My daughter lukes to miustuize her legs after shaving. She likes varioys products that add moisture but they dont sting or burn. She likes several if the products from Palmers. Myself, I am checking what else Palmers has available.  Quality is A+</li>
    <li> Best ever! Not greasy, softened skin, smells great but mild ... Highly recommend! Takes care dry and ashy skin! great for using in  the health care setting.</li>
    <li> It arrived at time.love palmers</li>
    <li> This product was recommend by a pharmacist for dry itchy skin.  After using this for a day it stop my itching and left my skin smooth.  I would recommend this product for all skin types.  Bonus is the great smell of the lotion!!</li>
    <li> I love this products.  it is also hard to find in my stores.  i can find the cocoa butter stuff but not the olive butter..  I love this product and it does such a good job.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of all the Palmer lotions but it is very difficult to find the olive oil variety. I also would prefer it in a pump. It is my very favorite lotion and I have used many.</li>
