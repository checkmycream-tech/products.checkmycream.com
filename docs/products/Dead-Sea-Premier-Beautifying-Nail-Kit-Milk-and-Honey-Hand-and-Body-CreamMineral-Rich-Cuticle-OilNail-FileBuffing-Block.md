      <li>It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
      <li>Love and prosperity to all!  </li>
      <li>Now I know better!</li>
      <li>The lotion, nail buff and file were a nice bonus.</li>
      <li>and I liked it</li>
      <li>The lotion smells really nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, but not particulary pleasant.</li>
      <li>know they are very easy to negotiate with.</li>
      <li>A great accompany with the salt scrub ( which is done first to get the benefits if the kit ).</li>
      <li>Well, after completely buffing my own nails, looking beautiful for about 2 weeks, I began to buff again.  </li>
      <li>Helps to keep cuticles and hands soft; buffer shapes and shines nails for a nice finish; hands will look beautiful without polish.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I love the cuticle oil.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise I love it.</li>
      <li>My nails have never looked better  </li>
      <li>Got the &amp;#34;hard sell&amp;#34; from the saleswoman, and paid a lot more than it&#x27;s being offered for on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I love this kit.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I negotiated.</li>
      <li>The lotion is okay, if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Please get more</li>
      <li>i love your products.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear nail polish and love how this shines up my nails.</li>
      <li>When my nails go naked the buffer gives the perfect touch.  </li>
      <li>I have been usung for a couple of months now, and I love the shine.</li>
      <li>I have used ths product for more than 4 years.  </li>
      <li>So I took out my kit and decided to give it one more try...</li>
      <li>You would think that any mall would vet the products coming into them to make sure that customers were not getting ripped off -</li>
      <li>On the shine side, I found that I have to run the block from the bed of the nail to the tip to get the best shine, one way only.  </li>
      <li>My nails were even more brittle.</li>
      <li>Very pleased, thanks!</li>
      <li>Turns out it was not such a good purchase for me!  </li>
      <li>Go easy on it.  </li>
      <li>My nails look beautiful and my cuticles seem to have instantly vanished and the lotion makes my hands feel like silk.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone seeking quick, easy, sustainable and healthy nail care.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m a huge fan of</li>
      <li>This set is DEFINITELY worth the $$ I paid &amp; I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>I like the way this helps strengthen and smooth nails.</li>
      <li>Mom has psoriasis and I have found Primier products to be fantastic for her skin and nail problems</li>
      <li>(I also do this with nail polish chips and dents, smooth the dent, then buff!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They do hire some REALLY good salespeople apparently!</li>
      <li>Originally the price was $40, so the $15 price tag was quite a savings.  </li>
      <li>so well I got another through Amazon for a much more reasonable price.</li>
      <li>The nail bed I noticed was becoming thinner with the buffing/filing, and they were NOT shiny like the first time.  </li>
      <li>Not bad,</li>
      <li>I saw at Mall for $75.00, I ordered on line for less than $20, great deal.</li>
      <li>but I agree with some of the critics, the shininess is never quite as good as the first time you use the white side.</li>
      <li>price is fantastic – all in all, this Premier nail kit comes highly recommended!</li>
      <li>, i bought it from the Premier Dead Sea kiosk at the mall after i checked it twice with the great presentation they show u, and the girl convinced me that i&#x27;d lose nothing bcz</li>
      <li>I have spent money having my nails done monthly, and I thought if I could make them look this good at home (for the price of $50 which was at the kiosk) then I would have saved in the 2 years</li>
      <li>It is a neat kit and worth the $14 I paid on amazon (price fluctuates between 13 and 20</li>
      <li>This product is worth its cost.  </li>
      <li>Worth it.</li>
      <li>The lotion is so creamy and smells so fresh.  </li>
      <li>Used the kit last night, and was blown away by how beautiful it left my nails!  </li>
      <li>Beware of the malls that try to sell this at $50 plus, it&#x27;s no where near worth that much!!!</li>
      <li>Opened the hand lotion for the first time since purchasing and was immediately struck by how soft it left my hands, but more so by its wonderful yet subtle aroma.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
      <li>So thanks, Amazon!</li>
      <li>i will come back for more when mine runs out.</li>
      <li>I first bought the Dead Sea products at the mall, and loved them.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and surpasses many of the products sold in stores, some even at more expensive prices than this.  </li>
      <li>I got this same kit a while back at a kiosk at the mall, for twice the price, and just loved the hand lotion.</li>
      <li>So happy I didn&#x27;t get sucker in at the mall!</li>
      <li>checked on every bit of the box it had no customer service number or address or anything to ask if the warranty was even real.</li>
      <li>So, I think the delivery was very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>comes out too fast.</li>
      <li>This product works very well</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>There is no such thing in the original magazine cover.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t try the big tube of body lotion yet but the small one is great</li>
      <li>Totally worth the really low price - would have paid that price just for the nail blog.;)</li>
      <li>I found the Nail Kit to be a high quality.</li>
      <li>high gloss shine rivals anything a nail salon can do, yet without all of the chemicals and solvents they use, and without the price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>If you buy this kit for the $17 as currently advertised by Amazon, the buffer, cuticle gel, hand cream &amp; file are probably worth it.  </li>
      <li>, I saw in their homepage showing several woman&#x27;s beauty magazine covers, which all featuring one set of their products, first I thought the products are on the covers because these magazines recommend it to customers, but I doubt that, so I google the magazine to see whether these products are really on the covers----the truth</li>
      <li>filing and shining my nails, I was amazed by how much they shined with a wet, glossy appearance–remembering that is what sold me in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I found the Nail Kit to be a high quality. The kit contains everything for skin and nails care. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Everyone is giving such low ratings because they got ripped off at the mall. I bought this here for less than $20 when they offer the same product for somewhere around $40-$50 at the mall kiosk. My nails look beautiful and my cuticles seem to have instantly vanished and the lotion makes my hands feel like silk. DO NOT buy at the mall. Let them test it out on you so you know what it looks as feels like and then buy it here for WAY less! So happy I didn&#x27;t get sucker in at the mall! And I&#x27;m looking forward to rubbing it in their face that I know they are rip off artists!</li>
    <li> This is one of THE BEST lotions that I have ever used. I&#x27;ve used dozens over the years.  This one beats almost all of them. Shea Butter is close but not like this.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks and feels healthier after one use.  The wrinkles lessen and my skin feels nourished.  My young teen agrees with me that this lotion is different. It really seems healthier than the average lotion.  There really is something to that Dead Sea, obviously!!!!!This is a MUST HAVE for me!  Thank you to DSC and Amazon.com!  Love and prosperity to all!  :)  p.s.  All the scents are wonderful.</li>
    <li> I was in the mall one day and was approached by a kiosk vendor of Premier Dead Sea Products.  He proceeded to buff one nail with the blue, grey and then white side of the buffer.  My nail look fabulous!!! I have spent money having my nails done monthly, and I thought if I could make them look this good at home (for the price of $50 which was at the kiosk) then I would have saved in the 2 years this vendor told me the kit would last.  Well, after completely buffing my own nails, looking beautiful for about 2 weeks, I began to buff again.  The nail bed I noticed was becoming thinner with the buffing/filing, and they were NOT shiny like the first time.  This shininess NEVER happened again.  If you buy this kit for the $17 as currently advertised by Amazon, the buffer, cuticle gel, hand cream &amp; file are probably worth it.  As for the $50 I spent - NO WAY!</li>
    <li> I have been usung for a couple of months now, and I love the shine. I get way less breakage of my nails. I would have given it 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t like the sent of the lotion and the cuticle oil comes out too fast. Otherwise I love it.</li>
    <li> Product and delivery were great. Recommend everyone buy one of these for their hands as the cream works great for softening hands and the buffer polishes the nails to a salon finish.</li>
    <li> The cuticle oil is very nice.  I got this for the oil alone, and the price was good.  The lotion, nail buff and file were a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the current two reviews before I bought this kit.  My situation was slightly different and more expensive.  I have only used it once and liked the result, however, if the product lasts as little as said on the other reviews I wish I hadn&#x27;t.  One other thing:  this product was selling for $90 in the mall I went to! I told the girl I wasn&#x27;t going to pay $90 when I wasn&#x27;t going to use the lotion (it is perfumed, which is a no-no for me) so she sold it to me for $45 which I thought was ok if it worked as promised and the seller doesn&#x27;t disappear! Now I know better!</li>
    <li> never spend what they ask for up front in the middle of the mall. I&#x27;m glad I negotiated. I do like the set somewhat but I agree with some of the critics, the shininess is never quite as good as the first time you use the white side. Luckily enough, though they tried to charge me 60 I refused and after attempting to walk away several times I then agreed at half price $30 AND got them to throw in extra buffing sides including the infamous white &amp;#34;silk&amp;#34; side. Worth it. The saleswoman said the white side is made of silk so it does have me wondering if I buy a bit of silk fabric if I could just shine them with that myself? LOL Who knows! If you buy it, pay less $30 or less! They do hire some REALLY good salespeople apparently!</li>
    <li> same thing as the previous comment happened to me, i bought it from the Premier Dead Sea kiosk at the mall after i checked it twice with the great presentation they show u, and the girl convinced me that i&#x27;d lose nothing bcz it has lifetime warranty with it!! and when i asked if they come and go to different places she said noooo we r always here! the second time i used it didn&#x27;t shine like the first and the white part of the buffer felt rough so i went to the mall to get the refill but they were GONE!!!&lt;br /&gt;i checked on every bit of the box it had no customer service number or address or anything to ask if the warranty was even real. i asked abt them and knew to which mall they moved, i went to that far away mall yesterday (after abt a month) and i looked for them and AGAIN they weren&#x27;t there anymore!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i guess knowing that they rent the kiosk for a month or so, they promise that they ll keep maintaining ur buffer for ur whole life and that s their trick, it has no warranty and it doesn&#x27;t last, if you see them in the mall get ur nails done there and don&#x27;t pay the $50 bcz that&#x27;s all what you get any way.</li>
    <li> I got this same kit a while back at a kiosk at the mall, for twice the price, and just loved the hand lotion. This is a different fragrance, but the lotion still works just as well.  I wish I could get the lotion by itself.</li>
    <li> The bad: I bought this nail beautifying kit a number of years ago at a mall kiosk.  Got the &amp;#34;hard sell&amp;#34; from the saleswoman, and paid a lot more than it&#x27;s being offered for on Amazon.  Used the kit a few times, and then out of sheer laziness, there it sat in the back of the closet until yesterday when I decided to go through things and keep or discard.  So I took out my kit and decided to give it one more try...&lt;br /&gt;The Good: Used the kit last night, and was blown away by how beautiful it left my nails!  Opened the hand lotion for the first time since purchasing and was immediately struck by how soft it left my hands, but more so by its wonderful yet subtle aroma.&lt;br /&gt;After filing and shining my nails, I was amazed by how much they shined with a wet, glossy appearance–remembering that is what sold me in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;This high gloss shine rivals anything a nail salon can do, yet without all of the chemicals and solvents they use, and without the price.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price is fantastic – all in all, this Premier nail kit comes highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It is a neat kit and worth the $14 I paid on amazon (price fluctuates between 13 and 20 so watch), most of it can be had for less (thus the 4 star) but overall at 14 I don&#x27;t think it was a terrible price. Beware of the malls that try to sell this at $50 plus, it&#x27;s no where near worth that much!!!</li>
    <li> Trick 1:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this kit from Nordstrom,  it is 39 dollars in the store, the seller told me if I buy it online, it will be 39 dollars only for one of the product called Buffing Block in the kit. Now I found it is not true! The price on Amazon for the whole kit is much less than what this seller said, not to mension only one of the product in this kit. And the worst is that there is no refund for buying this in the Nordstrom store.&lt;br /&gt;Trick 2:&lt;br /&gt;I also check their official website, I saw in their homepage showing several woman&#x27;s beauty magazine covers, which all featuring one set of their products, first I thought the products are on the covers because these magazines recommend it to customers, but I doubt that, so I google the magazine to see whether these products are really on the covers----the truth is they are not there! There is no such thing in the original magazine cover. The website uses these \\&quot;revised magazine cover\\&quot; to show there products. This is an absolutely ugly trick to me. I hate being treated by tricks by the seller and the company like this, there is no trust built between the customer and the producer, I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> i got this for a gift from family couple years ago. could never find it till now. i love your products. if u take are of the set it last longer i seen so meany comments about how it don&#x27;t last. well take care of it it will last. thank u i will come back for more when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> I buy these for my wife and she loves it.  They shine her nails up and cost half the price you would pay in the malls.</li>
    <li> I love this kit.  My nails have never looked better  Less breakage  cuticles look good all the time  great price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product since it&#x27;s simply great. I didn&#x27;t try the big tube of body lotion yet but the small one is great and I&#x27;m a huge fan of the nail stone - treated my nails with it 4 weeks ago and the nails still shine bright! Awesome! Totally worth the really low price - would have paid that price just for the nail blog.;)</li>
    <li> Amazing how well this works!  I saw at Mall for $75.00, I ordered on line for less than $20, great deal.</li>
    <li> The buffer part of this kit I&#x27;d the best thing ever! You simply use each side of it in order on your nails and they come out so smooth and extremely shiny! It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
    <li> This product works very well, I got it for all three of my daughters. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have looked for years for both oil and cream that would put life in very dry cuticles... this does.  When my nails go naked the buffer gives the perfect touch.  This is also the best buy  have found.</li>
    <li> I saw it at the mall for $59. Came home and ordered it from Amazon for $19.  Works great...my nails are shinier than ever.  The mall price did include 3 years of replacement product, but I probably would never go get them!</li>
    <li> This product is worth its cost.  It&#x27;s easy to use and surpasses many of the products sold in stores, some even at more expensive prices than this.  I would recommend this product to anyone seeking quick, easy, sustainable and healthy nail care.</li>
    <li> very good product.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> I received the package today (on May 2).&lt;br /&gt;The estimate delivery was May 1 - Jun 1. So, I think the delivery was very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 kits. One kit is perfect. The other arrived with the \\&quot;hand and body cream\\&quot; opened, unfortunally.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the products looks great and I&#x27;m anxious to use that.&lt;br /&gt;Here in Brazil this product is very expensive. So thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> My parents got this kit for me two Christmas&#x60; ago and I liked it so well I got another through Amazon for a much more reasonable price. I don&#x27;t wear nail polish and love how this shines up my nails. The lotion smells really nice. I am happy I was able to find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I first bought the Dead Sea products at the mall, and loved them.  Plus they&#x27;re at the same mall year-round.  The buffing block is okay, but you do have to be very careful not to overuse the roughest side or your nails will get very thin.  On the shine side, I found that I have to run the block from the bed of the nail to the tip to get the best shine, one way only.  (I also do this with nail polish chips and dents, smooth the dent, then buff!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get the blocks separately, with a full range of \\&quot;grit\\&quot;, from beauty supply shops or other places where they sell a lot of nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, yes, at the mall kiosk, you can get the price reduced, but have to take time to work with the sales person.  And they never seem to want me to browse.  So I haven&#x27;t gone back.</li>
    <li> Buffer will wear out after regular use but I will continue to buy this since it does work very well for a long time (the last set I had lasted me years!). Very pleased, thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used ths product for more than 4 years.  Originally the price was $40, so the $15 price tag was quite a savings.  Using this once a month has turned my brittle nails stronger.  I now have to trim themhen before I could not grow them!</li>
    <li> The lotion is so creamy and smells so fresh.  I do not even need perfume!  I think you are out of stock.... Please get more</li>
    <li> A great accompany with the salt scrub ( which is done first to get the benefits if the kit ). Helps to keep cuticles and hands soft; buffer shapes and shines nails for a nice finish; hands will look beautiful without polish.</li>
    <li> I too was approached at the mall. The cost? $39 for two kits. Not bad, but I immediately got on my iPhone &amp; checked the price online. I told her $39 wasn&#x27;t bad, but I did not need 2 kits. So I got 1 for $19. Know what you&#x27;re working with &amp; know they are very easy to negotiate with. This set is DEFINITELY worth the $$ I paid &amp; I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I like the way this helps strengthen and smooth nails. Mom has psoriasis and I have found Primier products to be fantastic for her skin and nail problems</li>
    <li> bought it in the mall, then found out it is half the price via Amazon, to bad they have to rip people off , the product is not worth it.</li>
    <li> I was tricked into buying this product from a kiosk at the mall for $63 !!!!!  You would think that any mall would vet the products coming into them to make sure that customers were not getting ripped off - now I find I could have bought it for so much less!  The buffing bar also shows a lot of wear after a couple of uses.  So disappointing.</li>
    <li> They are rip off artists.  They do not return phone calls and disappear from the mall faster than Santa in January.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY from this company in the mall and their products on line.  Total junk from total crooks.</li>
    <li> For me, it did not work! My nails were even more brittle. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I paid 60 bucks at the mall for this!! What a sucker I was! I bought this for a friend because I know she will like it and falls for those mall kiosk people like I do!</li>
    <li> I had used this kit before so I knew I would like it.  I did.  I love the cuticle oil.  My nails are very fragile at certain times of the year and this has helped them become stronger.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a mall kiosk for $25.00, thinking it was comparable to a manicure which I never have time for. Turns out it was not such a good purchase for me!  The buffing block thinned my nails so much after only one use that they all began splitting.  I ended up cutting them very short to prevent further splitting and breakage.  The oil works well, but after pushing back my cuticles, I used a cuticle clippers to cut away the cuticle (I know, I know, you&#x27;re not supposed to do this).  This created a bunch of hang nails.  Well seriously, cuticles don&#x27;t just melt away.  The lotion is okay, if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrance.  It&#x27;s light, but not particulary pleasant. If you consider purchasing this product, do so on-line and don&#x27;t fall for the sales gimmicks used at the malls.  Be careful with the buffing block.  Go easy on it.  I thought I was, but obviously, that is not the case!  And for the shine, don&#x27;t expect it.  I saw a shiny nail once after the mail demo and never again.  Maybe I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing but it can&#x27;t be rocket science.  I&#x27;ve had beautiful nails before using this product. I was even able to file and polish my own nails!</li>
