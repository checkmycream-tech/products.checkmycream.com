      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get over how fantastic this lotion smells!</li>
      <li>One of the better lotions</li>

      <li>It smells amazing and has a very creamy texture that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily.</li>
      <li>well worth it!</li>
      <li>I love this new lotion. !!</li>
      <li>Easy purchase, fast shipping, accurate description</li>
      <li>Not enough for me to care because I still get amazing color from this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Easy purchase, fast shipping, accurate description</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works as expected.</li>
    <li> I recently started going to a tanning salon and the girl recommended this to me. It was like 75$ in the salon so I ordered it off here. I tried the packet from the salon for the first 2 days and I was extremely satisfied. But it does not last which is why I had to keep on tanning with this. Warning: it does have a orangey bronzey color to it so I don&#x27;t recommend it for fair skin. Before tanning I had a pale but yellow toned skin so the orangey bronze color would make me look bronzed (if that makes sense)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few sessions I noticed a darker color but after showering the bronzer would come off:/ and leave me with half the tan I got before showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I would not recommend this to people who want a quick tan, it&#x27;s more gradual.it builds up the color slowly. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing but it&#x27;s a nice product, there&#x27;s better ones out there</li>
    <li> Never buying this again, it left in between my fingers orange like i had a self tanner on.</li>
    <li> My tanning salon charges roughly $90 for this lotion, but I found it here on Amazon for way less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I noticed was the amazing smell. It&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Whild Berry Dahlia&amp;#34;, and I know one thing for sure... I want to bathe in it every day! I can&#x27;t get over how fantastic this lotion smells! I just wish it smelled as great after my tanning session, but DHA bronzers often have a funny after smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion also requires quite a bit of prep time before tanning. You must rub it in evenly and well, otherwise streaking may occur. And don&#x27;t ever be lazy about washing your hands and getting the lotion out from between your fingers. I was in a rush, didn&#x27;t do it, and now my finger webbing is a hideous dark brown. Gross!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the &amp;#34;squeeze cork&amp;#34; that is inside the bottle (don&#x27;t know what it is called) fell down into the bottle after a few uses, which is really annoying. It also makes me wonder if the bottle was tampered with. When I compared it to my salon&#x27;s bottle, I noticed a slight difference in consistency... Not enough for me to care because I still get amazing color from this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a freckly blonde, so I don&#x27;t tan well... This lotion helps so much!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite tanning lotions I have tried. It smells amazing and has a very creamy texture that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily. It doesn&#x27;t make you orange or overly dark, it&#x27;s the perfect blend!</li>
    <li> Heard amazing things from friends about this lotion. Cant wait to try it. I was amazed at how fast I got it. Ordered it on Wednesday, had it by Saturday.</li>
    <li> Not the best for fair skin. The toner is too much and looked orange and streaky. I would not recommend using this if you have a fair complexion.</li>
    <li> Like most it smells good prior to tanning but goes on thick and uneven and does not smell nearly as good after like other dc lotions</li>
    <li> I like this lotion overall. The smell is nice, and its not \\&quot;orangy\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t feel like it lasted very long though.. and it didn&#x27;t go on very nicely in the feet/ ankle area. But it did get me color fast. I just feel like it is a more expensive lotion and should have been a little better.</li>
    <li> One of the better lotions</li>
    <li> works very well. recieved it fast</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion!  It arrived quickly and I would definitely order this product again.  It&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying in the tanning salon!</li>
    <li> I purchased this previously at the tanning room loved the smell although it is pricey.  I found it on line for a lesser price.  The same lotion and I purchased more. No greasy feeling either.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my girlfriend, but she was extremely satisfy with the results though we couldn&#x27;t get passed the yellow hands, but overall we give it a five star rating, I love the smell by the way!</li>
    <li> Bronzes perfectly.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I really want to get this product because it is a good price compared to $75. Which is what my salon charged but my salon told me that if I buy from amazon it will be tampered with.  That it is watered down and they put different products in this to delute it. A girl that goes to my salon said she bought this from amazon and it had a tingling lotion mixed into it and she broke out in a rash. Because of this I&#x27;m very afraid to buy from here. I have bought the single packs from my salon and I know the lotion is supposed to be a brown color. Can anyone tell me if they believe this is legit?</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotions I have used. Tan very quickly with it.</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived on time.  Kind of expensive.</li>
    <li> this is a great product you do have to rub in really well but other than that this will boost your color great and it doesnt rub off or fad out the smell is great to.</li>
    <li> Liked it, used a lot of type and one of the better ones.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Does have an after tan smell. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I used this product at the salon and had a great bronze that lasted hours after tanning and gave an instant color. This bottle that I bought from Tantastic on amazon looks bronze but rubs on white like a plain lotion and there is no color change after tanning. This is simply unethical if that is what the companies are offering and shame on Amazon for allowing it. Its a great lotion and will not buy from amazon any longer.</li>
    <li> I Love it! I will definately buy the Camo  Queen tanning lotion again. It is way cheaper on Amazon than in the tanning salon &amp; well worth it!</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised and in great condition!</li>
    <li> I love this new lotion. !! Smells amazing before AND after tanning!!</li>
    <li> Helps give a great color- couldn&#x27;t use during a lunch time as it has a distinctive tanning lotion smell but if that is not an issue go for it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed, and way cheaper than buying it at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> Great smell, fantastic moisturizer, and nice bronze tint!</li>
    <li> This was so expensive at my salon. They always tell you &amp;#34;be careful, the salon bottles you are buying could be expired and not work, etc&amp;#34;. This bottle worked fine and I had no issues whatsoever. I use this as my bronzer and alternate between this and a tingle lotion. I am a forever customer.</li>
