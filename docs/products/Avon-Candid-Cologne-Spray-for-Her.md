      <li>I received my package 2 days after my order was confirmed.</li>
      <li>Strong and sultry at first but lightens to an inviting scent that is not insulting to the senses.  </li>
      <li>And fast!!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a clean floral</li>
      <li>I was looking for a sweet floral scent.</li>
      <li>I ALSO GET COMPLIMENTS FROM EVERY ONE DAILY ABOUT THE CLEAN FRESH  PLEASANT AROMA I HAVE ON.  </li>
      <li>NO BAD AFFECTS FOR ME</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even been asked at te super market what I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
      <li>I HAVE USED CANDID COLOGNE SPRAY FOR EVER, AND NO OTHER COLOGNES PERIOD.</li>
      <li>I really love the scent  of Avon Candid Cologne spray so much that I wanted to order extra&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Shipping was super super fast..</li>
      <li>This particular scent is light and fresh smelling.it doesn&#x27;t over power your senses.</li>
      <li>A decent scent that I bought for my mom who wanted a light fragrance for summer.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and delivery was faster than I had imagined.</li>
      <li>Smelled pretty good, but the scent did not last very long.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>absolutely order again when I run out....</li>
      <li>so I am very upset over this.  </li>
      <li>Its light and lasts long.</li>
      <li>It is the only cologne I can wear that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache and the fragrance is light and soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Candid for decades, like others, and when I figured out Avon was discontinuing it, first I got angry, then I stocked up at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I love this Cologne, light but a little floral, not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>This was a gift to me when my son was born (now 37 years old).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s subtle yet sexy.</li>
      <li>.....now I will have to scavenger for it, and I know that unless Avon brings it back I will have to find a new scent....</li>
      <li>Avon once again proves to be a solid choice at a price that doesn&#x27;t leave your wallet empty</li>
      <li>It appears Avon is bringing it back, at least for awhile, but the Amazon price is much better.</li>

THUS, ONCE I  DISCOVERED HOW GREAT CANDID IS AND NO BAD AFFECTS FOR ME, IT WAS  WONDERFUL!! I ALSO GET COMPLIMENTS FROM EVERY ONE DAILY ABOUT THE CLEAN FRESH  PLEASANT AROMA I HAVE ON.  I&#x27;M SURE I HAVE USED THIS COLOGNE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF AVONS INTRODUCTION OF IT.  I LOVE IT!!!!  I AM CONSTANTLY ASKED WHAT PERFUME I AM WEARING, AND WHERE TO GET IT!!  DOESN&#x27;T GET BETTER THAN THAT!!</li>

    <li> the fragrance is so good</li>
    <li> Started using this scent around 1970, I believe. Has always been my fav...always will. It is light but not too ethereal. Lacks that &amp;#34;catch-you-in-the-throat&amp;#34; quality of many scents.</li>
    <li> Took a gamble getting this cologne.  Did not care for it at all.  Donated it in hopes someone might like it.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!! And fast!!! Thank you</li>
    <li> I love it have used for years!</li>
    <li> I love candid cologne spray, I am so glad I can get this on amazon, and not have to have an avon lady.</li>

    <li> I have worn Candid for many many years..I still had a tiny bit left, but was almost out.  needed more!!</li>
    <li> Avon has stopped selling this and it&#x27;s the only perfume that doesn&#x27;t agrivate family allergies so I had to have it. Great price even compared to the avon prices. If you like this and can&#x27;t find it get it here. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>

    <li> As many women can identify a &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; that their mothers or grandmothers always wore and immediately experience a Flashback to the comfort and embrace of a time gone by...sadly so it shall be with this cologne that I have wore for the past 40 years. Avon has discontinue this cologne and I had to find it on line, Even though I am still on the &amp;#34;upper side of the grass&amp;#34; my children and grandchildren already mention when the come into the house, that it &#x27;smells like  grama&amp;#34;.....now I will have to scavenger for it, and I know that unless Avon brings it back I will have to find a new scent....It is a very light, woody, sweet fragrence, that I will miss, but am happy Amazon has it available at a reasonable price.</li>

    <li> I absolutely love Candid. I&#x27;ve been wearing for years and it&#x27;s the only scent I&#x27;ve ever worn and gotten compliments on.
