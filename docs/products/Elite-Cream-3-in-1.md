      <li>My own testimony was after 2 weeks of using it I met my husband at the gym after work and upon seeing him, he took his earphones out for a second and was like &amp;#34;woah</li>
      <li>but this is actually worth writing about.</li>
      <li>I ordered it in April and its July, and so far if anything it made my skin break out more and become oily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had good skin in middle or high school</li>
      <li>Realistically, it didn&#x27;t serve it&#x27;s initial purpose for me (skin whitening), however I will most definately continue purchasing this product because of the results it has had on my skin so quickly.</li>
      <li>This cream really work!</li>

      <li>I washed my face and put it on, first it smells really</li>
      <li>thanks a lot😊 will certainly buy again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;ps:</li>
      <li>My interest in this cream was to make my skin lighter (like a gentle skin bleaching process).</li>
      <li>and it is actually really soothing and moisturizing when you put it on</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please feel free to comment with questions of my experience or if you have similar skin tone (medium skin tone) and want questions answered!</li>
      <li>I feel like it can make me look really off with the rest of my skin tone.</li>
      <li>This cream really does work and fast too.</li>
      <li>and I only used it in the evening so that no one would mistaken me for a cheap &amp;#34;working girl&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t bother me too much once I got used to it</li>
      <li>/&gt;Downfall: You really have to work it in.  </li>
      <li>So to start off, I am a Mexican with medium dark skin,I purchased this product after watching a pretty good review on it.</li>
      <li>but you have to keep rubbing it in to look normal!</li>
      <li>I barely dab my finger into the cream and it is usually more than enough, so</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s more packaging than product (a jar typically lasts me 3-3 1/2</li>
      <li>Once it&#x27;s applied to the skin, however, it does not feel particularly moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Definitely buying more in the future.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical on getting it at first because there are so many gimics out there, even when I recieved  this in the mail, the box and container it came in seemed cheap</li>
      <li>so when you put it on, of course it makes your skin appear lighter, but as far as changing the pigmentation of the skin to a permanent lighter shade, not so much.</li>
      <li>I bought this face cream to see if it would live up to the hype on the internet.</li>
      <li>I hereby give it two stars simply because it saved me money on perfume;)</li>
      <li>at first it&#x27;s looks like a chalky white cream</li>
      <li>I love this cream it really helps brighten and make my skin glow, it also helps a lot with the acne, although the portion is very small and the shipping is long, and very pricey.</li>
      <li>I have never used foundation ever since this product had clear up my skin....</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>i gave it four star&#x27;s due to the very very slowwwww shipping , any ways i had a baby April 2014 after my son it seems like nothing has been working to remove my acne scars</li>
      <li>The jar is very small,expensive and last for only 1 month.</li>
      <li>I like to add a little more on my dark spots and around the sides of my nose(only because people use concealer on the side of the nose to make it look lighter and look younger)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just now starting to improve in my adult years</li>
      <li>that I&#x27;m near the bottom of the jar where I can give an objective assessment of this product, I cannot attest to its advertised benefits or its hype (I&#x27;m Asian myself</li>
      <li>IT GOOD BECAUSE I HAVEN&#x27;T BREAK OUT BAD...</li>

    <li> So my cream just got here, and I can&#x27;t wait to see some results, I don&#x27;t know why but I have faith that it will work! I washed my face and put it on, first it smells really LIKE REALLY good! And it looks like a concealer cause it leaves your face about 1 0r 2 shades whiter, I love it! I&#x27;ll write another reviews 15 days later 😊follow me on instagram @keidi95</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not works at all. I been using it for 3 month already I don&#x27;t seen any results like these comments discribed don&#x27;t waiste your money!</li>
    <li> I got it on time. No damage to the product. I&#x27;m satisfy.</li>
    <li> Love love this. It has cleared my acne, dark spots, etc....I Will purchase this forever if I can. Ever since using this product my face had never ever grew a pimple. This product has brighten my skin like a miracle! This product is a must need! :) this product fades scar, etc..everything. I have never used foundation ever since this product had clear up my skin.... I&#x27;ve receive many compliments.</li>
    <li> got it about one month before the scheduled arrival. was utterly satisfied. thanks a lot😊 will certainly buy again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;ps: gosh. the product is so lovely, girls. it seriously works!</li>
    <li> This cream really work!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. After 2 nights, my skin is clearer and lighter. I will buy this stuff forever!</li>
    <li> So to start off, I am a Mexican with medium dark skin,I purchased this product after watching a pretty good review on it. 2oz??? Rip off?? NOPE! (: this cream is unlike the other creams I have had. I barely dab my finger into the cream and it is usually more than enough, so 2 oz will go a long way, than I expected! The texture is pretty thick when it&#x27;s in the jar and on your face(you can feel it&#x27;s thickness) at first it&#x27;s looks like a chalky white cream but you have to keep rubbing it in to look normal! I don&#x27;t use this product with makeup like some people do only because I feel that my skin looks way lighter(fakely) when I have it on so I use it as a night cream, because I LOVE how my skin looks after I wash it off! So it makes my natural skin(with out the cream) which is an ugly dull skin texture into a SHINEY, BRIGHT(yes a lot lighter), Newly looking skin completion(after I was off the cream) so when I wake up i wash it off and have beautiful skin! So instead of placing make up over it like some people can pass with, I rinse my face and I don&#x27;t have to wear any cover up or make up afterwards! Ps. I like to add a little more on my dark spots and around the sides of my nose(only because people use concealer on the side of the nose to make it look lighter and look younger)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short I recommend using this product as a night cream and washing it off when you really want good effects!&lt;br /&gt;This cream is like a mask for me. If I am wearing it out I feel like it can make me look really off with the rest of my skin tone. (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to comment with questions of my experience or if you have similar skin tone (medium skin tone) and want questions answered!</li>
    <li> So much LOVE this cream ! Finally , I found the BEST ever night cream. Makes my skin look softer, brighter and look younger. . . I higly recommend this cream to everyone . . .  try this and do it at night before going to bed.</li>
    <li> great seller would buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of creams. My interest in this cream was to make my skin lighter (like a gentle skin bleaching process). I&#x27;ve found that the cream itself is a very light color so when you put it on, of course it makes your skin appear lighter, but as far as changing the pigmentation of the skin to a permanent lighter shade, not so much. However, I&#x27;m giving this cream four stars because it did even out my skin tone in addition to clearing up all blemishes on my face. I was extremely impressed actually, after 2-3 nights of using it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how small the pores were on my face and how even the skin tone was. I felt completely comfortable not even having to wear make-up or foundation throughout the day. I purchase a lot on Amazon and I NEVER write reviews about what I buy but this is actually worth writing about. Realistically, it didn&#x27;t serve it&#x27;s initial purpose for me (skin whitening), however I will most definately continue purchasing this product because of the results it has had on my skin so quickly. I was skeptical on getting it at first because there are so many gimics out there, even when I recieved  this in the mail, the box and container it came in seemed cheap I&#x27;ll admit, but it&#x27;s a great facial cream. My own testimony was after 2 weeks of using it I met my husband at the gym after work and upon seeing him, he took his earphones out for a second and was like &amp;#34;woah, your skin looks like porcelain.&amp;#34; I was in shock lol I&#x27;ve never had good skin in middle or high school and it&#x27;s just now starting to improve in my adult years but that&#x27;s the best way I can describe the effects and results you will see if you use this cream. Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;  Hope this was helpful.</li>
    <li> Love this cream it have my face looking very nice thank you !</li>
    <li> I love this cream it really helps brighten and make my skin glow, it also helps a lot with the acne, although the portion is very small and the shipping is long, and very pricey.</li>
    <li> This stuff takes good care of acne I have sensitive skin and it is actually really soothing and moisturizing when you put it on and it does whiten just like it is supposed to ^_^</li>
    <li> I bought this face cream to see if it would live up to the hype on the internet. It didn&#x27;t. When I first opened the jar, the rose fragrance was so strong it hit me like a perfume bomb! The cream itself was nothing like anything I&#x27;d used before, it has a consistency of a foundation cake that&#x27;s not easily scooped up with a finger. Once it&#x27;s applied to the skin, however, it does not feel particularly moisturizing. Though the fragrance is quite intoxicating, not in a pleasant way. It didn&#x27;t bother me too much once I got used to it and I only used it in the evening so that no one would mistaken me for a cheap &amp;#34;working girl&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m near the bottom of the jar where I can give an objective assessment of this product, I cannot attest to its advertised benefits or its hype (I&#x27;m Asian myself so I don&#x27;t subscribe to the fascination with all things oriental.) My faced stayed in the same skin tone and the quality of my skin has no noticeable improvement whatsoever. I hereby give it two stars simply because it saved me money on perfume;)</li>
    <li> IT GOOD BECAUSE I HAVEN&#x27;T BREAK OUT BAD... BUT I HOPE TO SEE MORE PROGRESS</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not works at all</li>
    <li> Amazed with the result and it&#x27;s only been 5 days i gave it four star&#x27;s due to the very very slowwwww shipping , any ways i had a baby April 2014 after my son it seems like nothing has been working to remove my acne scars and i have used almost everything even prescription creams from my dermatologist. But now my scars have been significantly reduced lets see what happens in the weeks to come</li>
    <li> I bought this creme 3 times . One for my mom, my friend, and my cousin. My cousin saw the blemishes go away but my mom has these black blemishes that has been on her face since she had my brother. And my friend she has pimples and in about 2 or 1 week they went away.</li>
    <li> No real opinion here, perhaps when my acnes clears up I might try it. I&#x27;m a bit nervous though because it is HIGHLY fragrant and usually in my past experiences, Fragrance and Acne don&#x27;t usually mix too well. Will update if I use it further</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! It cleared up my acne and took all my acne scars away. It really did even out my skin tone and made my face more lighter &amp; brighter. I am very happy with this product and I will continue on buying it.</li>
    <li> This cream really does work and fast too. I wish they made it for the entire body. Within a month i noticed how bright my skin became</li>
    <li> The product has a very good smell. Like floralish. I ordered it in April and its July, and so far if anything it made my skin break out more and become oily. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> The best night cream EVER.  I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Nars, La Mer, Aveno, L&#x27;Oreal, Mario Badescu, etc. etc.  This one DOES things.  It really does!  1.)  Reduces acne scaring and dark spots, 2.) Evens overall skin tone, 3.) Makes outbreaks calm down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downfall: You really have to work it in.  It creates a pale/pasty appearance, which diminishes throughout the night as the skin absorbs.  There&#x27;s more packaging than product (a jar typically lasts me 3-3 1/2 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been purchasing for 3 months now, best value is purchasing 2 at a time.  First from ebay (far too expensive) and now from Amazon.  I will continue to buy as long as it is made.  EXCELLENT product!  My skin type: Oily, acne prone.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the description says its clears your acne,pimple scars and mark and from reoccuring.Also,it suppose to whitened the skin for the face.I was a bit dissapointed. It did nothing for my pimple marks and scars. It smells good and yellow in color.&lt;br /&gt;When you apply it on the face.You have to rub it several times for it to absorb properly into the skin.Otherwise,it leaves a chalky look and feel. The jar is very small,expensive and last for only 1 month. It says 3 in 1 but it doesnt give proper description of why its called Elite 3 in 1 Cream! The description and instruction on the box. And inside the box it comes with a instruction sheet which is very small.In order to&lt;br /&gt;read,a person have to use a magnifier glass if they know how to read oriental language.The instruction and description is not in English.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a month now but hasn&#x27;t seen result yet. I&#x27;m still hoping to get the result other people claim.....</li>
    <li> Works amazing! Definitely buying more in the future.</li>
</ol>
