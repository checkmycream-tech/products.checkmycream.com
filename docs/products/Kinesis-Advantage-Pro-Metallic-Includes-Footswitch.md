      <li>What surprised me was how easy it was to learn touch typing on this keyboard.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this on my question for better ergonomics. After a month or so, I&#x27;m finally back up to my normal typing rate. I haven&#x27;t used a lot of the features, but I figure I will at some point. Only complaint is the foam pads they include to attach have already worn down on one side.</li>
    <li> Let me start off this review by admitting that many will find it unfair. I have used this basic model of keyboard (maybe one minor revision back) for over five years now. As a programmer, I love the layout. The ability to use Alt and Ctrl with my thumbs is a lifesaver. On top of that, my thumbs get a nice workout with all the other useful keys in the thumb section.    So if it&#x27;s such a great keyboard, why the 1 star rating? Well, this is my second keyboard. As others have mentioned, the top row of keys containing the escape and function keys is horrible. It&#x27;s soft rubber that wiggles horizontally as well as pressing down. It&#x27;s extremely difficult to get any useful feedback on pressing it and I find that I frequently wind up with multiple keypresses on them with one poke if I&#x27;m not very careful. There&#x27;s nothing quite like hitting escape in an app, only to have it send multiple escapes, thus possibly backing out of too many prompts/windows.    On top of that, the reason I&#x27;m on my second keyboard is because the F9 key ultimately failed on my first one. That was after only a couple of years of using it. The construction and design is incredibly poor in this area.    But even this could possibly be forgiven if they keyboard wasn&#x27;t $300! For that much, there&#x27;s just no excuse for either the choice of these squishy rubber keys or for them failing in a couple of years. Maybe they think \\&quot;normal\\&quot; users don&#x27;t use these keys much (that might be true of the function keys, though it&#x27;s really hard to believe with the escape key), but I don&#x27;t think their biggest market is \\&quot;normal\\&quot; users. It&#x27;s users that use keyboards a lot, which includes programmers and job-centered application users. Both of these tasks typically heavily rely on function keys.    I&#x27;ve written them an email almost nine months ago but never got any response. So lacking any possibility of this improvement, I feel I have no other recourse than rate this product so low. It&#x27;s great, but how often can you afford to replace a $300 keyboard? How does every 2-3 years sound?    PS: To try to work around this situation, I&#x27;m buying a $100 function key strip from x-keys. Yes, $100 more just to try to make a $300 product work like it should. It should help me avoid having to ditch this keyboard when it inevitably breaks, but it&#x27;s not the most ergonomic or economic of solutions.</li>
    <li> I love this keyboard&#x27;s design. It takes does take a few days to get used to, however, so try switching over a weekend or other period of downtime to adjust and avoid getting frustrated.  Once your muscle memory has adjusted, you should find that the keyboard is much more comfortable to type on. For me, there are two features that really make this design excel over other ergonomic keyboards I have tried. First is the splitting of the keyboard into two concave finger wells. This helps you avoid awkward finger and wrist positions.  Second is the two separate thumbpads that place the more heavily used keys (e.g. space, enter, backspace, control, alt, etc.) right under your thumbs.  Since your thumbs are the strongest digits on your hands, this makes a huge difference in typing comfort. It also helps you avoid awkward finger stretches to perform common actions like cutting and pasting and other control and alt keyboard shortcuts.  Actually, the entire layout is designed to avoid awkward finger stretches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic setup for a windows PC is simple, just plug the USB cable in and start typing. Remapping keys is fairly easy, but I am fine with the default layout. Mac users need to jump through some hurdles and there is a way to switch to DVORAK layout. Although I didn&#x27;t try to do either, the instructions seem straight forward. The keyboard also supports a good number of macros, but I use software on my computer (PhraseExpress) that provides much more powerful macros and an unlimited number of them. So I don&#x27;t have much use for the Kinesis&#x27;s keyboard memory macros. If I were to switch the keyboard from computer to computer frequently, it might be helpful, but I only use it with one computer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should note that this is a big keyboard and will not fit into keyboard trays designed for \\&quot;standard\\&quot; keyboards. The size is one reason it is so comfortable to work on, but you need to make sure that it will fit into your workspace or that you are willing to makechanges to your workspace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I like this keyboard, there are a few flaws that keep me from giving it a five-star rating. First, I&#x27;ve been unable to get the USB ports on the bottom of the board to work with anything. Since the keyboard takes up one port on your computer, it would be nice to plug a couple devices into the keyboard, but I have tried connecting an external hard drive and also an external touch pad and neither work with the keyboard. I may just have gotten a dud and will update my review after I&#x27;ve gone through the support rigamarole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The USB ports worked when I plugged the keyboard into a different USB port on my computer. I still kept the review at four stars because of the foot-pedal issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A more serious and annoying limitation is the foot pedal drivers. It may not be fair to ding the keyboard because of the foot pedal, but the pedal comes with this model and is one of the features they use to advertise this model, which is the highest-end model they sell. The foot pedal&#x27;s default action is to activate the embedded keyboard layer. The keyboard does not have a numeric keypad and uses an embedded layer of keys that you activate with a keypad button, similar to how many laptop keypads work. So using the foot pedal is helpful for activating the numeric keypad. But if you use a separate numerical keypad or don&#x27;t use the embedded keys often, you are supposed to be able to remap the footpedal like any key on the keyboard. For example, I would like to use the foot pedal as the shift key or as the mouse click. But the foot pedal drivers do  not support Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Mac OS. If you want to change the default action of the foot pedal, you have to hook you keyboard and footpedal up to a windows XP or Windows 2000 computer and remap there.  Many people will not have easy access to outdated operating systems and it is unacceptable to not support current operating systems and not make it clear whenyou buy the product. This limitation is not mentioned in their marketing materials. Their manual doesn&#x27;t even mention this. You have to dig around in the support pages of the Kinesis Web site to find an explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foot pedal drivers are a large blemish on an otherwise great product. When spending so much for a keyboard, one would expect that they would at least support a current operating system rather than expecting their customers search for a legacy OS no longer supported by Microsoft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In hindsight, I should have bought the Advantage, rather than the Advantage Pro model. I don&#x27;t use the onboard macros and the foot pedal is useless to me because I can&#x27;t remap its default action due to a very outdated driver that Kinesis hasn&#x27;t updated to support a modern OS. I&#x27;m also disappointed with the bum USB ports, but am not counting that against them yet as it may just be bad luck in getting a defective unit. I&#x27;ll update this after I&#x27;ve tried to resolve the usb issues with tech support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given these two fails, it may be surprising that I rate this product so highly. I do so because I find the design to be excellent. It is by far the best designed keyboard I&#x27;ve used and the USB ports and foot pedal are really not that important to me. If I would have bought the standard Advantage model, I&#x27;d probably give it a five-star rating, but most of the additional features of the pro model are not that useful, are outdated, or don&#x27;t work. To avoid disappointment, you may be better off buying the standard version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UDATE (11/2012): After over 2 years of use, I still love this keyboard. I now use a treadmill desk and find that this keyboard is easier to use when walking on a treadmill desk then more traditional flat keyboards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Kinesis Ergo Advantage Pro for years with no issues.  Without it I would not be typing this review.  Years ago I was working on the computer constantly and was facing the fact that I may have to change professions due to both wrist and hand issues.  The damage was being caused by using a traditional keyboard and mouse.    After much research I invested in the Kinesis Advantage Pro keyboard and a Wacom tablet with pen.  I have never looked back.     There is a learning curve to using the keyboard which generally takes less then a week to overcome.  In my case I was originally more of a four finger typist.  When I received the Kinesis keyboard it became apparent that you need to touch type to use it. .  What surprised me was how easy it was to learn touch typing on this keyboard.  Within a couple of days I was touch typing, something I wasn&#x27;t able to master on a traditional keyboard.    Having worked on one version or another of this keyboard for 15 years I can highly recommend it to anyone.  Like any keyboard it&#x27;s still important to set it at the correct height and tilt for your ergonomics. Instead of a mouse I use a pen tablet.  When people ask about using a pen I remind them that people have been using pens and pencils for centuries.  Computer mice have been around for only about 25 years.</li>
    <li> This is a great keyboard, and I bought mine based on the recommendation of a friend who has been using these keyboards for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a well-known issue with Windows 7 and USB 3.0. If you&#x27;re using Windows 7, you will most likely have problems getting the keyboard to work. However, if you contact Kinesis customer support promptly after purchase, they will send you a cable conversion kit to change it to use a PS2 connector. They also include a PS2-to-USB converter, which essentially makes the keyboard work just fine under Windows 7. I will elaborate on that more below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The keyboard itself is fantastic! It does take some time to get used to the new layout, but I just downloaded a free typing tutor program and went through the exercises. I normally touch-type 70-80 wpm, so it was a bit of a change to have to re-learn the new layout, but I can already tell that it&#x27;s easier to use and puts less stress on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about the Windows 7/USB 3.0 issue: When I received my keyboard, it did not work with Windows 7, so I emailed Kinsesis customer support. They sent me the conversion kit, and it only took me about five minutes to remove the bottom of the keyboard and unhook the USB cable from the USB daughterboard and main circuit board. I then attached the new PS2 cable, and then use a PS2-to-USB converter to regain USB support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was waiting for my cable conversion kit to arrive, I connected the keyboard via USB to a Linux workstation, and it worked just fine with the Linux USB drivers. I wish that the keyboard worked flawlessly with Windows 7, but I think the problem lies with Microsoft, and at least Kinesis promptly sent me a work-around and were very helpful in addressing the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to not be intimidated by the USB issue with Windows 7. If you&#x27;re capable of using a screwdriver, you can swap out the cable, and the keyboard itself is definitely well worth the trouble!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  11-May-2015&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with the keyboard that I ordered for my job, I have ordered another one for home as well.r my job, I have ordered another one for home as well.</li>
    <li> SEVENTEEN YEARS ago, I finally \\&quot;had to\\&quot; give up typing. My hand doctor told me, if I didn&#x27;t I would end up having carpel tunnel surgery, and then still have to quit typing.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I could only type 15 minutes, after resting my wrists.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this keyboard in Popular Science magazine. The article made it sound like this keyboard would \\&quot;allow\\&quot; me to continue typing, so I ordered one.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely nice for your wrists. Majority of the keys are in the same place, BUT you have to get used to the \\&quot;reach\\&quot;.  The \\&quot;hardest\\&quot; key to get used to is the SHIFT Key.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Space, backspace, Enter and Delete are now \\&quot;thumb keys\\&quot;. Control / Alt / Home / End / Page up / Page Down are also located in the center of the keyboard towards the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;because I hit Enter &amp; Space a lot, (both keys located on he right side), my arthritis acted up on my right thumb joint.  So ended up having minor surgery on that thumb.  Kinesis tech support suggested \\&quot;relocating\\&quot; Space key with the Backspace key.  So I did. That solved anymore issues.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Because I use a computer at home too , I bought a 2nd Kinesis. So I ended up with one Advantage and one Advantage Pro. the MACROS came in real handy when using Autocad.  One keystroke combined with holding down the foot pedal you could Zoom in a certain distance, change drawing properties.  real nice.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Will this keyboard \\&quot;last\\&quot; ?  It took 15 \\&quot;years\\&quot; before some of my keys would not activate the keystroke.  So I just kept using the other Kinesis, which still has no problems after \\&quot;seventeen years\\&quot;!  My Advantage Pro is currently being rebuilt at the factory for less than $100.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;ANOTHER thing no review here mentions is - you CAN toggle the Advantage Pro to the DVORAK keyboard layout , which is \\&quot;much\\&quot; easier on your hands.  BUT it will take time to learn. Because your fingers are learning new exercises - do this slowly to avoid sore fingers.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Studies have revealed 8 hours of typing on a QWERTY keyboard amounts to 16 miles of travel , while only ONE mile with DVORAK.  TEN THUMBS is a nice cheap typing program to learn DVORAK.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;BECAUSE of the Kinesis Advantage keyboard I was \\&quot;able\\&quot; to keep typing 17 more years after hand doctor told me I HAD RSI. Get an Kinesis keyboard and stay away from RSI surgery!</li>
    <li> Takes time to get used to but worth the effort if you suffer from RSI.  Unfortunately it is very difficult to order in Europe and I had to wait a friend of mine to brink it back to me from the states</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t tell from the product photo, but the escape key and the function keys are a thin row of half-height rubber keys. They aren&#x27;t the full size mechanical Cherry MX brown keys used on the rest of the keyboard. The main keys feel great, but if you use either the escape key or the function keys with any regularity (e.g. programmers) then you will not like this keyboard. This is probably a great keyboard for copy typists. Not so good for the rest of us. With full sized function keys, there would have been a big learning curve, yes, but I would have kept the keyboard and made that attempt.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Kinesis Advantage Pro for almost a year.  I absolutely love the keyboard!!!  The footswitch is something to really adjust to over time, but I love this keyboard.  I use the keyboard eight hours a day M-F as an accountant!  I would recommend the keyboard to anyone who spends so much time in front of a computer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the look of the keyboard is strange don&#x27;t worry about adjusting to the keyboards shape.  You really do naturally take on the form and shape of the key board.  It is very comfortable and user friendly.  I would recommend getting the hand pads that go in the empty place below the keys.  It really makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase! Purchase! Purchase!</li>
    <li> It is no exaggeration to say that this is the best keyboard I have ever typed on.  I have been using this keyboard for over 10 years and it has not yet let me down.  As a programmer who writes a lot of software code, documentation, and email this keyboard has been extremely comfortable for my hands and wrists.  I average about 10-12 hours a day on the computer.  I also write papers at night for school or Sunday messages and this keyboard continues to do what it was designed to do: just work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deep well for your fingers allow your hands to type in a natural resting position so your wrists aren&#x27;t bent up as with most keyboards.  I am one of the few that actually use the programmable keyboard macros.  When I&#x27;m logged on to certain computer consoles through Putty or Terminal programs, the esc, alt and control keys aren&#x27;t mapped properly so the keyboard re-map feature always fixes that common problem when switching between disparate computer systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The learning curve on this keyboard took about a week.  I was already a touch-typist prior to getting this keyboard so typing at my same speed took almost a full week to get re-acquainted with the keys such as the left-thumb backspace, home,end,pgup,pgdn, and enter keys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this keyboard directly from Kinesis I believe for $300 and it has been a worthwhile investment.  After 10 years I&#x27;ve worn out the palm pads that came with the keyboard.  As I shop on Amazon for those pads I decided to let the world know about this great keyboard and pass on the typing joy!</li>
    <li> I have been using a Kinesis Advantage Pro since the port was a PS2! I have RSI in both wrists and this is the only keyboard I can use. I have one at work and one at home. I also use a pen tablet instead of a mouse (use the mouse mode in the settings).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this keyboard to everyone I know. Also, when a job buys it for me (with a letter from my doctor) they usually let me take it with me when I leave since they know no one else will use it OR everyone will want one.</li>
    <li> It takes some getting used to--it will come with typing exercises, which you&#x27;ll need to do until you get completely comfortable, and this might take a few weeks. The price is obscene. After using an iMac keyboard, this felt like using something from 1990. And the keys occasionally stick.  So why the 5 star review? I&#x27;d buy another one in a heartbeat. I recommend this keyboard to everyone I know who has pain when typing. Before the Kinesis Advantage, typing was excruciating. After using this keyboard design, it began to seem inconceivable that most keyboards aren&#x27;t designed like this. It makes typing feel so natural. I have much less pain now when typing than I had before it. This keyboard was a godsend.  I also got rid of my mouse and only use a Wacom Bamboo tablet for navigation, and will soon be adding an Apple trackpad. I&#x27;ve come to realize that the combination of a standard keyboard and mouse is crippling. And using a computer doesn&#x27;t have to be like that! I&#x27;ve had my Kinesis Advantage Pro for a few years now. It is what has allowed me to continue typing. I wish more people in pain knew about it. I wouldn&#x27;t waste money getting the in-between kind that looks like a regular keyboard slit in half. Just get the real deal. When you consider the cost of being in pain due to lack of productivity, medical and therapy expenses, the price of this keyboard isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
    <li> Great Keyboard, it&#x27;s appear strange on first days but now i&#x27;m loving it. Now I have one at office and I want another for home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wrangling over how to deal with this problem for a long time now. Finally my hands feel OK. Took only a couple weeks. Owned this for a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gotten to the point that I can use a regular keyboard for a little while, which I&#x27;m using right now at home (Kinesis at work), but I really want to buy another one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the pro version so I have the footrest, but haven&#x27;t really used it so far.</li>
    <li> Only took a few days to get back to my previous speed. This keyboard hasn&#x27;t done any ergonomic magic for me, but I definitely like it more than most keyboards.</li>
    <li> I love this keyboard.  I am a keyboard snob, and have tried several version of ergo keyboards... this keyboard is a great combination of ergonomics and quality parts.  Sure, for 100 bucks, you can buy a DAS Keyboard with Cherry MX actuators.  Let me clarify - you are not buying this keyboard for the keys - these are simply a nice touch.  You are buying this keyboard as it reduces  more stress to your wrists and fingers than any other keyboard on the market in this price range (sure, Maltron might be better, but at 3x the cost...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a programmer, I type for a living.  As such, a quality keyboard is essential to my health.  Before switching to the Advantage, I was using a Kinesis Freestyle.  This keyboard (a fully split design) allowed me to position my hands in a way that reduced wrist strain, but I was still having to strain to reach the keys, due to the lateral movement of you fingers required by keyboards that do not feature a &#x27;matrix&#x27; key layout.  By switching to the Advantage Pro, my fingers travel more or less in straight paths forward and backwards - no later straining.  This reduced movement alone has allowed me to stop wearing wrist braces when I type - something that had become common practice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While switching to this keyboard might be difficult, especially if you are coming from at traditional, non-ergo keyboard, it is completely worth it - by the end of the first week, I was back to about 90% of my typing speed.  Now that I am fully adjusted, I am as fast if not faster than I was before - this additional speed is probably due to the Cherry MX Brown actuators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence, try it if you can before you buy it - I borrowed a co-workers keyboard for a month before making the jump, but I can say that it has vastly changed my day to day life, as I no longer suffer from RSI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;Matt Ramsey</li>
    <li> First, the price. Frankly it&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous. It&#x27;s just a keyboard. Period. There is nothing about it that justifies a $250+ price tag. The key switches are generic, made of cheap plastic like all the others. The only thing difference between it and a $30 keyboard is the shape and layout of the keys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are planning on using it with a iMac, be warned that on my new iMac running the latest version of OSX, the computer will NOT boot up when this keyboard is attached to it. It sits there at a white screen until I shut the computer off, unplug the keyboard and restart it without it connected. Only after the computer is up and running can I plug it in and use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the so-called ergonomics of the keyboard, I find those claims questionable as well. The hand position may seem more natural at first, but in actual use it requires so much stretching, reaching and other gymnastics that I begin to get cramps sooner and more seriously than with a standard keyboard. Your milage may vary, but for me this keyboard actually seems to make my hands worse rather than help.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful ergonomic design and well worth the money! Unfortunately Arthritis in several finger joints prevented me from using it for long periods</li>
    <li> My job puts me in front of a computer most of the day.  I began to feel pains in the outside edges (pinky fingers) of my hands after a long day.  The biggest advantage of the kinesis here was that it moves a lot of the control-type keys from the outside edge of the keyboard to your thumbs which are much stronger fingers.  Buttons like Cntrl, Alt, Shift, Home, End, Page Up/Down.  I also trained myself to use the foot pedal for shift.  The pain subsided completely after about a month and I&#x27;ve been using this for years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those wondering, it took me about 2 weeks to get back to the same speed of typing I had before switching and I feel like I&#x27;m now even faster now as a result, though the difference is probably minor.  I also have no problems switching back to a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; keyboard at any time so it doesn&#x27;t make it difficult for me to use a laptop or someone else&#x27;s computer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro-tip.  Map the Tab button to your thumb if you use it a lot.  For me, I mapped Tab to be where the Page Down button on the keyboard is (under right thumb).  I don&#x27;t use the windows button much so I just shifted the page up/page down buttons up one each (ie: window key is now page up, page up is now page down.  Only problem with these kinds of mappings is that the keys can&#x27;t really be moved so the labels will be wrong.  Nobody else will likely be using my keyboard though, so I don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> This keyboard is fine if you&#x27;re willing to shell out $350 and have the time and patience to learn/get used to this new keyboard configuration. But it does take a lot of getting used to, and is hard to switch from this keyboard to a normal one when you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* This keyboard forces you to type correctly. It makes it extremely hard to type incorrectly, making you want to learn the right way&lt;br /&gt;* It is supposed to be a lot healthier for you, making your hand type in a healthy position&lt;br /&gt;* The keys are really nice. They push down very well and have a nice spring to them coming up. It feels really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* As a normal keyboard, it takes a little bit of time to get used to. The control, space and delete keys are in the middle of the keyboard and you have to hit them with your thumb on specific side that they chose to put them, which is ok, it just takes time to hit the correct keys. It would maybe take less than a week to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;* As a programmer, I&#x27;ve grown accustom to a lot of keyboard shortcuts that are hard/un-intuitive to perform on this keyboard. It basically prevented me from using the keyboard shortcuts that I&#x27;ve grown to love (I use vim for editing my code).&lt;br /&gt;* The function keys at the top are as bad as people say. It&#x27;s weird to me that they choose to have the function keys be so squishy and fake when the rest of the keyboard keys feel so nice.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s very expensive. It&#x27;s hard to justify the price on this unless you make a career off of typing on a keyboard. If you have the money for it, or your company is paying for it, then it can be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;* If you want to effectively type on a keyboard like this, then it pretty much needs to be the only keyboard you use. If you need to work in a coffee shop, a train or anywhere else you just have a laptop, you don&#x27;t really want to be dragging this keyboard around everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really really wish this keyboard would have worked out for me, I just couldn&#x27;t really get used to this new way of typing. If you have the time and patience to get used to it then this should be a fine keyboard for you. What I really wish is that the keys would be customization so that I could put them in whatever configuration I wanted, then this keyboard would be perfect, but that&#x27;s asking for too much.I just couldn&#x27;t really get used to this new way of typing.
