      <li>We highly recommend this oil.</li>
      <li>The coconut oil is of a good quality, clear and clean; the only down side was when I revived the bottle it was leaking from the cap, it seemed like the cap came loose.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> wonderful; easy to use and give great results; look forward to using it in many different ways; maybe a pouring spout would be nice</li>
    <li> The oil seems to be what I wanted. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to use it, but I will in the next few days.</li>
    <li> This was a great value, and product as expected!! Wonderful !! Better than other products like it. A greater amount for a lower price.</li>
    <li> love this FCO - not only is it a nice, quality product, but the shipping was fast too!  I make a lot of my own beauty and body products and I will DEFINITELY be buying this again!</li>
    <li> The product was good but the sealing tape didn&#x27;t hold and the oil leaked all over the package...it was a real mess.</li>
    <li> I use this for perfumery to dilute absolutes, it works well for just about every absolute I&#x27;ve tried except for some of the more notoriously difficult ones like tonka bean which somewhat precipitates out of solution upon cooling.  It&#x27;s quality product at a pretty good price.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This oil is good for psoriasis. Good to put in your body lotion for beautiful skin. After showering, good to dab some in you pubic area to keep it nice and fresh. It is light and non-greasy and absorbs quickly. It came quickly and packaged well so it came intact.</li>
    <li> First off, the seller ships super fast, which is great! It came double packaged, in a postal box and plastic mailer, which was also good because leaking oil makes a big mess! The bottle was taped shut, but it was no match for an ounce or so of coconut oil on the loose. No worries, but have clean-up supplies at the ready!</li>
    <li> We highly recommend this oil. We use it to make sunscreen, baby wipes, with essential oils and more. The only downside is the shipping, it has come twice with the lid busted and the box soaked in oil. I haven&#x27;t noticed much product loss, just annoying that I have to dig through oily packaging to get to my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is 2 stars!!!!</li>
    <li> I will buy more of this and other carrier oils from this company. I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Not only did this arrive within about 2 days, but it works great with my essential oils!! I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This product absorbs fast and it great as a facial moisturizer and as a base for essential oils. I just love it. I also use it for an after shower moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It needed to come with some kind of pour spout is the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like.  The oil is great and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I am new to essential oils and carrier oils.  This oil is great for my rollerball bottles and for massage oil blends</li>
    <li> This oil smells and tastes like plastic, even when I moved it to a glass bottle. I&#x27;m thinking the plastic packaging leached chemicals into it, which of course is really unsafe. I&#x27;ve had to toss pretty much the whole bottle, so it was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Love the price!&lt;br /&gt;Received my package incredibly fast!&lt;br /&gt;Overall texture and smell was fabulous but the oil is cloudy not clear!</li>
    <li> The coconut oil is of a good quality, clear and clean; the only down side was when I revived the bottle it was leaking from the cap, it seemed like the cap came loose. Not a whole lot of the oil was lost, so I didn&#x27;t report it.</li>
    <li> I love using this with my essential oils. When it was shipped, extra tape was placed around the cap to ensure it didn&#x27;t leak. It was in perfect condition. Much cheaper than some other organic FCOs. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to find this product.  I mix this 50/50 with Babassau oil and it has totally changed the look and feel of my son&#x27;s skin.  My son has MS and sometimes medications dry his skin out. This has changed all of that for the better and I love it.  I feel like I&#x27;ve found my son&#x27;s oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my LMT.  He LOVES it!  It glides on so smoothly and does not leave an oily feeling at all.  He also mentioned that he uses so much less of this oil than any others he has tried.</li>
    <li> Works great to dilute my essential oils.  More greasy than I thought it would be, but overall works well for what I needrit for.</li>
    <li> Wow! This quality is fantastic! I love fractioned coconut oil and much prefer it to bake with versus coconut oil. It&#x27;s Los a,axing for a massage oil and for diluting essential oils I love this and feel like this is a high quality oil!</li>
    <li> The product is a nice scent free and lightweight oil and it easily abosrbed into the skin. I use this as a carrier oil for my Doterra products. The seller is extremely responsive. I had problems getting my order here and Laura was a gem and worked with me to ensure I had my oils here just in time for my meeting. Thank you and I will definitely come back for future needs!</li>
    <li> One bottle broken and emptied during shipment, seller replaced immediately, like next day. thank you. i&#x27;m still not sure about the actual fractionated oil. It is more oily than I had understood fractionated coconut oil is. But, if it is suppose to be oily then all is good.</li>
    <li> I have been experimenting with essential oils and needed a carrier oil. I was using olive oil but wanted something light. I got excellent service, rapid shipping and am writing this because I needed to order more.</li>
    <li> delivery was very fast. this is  actually my 3rd purchase of the FCO. I love it and my clients really enjoy being massaged with it.. leaves your skin feeling soft, sllky but not shiny or greasy.  . plus the health benefits from the fractinoated cocnut oil is remarkable.. Dr Adorable is my number one choice for my massage oils. i have also purchased hemp seed oil and mix it with the fco and it gives an even smoother glide. thank you and i am very happy.. i like how the fco was packaged nicely and securely. thanks again</li>
    <li> This is a reasonably priced Fractionate Coconut oil (FCO). Good quality. Fractionated means the oil has been separated from the fat. So, it goes on non-greasy and soaks into the skin, instead of sitting on top. Great for using with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. I use this for everything from a skin moisturizer, carrier oil and teeth pulling (Ayurvedic, not literal). Packaged well and no leaking when the oil arrived.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s FCO in all its goodness.  I got 2 16oz bottles in my order, which I plan to re-purpose to store the resulting products.</li>
    <li> Scent free oil perfect for massage and skin care. Absorbed very well by skin, easy to wash out of fabrics without leaving any stains</li>
    <li> I really love it. It&#x27;s light and its perfect to add my essential oils. Delivery was very quick, packaging great and the quart jar is small and compact.  Great product.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love the oil, great value.  However, my box and all the packaging was drenched in oil when it arrived.  Pretty messy cleanup.  The normally white USPS Priority box was this shiny dark grey kind of color  - it was completely saturated.  I&#x27;d say the bottle lost about two inches of oil from the top.  I sent the seller a picture of the oil soaked packaging, but the picture of the container got deleted from my iPad so I never sent it in like they requested.  That&#x27;s on me, but having to do all that is a hassle.  They did say they would send replacement oil and I think they would have...however, had they packaged those replacement  ounces the same way, who know how much would have made it?  They lose a star for lousy packaging.  Even if they&#x27;d sent the replacement (and I think they would have), they&#x27;d still have lost the star for the initial mess.</li>
    <li> Happy I found Dr. Adorable.  I use this product in my  home made hair oil.. great moister , true to description.</li>
    <li> Thank you!  Very happy with the oil.  A great base oil for mixing essential oil blends.  Will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product for use in making so many homemade recipes. Feels so wonderful on the skin.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s god stuff, will buy more.</li>
    <li> Very happy to use a high quality, non-staining FCO in my essential oil roller balls.  Dr. Adorable came highly recommended by an experienced friend.</li>
    <li> I use this type of coconut oil for oil-pulling. It is easy to pour. I add a couple drops of clove bud essential oils and it is very pleasant to taste.  I also have used this for making a face scrub with lemon essential oils and organic sugar. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this every day as a way of diluting my Essential Oils from doTERRA.  The quality is very nice, and the oil was received quickly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> This seller and product are gold! Shipped quickly, no fuss. The oil itself is amazing. Moisturizing with no scent of coconut. I actually like coconut but this oil is perfect for infusions, or blending into something else, as it doesn&#x27;t over power the other ingredients. Now I must go order more....</li>
