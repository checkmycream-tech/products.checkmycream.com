    <li> this product is very good</li>
    <li> This is the first mascara I have found that doesn&#x27;t have me groping at my eyeballs in discomfort midway through my day. It offers luxuriant coverage, and doesn&#x27;t flake off onto my corneas. It stays on my lashes! Now, hopefully Maybelline won&#x27;t discontinue or reformulate this cosmetic treasure...</li>
    <li> I just opened this today and I&#x27;m not sure if it was empty and repackaged or just old and dried out, but it is awful!</li>

    <li> I received a more out-dated version of this mascara. Don&#x27;t let this fool you. It&#x27;s dried out, and not the right product.</li>
