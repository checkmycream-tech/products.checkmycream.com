<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great brushes.  This is such a nice set - you can pay the full set price for just one make up brush in the department stores.  These brushes are soft.  Easy to wash and quick dry.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best brushes I ever bought. Never will go back to putting on cosmetics with a sponge or applicator. Very high quality. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This brush set is great! It came as described, and I am very happy. The 18 brushes are great quality with a very nice carrying case. I would without a doubt recommend this product to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debbie</li>
    <li> Great brushes do not lose fibers .</li>
    <li> I have been eyeing quality make - up brushes at some of the high - end cosmetic stores for some time now but didn&#x27;t want to spend the extreme prices for just a small grouping of brushes. I am thrilled with both the quality AND price of my new brushes. It&#x27;s really an amazing deal. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I got these brushes for my girlfriend since she only has a few. I felt she could use a set to widen her brush set-ness. These brushes arrived in a nice case. My girlfriend was overjoyed. They definitely provide a wider array for her to use. The smaller ones work well for eye wear and the larger ones work well for blush and powders. I don&#x27;t know the details, but my girlfriend said they were a great set. The bristles were rigid, but soft for use as makeup. And the case makes sure that she doesn&#x27;t lose a brush again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very solid set of makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality of the brushes.  The bristles were soft yet effective in the application of my make-up.  There is also a wide variety of brushes for pretty much any make-up application.  - Amy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting but I absolutely love these. I work in the beauty industry and have used many different kinds of make up brushes. These are great and easy to clean. I highly recommend these to all the ladies out there!!</li>
    <li> These brushes were absolutely amazing, especially considering the price. If I went to Sephora with how much this entire set cost, I would have left with one and a half brushes.  I washed them all before use last night, and not a single bristle was lost.  I used them for the first time today, and they applied makeup beautifully.  They feel great on the skin, too.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love my brushes :) the hairs never fall off and with a good wash once a month they seem to get softer and sturdier. Definitely recommend :)</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a brush set that has all the basics and then some.  This set has it! The brushes are soft and applies powder, blush and eyeshadow flawlessly.  I really like how compactly the brushes fit in the case and the magnetic closure for the case as well.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great deal for a set that seems will last for a very long time!</li>
    <li> For the amount of brushes that comes in the package, it is a great deal.  There is about every size of brush to do whatever you need and then some.  The pouch that comes with it will help keep them organized and in order so they do not get lost.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for almost 3 months. Really like them a lot ! I went back and ordered my 30 yr. old daughter these too..</li>
    <li> Great brushes and quick delivery. They were high quality brushes in a beautiful case. I will order them again when the promotion code is available.</li>
    <li> Where to start ... delivery was fast, package came in perfect condition with that said when I opened it I was very please. The brush set come in a beautiful black pouch that you can use as an accessory with any black dress that cute it is the pouch.  Right away my daughter an I start trying all the brushes putting make up at each and in awe how good quality and smooth it feels we love it and i&#x27;m planning to order more for Christmas gifts the price is right and the quality and presentation of them are very classy.  This is highly recommend it believe me you won&#x27;t be disappoint it.  I&#x27;m really impress Thank you so much is very hard to find an excellent quality of brush set for such a low price and with a very classy visual product inside the price Thanks and keep the good work from a very happy customer thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Margie</li>
    <li> This truly is the best makeup brush set. It includes every brush you will ever need to make applying your make-up fun , easy and downright glamorous. They feel soft to the skin. The natural hair brushes hold powders such as eye shadow , face powder, finishing powder and blush very well but they are equally easy to clean by tapping them on a hard surface. The synthetic hair brushes are also soft however they work very well with liquid make up , eyeliner , lip liner and lip finishes. I whole heartedly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are nice quality - much better than the cheapo stuff you can get at the super market. I love all the different sizes and styles. These are great for makeup newbs like myself.</li>
    <li> the brushes are super solf, easy to wash. the kit is great the only thing is that the tip of one of my brush is starting to come off..</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this set of brushes. They&#x27;re soft and the carrying case is very nice. I would recommend this to my friends :)</li>
    <li> Came exactly how it was in the picture.. Unfortunately within the week that I first got it, my brushes were falling apart.. Literally!</li>
    <li> I have used many brush sets before, but they have always caused irritation. This product did not irritate my skin and there was such a variety of brushes included. I will continue to use Glynae for all my beauty product needs!</li>
    <li> Definitely a great deal! With this purchase, I feel like I finally have all the brushes I need. This set outperforms the others. Love the big brushes, soft hair, easy cleaning, and sturdiness of this set; and the case it comes in is really pretty too.. I use them on a daily basis. My eye makeup has gone to another level!</li>
    <li> I love love love this makeup brush set.  For its use, the price is really good for this set.  It&#x27;s not one of those cheap makeup brush sets from target or wal-mart, they are really good quality and everything that I ever need to do my makeup is already in there.  All in all very happy with this purchase and would probably buy a few more as gifts.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my girl and she absolutely loves it! This is a great product at a really good price.</li>
    <li> Brushes are horrible hopefully I can return them. Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
    <li> So soft and gets the job done... Glad I purchased these.</li>
    <li> I ordered these makeup brushes for my wife.  I wouldn&#x27;t not call me an expert at makeup brushes or buying makeup brush sets but I do know by the reaction of her the Glynae makeup brushes were obviously and excellent by.  She had a very old set of brushes and I knew she needed a new set.  I wanted to buy ones that were soft on her skin and well make.  I like the look of Glynae and the price was excellent.  She loved the brushes! She said they were very well made and she liked the feel on her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Glynae makeup brush set.</li>
    <li> I  LOVE IT!!!!!, good quality, I&#x27;m very happy that i decide it to buy it!!!!! Great look and all the basic brush that you need :)</li>
    <li> Nice brushes and case. Although they had that strong chemical smell about them.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Got these for my wife and she loves them. Her comments: The brushes are good quality and good variety for applications. The case is durable and convenient. This brush set outclasses other options in this price range.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price! :D</li>
    <li> This is an excellent set of makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case itself looks elegant and high quality - something I wouldn&#x27;t mind carrying around with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brushes come in a variety of sizes for different types of makeup (18 in all) and feel high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is an excellent value, and I highly recommend it for both personal use and as a gift!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok... Cheap looking. I am so disappointed it didn&#x27;t come with a book for the brushes. How to use each brush for best effects.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife and she loves it! She says that it has all the brushes she need and that the quality is very good. It also comes with a nice bag which holds all the brushed in and looks like very nice.</li>
    <li> This brush set is awesome!  There is literally a brush for everything.  It has a great carrying case that is compact enough to fit in my purse.  It has all of the brushes that I could need.</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes at a very good price and they are a very good set of brushes. They even come with their own pouch that has a magnetic clamp. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase.</li>
    <li> So far I can say it&#x27;s given a good impression.. not sure how these things work but the feedback i got told me to say this:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Its pretty good and brushes are soft and not harsh on the skin&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that.. no idea lol</li>
    <li> These are my first set of brushes and I am completely in love with them. The quality of the product is great and they come in a beautiful black case which makes them easy to store and carry anywhere you want. The bristles are soft on skin and does not cause any irritation. It was a great purchase at a great price. Really impressed and will be recommending them to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase these because my 15 year old niece was doing everyone&#x27;s makeup at my daughter&#x27;s wedding and she had a set of these and the makeup went on so well and looked so much better for a longer period of time throughout the day!  Great Product, I only wished I would have known about these when I was younger!</li>
