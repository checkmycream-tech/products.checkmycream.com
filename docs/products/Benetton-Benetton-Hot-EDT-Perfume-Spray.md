      <li>Grand daughters favorite perfume......</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>love it bargain of my life</li>
      <li>this is far better than the price this could easily be a $65 value as it smells just as good as any designer fragrance out there !</li>
      <li>This is such a great product my wife absolutely loves this and its a great deal</li>
      <li>Said it smell fresh, not overly overpowering and a fine complement after a refreshing shower.</li>
      <li>arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
      <li>I bought \\&quot;Hot\\&quot;&#x27;s counterpart \\&quot;Cold\\&quot; for myself and loved it so much and thought I&#x27;d try Hot as well since it is supposedly also unisex.  </li>
      <li>Original product</li>
      <li>Hot by United Colors of Benetton for Women is a great fragrance for anyone looking for a nice light scent, nothing overpowering or heavy.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PERFUME IS A WONDERFUL FRANGANCIA DELICATE SO SOFT</li>
      <li>Luckily I thought it smelled trendy enough that my sister would like it</li>
      <li>I think it smells like a freshly showered guy</li>
      <li>It is actually sweeter than I thought it would be, for the name, &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; was a bit misleading to me, but I knew I liked another Benetton scent, and thought I would try this one out.  </li>
      <li>Nice  lady perfume, great smelling and moderate to long  lasting</li>
      <li>Hot is perhaps even better, but only for women..</li>
      <li>the fragrance remains not previously used the original</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and well packaged.</li>
      <li>Very affordable</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Its very affordable, lasts long and it has a rich fragrance..</li>
      <li>I love that it is so cheap and smells so expensive.  </li>
      <li>The items seem to be old stocks..??!</li>
      <li>Hot is feminine (definitely not unisex)..</li>
      <li>Cold is great for either.</li>
      <li>Are these products really old stocks and/or original/brandnew?</li>
      <li>thanks, every things it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;i wish visit your products next time.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;ll be sending these items as gifts, they could say that these are imitations and/or old stocks already.</li>
      <li>exactly what i expected</li>
      <li>Trust me, both Hot and Cold smell fantastic..</li>

    <li> Hadn&#x27;t ever smelled or seen this before, but I like it a lot!  It is actually sweeter than I thought it would be, for the name, &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; was a bit misleading to me, but I knew I liked another Benetton scent, and thought I would try this one out.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very affordable and she liked it. Said it smell fresh, not overly overpowering and a fine complement after a refreshing shower. I guess that will make it 4 Stars.</li>
    <li> The items seem to be old stocks..??! If I&#x27;ll be sending these items as gifts, they could say that these are imitations and/or old stocks already. How do we prevent these scenarios? Are these products really old stocks and/or original/brandnew?</li>

    <li> Grand daughters favorite perfume......&lt;br /&gt;I get her a bottle every Christmas....she was happy!!!!</li>
    <li> Great! Just what I expected to receive!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfum for about 12 years, and this one I just got doesn&#x27;t smell like the others. I&#x27;m really disappointed, and the worst part: It can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
    <li> I bought \\&quot;Hot\\&quot;&#x27;s counterpart \\&quot;Cold\\&quot; for myself and loved it so much and thought I&#x27;d try Hot as well since it is supposedly also unisex.  After a sniff I definately discovered while Cold might be unisex, Hot is very feminine.  Luckily I thought it smelled trendy enough that my sister would like it and she did!  I must admit it smells good, very rich and floral.  I love that it is so cheap and smells so expensive.  I always recommend testing a perfume before buying it (they smell differently on all skin types) but at this price I couldn&#x27;t resist and I won&#x27;t critique you if you don&#x27;t either.  Trust me, both Hot and Cold smell fantastic.. Hot is perhaps even better, but only for women.. Cold is great for either.</li>
