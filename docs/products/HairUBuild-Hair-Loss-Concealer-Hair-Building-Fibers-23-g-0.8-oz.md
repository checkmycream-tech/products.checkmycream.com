      <li>Good Product.</li>
      <li>Good luck to the rest of you.</li>
      <li>Great product, I am satisfied.</li>
      <li>My grandmother is enjoying this product.</li>
      <li>the fibers are more like powder and leave residue everywhere.</li>
      <li>I used Caboki and spray hair enhancer before but this stuff has more fibers and covers the area so easily.</li>
      <li>On top of that, even, when I take a shower I have to use shampoo to remove it, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t fall easy.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>It comes off too easily.</li>
      <li>Depending on how you apply it, you can have clumps of the fibers instead, and they can \\&quot;fall off\\&quot; easily.</li>
      <li>I wouldnt use this for a full on bald spot or on top of my head.</li>
      <li>Perfectly matched the natural shininess of my hair, and looked completely natural.</li>
      <li>Know how to apply properly and it&#x27;ll look great.</li>
      <li>Not only it is very reasonably priced, it also does a really great job of sticking to hair and scalp...</li>
      <li>First thing that&#x27;s good about it is that it lasts longer than others for a lesser price.</li>
      <li>I have gone back and re-ordered the original product that The product seems to be more like fuzz.</li>
      <li>Clumps less than Cabooki, better value, the bottle size makes it easier to get the most out of it.  </li>
      <li>Caboki is vastly superior, just not worth my time to return it</li>
      <li>Very very gooood,  </li>
      <li>Still pretty neat product.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Secondly, its okay as compared to Caboki, I feel it doesnt mix well with</li>
      <li>Personally, I prefer Xfusion, so this will be more of a backup.</li>
      <li>I do not have a full on bald spot so this product is great for creating the illusion of thicker hair where my edges are thin.</li>
      <li>QUICK, EASY,LOOKS NATURAL........</li>
      <li>They also complained it caused a pretty good itch.</li>
      <li>Competitive products in my part of the world are very costly...</li>
      <li>reasonable price compare to others.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast as well...</li>
      <li>And when i am saying longer its really longer.</li>
      <li>Also, they tend to clump to each other more than sticking on the hair.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it....</li>

<li> Takes practice, dont use it on wet hair and need to wash hair before next application.</li>
<li> This may or may not work for some people as despite your hair looking black, it may actually have a lighter shade than this.</li>
<li> the hairs and color was too dark.</li>
<li> When you sell a black color , you should understand that no one is carrying \\&quot;jet\\&quot; black color in world.</li>
<li> I bought this (black color) because the supplies and price for Xfusion has been fluctuating.</li>
<li> It should be little lighter than dark black.</li>
<li> It covers well the bald area without leaving a mess around, the fibers get well stocked in your hair.</li>
<li> it falls down everyday.</li>
<li> Caboki&#x27;s product sticks to hair, covers twice as well and doesn&#x27;t end up shedding all over the place like this, I literally had little fuzz balls all over my counter after using this and the little that sticks in your hair sheds off in hours.  </li>
<li> I am getting little acne too on my forehead</li>
<li> j just wasted my money</li>
<li> It&#x27;s fake only color that may make your face black aswell..</li>
<li> It balls up and really makes you look bad.</li>
<li> Sorry, it was not good for me because the powder got all over my cloths and left residue on my combs &amp; brushes.</li>
<li> That stuff is a joke, a real waste of money</li>
<li> This stuff clumps up, sticks in clumps, falls off all over the place and is generally a very bad idea.  </li>
<li> Worst quality, will never buy again</li>

    <li> I will never order again. I have gone back and re-ordered the original product that The product seems to be more like fuzz. It balls up and really makes you look bad. They also complained it caused a pretty good itch. Good luck to the rest of you.</li>
    <li> QUICK, EASY,LOOKS NATURAL........THAT SIMPLE</li>
    <li> My grandmother is enjoying this product. It does stick to your hands and nails when you run your fingers through your hair. Still pretty neat product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Know how to apply properly and it&#x27;ll look great. The price is perfect.</li>
    <li> I have tried Nanogen , Caboki as well. Cos this was cheaper than them so I thought of trying it. First thing that&#x27;s good about it is that it lasts longer than others for a lesser price. And when i am saying longer its really longer. My Nanogen or Caboki lasts about a month but this one lasted couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;Coming to the -ve points . I wish there was see through bottle like Caboki so that you can actually see how much is left. Secondly, its okay as compared to Caboki, I feel it doesnt mix well with the hairs and color was too dark. When you sell a black color , you should understand that no one is carrying \\&quot;jet\\&quot; black color in world.It should be little lighter than dark black. It comes off too easily. I am getting little acne too on my forehead cos it falls down everyday.</li>
    <li> Clumps less than Cabooki, better value, the bottle size makes it easier to get the most out of it.  Takes practice, dont use it on wet hair and need to wash hair before next application.</li>
    <li> I bought this (black color) because the supplies and price for Xfusion has been fluctuating. Unlike Xfusion, the fibers for HairUBuild is coarser. Also, they tend to clump to each other more than sticking on the hair. Depending on how you apply it, you can have clumps of the fibers instead, and they can \\&quot;fall off\\&quot; easily. The coarser fiber in turn creates a \\&quot;blacker\\&quot; color look. This may or may not work for some people as despite your hair looking black, it may actually have a lighter shade than this. Personally, I prefer Xfusion, so this will be more of a backup.</li>
    <li> Very very gooood,  loved this , i gonna buy more, my hair is very nice now!! Every one apruved this</li>
    <li> I used Caboki and spray hair enhancer before but this stuff has more fibers and covers the area so easily. reasonable price compare to others.</li>
    <li> The best hair concealer I have ever used. This product has achieved something I like. It covers well the bald area without leaving a mess around, the fibers get well stocked in your hair. On top of that, even, when I take a shower I have to use shampoo to remove it, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t fall easy. Great product, I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Good Product. Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Easy to use. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> paired with hairspray, it doesn&#x27;t run at all. Perfectly matched the natural shininess of my hair, and looked completely natural. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fake only color that may make your face black aswell..I didn&#x27;t use it j just wasted my money I</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. I do not have a full on bald spot so this product is great for creating the illusion of thicker hair where my edges are thin. I wouldnt use this for a full on bald spot or on top of my head.</li>
    <li> This stuff clumps up, sticks in clumps, falls off all over the place and is generally a very bad idea.  Caboki&#x27;s product sticks to hair, covers twice as well and doesn&#x27;t end up shedding all over the place like this, I literally had little fuzz balls all over my counter after using this and the little that sticks in your hair sheds off in hours.  If you want to save a couple bucks to have this goop all over your cloths and bathroom and make it obvious you&#x27;re using a concealer, be my guest but Caboki is vastly superior, just not worth my time to return it</li>
    <li> Works really good. Use hair spray along with it so that it sticks to your scalp instead of flying away when there is a wind. The only thing is that when someone gets close they can see tha i used something to cover up.</li>
    <li> Sorry, it was not good for me because the powder got all over my cloths and left residue on my combs &amp; brushes. My family members thought I painted my scalp. Products work different with everyone.</li>
    <li> Competitive products in my part of the world are very costly...I am so happy to have discovered HairUBuild.  Not only it is very reasonably priced, it also does a really great job of sticking to hair and scalp...I was happy to see that it matches my hair&#x27;s shininess perfectly.  I would highly recommend it....Shipping was fast as well...</li>
    <li> what you pay what you gets</li>
    <li> Worst quality, will never buy again</li>
    <li> That stuff is a joke, a real waste of money</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick to ones hair well</li>
    <li> the fibers are more like powder and leave residue everywhere. You would need hairspray to keep the fibers to stick to your hair. Someone actually dusted my collar and asked what it was, initially i was embarrassed and made up something. would never buy this again.</li>
