      <li>I absolute love this product...</li>
      <li>I felt like it just sat on top of my hair without really penetrating it to provide moisture.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>I recently did the &amp;#34;big chop&amp;#34; and I must say that this makes my curls &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; and gives my curls a nice shine and hold.</li>
      <li>, i can declare this to be my first staple product.</li>

      <li>This product brings out my natural curl pattern and keeps it soft.</li>

      <li>It left my hair soft, NO FLAKES-</li>

    <li> Love this product and great product service</li>

    <li> It works great on my curls.</li>
    <li> Absolute love the smell! Works great initially, in damp hair - but also to freshen up curls once dry.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 3year old. Less shrinkage than other products</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work...that bulls***  yo!</li>
    <li> Received. Great product A++++</li>
    <li> It smells great not heavy and it keeps my hair very moisturized</li>
    <li> Used product at salon before helps to keep the frizzes at bay.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Good product</li>
    <li> Like fragrance.  Did not assist with defining curl pattern as other products have.</li>
    <li> Controls curls without the crunchy feeling.  Leaves my hair soft and manageable</li>
    <li> This product did not do much for my hair. I felt like it just sat on top of my hair without really penetrating it to provide moisture. After an hour or two my curls looked somewhat limp. I have hair in the 3A/3B range. An acquaintance with type 4 hair loves this product. It may or may not work for you.</li>
    <li> I was searching all over for something that defined my coarse 4a hair and did not leave flakes or hardness. After using eco styler gel, my curls were defined but very hard. So i used cantu shea butter define and shine custard. That left my hair hard and FLAKYYYY! So I took a trip to family dollar to get an eco styler gel with less hold. When i went to two family dollars and did not find any luck with my search, i turned to the other products on the shelf. I took a leap of faith and spent $5 buying this product and after one use, i can declare this to be my first staple product. It left my hair soft, NO FLAKES-and i used a lot-, and my curls defined the whole day. A wash and go is all i do now. Please give it a try and i LOVE the smell too</li>
    <li> I absolute love this product...yeah Aunt Jackie</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product for my hair. I recently did the &amp;#34;big chop&amp;#34; and I must say that this makes my curls &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; and gives my curls a nice shine and hold.

    <li> I do not like this product. I have pretty thick and dry 4C hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this product on my head twice and I never liked the results. Left my hair hard and dry. Saw no definition.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had other friends who liked it but it doesn&#x27;t work for my texture.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be giving this away.</li>
