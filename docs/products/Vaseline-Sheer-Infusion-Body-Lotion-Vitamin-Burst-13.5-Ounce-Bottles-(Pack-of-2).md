      <li>This is an ok product, the maker needs to reduce the scent.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my arm and leg.</li>
      <li>As a companion to Vaseline&#x27;s Sheer Infusion Body Lotion Mineral Renewal Product (which replaces minerals lost during the washing process), , this is also a most excellent product.  </li>
      <li>I love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love body lotion.</li>
      <li>I simply love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>nothing overwhelming at all.  </li>
      <li>I enjoyed having smooth and silky skin that felt almost revitalized!  </li>
      <li>It is also fragrance free, so its scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, and doesn&#x27;t compete with my own perfume.</li>
      <li>I love it for myself and my daughter.</li>
      <li>Many people have it without even realizing it has a name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my skin feels much better after I put it on.</li>
      <li>Perhaps this was the STRATYS 3, suspended on my top layer of skin.  </li>
      <li>For me, it was just OK.</li>
      <li>This is a good lotion, I liked the way it absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on my hands.</li>
      <li>Hand lotions tend to annoy me because they feel great on the skin at first, then you realize that your hands are greasy and have to clean them before touching anything...</li>
      <li>It has a light, fresh, pleasant fragrance with notes of spice and citrus that lasts practically all day.   </li>
      <li>I found it to have a nice mild fragrance...</li>
      <li>However, the scent is mostly masked by the \\&quot;Vitamin Burst\\&quot; scent, and it&#x27;s not overly strong.  </li>
      <li>I am cautious about the feel and texture but most important of all - the residue test.</li>
      <li>Other than that, this is an excellent product and one I would recommend.</li>
      <li>The perfumey smell is rather strong.</li>
      <li>It was strong but I grew in to it.</li>
      <li>which was nice, because as I said the first thing I did was break the pump.  </li>
      <li>My opinion is that if you have tried a Vaseline intensive care lotion, you&#x27;ve tried this lotion, despite the claims on it&#x27;s huge marketing blitz.   </li>
      <li>It has a light fragrance which, to me, does not seem overpowering.  </li>
      <li>The Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion is light and non-greasy, but appears to penetrate through the top skin layers fairly weightlessly.</li>
      <li>There was also an anything but smooth, waxy feel to my arms and hands as well.  </li>
      <li>The bottle shape is comfortable, will not slip out of your hand.</li>
      <li>That being said, the lotion glides on smoothly and has a light feel.  </li>
      <li>The botanical scent is light</li>
      <li>Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula With Vitamin E Lotion Fragrance Free]].  </li>
      <li>have a lot of skin allergies, and my mother has asthma, so I&#x27;m always on the look out for lotions that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, feel smooth to the touch, and are scent-free.</li>
      <li>My face gets dry in the winter and though this is body lotion it&#x27;s worked great as a face lotion as well.</li>
      <li>In addition to the surprising sheerness, the scent is light, which I personally like because I can use it with any body wash or soap without worrying about matching or complementary scents.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
      <li>It has a smooth, light feeling when applied, and immediately is absorbed by the skin.  </li>
      <li>It is a great moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
      <li>However, once that was solved it has worked fine, and the lotion was definitely worth the wait.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent, in fact it smells quite clean.</li>
      <li>Applying the product is aesthetically pleasing, but there is a dearth of ingredients to make this product special.  </li>
      <li>Whereas many lotions (according to my wife) can make you feel greasy or oily , the Vaseline Sheer Infusion went on smoothly and when applied in the right amount provided a relaxing , warm feeling.</li>
      <li>Not bad yet nothing exemplary.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are many less costly moisturizing lotions (without paraben), that perform much better and are either unscented or more pleasantly scented, even other Vaseline lotions.  </li>
      <li>Well, first thing I noticed was the strong smell.</li>
      <li>Currently, the best I can come with that is baby lotion, and even that has a distinct scent, so when this Vaseline brand of \\&quot;Vitamin Burst\\&quot; was offered on Amazon Vine, I was excited to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, for me personally, I don&#x27;t like this lotion.</li>
      <li>Excellent and inexpensive daily moisturizer especially for those who use Vaseline   Intensive Care.  </li>
      <li>It blends into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, this product&#x27;s performance does not justify its high retail price in my opinion and did not impress me or live up to the commercial for what is supposed to be Vaseline&#x27;s newest and best lotion.  </li>
      <li>Vasoline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion is an outstanding product!</li>
      <li>Not too powerful.  </li>
      <li>Once it absorbed this went away.</li>
      <li>I really liked the Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Equally effective are [[ASIN:B001ECQ4OY Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion Total Moisture Conditioning Body Lotion with Vitamins E &amp; A]] and</li>
      <li>Overall this is a nice lotion, and it moisturizes well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling soft without any slimy residue often found with super lubricating</li>
      <li>only thing I don&#x27;t love is the perfumey smell, which tends to linger.  </li>
      <li>It does go on smooth though, no real icky greasy feel to it.</li>
      <li>and it make my leg soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Leaving my skin feeling moist and with a soft, light scent.</li>
      <li>ah, yeah, especially after a hot morning shower, and provides a nice scent to make you fit to join the public</li>
      <li>,it stay soft and smooth all day on my leg.</li>
      <li>I got this sheer infusion vitamin burst yesturday and love it to death.</li>
      <li>The first thing that happened was I picked up the bottle and the squirt pump broke off.</li>
      <li>When I went to use it again, however, something told me to shake the bottle thoroughly, and was really glad I did, because it was like using a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can use it more than once a day, but I really don&#x27;t like to use it on a larger area than my hands because then it does get overpowering.    </li>
      <li>The sleek, modern ombre bottle, the luxurious texture and universally appealing citrus fragrance, are an illusion; a set up, if you will, for Vaseline Sheer Infustion Body Lotion, Vitamin Burst.  </li>
      <li>Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion feels silky against your skin and is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I wish it was a slightly lighter scent, but it is quite nice and does fade after a bit.</li>
      <li>or I&#x27;ve seen advertised promising relief from that itchy-tight feeling that drives me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
      <li>It has a light fragrance which is not overpowering, but just enough.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I just mention it here in case someone wants to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>lotion works very well on her kp, but the scent annoys her.  </li>
      <li>So far I have tried 2 scents in the Sheer Illusion series, Vitamin Burst being my favorite of the 2.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The wife is trying out this Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion, Vitamin Burst:  I found the lotion very nice.  It was not greasy on the skin, but soaked right in and left the skin feeling soft, moist-looking, and supple.   It has a light, fresh, pleasant fragrance with notes of spice and citrus that lasts practically all day.   I chose this lotion because of the vitamin contents(vit.B5 &amp; vit.E), wondering if the Vitamin E that is purported to help damaged skin, helping with the healing process, would actually work. Is the jury still out on this concept?    I did notice that the lotion became sticky, almost waxy during the day - had to wash it off my palms before preparing meals.  Perhaps this was the STRATYS 3, suspended on my top layer of skin.  Overall, it is an acceptable moisturizing body lotion.  The bottle shape is comfortable, will not slip out of your hand.</li>
    <li> Great lotion! The only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because an unscented formula is (or was) not available. It&#x27;s not a bad scent, in fact it smells quite clean. It&#x27;s just that unscented lotion is my preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling soft without any slimy residue often found with super lubricating lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We signed up to have it delivered regularly with Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program (which means we are getting it tons cheaper than if we bought it at the grocery store).</li>
    <li> Excellent and inexpensive daily moisturizer especially for those who use Vaseline   Intensive Care.  Three recipes and odors are offered but I prefer the Vitamin Burst.  Maybe many other people do too because it is harder to find or often found at a higher price.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried easily 50 different types of lotions.  I have chronically dry hands year-round, and one of my 2 \\&quot;go to\\&quot; brands is Vaseline Total Moisture Conditioning.  When I saw this new Vaseline Sheer Illusion, I had to try it.  So far I have tried 2 scents in the Sheer Illusion series, Vitamin Burst being my favorite of the 2.    What struck me at first was how similar the scent of the Sheer Illusion lotion was to some Avon \\&quot;protecting\\&quot; lotion I got as a gift back in the early 1990s.  I&#x27;m convinced that the \\&quot;Stratys 3\\&quot; protection Vaseline uses is the same thing.  It&#x27;s not a pleasant scent, honestly, it reminds me a bit of glue.  However, the scent is mostly masked by the \\&quot;Vitamin Burst\\&quot; scent, and it&#x27;s not overly strong.  I can use it more than once a day, but I really don&#x27;t like to use it on a larger area than my hands because then it does get overpowering.    The protection is quite good.  With other brands I&#x27;m usually reapplying the lotion 3-4 times per day, but with Vaseline Sheer Illusion I can use it twice a day and get the same moisturizing effects.  It works well on hands, arms, and legs.  I tried it on my very dry feet and it wasn&#x27;t effective at all, but that&#x27;s usually the case with body lotions.</li>
    <li> The sleek, modern ombre bottle, the luxurious texture and universally appealing citrus fragrance, are an illusion; a set up, if you will, for Vaseline Sheer Infustion Body Lotion, Vitamin Burst.  It appears to be a high quality product, but its formulation and performance are pedestrian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump bottle dispenses a generous amount of product, which does an adequate job of moisturing arms and legs, but leaves a lingering stickiness on less exposed skin, such as the shoulders.  Applying the product is aesthetically pleasing, but there is a dearth of ingredients to make this product special.  A tiny bit of vitamin E and Panthenol do not measure up to well-formulated products like CeraVe or Olay Quench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Equally effective are [[ASIN:B001ECQ4OY Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion Total Moisture Conditioning Body Lotion with Vitamins E &amp; A]] and [[ASIN:B001G7R3QK Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula With Vitamin E Lotion Fragrance Free]].  They are also friendlier to your budget.</li>
    <li> I really liked the Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion.  I found it to have a nice mild fragrance...nothing overwhelming at all.  I like the feel. It was not greasey like some lotions can be.  I enjoyed having smooth and silky skin that felt almost revitalized!  Thanks for a great product!  This would make a great gift for someone!</li>
    <li> I am not a cream person, and figured if I didn&#x27;t end up liking it, I could give it to someone in my family. Well, first thing I noticed was the strong smell. I guess I have a sensitive nose or something because I couldn&#x27;t imagine slathering my body with smelly cream every day. It does go on smooth though, no real icky greasy feel to it. Other than that, well, it&#x27;s cream. For me personally, I am a big skeptic when it comes to all these &#x27;miracle&#x27; creams that are supposed to work wonders on your body. Plus, everyone&#x27;s body reacts differently to different things. For me, it was just OK. I probably will end up giving mine away though since I have only used it a total of 2 times.</li>
    <li> My young daughter suffers from keratosis pilaris (\\&quot;kp\\&quot;), also known as chicken skin.  It&#x27;s rough, bumpy skin on her arms.  Many people have it without even realizing it has a name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion works very well on her kp, but the scent annoys her.  (I am also not fond of the scent.)  If they made this in an unscented version, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion does not feel greasy at all.  It is easily absorbed by the skin and does a GREAT job moisturizing.  I love it for myself and my daughter.</li>
    <li> Hand lotions tend to annoy me because they feel great on the skin at first, then you realize that your hands are greasy and have to clean them before touching anything... then you wash your hands later and have to re-apply the lotion, or it just wears off after an hour or so, etc. The Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion is amazingly different, in that it lasts for many hours and also lasts through several hand washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m male, so I don&#x27;t like perfume smelling hand lotion, nor do I want to keep a bottle with me all day and apply it over and over. This lotion has a very pleasant smell without being flowery, perfumy, or feminine. But ladies, don&#x27;t worry - my wife loves it and has stolen my bottle away from me. I&#x27;m going to have to order more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With winter coming, and dry skin season upon us - order some now!</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion, I liked the way it absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on my hands. If you like a citrus fragrance, you&#x27;ll like this lotion. I don&#x27;t care for the scent, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Sheer Infusion body lotion is a pleasure to use.  It has a smooth, light feeling when applied, and immediately is absorbed by the skin.  It has a light fragrance which, to me, does not seem overpowering.  I cannot attest to the effectiveness of the vitamins B5 and E in the Vitamin Burst version but have used it daily for over 2 weeks and it seems to moisturize, soften, and hydrate the skin well.  I prefer it to other heavier skin lotions due to the quick absorption and non-greasy attribute.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great and has the right amount of moisture without being oily. It&#x27;s great for dry skin. And even though I usually prefer frangrance-free lotion, this lotion has a subtle citrus scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I would definitely recommend this lotion for anyone with dry skin or anyone who uses lotion in general. My face gets dry in the winter and though this is body lotion it&#x27;s worked great as a face lotion as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been one for cologne. It always seemed too - oh, I don&#x27;t know - James Bondish or something for my down to earth tastes. Baby powder is messy. Body lotion, however, like Vaseline Infusion Body Lotion, complements my needs and my tastes perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels sooooo good to rub this on . . . ah, yeah, especially after a hot morning shower, and provides a nice scent to make you fit to join the public parade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian W.

    <li> I got this sheer infusion vitamin burst yesturday and love it to death. I like how the lotion make my skin soft and silky, it also last all day. I can&#x27;t stop touching my arm and leg. I use it after I shave my leg and it make my leg soft and smooth. I like how it doesn&#x27;t cause my leg to have redness or bump,it stay soft and smooth all day on my leg. I have mineral but they are okay because it feel a little bit sticky. I recommed to everyone to use this product.</li>
    <li> I typically have normal to oily skin so generally use lotions only in the winter. This Vaseline Sheer lotion goes on light and feel surprisingly silky (very nice!). It blends into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. My only complaint is the fragrance. The perfumey smell is rather strong. I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll consider making an unscented version.</li>
    <li> My opinion is that if you have tried a Vaseline intensive care lotion, you&#x27;ve tried this lotion, despite the claims on it&#x27;s huge marketing blitz.   The botanical scent is light and I did not find it offensive.   Of course, there is no way for the average consumer to substantiate their claims that this lotion completely penetrates the dermis with greater effectiveness than any other lotion. That being said, the lotion glides on smoothly and has a light feel.  My skin does feel soft for several hours after the application. The price is on the high side for a Vaseline brand lotion and this did not impress me enough to pay full price in the future.</li>
    <li> This lotion doesn&#x27;t leave the skin as soft and moist as I usually get from my Jergens bottle at home. Not bad yet nothing exemplary.</li>
    <li> As a companion to Vaseline&#x27;s Sheer Infusion Body Lotion Mineral Renewal Product (which replaces minerals lost during the washing process), , this is also a most excellent product.  The vitamins provided in the lotion serves to nourish the skin.  Even though I&#x27;m a guy, both products work well with my skin!  I highly recommend it!  Five stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Buy both the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion, Vitamin Burst&lt;br /&gt;2. Vaseline&#x27;s Sheer Infusion Body Lotion Mineral Renewal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use them together - for the skin you came in!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion because it is lightweight and not greasy. It has a light fragrance which is not overpowering, but just enough. It is a great moisturizer for dry skin. The lotion goes on silky soft and moisturizes for some time. This is a great body lotion that nourishes the body and provides silky softness to the skin. I highly recommend Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion with Vitamin Burst.</li>
    <li> This is great lotion. It moisturizes well, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with that greasy residue that other lotions tend to provide.  My mom and I both use it, and it has helped our dry skin a lot this winter. I have very sensitive skin, and in the past, some lotions have caused even more irritation to my skin -- this one does not.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the perfumey smell, which tends to linger.  But I can overlook that, because the product works so well.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> The first thing that happened was I picked up the bottle and the squirt pump broke off. Not a huge issue as it may have just been cracked during shipping (?). The bottle is shaped nicely so that even if you have lotion on your hands it isn&#x27;t difficult to pick up and use. which was nice, because as I said the first thing I did was break the pump.  I&#x27;m not trying to say it isn&#x27;t a well made bottle (or pump) because as I said it may have been cracked in shipping. Overall this is a nice lotion, and it moisturizes well. The scent is pleasant and not overwelming. My only complaint is that it felt sticky. It took a few minutes to absorb and was much stickier on my skin during this time than most lotion I&#x27;m used to. Once it absorbed this went away. I&#x27;d buy this lotion and/or one of the vairations of it. It is a good product. the thing that saves it, for me, is that once it absorbs all of the sticky sensation does go away. Leaving my skin feeling moist and with a soft, light scent.</li>
    <li> Vasoline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion is an outstanding product! Daily use produces revitalized skin. Highly recommended! Order it NOW!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.  It gave superb, long-lasting moisture to my skin in one of the lightest lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have very dry skin and was really interested in the depths of moisture and lasting nature this product would provide. I was thrilled to find that it goes on extremely light, but the moisture lasted all day.  Usually the degree of moisture that this product provides is associated with heavy lotions or body butters that feel rather heavy on my skin.  In addition to the surprising sheerness, the scent is light, which I personally like because I can use it with any body wash or soap without worrying about matching or complementary scents.    I&#x27;m converted.  I will definitely use this product again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got pump bottles of moisturizer all around my house. In the kitchen, bathroom, near the recliner, on the shelf next to the couch... I am a frequent user of hand cream and body lotion and need to have it always within reach. Once the winter hits, that use becomes constant. I am a brand-switcher, and always try whatever is new or I&#x27;ve seen advertised promising relief from that itchy-tight feeling that drives me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion, Vitamin Burst is great. The effect is long-lasting, the fragrance is fruity and I can deal with it. I wish it was a slightly lighter scent, but it is quite nice and does fade after a bit. I&#x27;ve even pumped some of it into a tiny plastic bottle to keep in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guarantee it will start replacing the other brands I&#x27;ve been using! Because it is so long lasting, it will save me money in the long run. I would definitely recommend this lotion to friends and family!</li>
    <li> My wife has been selling Avon for 25 years , and her loyalty to that line usually provides resistence in trying other brands. This one however she found very appealing. Whereas many lotions (according to my wife) can make you feel greasy or oily , the Vaseline Sheer Infusion went on smoothly and when applied in the right amount provided a relaxing , warm feeling. I liked the aroma of it , and the fact that it stayed on her and did not rub off onto me !</li>
    <li> Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion feels silky against your skin and is easy to apply. No excess moisture to get rid of, no greasy feeling. I&#x27;m not sure it hydrates as well as the manufacturer claims but my skin feels much better after I put it on. The only drawback: it&#x27;s heavy scent. Other than that, this is an excellent product and one I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love body lotion.I tried this one because it looked like it would help with my dry skin. It just left my skin feeling very greasy. It didn&#x27;t help my skin at all</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, so am skeptical of most claims by moisturizers that they are effective. I purposely waited to use this product until after colder weather set in and central heat was turned on to really test its effectiveness -- that&#x27;s when dry skin starts to crack and peel. The Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion is light and non-greasy, but appears to penetrate through the top skin layers fairly weightlessly. It is also fragrance free, so its scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, and doesn&#x27;t compete with my own perfume. Most important, after two weeks of use, my skin definitely feels softer and less dry, which is nearly miraculous in my experience for a lightweight-feeling body lotion. I&#x27;m very impressed with the effectiveness of this product. My only real problem with the product was that it was quite difficult to get the pump mechanism to work. However, once that was solved it has worked fine, and the lotion was definitely worth the wait.</li>
    <li> When I first used this, like many reviewers, I also thought it smelled terrible, and the smell lingered for a LONG time. There was also an anything but smooth, waxy feel to my arms and hands as well.  When I went to use it again, however, something told me to shake the bottle thoroughly, and was really glad I did, because it was like using a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The terrible smell was replaced by an actually very pleasant one that I didn&#x27;t mind at all, and while there was still somewhat of a wax-like residue left on my skin, it was NOWHERE near as bad as the first time I used it without shaking the bottle thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this product&#x27;s performance does not justify its high retail price in my opinion and did not impress me or live up to the commercial for what is supposed to be Vaseline&#x27;s newest and best lotion.  I&#x27;m sure there are many less costly moisturizing lotions (without paraben), that perform much better and are either unscented or more pleasantly scented, even other Vaseline lotions.  But most of all, will not leave that strange, wax-like residue upon contact with your skin that I unfortunately just could not get past, whether you shake the bottle or not.  Sorry to say, no matter how much I wanted to like this product, I really could not see myself using it again and wound up giving it away.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Sheer Infusion Lotion / B0027CT5TG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of skin allergies, and my mother has asthma, so I&#x27;m always on the look out for lotions that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, feel smooth to the touch, and are scent-free. Currently, the best I can come with that is baby lotion, and even that has a distinct scent, so when this Vaseline brand of \\&quot;Vitamin Burst\\&quot; was offered on Amazon Vine, I was excited to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, for me personally, I don&#x27;t like this lotion. It has a REALLY strong, fake smell to it - it smells like fake &#x27;mango&#x27; scent or something similar that is supposed to smell exotic and just smells over-poweringly sweet instead. The scent is so strong that it fills the entire room, and it fights tooth and nail with any other scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I really dislike about this lotion is the sticky residue it leaves on my skin. Every time I&#x27;ve applied this lotion, I&#x27;ve eventually given in to the craving to head to the bathroom and wash it off. The residue on my skin, especially my hands, is palpably sticky, like my skin has a thin layer of mucus over it. I feel like I&#x27;ve given the lotion a fair chance, several applications over several days of varying humidity and weather, but I just can&#x27;t get different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to get on a \\&quot;green\\&quot; soap box, but I was disappointed to see that there&#x27;s not a  single ingredient in this lotion (outside of water) that isn&#x27;t a multi-syllabic chemically-sounding name - not even simple things like plant extracts (a bit of peppermint extract would be far superior to this fake &#x27;mango&#x27; scent, in my opinion). So I&#x27;m a bit disappointed because I thought Vaseline might start moving more towards natural ingredients, but since it wasn&#x27;t marketed as such, I didn&#x27;t hold it against them - I just mention it here in case someone wants to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this lotion didn&#x27;t work for me, but maybe it will for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Ana Mardoll</li>
    <li> This lotion was very smooth and had a nice scent.  Not too powerful.  I used it on my feet and hands.  By the fourth day, it had really worked wonders for my dry cracked hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure about the vitamins.  The product did not have a vitamins smell.  Overall, I would purchase the product again!</li>
    <li> I simply love this lotion.  It has a citrus smell which seems to be a pick me up in the mornings.  Non greasy too.  I&#x27;ve been using this over the Yes to Carrots body butter, which in my opinion is just as good, but because of the smell.</li>
    <li> Like any body lotion in the market, I am extremely careful before its use. I am cautious about the feel and texture but most important of all - the residue test. The regular Vaseline passes it and so does the Sheer Infusion Body Lotion. However, the strong after smell may not fit well with everyone. It was strong but I grew in to it. This is an ok product, the maker needs to reduce the scent.</li>
