    <li> This order is my first experience with this type of hair. I am so pleased with the texture and feel of this hair. It looks very natural . Its not bulky. I have been playing with it to see if it would shed easily and nothing unnatural has occurred. The value is awesome and i will order again upon availability.The delivery was phenomenal. The hair had an expected arrival of Nov. 25 - Dec. 1. I ordered it on Nov. 19 and it arrived on Nov. 21. I was concerned with getting it before the Thanksgiving Holiday and that is no longer an issue. I am going to ombre according to the instructions included on the back panel of packaging and give an update on the longevity of this product regarding texture, shedding, and overall look.&lt;br /&gt;To the Seller: Thanks for making my first experience with this product and your service a stellar one.</li>
    <li> Used dark and lovely hair dye, it dyed excellent. Bomb ass hair.</li>
    <li> The worst hair! Extremely thin!</li>
    <li> Perfect hair!! Love it</li>
    <li> The hair was great by it being so cheap,i even bleached the ends an it did&#x27;nt shed or dry out and when it got wet it got back wavey</li>
    <li> I used this hair to make a wig in Dec 2014 that I&#x27;m still using now (May 2015) I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of the hair - it&#x27;s in between BSS quality and top not virgin hair - which works for me because I can&#x27;t afford spending hundreds of dollars on hair at one time. It isn&#x27;t super shiny which is sometimes a good and bad thing. I like to add a little glosser to it occasionally just because sometimes the lack of shine makes the hair look dry/unhealthy. I don&#x27;t always treat it well, sometimes I leave it in the closet and under clothes and it gets roughed up, but some brushing and a little heat does the job to freshen it up. I&#x27;ve washed this hair at least 3 times and it&#x27;s still soft and manageable. It does shed a little bit but I haven&#x27;t had any problem with it. I did cut the hair from about back length to a bob  - mainly because as a student who uses a backpack I was annoyed with my hair constantly tangling from the friction. Even in a bob the hair closest to the nape still tangles a bit but takes no time to clear out. When it comes to coloring the hair I&#x27;ve only dyed it once - with a boxed burgundy dye. I didn&#x27;t bleach it first but it still took the color well enough and the ends didn&#x27;t get dry or ratty looking. When the hair was newer it didn&#x27;t hold curl very well but now that it&#x27;s been broken down a bit it holds curl a lot better. I didn&#x27;t use the little &amp;#34;closure&amp;#34; just because I needed a full lace closure not the little circle at the crown. I would recommend this to someone who intends to use it to make a wig and I plan on purchasing another pack so I can make me another wig that&#x27;ll be longer.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about ordering this hair, but then I said y not. And when I received the hair I fell in love one time. The texture is everything and most importantly it doesn&#x27;t shed much and tangle its tangle-free. I will be buying more of this hair. And for the price its negotiatiable. If you don&#x27;t want to spend lots of money then this is the perfect hair to get. And its worth the money</li>
    <li> Love my hair.  Want more of the same hair longer at an even better price thx you guys</li>
    <li> great hair no problems,will buy again</li>
    <li> This is so good hair, don&#x27;t shed at all!!! You can bleach it ...curl it....ect...very good quality! !!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my little sister...... she loved it it looked and felt great doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
    <li> This is is amazing for the price</li>
    <li> This hair was received promptly and looked the way it was advertised. I am pleased with this purchased and would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Hair is very soft and natural. My daughter is very excited because my wife will install it in for her we let her get a sew in at 16 my wife does hair so hopefully after the wash and condition it will be still in good shape to sew in. Will order longer next time also will see after her hair is done.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t worn it yet but seems to b of gud quality,I run my fingers through is so often and haven&#x27;t seen a single hair fall from it yet so so far so gud!</li>
    <li> If u wet this hair will it curl ?</li>
    <li> I assumed it was 14&amp;16 inch but it was really 12&amp;10 no biggy. But it wasn&#x27;t wavy after i washed &amp; dyed it. I had to continue to curl it plus it didnt keep a curl. But i washed it while it was installed, deep conditioned it for a hour &amp; got under a hooded dryer. Then flat ironed it &amp; it came out FABULOUS! So by this hair at your own leisure. I will be bying more in a longer size ONLY TO KEEP IT STRAIGHT.</li>
