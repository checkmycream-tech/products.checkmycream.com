      <li>One of the best products ever, makes hair super healthy and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>I have had both items quite awhile because you don&#x27;t use much of either product to do your hair, but it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
      <li>The Science of 10 conditioner and shampoos are the absolute best shampoo and conditioner I have found.  </li>
      <li>No frizzies in sight! :)</li>
      <li>Truthfully, this leaves your hair soft, silky and smelling incredible.</li>

      <li>I use living proof at 1/2 the cost with better results.</li>
      <li>I love it  </li>
      <li>A shampoo/conditioner liter duo set can save you even more, and often pop up on Amazon.</li>
      <li>all their products, the Ten line stood out as one of the best shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>This may not matter to many, however, if you have an allergy to Gluten</li>
      <li>,i can tell the difference this has made with their Hair leaves a nice Shine and corrects damage ,as in my other review about the Shampoo i have not used this yet because i am using a wonderful Vitamin Shampoo for the time being</li>
      <li>so so so delicious leaves my hair super soft</li>
      <li>If you have very long hair, this conditioner is the best.  </li>
      <li>So to have more and better hair and only have to purchase twice a year - this is a great conditioner.</li>
      <li>What can I say, it leaves your hair soft and manageable with a great fragrance.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner leaves hair shiny and smooth and having been using them for many years.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t squeeze it easily.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, which was thinning.  </li>
      <li>Alterna 10 is an absolute 11!!!</li>
      <li>I found nothing special about the results.</li>
      <li>i can&#x27;t say enough good about this</li>
      <li>With in the first use, i noticed a Huge change in both the feel and look of the quality of my hair.</li>
      <li>It is easy to manage, and the only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold color as well as it used to, but I will happily deal with that because at least I have a lot more hair to color!  </li>
      <li>GRanted, my hair is not back to the way it was, but I honestly don&#x27;t think that any product could help it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I am 47 years young and love this product.  </li>
      <li>I can smell my hair throughout the day and its fresh.  </li>
      <li>Did you know that Gluten is found in many different products that you use every day???</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner, since you only use it once a week, but makes your hair so shiny and managable.  </li>
      <li>maybe try finding one of these first.</li>
      <li>This is the only product that has ever been able to control my unruly/wirey hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s probably a worthwhile investment, and the larger salon sizes help keep the cost reasonable.</li>
      <li>but I only use it about once a week when I really want to feel great or just need a mental boost for the day.</li>
      <li>I have had a full head of gray hair since my early 20&#x27;s and have been dying it for years.</li>
      <li>my hair extra special and, boy, did I find it!</li>
      <li>Seriously, this stuff can hold its own against even the likes of the all mighty Pureology Nanoworks.</li>
      <li>it ends up being quite reasonable.  </li>
      <li>so yeah, ironic gift...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a spendy item, but considering how much time and money people tend to put into their hair</li>
      <li>I know that everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but this really works for me (fine but full short hair that&#x27;s professionally colored).</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>I tend to damage my hair just as a normal woman would  </li>
      <li>It has four times the product for about 25% more money than the 8 oz bottles, and brings the price down immensely, pretty much in line with other high-end brands.</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>(Hair goes an inch past my chin from the top)</li>
      <li>It is pricey but is worth every single penny</li>
      <li>A dime-size dot of the shampoo is MORE than enough for my medium-length guy&#x27;s hair, and just a half pump of the conditioner is sufficient.</li>
      <li>The bottle top was broken so it has to be dispensed by taking top off and slamming it down on your hand ..</li>
      <li>A nice scent, and very thick.  </li>
      <li>I receive comments on my hair all the time of how soft and shiny it is.  </li>
      <li>But even if it weren&#x27;t, after three months of use, my hair is much fuller and healthier than it was prior to this.  </li>
      <li>- there&#x27;s really no way to explain how much better this product is than other luxury</li>
      <li>It has so much more body than with previous shampoos and conditioners that I&#x27;m actually using fewer additional products to maintain my hair style, and am only washing it once or twice per week.</li>
      <li>Alterna is one of the very few companies who&#x27;s entire product line is Gluten Free!  </li>
      <li>I found the Ten line to not only cut down on tangles and friz, but it leaves my hair incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>This much can be a big commitment, but I&#x27;ve seen Alterna Ten sample packets...</li>
      <li>great product and the price isn&#x27;t that expensive considering how long a bottle will last.</li>
      <li>Hair comes out extra soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>My hair is freakishly soft after only a weeks use.</li>
      <li>No words to describe how frustrating it is to be in the shower and not be able to get it to come out of this design.  </li>
      <li>I will say I have shoulder length hair that has maybe up to 10 grey hairs and even those hairs are soft!  </li>
      <li>So, I was left with severely damaged hair (gets very kinky and coarse when wet).  </li>
      <li>I sometimes run out and will try some other high end product until my order of Alterna 10 arrives, and nothing ever even comes close to what this product  does for my hair.</li>

<li> I usually tend to purchase the bigger size</li>
<li> I purchased this product because I was in Europe a few months ago, and even though I had a converter for my Flat iron, there must have still been some sort of electrical problem because my flat iron got so hot that it badly burnt my hair and then melted.  </li>
<li> This conditioner is not worth the money.  </li>
<li> A small amount goes a very long way.</li>
<li> The container is small, but a little goes a long way, so it lasts quite a while.</li>
<li> I have long thick wavy hair.</li>
<li> I have used this product since January, and I just purchased my next bottle in late June, because you need very little of the product for it to work, so price-wise</li>
<li> Not sure why it didn&#x27;t work for others but for my hair --a miracle worker.</li>
<li> Hard plastic bottle.  </li>
<li> I have thick, curly hair that can become a bit unmanageable.</li>
<li> Poor design.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was doubting my purchase, because this conditioner is very expensive. I wanted something to make my hair extra special and, boy, did I find it! I did not even need a comb with this conditioner. I used the Science of 10 Shampoo, also. Hair comes out extra soft and shiny. No frizzies in sight! :)</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes your hair feel stronger and healthier. It felt softer and was shinier. I just wish I could still afford it - unfortunately it&#x27;s a bit expensive for me.</li>
    <li> The bottle top was broken so it has to be dispensed by taking top off and slamming it down on your hand .. Very annoying</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner, since you only use it once a week, but makes your hair so shiny and managable.  I wish the products weren&#x27;t so pricey!  I have had both items quite awhile because you don&#x27;t use much of either product to do your hair, but it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for years. I have had a full head of gray hair since my early 20&#x27;s and have been dying it for years. This is the only product that has ever been able to control my unruly/wirey hair. It&#x27;s also great for humidity. I sometimes run out and will try some other high end product until my order of Alterna 10 arrives, and nothing ever even comes close to what this product  does for my hair. It is smooth/shiney/and youthful. The only con is the cost. But if you can make the investment in the 33oz bottle, it will last you 6-7 months. It is pricey but is worth every single penny</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I was in Europe a few months ago, and even though I had a converter for my Flat iron, there must have still been some sort of electrical problem because my flat iron got so hot that it badly burnt my hair and then melted.  So, I was left with severely damaged hair (gets very kinky and coarse when wet).  I have been using this product for about a month and I think it is helping.  GRanted, my hair is not back to the way it was, but I honestly don&#x27;t think that any product could help it.  This is a very deep conditioner and i think with time, it will slowly help my hair get back to normal.  If you have damaged hair, this should help.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t but it unless you want to vet one addicted. I have long thick wavy hair. This shampoo AZ nd conditioner makes my hair feel like silk. Expensive but I only use it about once a week when I really want to feel great or just need a mental boost for the day.</li>
    <li> Bought for my Family works great with the Shampoo i can&#x27;t say enough good about this ,i can tell the difference this has made with their Hair leaves a nice Shine and corrects damage ,as in my other review about the Shampoo i have not used this yet because i am using a wonderful Vitamin Shampoo for the time being but i can see how Healthy their Hair looks .Worth the Price.</li>
    <li> When you get shampoo instead of the conditioner you ordered.  I hope the shampoo is good.  Good thing I was planning on getting it anyway. Hehe</li>
    <li> Just started using this, along with the 10 Shampoo, and my hair is amazing! It has so much more body than with previous shampoos and conditioners that I&#x27;m actually using fewer additional products to maintain my hair style, and am only washing it once or twice per week. I know that everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but this really works for me (fine but full short hair that&#x27;s professionally colored).</li>
    <li> Pros: One of the best products ever, makes hair super healthy and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Pricey, but larger sizes and the fact that a little goes a LONG way offsets this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair products are a little out of my area of expertise, but I was fortunate enough to have discovered Alterna a couple of years ago when a friend of mine received a case of all their products after doing some work with them. He&#x27;s bald...so yeah, ironic gift...but it worked out well for me, ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all their products, the Ten line stood out as one of the best shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. I have thick, curly hair that can become a bit unmanageable. I found the Ten line to not only cut down on tangles and friz, but it leaves my hair incredibly soft and smooth. I imagine that this is a dream product for women with shoulder-length or longer hair - there&#x27;s really no way to explain how much better this product is than other luxury shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con to Alterna Ten is the price. For value shoppers, you&#x27;ll want to check out the 33.8 oz / 1 liter size. It has four times the product for about 25% more money than the 8 oz bottles, and brings the price down immensely, pretty much in line with other high-end brands. A shampoo/conditioner liter duo set can save you even more, and often pop up on Amazon. This much can be a big commitment, but I&#x27;ve seen Alterna Ten sample packets...maybe try finding one of these first. Even one use shows how awesome this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Having mentioned that this is an expensive shampoo/conditioner, I also have to point out that it is very, very condensed. A dime-size dot of the shampoo is MORE than enough for my medium-length guy&#x27;s hair, and just a half pump of the conditioner is sufficient. My liter bottles therefore last me 18 months plus (no kidding), again massively offsetting the cost. I use about half as much Alterna Ten as Bumble &amp; Bumble or the other brands I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Alterna has created a heck of a product in their Ten line. It&#x27;s a spendy item, but considering how much time and money people tend to put into their hair it&#x27;s probably a worthwhile investment, and the larger salon sizes help keep the cost reasonable.</li>
    <li> the best conditioner period the end its the best simply amazing it smells so so so delicious leaves my hair super soft</li>
    <li> Great brand and product!  This conditioner leaves hair shiny and smooth and having been using them for many years.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Love this!  If you&#x27;re familiar with alterna products this is the best!  The top!  It&#x27;s worth the money.  I use this with the shampoo and just love it.  It does what it states.  After one use you can see and feel the difference.  I am 47 years young and love this product.  For me, I did use other products from the alterna line as well as others but this is what I go back too.  I love it  What can I say, it leaves your hair soft and manageable with a great fragrance.  I can smell my hair throughout the day and its fresh.  Yes it&#x27;s pricey but it works for my hair and will always be a devoted customer.  I usually tend to purchase the bigger size but this time I had to order the smaller size.  I will say I have shoulder length hair that has maybe up to 10 grey hairs and even those hairs are soft!  I tend to damage my hair just as a normal woman would  I receive comments on my hair all the time of how soft and shiny it is.  I hope alterna never stops ten product line.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is not worth the money.  I found nothing special about the results.I use living proof at 1/2 the cost with better results.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have been using for several years.  It does work best with fine, lifeless hair and gives shine and body.  Not sure why it didn&#x27;t work for others but for my hair --a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> Same as the shampoo.  No words to describe how frustrating it is to be in the shower and not be able to get it to come out of this design.  Poor design.  Hard plastic bottle.  Can&#x27;t squeeze it easily.</li>
    <li> WOW!  Did you know that Gluten is found in many different products that you use every day??? This may not matter to many, however, if you have an allergy to Gluten like I do, this information is of mega importance!  Alterna is one of the very few companies who&#x27;s entire product line is Gluten Free!  I started using their line and stopped using another line that contained gluten (unbeknownst to me) and guess what - My hair started growing like a weed!!!  Alterna 10 is an absolute 11!!!</li>
    <li> Iv used a lot of top tier luxury shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners, and this stuff just might be the best iv tried yet. Seriously, this stuff can hold its own against even the likes of the all mighty Pureology Nanoworks. With in the first use, i noticed a Huge change in both the feel and look of the quality of my hair. And its been a week now, this stuff along with the shampoo, its awesome!  I am a guy who actually cares about his personal appearance and hygiene and No i am not gay.  All kidding asides, this is very good conditioner and i would recommend it to any one regardless of hair type. My hair is freakishly soft after only a weeks use.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo product I&#x27;ve ever used. Truthfully, this leaves your hair soft, silky and smelling incredible. A small amount goes a very long way. I use a dime size amount and it fully lathers throughout my hair. (Hair goes an inch past my chin from the top) great product and the price isn&#x27;t that expensive considering how long a bottle will last. Everyone who showers at my house asks me where to get it. Literally everyone.</li>
    <li> If you have very long hair, this conditioner is the best.  A nice scent, and very thick.  The container is small, but a little goes a long way, so it lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> The Science of 10 conditioner and shampoos are the absolute best shampoo and conditioner I have found.  I have fine hair, which was thinning.  I have used this product since January, and I just purchased my next bottle in late June, because you need very little of the product for it to work, so price-wise it ends up being quite reasonable.  But even if it weren&#x27;t, after three months of use, my hair is much fuller and healthier than it was prior to this.  It is easy to manage, and the only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold color as well as it used to, but I will happily deal with that because at least I have a lot more hair to color!  So to have more and better hair and only have to purchase twice a year - this is a great conditioner.</li>
