      <li>So it is okay</li>
      <li>I did manage to kind of peel it off, but since you can&#x27;t put it on smooth, you can&#x27;t just lift off the mask like you can with some.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried most, if not all, of the Queen Helene face mask products and without a doubt, this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>The Queen Helene mask worked better than all the others for this purpose.</li>

      <li>She seemed to liked it and asked to purchase more since this original purchase.</li>
      <li>This is a nice peel mask and my skin does feel softer after using it, but it has a *very* strong alcohol smell when you first apply it</li>
      <li>Well, to solve the gooies is easy.  </li>
      <li>Easy on easy off .</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>easy to use.</li>

      <li>QH is known to be well priced and has many loyal users,,,i would &#x27;protest&#x27; if they raised it</li>
      <li>It protected my hairline perfectly and when little wisps of hair fell against my face, as they always seem to do when I dye, no problem.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, fantastic product.</li>
      <li>MIX some of this water into it,,,,,it will become just a smooth glossy</li>
      <li>a good old exfoliation couldn&#x27;t take care of...</li>
      <li>Did a good job and skin felt clear afterwards.</li>
      <li>I am in my early 20&#x27;s, fair skin, and combination type also if that helps.</li>
      <li>I love how clean, fresh, and glowy I look after using it.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily, dries quickly, and peels off leaving baby-soft skin underneath.</li>
      <li>Smells nice and leaves my face feeling very soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Normally with a face masque of any kind, you will see a remarkable instant \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; or \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; of your skin because</li>
      <li>Queen Helene original formula antioxidant grape seed extract peel did meet my expectations.</li>
      <li>I found you must warm the product between your hands to get it to spread evenly, so squeeze it out and warm it up with the friction of your palms, like you would any other product you put on your face or in your hair, and you will be fine.</li>
      <li>When I was a kid , me and my mom would apply this and my skin always felt so clean after each use,</li>
      <li>Please make sure you warm this product prior to applying.</li>
      <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh, and the satisfaction of peeling it off is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It is a true peeling mask and exfoliates/peels leaving my skin feeling super clean and invigorated.  </li>
      <li>You just want to rub your fingers across it again and again because it feels so cool.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s really because I enjoyed the peel-off process.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s goopy and sticky, but it&#x27;s not bad once you get used to it.  </li>
      <li>the result is not bad.</li>
      <li>the whole mask won&#x27;t pull off, just use a warm washcloth to gently wipe it away.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product \\&quot;Queen Helene Grape Seed Peel\\&quot; for years and love the way my skin is so soft and smooth after just the one use.</li>
      <li>It removes the top layer of old skin cells leaving a smooth surface.</li>
      <li>Very cheap compared to other peel-off products but very good in terme of cleaning the skin, especially oily skin like mine.</li>
      <li>What I like most about it is the way it peels off of the face, pretty much in one piece</li>
      <li>My face is so much more radiant and alive!</li>
      <li>I love peel-off masks for the way they pull off one more dry layer of skin after I exfoliate.</li>
      <li>The product was dried up in both containers and cannot be used.not happy with this at all.</li>
      <li>I am just using it on my dirtier spots instead of trying to smooth it over my whole face</li>
      <li>The process is fun though.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cleanse your skin well before using this, with warm water to open the pores.  </li>
      <li>Moisturizers work better when the old cells are removed.</li>
      <li>it dries evenly but worth the work.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling so nice and not red...</li>
      <li>near the end, helps to cut off top part of tube.</li>
      <li>It is also a lot of fun to peel off.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love peel-off masks for the way they pull off one more dry layer of skin after I exfoliate. I like pretty much all of them I&#x27;ve tried, but the coolest thing about this one is that, when it dries, (and that takes a pretty long time to get it fully dry), it has the weirdest smooth feeling.  You just want to rub your fingers across it again and again because it feels so cool. It really stays intact once dry and peels off all in one piece. Feels good, too.  I also stumbled across a second benefit to using it-- I hate it when I dye my hair and dye gets on my face or makes my hairline look irregular for a few days, which happens ev en though  I always use a barrier cream along my hairline to prevent this.  I guess some dye goes through the cream.  Last time I dyed, I used this mask as the barrier and let it start to dry before I applied the color. It protected my hairline perfectly and when little wisps of hair fell against my face, as they always seem to do when I dye, no problem. I just pulled the whole thing off and no problems!  The Queen Helene mask worked better than all the others for this purpose. I will never dye my hair without giving myself this facial mask treatment again!</li>
    <li> After a hot mineral bath, while my pores are open I use this product. I can literally see the impurities removed from my skin in this peel-off mask. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother at all. Thank you Amazon because it&#x27;s no longer stocked at my pharmacy!</li>
    <li> This product is as close to useless as it can get.  It&#x27;s a waste of money.  First of all, it falsely advertises as  it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;peel\\&quot; anything.  Normally with a face masque of any kind, you will see a remarkable instant \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; or \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; of your skin because it deep cleans.  This product is too thin to be of any benefit.  It does not deep clean and the slightest bit of perspiration will immediately start to dissolve it.  After one tube, I would never buy it again and I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product is too thick and impossible to smooth on evenly.  Some areas took hours to dry. It was a good price for the quantity of the product.</li>
    <li> This mask is great! When I was a kid , me and my mom would apply this and my skin always felt so clean after each use,</li>
    <li> It is a good item. But you have to close you eyes for a few minutes if you don&#x27;t want to cry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter. She seemed to liked it and asked to purchase more since this original purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used this product \\&quot;Queen Helene Grape Seed Peel\\&quot; for years and love the way my skin is so soft and smooth after just the one use. I have combination skin and would recommend to anyone with oily or dry skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product as well as \\&quot;The Original Mint Julep Masque\\&quot; by the same manufacturer. Very cheap compared to other peel-off products but very good in terme of cleaning the skin, especially oily skin like mine. I find it helpful in pimple prevention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how long I have been using this product. A few years, at least... Usually I can tell the difference in my skin next day. I had tried more expensive peel-off masques, but this one is better. Some other products made my skin dry, but this one did not.</li>
    <li> So I have used this product before a few years ago so I have something to compare with. I really do think that the one I got was expired or close to it. As it does not have a date on it its really hard to tell, but the mask was thicker then it should be when coming out. After applying it to my face it doesn&#x27;t dry well everywhere which is the problem I was having when I had mine for a very long time. I have tried applying liberal amounts to thin coatings and still it doesn&#x27;t try well. Last time I used it, it was horrible I barely got the stuff off because it wouldn&#x27;t dry. I will try to order again maybe I just got a bad one and if its better will happily change my review.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot! It does have a thicker consistency than I had imagined, but I have only ever used cucumber peels and they may just be thinner. I found you must warm the product between your hands to get it to spread evenly, so squeeze it out and warm it up with the friction of your palms, like you would any other product you put on your face or in your hair, and you will be fine. It does work and it did not leave any residue behind. It took about ten minutes to dry and I felt the layer I used was thick, also I found the grape scent pleasing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years.  And I don&#x27;t usually follow the directions; I keep it on longer than the directions require; my skin glows! and feels tighter and healthy.... I follow up with [ASIN:B00396VE7U Revision Intellishade SPF 45]]tinted moisturizer which I use daily.  I use the Grape Seed Extract mask one to 2x&#x27;s a week and am often complimented on how great my skin looks.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product years ago and I love what it did for my skin. Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere so I got it from Amazon. Used product and it doesn&#x27;t pull the blackheads out as I remember.</li>
    <li> This peel off mask has a very strong chemical / alcoholly smell that is off-putting. I feel like I must be putting on toxic chemicals on my face every time I use it. Though interestingly ..... the result is not bad. My skin looks &#x27;improved&#x27; after using it. Unfortunately all the chemical names on the ingredients and the smell are not acceptable.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Been using for years. Leaves your face looking years younger. Easy on easy off . Very refreshing! A professional result without the cost. No disappointment here.</li>
    <li> It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh, and the satisfaction of peeling it off is fantastic. Definitely gets the surface gunk, though I&#x27;m skeptical of anything that claims to deep clean pores. One can use this once or twice a week without adverse affects.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried most, if not all, of the Queen Helene face mask products and without a doubt, this one is my favorite. It&#x27;s a bit sticky/goopy so application isn&#x27;t as easy as with the other masks, but the end result is worth it. The mask peeled off my face in just about one piece and immediately I noticed my skin felt tighter, my pores looked smaller and my face felt fresh. Only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the semi-difficult application and the strong fumes that irritated my eyes for a minute or two during/after application. Otherwise, fantastic product.</li>
    <li> This is extremely thick and it&#x27;s hard to squeeze out, and you only get a little at a time, and then it&#x27;s hard to spread on your face...I did manage to kind of peel it off, but since you can&#x27;t put it on smooth, you can&#x27;t just lift off the mask like you can with some.  So it is okay but not sure I&#x27;d recommend it.  I am just using it on my dirtier spots instead of trying to smooth it over my whole face---too much work.  I know there are other better peel off masks.  The Helene clay masks are good and I&#x27;ve always been happy with those but I didn&#x27;t want to have to wash off all the product, so am looking for a peel mask.</li>
    <li> The product was dried up in both containers and cannot be used.not happy with this at all. Would like replaced</li>
    <li> My skin feeling unbelievably soft after using this peal off mask.  It is also a lot of fun to peel off.</li>
    <li> great&lt;br /&gt;place to shop got card fast and not bent or dind mint i will come back when i need more cards but took almoat one month</li>
    <li> fast shipping, item was as described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved peel-off masques. That&#x27;s really because I enjoyed the peel-off process. However, I considered them ineffective because the only thing they&#x27;d get rid of are my baby hairs at the front, nothing more. But this is one masque that does the trick! I constantly looking forward to applying it and seeing the difference it makes it closing my pores and getting rid of my acne. My face is so much more radiant and alive! This is definitely a product I&#x27;m sticking to.</li>
    <li> Dry into one piece that peels of easily. Works well, would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;When near the end, helps to cut off top part of tube.</li>
    <li> very good product. good results.  easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love cleaning my face with this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much. The process is fun though.</li>
    <li> I love to use this product. I like that it&#x27;s thick when I put it on so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it dripping off my face while it dries. After use my face is visibly smoother and my pores are smaller.</li>
    <li> Great mask, I can tell a difference in my skin after using it. Peel off masks make it so much easier and mess free so I&#x27;m thinking about sticking to them instead of any other masks. My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t help with pimples like the Mint Julep mask does under this brand.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good. I actually purchased it based on a review I read on Amazon and must say the review was right on point. What I like most about it is the way it peels off of the face, pretty much in one piece and sometimes you can see the particles it&#x27;s lifting from your skin. Very pleased and plan to order more. I&#x27;ve been looking for a great peel off mask for a long time and this definitely get&#x27;s the job done for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  Makes your skin so soft after peeling off the dead cells.  A little difficult to apply.  It&#x27;s lumpy and needs to be smoothed  on so it dries evenly but worth the work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the people at St. Helene was thinking with this one. To me it&#x27;s too similar to glue. And the ingredients don&#x27;t say facial health to me either. The scent is pleasant though. But it is too reminiscent of  peeling glue off your hands after a craft project.  Results are nothing a good old exfoliation couldn&#x27;t take care of... Tossed it out, but will still be trying more peel off masks.</li>
    <li> 5/4/15 Got one with new label and re-formalization- I hope it still works the same.  Used to make my skin feel really smooth and soft afterwards. I will edit and remove the 5 stars if it does not anymore.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Used something similar 30 years ago and could never locate it in the store. Goes on easily, dries quickly, and peels off leaving baby-soft skin underneath.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a typical peel off mask.  Smells nice and leaves my face feeling very soft and smooth.  It&#x27;s a nice part of a weekend (or when I can find time) pampering ritual.</li>
    <li> Always one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> I use this as an alternate to my other masks.  Has a nice &amp;#34;astringent&amp;#34; feel when first applied. Great results.</li>
    <li> I love this product. it is inexpensive and does the job! I keep this on hand all the time!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It does get grime out of pores, though definitely not as well as actual pore strips. You can see the dirt and dead skin after pulling it off. It has a pleasant smell and it doesn&#x27;t sting. I use it about once a week on problem areas (around nose and on chin). Queen Helene products are usually great!</li>
    <li> I couldnt find a peel off face mask in dept. stores unless it was just a one time application.  I looked everywhere. I finally found this on Amazon and it was reasonably priced so I tried it and I love it.  My face feels so soft when I pull the mask off and it will come off in one big piece if you want it to. They make my face feel so fresh.  I dont get this sensation with masks that you just wipe off with a washcloth. I will buy more of this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skin care FANATIC,,,and it shows, people tell me.  This is a must have, an amazing product,,,like an old friend :)  Well, to solve the gooies is easy.  just squeeze some masque into your left hand, take a little water (tap or bottled, depending on your preference)  MIX some of this water into it,,,,,it will become just a smooth glossy application,,,then u can either apply a thinner application, (quick, maybe just for your nose  :)  OR,,,put on a thin layer nad another thin layer until u build up a nice amount....RELAX,,,,,,and feel ur face come back to life,,,,(in other words)  just add a little water to it,,,  ok,,,,,used to be $2. or $3.  at the Dollar Store, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore,,,,now it&#x27;s rising in price, I hope they don&#x27;t bring it any higher....QH is known to be well priced and has many loyal users,,,i would &#x27;protest&#x27; if they raised it more,,,,,then I would explore others....QH  , don&#x27;t play with the price to much,,,,people in their 50&#x27;s have used this s ince theey were kids we don&#x27;t like that it just disappeared off the market shelf.</li>
    <li> This is a nice peel mask and my skin does feel softer after using it, but it has a *very* strong alcohol smell when you first apply it and I probably would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I originally was looking for a thicker type of peel off masque, but when I got it, it&#x27;s a very clear, thin, material, and has a chemical smell. It goes on slick and takes time to dry, then peels off like (you know when you were a kid and you put the elmer&#x27;s white glue on your hand and it dried and you peeled it off like a layer of dead skin). YES, like that. Didnt do much for my skin&#x27;s overall quality either. I am in my early 20&#x27;s, fair skin, and combination type also if that helps. I recommend the Queen Helene&#x27;s mint julepe which is great. Not so much this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt; It is thick but works well. I first started using it when I went off birth control and my hormones went crazy. I started getting cystic (underground) primples as well as regular acne. With the cystic acne I used this product 2-3 times a day and it helped so much! I use it as a spot treatment also. When I am about a week away from my period I breakout. I take this out and use it a couple days. It makes my face feel and look much better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually on here buying more:)&lt;br /&gt;PS&gt; I am 29 with pale sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Not great...just okey..I didnt feel like it did a very good job of working my face muscles while peeling off!</li>
    <li> Made my face break out!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. It makes your skin so soft and look amazing, my daughters are hooked now too!</li>
    <li> Really good face mask. Sometimes you&#x27;ll have to leave it on for longer for it to dry and it goes on thicker in some places because it&#x27;s a little hoppy and difficult to spread. I would def recommend though, my skin felt a lot smoother after</li>
    <li> I still did not try the product but heard good reviews and looking forward to see if the reviews are true</li>
    <li> Great product.  Easy to use. Good company. It removes the top layer of old skin cells leaving a smooth surface. Moisturizers work better when the old cells are removed.</li>
    <li> it was a bit dried out</li>
    <li> I would not expect this product to solve any ongoing problems for you (i.e. acne, pores, blackheads), but it IS a great mask. I have sensitive skin that is acne prone, and I try to use this once/week to rejuvenate my skin.  I love how clean, fresh, and glowy I look after using it. In fact, I have taken to using it for special nights out and such because my skin looks a little brighter and feels much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice - wear a headband/pony tail when putting this on, or those little hairs that sweep around your face will end up stuck to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse your skin well before using this, with warm water to open the pores.  Blot your skin dry and apply a thin layer to your face. Yes, it&#x27;s goopy and sticky, but it&#x27;s not bad once you get used to it.  I usually put a grape-sized spot right in the middle of my cheek, then use my fingers to spread it around.  I apply only with my right hand so that I don&#x27;t end up with TWO sticky hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave it on for at least 10 minutes; a few minutes longer if it still feels damp in spots. At the end of my time, I get a few fingertips barely damp, then rub them near my temples to loosen up the mask enough for me to pull off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the whole mask won&#x27;t pull off, just use a warm washcloth to gently wipe it away.  Moisturize after!</li>
    <li> The feeling is very gooey, not like a traditional mask. I&#x27;ve never really gotten used to this feeling after trying the product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Queen Helene products. They work really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I remember when I was younger trying an apricot peel off masque my older sister use to use i think my saint ives? Anywho I decided to try this grape seed one.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it 2 times, not counting the small initial tester.&lt;br /&gt;The masque is quite thick and sticky and the smell is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;But i applied it to my clean face and waited about 7 minutes and some areas were dry and other not at all. So I had to peel it off section by section. I think I may be missing something when it comes to putting this on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I did the same thing but waited about 11-12 minutes. This time it started burning!!! It wasn&#x27;t a burning sensation I couldn&#x27;t handle, so I waited for it to complete drying and then peeled it off. My skin felt like it was oil-moisturized afterward. Since I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times I can&#x27;t speak for the results but this is my initial reaction.</li>
    <li> Firms up nicely and leaves skin very smooth.  It peels off easily-but you do need to lay it on thick.</li>
    <li> Please make sure you warm this product prior to applying. It is very sticky and goes on better when it is warm. Apply only a thin layer, the thicker the layer makes it more difficult to dry and peel off. It does not seem bad, and it does get a little warm but bearable. Would buy again</li>
    <li> This is a really nice peel-off mask that I&#x27;ve used for years.  It&#x27;s getting harder to find and sells out quickly at the local drug store so I&#x27;m happy to have found here on Amazon.  It is a true peeling mask and exfoliates/peels leaving my skin feeling super clean and invigorated.  The Queen Helene Mud mask is great too.  I use both a couple times a week and I&#x27;m always pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while and I love the way my skin feels after using it. It isn&#x27;t smelly and only takes about ten minutes.</li>
    <li> Honestly I do not think this product does any thing to the skin. I used to have a peel off mask before but I could feel the change my skin but this brand is not like that one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years and find it&#x27;s a great product for such a low cost.</li>
    <li> This was easy to apply and smelled nice. The thing I wanted to share is that it did not irritate my skin at all. I have extremely sensitive skin. I have to be careful what type of soap or anything else I put on my skin. I put a small amount of the product on and it seemed fine, so I applied it as directed over my face, with no ill affects.</li>
    <li> Just like I remembered.  Too bad I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  It leaves my skin feeling so nice and not red...</li>
    <li> Queen Helene original formula antioxidant grape seed extract peel did meet my expectations. Great products fast shipping. I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Did a good job and skin felt clear afterwards.</li>
    <li> Very good for a peel off mask. left my skin feeling soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Weak mask not a good peel strength compared to freeman</li>
</ol>
