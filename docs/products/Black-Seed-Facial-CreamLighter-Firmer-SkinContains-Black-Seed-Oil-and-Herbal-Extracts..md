      <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this good since I was in high school - my face &amp;amp; neck feel so smooth now &amp;amp; I can see a noticable difference in my throat, the akin is actually tightening up &amp;amp; what&#x27;s even better, others have noticed too!  </li>
      <li>Black seed is an incredible product.</li>

      <li>Its not exactly bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cream does not lighten the skin what so ever.  However, it does feel good and makes a good moisturizer at night before going to bed.</li>
    <li> smells good, kind of greasy, use lightly.</li>
    <li> I will never use this again. I used on lower face &amp; neck and a week later my skin started burning. I immediately stop &amp; noticed a bad red rash around my mouth &amp; chin. Bought some hydrocortisone cream and it cleared my skin. I will never use again.</li>
    <li> The feel of this cream on your skin is almost too good to  believe.  The way my skin feels and looks after applying this is totally great.  I am already looking forward to using this product for years to come.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My biggest concern is that this product does not show the ingredients on the jar. So, I found the box. It contains cetearyl alcohol which some sites say is toxic and others say is non-toxic. It also contains other things I am not familiar with but that does NOT mean it is not natural or good for me. Fragrance is the last ingredient. I should have reviewed the ingredients more carefully as I really wanted something with medicinal qualities. My bad...</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife. She&#x27;s been using it for a little over a week now and she notice her skin tone more even, less blemishes, whiter face and younger looking skin!</li>
    <li> Did not realize additives</li>
    <li> This is a new product for me, but I like it overall.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great makes my face soft</li>
    <li> Too fragrant, I hardly use it maybe use it went the winter comes, since I have combination skin,I don&#x27;t see what benefit one could reap from this product, moisturization  only use for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a couple of weeks now as a nighttime moisturizer for my combination skin:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It is rich, more like a cream mask, absorbs well, and does not irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It has a strong scent when you open the box. (I would even say a horrible scent) Give it a chance though. Once absorbed in your skin it smells pretty good. I am the kind of person who cannot be around flowery and strong scents, but I definitely like the way my skin smells after applying this cream.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. The smell smells great in my opinion. I have noticed that my skin really glows since I have been using this cream. Thankful.</li>
    <li> Ordered the product a few months ago.  Used it daily and my skin was well moisturized.  I ordered it because of it&#x27;s natural properties that heal eczema.  Did not clear it up, but my skin did feel good.</li>
    <li> I had not ever heard of this, but do use the Black seed in food.  I did not fine this to be of any real benefit to me.  A little too &#x27;heavy&#x27; for my sensitive skin and brought about blemishes.  The product itself is fine quality for use by others, I&#x27;m sure.  The delivery of the item was most acceptable.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I do not like how it smells.. Smells like something old like my grandma&#x27;s makeup. I am asian and have a very light beige skin tone.  I stayed under the sun with sunblock and I got darker.  My face got darker than the rest of my body.  I do not know if this product  is to blame but i had a hat on and my arms and legs which were pretty exposed did not get too dark. I&#x27;d give it a couple more days and see how it works..IF my husband doesn&#x27;t complain about the smell.</li>
    <li> I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT I RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT, IT WAS WELL WORTH THE ORDER AND THE CONDITION WAS EVERY THING I EXPECTED</li>
    <li> Works very well for me</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing nice scent, saw no fading though</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I have been using it for a couple of months now and love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was for lightening skin...so I only used it a few times! maybe I will try again later</li>
    <li> I LOVED the perfume in the product as far as the smell.  And it does fade quickly for those that don&#x27;t like the smell.  But I wasn&#x27;t buying perfume and I&#x27;m not a fan of putting perfume on my face.  And since I learned that perfumed products don&#x27;t have to list the ingredients I&#x27;m steering away from fragranced products altogether whenever I can.  I just jumped on this because of the black seed oil ingredient and the good price.  But I will use it as a hand cream until it is gone and not purchase it again.  I just went through a month of looking for products with favorite ingredients when I should have just bought the extracts and added them to products I already have. duh.</li>
    <li> I have not experienced anything different yet.Still using it.</li>
    <li> I did not like the product</li>
    <li> This facial cream is inexpensive, yet makes my skin smooth and soft. I use it day and night. If you are looking for an inexpensive cream that moisturizes, try this cream.</li>
    <li> One of the best facial cream I have ever used.  After just three weeks of use, by skin is firmer, a tad bit lighter with even skin tone.  Makes my skin smooth as well.  I&#x27;ll be happy to recommend to others, just not sharing my jar.</li>
    <li> I added a tsp. of black seed oil to the jar and stirred well which made it much better than just okay/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a busy mother and I don&#x27;t have time for small talk. This product is lovely. I didn&#x27;t realize that by volunteering to leave feedback, I would be required to write a specific number of words.</li>
    <li> I need a little more moisture. But I am sure it is healthy and will suit many</li>
    <li> I see alcohol, stearates and parabens, no thanks. But thanks for the ingredient list!  I won&#x27;t be trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> awesome face cream, silky, not greasy, make skin feel very nice and lighten dark spots.  I buy it over and over again. The price is awesome too.</li>
    <li> So far so good....Although my skin is tighter, I still have some discoloration but I assume it will be done by the end of my use.</li>
    <li> This cream is moisturinzing and has an off smell. Its not exactly bad but it does have a distinctive smell. The one thing that does make me not recommend this is that when I use this cream on  my face, it stings my face. It does not do that on any other part of my body, and I do not have sensitive skin on my face. I only use this on my feet and elbows now until I use it up.</li>
    <li> I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS PRODUCT AND BLACK SEED.  I ORDERED IT AFTER READING THE REVIEWS AS MY THROAT SKIN HAS BEEN SAGGING, EVIDENT FROM PHOTOS.  I HAVE FOUND IT TO BE CREAMY, TIGHTENS SAGGING SKIN RESULTING FROM MY OLD AGE AND CAN RECOMMEND IT ESPECIALLY TO OLDER LADIES LIKE ME.  PRICE IS REASONABLE TO GET SUCH RESULTS, A GOOD DEAL.</li>
    <li> Wonderfuuuuuuuuuuuul product! That&#x27;s true moisturize my skin/face and reasonable price to. Hope you always have this product in your list.</li>
    <li> Love the blk seed cream, it is not oily. Goes on smooth, makes skin feel soft. Helps complexion,dark spots.</li>
    <li> It really works it make my skin smoother,lighter and firmer.</li>
    <li> I have not been on this cream long enough to really see any difference.  I do like how it feels onmy skin.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this cream. It is very moisturizing, not greasy or oily. It also has a fragrance, so be aware.  I am disappointed that the ingredients are not listed on the container or the box.</li>
    <li> I have read about Black Cumin Seed and realized that adding this to my regime couldn&#x27;t possibly hurt. My regime is fairly simple, wash dry, and go, add some moisturizer when needed. No I&#x27;m not an all day in front of the mirror kind of girl, actually really a plain simple female when it comes to cosmetics. As Joe Friday from &#x27;Dragnet&#x27; would say, &amp;#34;Just the facts, ma&#x27;am&amp;#34;. It does have an odor, certainly not unpleasant, but a fragrance, and I would prefer less odor if possible.. It is a fine moisturizer especially now that the colder weather has arrived.</li>
    <li> the fragrance was just to over bearing could not use the cream it made me  very sick and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I broke out.  Wasted my money.  I will not be re-buying this again. I had high hopes on this product. Oh well, too bad.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin and I love the scent. I love the natural ingredients. I can&#x27;t say my wrinkles have gone away but it makes my skin look healthy. I will use this again over other products.</li>
    <li> Goes into your face with out greasy feeling. Makes my face feel softer and firmer. It does have a bit of an &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reading lots about Black Cumin seed, so I thought I would try this cream. I love it. It feels healthy on my face and hands. It smooths the wrinkles and does what it says, firms the skin. It has a very light fragrance that smells so good.</li>
    <li> I read that the smell was bad, but it is worst than I thought it could be. So strong and unhealthy that I had a headache in 30 min and turned into \\&quot;bitch\\&quot; mode due to the effect of the toxic smell, it raises your  blood pressure these kinda of \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;, so toxic to the brain etc.&lt;br /&gt;The creame also burned my skin in a bad way and after an hour of feeling bad I washed my face so I could get back to normal...&lt;br /&gt;Guess I will put it out in the communal area for someone else to try, although feel guilty doing that as it is so toxic!!</li>
    <li> The smell makes me want to throw up and it made my skin break out.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. I really hope it works .i will updat later. If it does this has moved to my must have list.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product  as it helped to remove all the black spots I have on my face. It is much better than using the oil because it is cream base and not greasy. I will recommend to anyone with acne or black spots on face.</li>
    <li> I ordered before and notice the difference.  Great product  Black seed is an incredible product. See my blog</li>
    <li> My face and hand feel very soft and smooth, it is lightening my skin I am particularly seeing the most results below my eyes, the dark area there seem much lighter almost gone... will update review after I&#x27;ve finished the bottle...</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this facial cream on my very-sensitive skin. Excellent product! I&#x27;ve purchased it twice, and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Been using it everyday since I purchased it weeks ago and don&#x27;t see any results yet.  I will give it more time.</li>
    <li> I like this product, my dark spots seem to be going away and my face is so soft and firm.</li>
    <li> Nice product, I don&#x27;t really like the scent, but the lotion absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel smooth and firm. The scent doesn&#x27;t hang around either, as soon as I&#x27;ve rubbed it in I no longer smell it. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product irritated my skin. From the first use, it caused a little pimple-like rash. I do not recommend using this for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Use it daily! Keep my skin clear and soft</li>
    <li> Really waste my time ordering this crap i wanted the cream not no pack of soap</li>
    <li> This product works well !I feel it is worth every penny.My skin seems softer and smoother since I&#x27;ve been using this cream.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. Not greasy. It&#x27;s my favorite cream and I&#x27;ve tried them all</li>
    <li> Been using for two weeks or more now and it has not done anything. The smell is horrible and the product is not natural like it says. It has Parben in it that is not good for your skin. And my black spots are the same color..black!</li>
    <li> Love it!! It was really great using this product! I will purchase again! Everything black seed I use! great product!</li>
    <li> Since I got I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning and evening, so far I didn&#x27;t notice skin tone change at all.</li>
    <li> like it, but would like it fragrance free</li>
    <li> This facial moisturizing creme is AWESOME! I have dry skin and it completely moisturizers my face. Also suffer from seasonal allergies and often have skin reactions. I read that black seed oil helps to stave off those kinds of reactions ... Made a believer out of me because  I tried other products after I ran out of the first jar, but my life just wasn&#x27;t the same without it. Totally worth my purchase and Amazon thankfully offers this brand which is much less than other places to find it.</li>
    <li> I love the texture. It goes on well but I noticed it causes a rash on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it for awhile and then tried it again. Still the same results.&lt;br /&gt;My opinion is; it has too much fragrance in it.&lt;br /&gt;Sure thought this was my \\&quot;hope in a jar\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I actually prefer the oil and have used it on my hands and a dab on my face is it feels dry.</li>
    <li> love it!!! has helped cleared my marks on face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I&#x27;ve read much about the benefits of black seed oil, and I am a great follower of alternative treatments and medication.  This facial cream leaves the face feeling a little tacky, but just a little, it has a pleasant fragrance and I like the results.  So, all in all, a solid purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have psoriasis and was told that black seed oil is great for helping with the psoriasis so I bought this.  I cannot say that it helps my psoriasis but I definitely feel the firming properties to the cream.  Not so much the lightening.  I would still recommend it.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m sure many people are wondering, here are the ingredients as listed on the box: Aqua, Shea butter, cetearyl alcohol, Vitamin E, Nigella Sativa (Black Seed) Oil, Glyceryl stearate, White oil, Glycerin, Propylparaben, Sodium Benzoate, Aloe vera, steareth-20, Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not as overwhelming as I was afraid it would be based on reviews.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet though, so we will see.  I&#x27;m a little concerned about the parabens, since my skin is pretty sensitive.</li>
    <li> I Love This Product! Feels Like Silk On Your Skin Smells Really Good No Greasy Buildup Hope It Stays Around</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a week. I don&#x27;t notice a difference in wrinkles or anything like that yet, but I would say that my skin feels a little firmer and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what people were complaining about the smell, it doesn&#x27;t smell weird or off to me, but it does remind me of an old fragrance that my grandmother&#x27;s skin cream had, so maybe some are sensitive to muskier scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very positive use experience so far.</li>
    <li> Really seemed to lighten age spots.</li>
    <li> Did not lighten at all and left my face greasy which resulted in breakouts.</li>
    <li> Very creamy and absorbent on the skin.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> A little heavy, but so far, so good.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough for a proper review.</li>
    <li> Its a good product. Thanks to the seller</li>
    <li> Have been using it for about 3 weeks now and my skin feels great. Has a very non greasy feel and smells good. We use this on our daughters cheeks as well as they tend to get very dry in the winter month&#x27;s. I recommend this moisturizer to anyone who prefers a non greasy look and feel.</li>
    <li> Just started using it few days ago. Skin feels and looks great!!!! Will buy it again and will recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> This cream leaves skin silky smooth with no greasy residue. It has no more odor than any other factial cream. I have never had a break out or irritation from using this cream. I found that you need use very little product to achieve your goal.  It helps tremendously with dry skin in all locations - face, elbows, lips, etc.  It is a product I would recommend to anyone...didn&#x27;t even realize it was a lightner - I bought it for the black seed oil - the additional herbal ingredients are a definite plus.    Would have no problem sending as a gift either. Wish I could find a face scrub that includes the black seed from the same company.</li>
    <li> I just started to use this cream. It has only been a week and I see a change in my complexion already. It has a wonderful scent and goes on with ease does not leave an oily residue. I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very strong perfume smell...not going to put this anywhere near my sensitive face and eyes.  Surprised that fragrance is listed last on ingredients.  I did put some on the back of my hand, it made the dog AND cat cough.  That sealed its fate.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I saw results immediately. This is a miracle cream in a jar. After the first night my skin the next day was firmer. Now after weeks of use, it has become so much nicer, softer and even toned. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes my face feel wonderful and if I dab a bit on a hurt place it seems to speed healing.</li>
    <li> All these items from black seed are excellent. I would highly recommend Sweet Sunnah as a company. They are the best</li>
    <li> I developed an allergy to Neosporin. This cream aids healing as good as any antibiotic cream ever did. Google the benefits of Black Seed oil. The stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive nose and really don&#x27;t care for many fragrances due to that. My husband even told me it was strong. I&#x27;ll keep looking for a black seed face cream or maybe just use the oil.</li>
    <li> Received and started using this 2 weeks ago and my skin is remarkably brighter and softer and seems more toned. A++ ..ordered another bottle..amazing results for a ridiculously low price!</li>
    <li> The verdict is still out. may be after the first jar I will be able to see more results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m all for healthy products for the hair face and body.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t won&#x27;t give this product a bad rating because I had to stop using it because it breaks my face out so I don&#x27;t know if it really does what it claims.</li>
    <li> The smell is way too strong and it doesn&#x27;t go away completely. My 11 years old daughter says I smell like an old lady :( I&#x27;ve tried to use it for a couple of days but I stopped because in my opinion the smell is cheap and very unpleasant.  Well, what else can you expect from a $5 cream? You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews about how bad the cream smells and I don&#x27;t agree - it has a stronger smell (not bad) when you 1st put in on but then it goes away. It has a very light, whipped texture but seems to just sit on top of my skin and not soak in as quickly as I like so anyone with oily skin might really like it. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy this product again because I don&#x27;t like the fact that the mfg. doesn&#x27;t list the full ingredients anywhere - not on this site, and not on the actual box.  This worries me with the FDA recently warning that facial creams being sold as \\&quot;skin lightening\\&quot; may contain toxic metal or mercury:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;The FDA warns that if you are using a product and  any of the following ingredients are listed: mercurous chloride,\\&quot; \\&quot;calomel,\\&quot; \\&quot;mercuric,\\&quot; \\&quot;mercurio,\\&quot; or \\&quot;mercury,\\&quot; are listed on the label, stop using the product immediately</li>
    <li> it not that good as far as seeing some change but I do see an improvedment when I put on some face powder..it did good, it made my skin look smooth and nice...</li>
    <li> It was a bit heavy on the skin, but if you like a thicker formula, then this is for you.  Didn&#x27;t do much to change my skin, but it was just as good as most brands out there.  Worth a try to see if you like it for yourself.</li>
    <li> Love Love this face cream.  It smells great and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Very prompt delivery really light face cream, non-greasy and absorbs really quick. Will be using again.</li>
    <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this good since I was in high school - my face &amp;amp; neck feel so smooth now &amp;amp; I can see a noticable difference in my throat, the akin is actually tightening up &amp;amp; what&#x27;s even better, others have noticed too!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t tell a different in my facials but I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I did add a little more black seed oil in it and the pimples I had vanished quicker than normal to me.</li>
    <li> it´s spectacular, estoy muy satisfecha una vendededor muy cumplido, seguro, eficiente y el pedido llego en la fecha acordada bien</li>
    <li> Only used once so far. haven&#x27;t had time to see how it&#x27;s truly going to work, but feels very nice.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream: soaks into skin and is not greasy.  It&#x27;s somewhat thick, so I sometimes mix it with a lighter cream.  No ill effects, rash or facial breakouts. Feels nice on my face.</li>
    <li> A nice face cream for daily use at a good price.  I have used this product for two months and I&#x27;m very satisfied; provides good moisture for the skin and has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I was looking for it I found it I got and I am  enjoying it to the fullest&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> The cream is a decent moisturizer and is good to use under makeup. I have yet to see the firming but then I don&#x27;t have too much of a wrinkle or loose facial skin problem. Pretty good cream for the price.</li>
    <li> My skin has not been this oil-free in a long time.  My skin feels a lot firmer.  Great Product..Thank you</li>
    <li> had to stop using because it caused my skin to be irritated. if you have sensitive skin i don&#x27;t recommend. if your skin is not sensitive by all means check it out.</li>
    <li> This does all it says and more. It tightens, softens and lightens the skin on any part of the face and body where I&#x27;ve used it. My husband golfs several times a week, and uses this daily ... no dry wrinkly skin or dark spots. I would recommend this to anyone who wants better skin.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive, thus far I have had no break outs and skin is softer than before. Need to use longer in order to see more results if any.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and this did not break me out. I noticed results after a few days - was given a free sample - and went and bought 3 jars. The sun damage and wrinkles around my eyes are improving.I am 34 and the Florida sun has not been kind....good stuff.</li>
    <li> very nice cream.  it makes my skin bright.</li>
    <li> This face creams works very well to hydrate the skin and my skin feels baby soft;)</li>
    <li> I have had so many issue with my skin lately...&lt;br /&gt;Once menopause hit me ... YIKES&lt;br /&gt;It was like being a teenager again... pimples, rashes, but worse because of the added WRINKLES OF EVIL!&lt;br /&gt;Within one week of trying this product face smoothed out&lt;br /&gt;I especially noticed this round my eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of times a day... just a dab here and there and smooth it in.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What made this especially wonderful was that I received a personal message from the people who own the store&lt;br /&gt;Seems they are just a few towns over and were kind enough to send me a business card with a phone number and email address&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super Service BTW!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Did research on this product and it serves me just fine in all categories for a beauty product.  LMF</li>
    <li> Makes my face so soft!! Its a great product plus black cumin seed is soooo  incredibly good for your skin.</li>
