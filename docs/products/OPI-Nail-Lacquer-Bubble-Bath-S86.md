      <li>I love the color!</li>
      <li>Bubble bath is a perfect color for anytime of the year really.</li>
      <li>Love love love this color.</li>
      <li>My favorite nail polish color for every occasion.</li>
      <li>I love OPI polishes and decided to try a lighter color for summer.</li>
      <li>I found this color to be streaky and not my favorite OPI shade.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that it takes a lot longer for this brand to chip than others, even without a top coat.</li>
      <li>Received quickly and packaged nicely</li>
      <li>The color is a very nice, natural color... makes my nails look very clean and pretty!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of OPI products.</li>
      <li>It clumped and would not go on smooth at all.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>If I wanted invisible I&#x27;d just keep my nails nailpolish free.</li>
      <li>Overall, very nice</li>
      <li>i love this color for summer, you can add  a sparkley top coat or keep it plain for a nice look either way thank you for the fast shipping and nice polish.</li>
      <li>OPI Nail Lacquer Bubble Bath is so far one of my favorite shades this summer!  </li>
      <li>Once coat gives a nice light shine, and two coats gives a little more depth, more of an opaque color.</li>
      <li>this is such a gorgeous color.</li>
      <li>Probably good for french manicures, but not for full coverage.</li>
      <li>I love OPI in general, I find that a bottle lasts me longer than other, and you do not have to apply as many coats to get a good even color.</li>
      <li>This is a great color and a good color to add the white french tips and goes on smoothly and the polish last.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice if you just want a simple color after a fresh manicure.</li>
      <li>Although the color is thin, after three coats, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>Recommended for interviews - very clean, classy look.</li>
      <li>You got that right girls, Lisa Robertson (sp) from QVC wears this shade (bubble bath)</li>
      <li>Beautiful soft color, not too beige or pink.</li>
      <li>This was my first OPI nail polish...</li>
      <li>What I love specifically about this color (Bubble Bath S86) is that I feel like I got multiple colors in one bottle.</li>
      <li>But it is a rather nice shade of &#x27;pink&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>Wanted to enjoy it for a longer wear, but even with OPI top coat didn&#x27;t live long.  </li>
      <li>Once it arrived I put on three coats and couldn&#x27;t really see it.</li>
      <li>its a very very pale pink even though it looks a little more cream in the photo, but it looks great on!</li>
      <li>that is the reason I purchased this particular, mainly a conversational piece.  </li>
      <li>Bubble Bath is such a pretty but very natural color!</li>
      <li>I love that the shade is a soft pink that compliments practically my entire wardrobe.  </li>
      <li>I like this sweet, baby, candy pink color.</li>
      <li>It can last the entire week with several coats and a clear top coat.</li>
      <li>Amazon carries it too and that base coat is excellent - maintains the polish without chipping.  </li>
      <li>Great natural look, not too thick or thin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very subtle and paints on smoothly after a few coats, leaving a streak free coverage that I adore.  </li>

<li> The color is neutral but pink enough to not be plain old clear.  </li>
<li> This color is just a little bit transparent so it looks very natural.</li>
<li> I have been looking for a light pinkish nude color for a while, and where others failed to impress, this one shined.</li>
<li> I put two coats and it lasts for a long time.</li>
<li> So I tried them both and guess what my manicure lasted 7 days without one single chip.  </li>
<li> OPI Bubble Bath is a very sheer pale pink color.</li>
<li> The nail polish is a little watery, but I sort of expected that.</li>
<li> It looked like watered down pepto bismol.</li>
<li> It is subtle but noticeable at the same time.</li>
<li> Would have given it 5 Stars except for the 3 coats, prefer the 2 coats, less time consuming.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too pale for my liking.</li>
<li> Usually, I notice chipping on day 3..</li>
<li> I also purchased the &#x27;Stickey Base&#x27; coat the same day.  </li>
<li> Finally got disgusted and threw it away.</li>
<li> It just isn&#x27;t for me, way too boring.</li>

    <li> I exclusively use OPI but was dissappointed with this one. It clumped and would not go on smooth at all. Finally got disgusted and threw it away.</li>
    <li> I love this color and it has great coverage. I put two coats and it lasts for a long time. I some times put three coats just to get a darker color. Very nice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of OPI products. I like this sweet, baby, candy pink color. Although the color is thin, after three coats, it&#x27;s perfect. I had a lot of compliments wearing this color. It&#x27;s nice if you just want a simple color after a fresh manicure.</li>
    <li> I love the color! Bubble Bath is such a pretty but very natural color! My favorite nail polish color for every occasion.</li>

    <li> You got that right girls, Lisa Robertson (sp) from QVC wears this shade (bubble bath) that is the reason I purchased this particular, mainly a conversational piece.  But it is a rather nice shade of &#x27;pink&#x27;.  I also purchased the &#x27;Stickey Base&#x27; coat the same day.  Amazon carries it too and that base coat is excellent - maintains the polish without chipping.  So I tried them both and guess what my manicure lasted 7 days without one single chip.  Usually, I notice chipping on day 3.. Had to put 3 coats of OPI bubble bath to get the desired color.  Check QVC and you&#x27;ll see Lisa wearing it.      Would have given it 5 Stars except for the 3 coats, prefer the 2 coats, less time consuming.</li>
    <li> this is such a gorgeous color. It is subtle but noticeable at the same time. It can last the entire week with several coats and a clear top coat.</li>
    <li> This is a great color and a good color to add the white french tips and goes on smoothly and the polish last. Anne</li>

    <li> Wanted to enjoy it for a longer wear, but even with OPI top coat didn&#x27;t live long.  RIP Bubble Bath.</li>
    <li> Always a good product.  The color is neutral but pink enough to not be plain old clear.  Goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Beautiful soft color, not too beige or pink. Great natural look, not too thick or thin. Received quickly and packaged nicely</li>
    <li> The nail polish is a little watery, but I sort of expected that. The color is a very nice, natural color... makes my nails look very clean and pretty! I applied three coats and you can still noticeably see the white, but I sort of like that. This was my first OPI nail polish... and I&#x27;m glad! Overall, very nice and I can&#x27;t wait to use it more often!</li>
    <li> This color is SO nude that it took 6 coats just to make it look like there was any color on my toes.</li>
    <li> Love love love this color. I have been looking for a light pinkish nude color for a while, and where others failed to impress, this one shined.

    <li> This is one of those overhyped colors. It just isn&#x27;t for me, way too boring. It looked like watered down pepto bismol.</li>
    <li> i love this color for summer, you can add  a sparkley top coat or keep it plain for a nice look either way thank you for the fast shipping and nice polish.</li>
    <li> I wanted a nude and the description was great. Once it arrived I put on three coats and couldn&#x27;t really see it. It&#x27;s too pale for my liking. I would not purchase it again because it&#x27;s invisible. If I wanted invisible I&#x27;d just keep my nails nailpolish free.</li>
