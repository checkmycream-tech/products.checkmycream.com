      <li>Really great for stamping and super cute!</li>
      <li>These are one of the best ones out there so far.</li>

      <li>Great product and the shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>The scraper is made of plastic, but it has some &amp;#34;metallic finish&amp;#34; which I really really love.</li>
      <li>After sifting through many cheap-looking plastic stamps, I saw this set from CICI&amp;SISI and had to order it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>In order to have a neat image on my nails, I had to try so many times.</li>
      <li>I love this stamper.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>but they didn&#x27;t give a better result.</li>
      <li>Very cute, packaged great, and even came in earlier than suppose to!</li>
      <li>The scraper and the stamp both clean up easily with acetone nail polish remover and have already gone through about 10+ uses with me without showing any signs of wear</li>
      <li>This is my full review of the item from CICI&amp;SISI:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>The gray one is good for stamping with light color polishes and the white one is good for stamping dark color polishes.</li>
      <li>This one came, good size, good weight, white and black stamping pad.</li>
      <li>My first stamper was the one from Pueen.</li>
      <li>It stamps clearly and smoothly</li>
      <li>I found that the weight of the handle helped to provide most of the necessary pressure when picking up images from my plates</li>
      <li>so glad I finally decided to splurge and get myself a nail stamping kit, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this set from CICI&amp;SISI when it comes to learning.</li>
      <li>I decided the first things I&#x27;d get with my first paycheck were the supplies to stamp my nails.</li>
      <li>so I received this item on Sunday ( exactly 2 days after the day</li>
      <li>No complaints, thanks!</li>
      <li>At first, I thought it was because of the polishes or the stamping plates</li>
      <li>The rubber heads of this stamper are neither very squishy nor very hard which is very good for stamping.</li>
      <li>I have been stamping for a few years now, and have been very happy with the Konad stampers except when I need to use pink.</li>
      <li>this CICI&amp;SISI stamper, I always be able to transfer a neat and clean image onto my nails, no more trying for hundreds of time.</li>
      <li>this CICI&amp;SISI stamper, I always be able to transfer a neat and clean image onto my nails, no more trying for hundreds of time.</li>
      <li>The stamper handle is very sturdy, but it does seem to come unscrewed sometimes.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t stamp very well</li>
      <li>I was a bit worried about after reading a few reviews, but I was very happy to find it was a small piece of flexible plastic.</li>
      <li>Live this stamper.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been drooling over nail stamping kits for ages, and when I got a new job</li>
      <li>With approximately $7, you get a beautiful steel stamper with two rubber head in different colors, gray and white.</li>
      <li>I love the holder but the stamper head is too hard, and wont pickup the image.</li>
      <li>The white pad shows dark polish clearly while the dark gray pad shows every color of light polish, and both pads are easy to check and see whether or not you&#x27;ve picked up the entire</li>
      <li>I struggled so much to scale the image into my nail when using Pueen stamper because the white polish is almost invisible on the white rubber head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so all I need to do is just roll the stamp over the image while barely pressing!</li>
      <li>But then I bought this, and got really surprised because it can even pick up an image made with a sheer, regular nail polish.</li>
      <li>It has the same amount of give as you&#x27;d find in a regular credit card and easily evened out polish on designs big and small!</li>
      <li>The stamping pads are firm and didn&#x27;t require much priming at all - I think I spent maybe 30 seconds total with my crystal file getting them ready.</li>

    <li> Nice Stamper set that Does work but I guess I am scraping wrong because the full image won&#x27;t show on stamper</li>
    <li> This is a great stamper. it took a little bit to get the hang of it but after I did it worked great. I will buy another one soon.</li>
    <li> I love this stamper.  It&#x27;s slightly firmer than the ones that come with their plate kits,  and those have been my go to stampers.  Since receiving this,  I have not used another stamper.  And I have a lot of them to choose from! I&#x27;ll be buying a back up of this one!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. I&#x27;m a beginner in nail stamping. My first stamper was the one from Pueen. It was squishy, and could not pick up the image nicely. I was so desperate when stamping my nails. In order to have a neat image on my nails, I had to try so many times. After seeing reviews from many Youtubers, I managed to purchase the Creative Shop nail stamper but it was out of stock. So I got this one as a second option. This is my full review of the item from CICI&amp;SISI:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SHIPPING TIME: I am a prime member so I received this item on Sunday ( exactly 2 days after the day I ordered it). I&#x27;ll give them 5 star for shipping and handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PRICE:  it&#x27;s a very very good deal in my opinion. With approximately $7, you get a beautiful steel stamper with two rubber head in different colors, gray and white. The gray one is good for stamping with light color polishes and the white one is good for stamping dark color polishes. With this amount of money, you&#x27;ll only get a plastic stamper with 1 stamper head and a plastic scraper from other brands. I struggled so much to scale the image into my nail when using Pueen stamper because the white polish is almost invisible on the white rubber head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE QUALITY: The rubber heads of this stamper are neither very squishy nor very hard which is very good for stamping. Their surfaces are both glossy but aren&#x27;t required priming to pick up an image nicely. My Pueen stamper could not pick up the image from regular polishes. At first, I thought it was because of the polishes or the stamping plates so I ordered Mundo De Unas and Konad stamping polishes but they didn&#x27;t give a better result. But then I bought this, and got really surprised because it can even pick up an image made with a sheer, regular nail polish. The scraper is made of plastic, but it has some &amp;#34;metallic finish&amp;#34; which I really really love. About the stamper, it&#x27;s made of steel and designed beautifully. The entire kit looks very expensive but costs not much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this CICI&amp;SISI stamper, I always be able to transfer a neat and clean image onto my nails, no more trying for hundreds of time.

    <li> It&#x27;s arrived on time and packaged great but the stamping heads are to hard doesn&#x27;t stamp very well</li>
    <li> Used a few times already. Works great. Would definitely buy again. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Very cute, packaged great, and even came in earlier than suppose to! :) now this here is a quality product. 👌🏼</li>
    <li> This stamper ROCKS! I have been stamping for a few years now, and have been very happy with the Konad stampers except when I need to use pink. I tried a few squishy stampers and had bad luck. This one came, good size, good weight, white and black stamping pad. I did prime the pad with a file and acetone and the image transferred beautifully. So glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> Really great for stamping and super cute!</li>
    <li> This stamper works so well. It stamps clearly and smoothly</li>
    <li> I buy this product because it has excelents reviews but I does not work as they said. I don&#x27;t know, maybe need more practice cause I&#x27;m a begginer.</li>
    <li> what a disappointment.I was exited for this stamper, but doesnt seem to work well for me. I love the holder but the stamper head is too hard, and wont pickup the image.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my niece, worked perfectly. Nail polish came off onto the nails perfectly. No complaints, thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product and the shipping was fast. Definitely happy</li>
    <li> Great stamper! Picks up images nicely.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the one that came with my stamp set. It works perfectly and I love having both colors so I can see white or black when I use those. The scraper works great too. The stamper handle is very sturdy, but it does seem to come unscrewed sometimes.</li>
    <li> the hard tires, but thanks as</li>
    <li> THE BEST STAMPER EVER!!! Finally stamper who STAMPS! No preparation, just take it and stamp! Picks up image perfect! I am so happy to find it and I tried almost all stampers...This is the best!</li>
