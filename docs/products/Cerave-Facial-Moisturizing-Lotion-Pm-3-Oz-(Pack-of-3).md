      <li>My favorite face lotion by far!!</li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended this cream for daytime use since I have fairly dry skin and needed something good.  </li>

      <li>if im wery dry, use it as a serum and apply a more mosurising cream on top.</li>
      <li>Proof once again that natural ingredients are the best way to go, especially for sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is great, just as great as a $100 product.  It&#x27;s always hard to explain in a review what your skin type is like and if it will do well for other people, but this is a reliable brand and product and if you want to keep you skin taken care of on your face, this is a really decent way to go.  Was nice to buy in bulk.  I&#x27;d say give it a try.  Really really nice.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! Recommended by my dermatologist and works great.  Keeps face feeling moisturized and not dry!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my allergist, particularly because it contains ceramides. My parents use another product from this company for the same reason -- apparently as one ages the skin loses its ability to be moist. Although I have not fact-checked that statement, I can say that the product is gentle --  I have sensitivity to ingredients in cosmetics (shown through patch testing and experienced directly).. My skin is fine with this product as a moisturizer for normal to dry skin, eye area included. On a separate note, I noticed a question about this product regarding expiry dates and decided to do some research.  If you give Cerave the code on the bottle, they can tell you the expiry date. (Note that the Cerave person I phoned indicated that only products with sunscreen have expiry dates, but the Cerave person who emailed me back after I posed the question via the company website gave my an expiry date). My bottles&#x27; expiry dates are 15 months after the purchase date.</li>
    <li> This stuff just really works for me. Great for dry skin in the winter--and for whatever reason--I don&#x27;t get acne when I use this stuff--as in when I stop using it--I start getting acne.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for the product.  I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> A good price for a product I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
    <li> I had been struggling with dry, blotchy and red skin on my face for several years.  My Doctor said it was an allergy to something and gave me Alegra.  I finally went to a dermatologist (I paid for it) and she diagnosed Rosacea and gave me some samples of CeraVe for the dryness (and Oracea).  It has been the best lotion.  I also use the CeraVe Hydrating cleanser twice a day.  Very mild, but keeps my skin soft with no burning or redness.</li>
    <li> I need to repurchase it!!! I like it!</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic Acid.  Yeah, if you don&#x27;t know what that is and you live in a dry climate, time to check it out.  Winter in Newport Rhode Island two years ago, an esthetician told me about it.  I haven&#x27;t come off it since.  There is an AM w/sunblock.  My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in 10 years.  You must must try this.  Especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion was recommended by our dermatologist.  Three pack made it much more reasonable than any other retailer.</li>
    <li> GREAT moisturizer.  Well worth the $$$ for me as it&#x27;s the only one that keep my sensitive, dry and acne-prone skin clear.</li>
    <li> Both the Night and Daytime were recommended by a dermatologist a decade or so ago and I have used them since then with good success as far as visible aging etc.</li>
    <li> This lotion leaves my face feeling moisturized but not oily. I love it. Great value for the price too!</li>
    <li> This is a great light lotion, I use it every night because my skin dries out easily after shower.  I&#x27;m allergic to just normal facial lotions, it burns when I apply it on my face... but I have to use lotion.  Especially around the nose area, when it dries out it is painful and causes a lot of painful chain reaction down the line.  I even went to a dermatologist once to ask about this issue but he was worthless as he just said use the head&amp;shoulders 2 in 1 shampoo to wash your face with to help out.  This lotion absorbs really well and lasts over night just right.  Normally during the day I do not have to apply lotion, except if I am going to be outdoors for a long period of time then I usually use sunscreen lotion.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  I was already using other CeraVe facial products, so I trusted the brand.  I have used another brand for years, and gradually developed a sensitivity to it.  So, I gave this a try, and I absolutely love it!  It absorbs quickly, and makes my skin feel fantastic.  I definitely recommend the whole CeraVe product line.</li>
    <li> Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love the condition this leaves my skin.</li>
    <li> Affordable night cream. This works well for me. Keeps my face moisturized throughout the night.</li>
    <li> This is a vegan alternative to Cetaphil, and my dermatologist recommends it too. My skin looks better since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> Best facial lotion on the market at the moment.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I had l I ved in Florida my whole life until a few years ago. My dermatologist in Florida said I had Rosacea and had me applying a steroid type cream to keep the redness down. I come out to Colorado and still experience the same issue until Ai find my dermatologist here. He didnt believe that I had Rosacea but just dry skin and started me on Cerave PM and Cerave AM. Not one red cheek since I started with the Cerave PM. My skin looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this lotion to those who may have sensitive skin (rosacea or eczema). My husband recently had a bad case of rosacea; when he visited the dermatologist she prescribed some prescription cleansers and ointments and casually mentioned to try this lotion should those items not &amp;#34;cut it&amp;#34;  Well to say the expensive prescriptions didn&#x27;t work is an understatement.  However, this lotion preceded by the CeraVe hydrating facial wash did the trick! His skin cleared up wonderfully and the blotchiness is gone! A great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good face lotion for years. my face is very sensitive and most lotions give me a rash, this lotion is brilliant!</li>
    <li> I ONLY used the most expensive names out there , and I&#x27;m willing to pay whatever it to  take care my skin. Won&#x27;t be disappointed I can&#x27;t believe how much money I&#x27;m saving,Thank you, Cerave. This is the best Night Repair lotion as well.</li>
    <li> God for intolerant skin but give not enough moisture if im wery dry, use it as a serum and apply a more mosurising cream on top. This is really great for Rosacea prone skin</li>
    <li> Excellent. Enjoyable.</li>
    <li> I have used this for two years now. This is an excellent moisturizer and I use it morning and night. I do not use the one with the sunscreen in it, as ALL sunscreens irritate my skin. I am over 50, and this has kept my skin feeling soft and smooth. It soaks in well, and make-up (Jane Iredale Pure-Pressed Foundation) goes on well over it. My 20 year old daughter uses it, too, and her skin looks great.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I just tried this yesterday!!! I think it is the absolute best moisturizer I have ever used!! A little goes such a long way and is not greasy, just perfect!! I recommend this to anyone!! Love it, will indeed be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an affordable moisturizer with niacinamide, and this fits the bill. It spreads easily and two pumps was enough to cover my face. It lasts a while too (using it twice a day). The other ingredients (ceramides, hyaluronic acid) are all very moisturizing ingredients. The only drawback is that there are fatty alcohols, which some people are sensitive to and can cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. Keeps my skin soft, moisturized and doesn&#x27;t cause break outs. I have also used the lotion with sunscreen with success.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price. Light lotion without any greasiness and sinks in quickly. Recommended on Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
    <li> Good stuff at a fair price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily/sticky feeling at all! It makes my dry skin feel very soft and smooth. My dermatologist originally recommended this lotion to me about seven years ago and I have used it faithfully since then. I use it both at night and in the morning each day.</li>
    <li> I use this for both am and pm because I can&#x27;t tolerate the sunscreen in the am product.</li>
    <li> I recently tried this lotion because I have very sensitive skin and I wanted to see what all the hype was about. It clogged up all my pores and made my skin feel rough and bumpy, absolutely horrible. I do usually use all natural skincare products though, so it&#x27;s possible that my skin had an adverse reaction to all the chemicals, preservatives, parabens, and synthetic ingredients that&#x27;s in this junk. So I went back to my usual natural skincare routine and my skin smoothed out immediately. Proof once again that natural ingredients are the best way to go, especially for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> great product for the inexpensive price. Moisturizes well without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> A great basic, effective SPF-free moisturizer. I chose it because it gets good marks from both Beautypedia as well as Skin Deep.</li>
    <li> nothing to really say. it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or anything. i don&#x27;t see any difference than any other lotion i&#x27;ve used..</li>
    <li> Best lotion for the price. Better than a lot of higher priced lotions</li>
    <li> Very gentle product, never irritates my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using AM and PM for more than 3 years now, my skin is better than when I was using Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great lotion that doesn&#x27;t irritate and makes your skin really soft.  Plus it has great anti-aging ingredients for a product that is so cheap.  Or even for an expensive product.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist prescribed Atralin (Retinoid) for me as a skin cancer preventative treatment. She suggested I mix it with CeraVe PM as ceramides are crucial to healthy, moisturized skin. I love it. I have even begun using it on the nights I don&#x27;t use my Atralin.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light moisturizer and was recommended  by my dermatologist. My skin looks brighter on mornings after I remember to use it.</li>
    <li> Expensive lotion but effective</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream for daytime use since I have fairly dry skin and needed something good.  It goes on light and smooth... Not oily at all. I tried the AM daytime cream but it was heavier and smelled a bit.  I would rather use a cream that I love and double with a UV protector than use a 2 in 1 that I don&#x27;t like. Definitely recommend this Cerave PM.  It&#x27;s a great price too!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, it makes my skin soft an smooth and it last all night and the next day even after rinsing my face in the morning. I use this at night together with neutrogena retinol and apply a moisturizer with spf and vitamin C in the morning after rinsing my face. I am 48 years old and I am starting to get fine lines around my eyes and mouth cause I smoke but none of these product are going to make me look like 20 again but they do diminish the fine lines and even my skin tone. A little dab of the cerave goes a long way. It penetrates deeply to provide all-night and day moisturization with a single application. It is one of the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I really love Cerave lotion, especially the PM. It was recommended by my dermatologist for my dry-but-acne-prone skin to use in conjunction with my prescription acne products. It keeps my skin well-moisturized without giving me breakouts. I like that it has no scent and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years and love it. It keeps my face real moist.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer, the only one I feel comfortable putting on my face (my dermatologist recommended it to me). This is the cheapest way to get it, hands down! Will be repurchasing once I run out!</li>
    <li> My favorite face lotion by far!!</li>
    <li> I have used many different and expensive facial moisturizers promising hydration for aging dry skin. This is really nice my face feel moisturizer all day and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I would highly recommend this product. My dermatologist recommended.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me. I started using it the first week even after feeling itchy and scratch right after applying it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;In the end of week, this lotion prove to me Im allergic to its contents.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I dont have use any other products beside that period of using cerave lotion.</li>
    <li> great for summer, but need to pile it on a bit more in the winter. The PM is an excellent moisturizer and does not leak into eyes while sleeping like some others do (nor does it leave an oily residue on the pillow case)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never, ever had sensitive skin until this year.  The good face products I used for years for aging skin, I can no longer use. So happy I found CeraVe through Amazon. After reading the great reviews for the AM and PM CeraVe, I tried them and love them. No more breakouts, and my face looks as \\&quot;young\\&quot; as it did with the highly advertised anti-aging skin stuff I was using. I highly recommend CeraVe if you have any kind of face breakouts.</li>
    <li> Cerave Facial Moisturizing Lotion PM is wonderful!  Very nourishing to my mature skin.  I use it every night and my face&lt;br /&gt;is so soft and smooth in the morning.  I highly recommend it to all ages.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended the CeraVe brand when a skin medication made my skin sensitive. I love the PM version, it&#x27;s not oily or heavy at all. Plus, I still feel moisturized. It&#x27;s essentially weightless and a few seconds after applying I can&#x27;t even tell there&#x27;s anything on my face. This is a PM lotion because there&#x27;s no SPF in this formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the PM lotion in humid and arid environments. It did it&#x27;s job and kept me moisturized in both habitats. In the desert I found that I would blow my nose before going to bed and that would wipe the lotion off around my nose. Sometimes I&#x27;d wake with a little spot of dryness on the tip of my nose. Now I know that if I wipe the lotion off before bed I&#x27;ll take a small drop of lotion and reapply it where the tissue or whatever rubbed my skin. Problem &#x3D; solved (no dryness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AM version has SPF, but it&#x27;s not the same. If you&#x27;re not oil-prone and/or have really sensitive skin then the AM formula would be a good option during the day. However, I find the AM version to be heavier than the PM and I can feel it on my face for hours (it doesn&#x27;t blend in to my skin like the PM version). By the end of the day with the AM kind I feel kind of oily (partly because it never felt like the lotion blended in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even now that I&#x27;m off the skin medication and my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive or dry I&#x27;ll keep using the PM version. However, I&#x27;ll likely look in to other AM options.</li>
    <li> This is a very smooth and light cream for night time. Applies easily and has no offensive scent. I would recommend this prodict to anyone interested in preserving their skin condition, it&#x27;s a perfect compliment to the Cerave AM lotion with SPF.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing moisturizer Ive ever used. I promise you will see a difference in your skin when you wake up, after using this the first night!</li>
    <li> The description didn&#x27;t mention that it was for normal to dry skin. That would have been helpful info. Otherwise, the product is good.</li>
    <li> Smooth, hydrating, and unscented. Non- allergenic. My husband also uses and appreciates the quality and result as well.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I use it at night before I go to bed and in the morning my facial skin feels super soft. This also has helped with my skin complexion as well. I am very happy with the product and definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is not worth the extra money. The 12 oz Cerave Moisturizing Lotion is just as good for 1/2 the money. And Olay Complete is a good as both of them for even less money.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to moisturizer for both nighttime and daily use.  I have a bottle sitting by my desk at work as well as my night stand for when I ever find a moment where my skin feels dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very acne prone so I am very careful with the moisturizers I use (and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried a ton) and this one does not brake me out ever which I love.  Just FYI, my skin is a combo (oily in the T-zone and dry everywhere else).</li>
    <li> Good ingredients that are proven to work to increase collagen and help minimize wrinkles. As far as moisturizing, this may be all that&#x27;s needed for younger and oilier skin types but I also use a more emollient moisturizer with this as I have older and drier skin. The price is excellent on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great deal, great product, super fast shipping!! A+ all the way.</li>
    <li> I love the cereve moisture cream so thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It&#x27;s ok, not as moisturizing as I expected but it does seem to moisturize my face.</li>
    <li> This is the best mousturizer I have ever tried. Not greasy, but even in the cold winter my face never flakes or is itchy. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It noticibly reduced fine wrinkles on my face in like 1 week. I use it both day and night. What a deal for the price! All my girlfriends use it now!</li>
    <li> Perfect for sensitive skin. Was recommended to me by my dermatologist to help with mild eczema and it does help.</li>
