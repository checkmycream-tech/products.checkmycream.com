      <li>Thanks so much for the smaller package.</li>
      <li>Wear it sparingly, cause after that first drip, you just loose your nostrils or something.  </li>
      <li>Its worth the extra money getting the actual bottle if I spent the \\&quot;$20.00 retail\\&quot; on this bottle id be quite heated.</li>
      <li>however if you wear too much, some people will complain that \\&quot;someone&#x27;s wearing axe\\&quot;, and there goes all your class down the crapper.  </li>

    <li> I was disappointed In how small this is . Perfect for young child only. Amazing smell just buy the larger sized bottle . very very slow delivery</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it, got for my dad for fathers day</li>
    <li> Smells really nice.. my girl loves it</li>
    <li> YYYYEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!&lt;br /&gt;When Im out meeting girls and Guys I always remember to Stop the Clock and \\&quot;Mambo up\\&quot; as the girls look down at me and tell me how Great I smell.  I know that sarcastic look is not real!!</li>
    <li> one of the best fragrances i&#x27;ve bought in a long time, i only wish i had bought a bigger bottle</li>
    <li> great size for travel and my beau loved it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out a little experiment with pheromones on my male partner recently.  I sought out some scents containing pheromones and casually noted what things got him closer to me.  As a &#x27;woman&#x27; seeking &#x27;gender re-assignment&#x27;, who tends to look neither male nor female, with a bisexual partner, I have tried both the Mambo perfume for women, AND the cologne.  The reaction to this cologne was stronger in my case.  I&#x27;ve also noticed a bit of interest from women, but I&#x27;m not very approachable to women...  In my partners case, however, he tends to be pretty affectionate when I wear this cologne.  I might try these scents out again, and do it more scientifically the next time.  For the guys, depending on your sexuality, it might be good news that men will like your smell, too.  One thing about this smell is it&#x27;s very recognizable to people who know it.  They won&#x27;t confuse it with anything else... however if you wear too much, some people will complain that \\&quot;someone&#x27;s wearing axe\\&quot;, and there goes all your class down the crapper.  Wear it sparingly, cause after that first drip, you just loose your nostrils or something.  You can&#x27;t freaking smell yourself, and you&#x27;re going to wanna pour that stuff on you until you make sure you smell like it.  Don&#x27;t.  Two or three drops will scent the collar of your shirt or the wrist of your sleeve until it&#x27;s washed.</li>
    <li> this cologne is a head turner my son my husband loves it my dad turned me onto itlove this</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> since i&#x27;m the one who has to smell him, this is what i bought for him to wear.  never been happier.</li>
    <li> The little sample they send with it smells wonderful.  I am going to look for it to buy for my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> Great item and great seller. I love this smell on my husband. Keep up with the great deals and I&#x27;ll be back for more</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the bigger bottle. It was a good purchase anyway. Next time I will get the larger</li>
    <li> Excellent! Great scent.</li>
    <li> My husband is enjoying the product. I would buy again. Thanks so much for the smaller package. It helps to test!</li>
