      <li>the smell isn&#x27;t the best and kinda gives me a headache but</li>
      <li>Great color, good feeling!</li>
      <li>&amp; it works great.</li>
      <li>Porduct works great.  </li>
      <li>I used this lotion years ago and it was great.  </li>

      <li>I have a good tan.</li>
      <li>I tan good with it.</li>
      <li>I love everything about this product!</li>
      <li>i love this lotion!</li>
      <li>Just as the title, this is by far the best tanning lotion.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t turn you orange like most tanners do.</li>
      <li>I think its ok but not my cup of tea</li>
      <li>, it doesn&#x27;t really smell that great.</li>
      <li>You know how most of the time when you go tanning, you leave and have to run home to take a shower or smell like burnt rubber the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>but I felt that this leaves more of an orange color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite lotion</li>
      <li>it thought it was just ok</li>
      <li>Great product shipped in speedy delivery, new in box!</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic and almost better after going through a 20 min tan.  </li>
      <li>it smells good and it does really well.</li>
      <li>Smells a lot like Cool Water!  </li>
      <li>Love it, and a very positive purchase!</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend to anyone.  </li>
      <li>It will for sure get you darker, you may not notice it right away</li>
      <li>Excellent tanning product from the past,</li>
      <li>nothing special</li>
      <li>after shave scent that wears off quickly.</li>
      <li>It gets you so golden brown and looking great for all yr round.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different ones, and this one is the one that makes you really dark, evenly, creates a beautiful color.  </li>
      <li>Helps you tan nice and brown and the tan seems to last longer.  </li>
      <li>I have used many lotions over the years, but dangerously dark is the best by far and has helped me achieve the darkest tan possible..</li>
      <li>&amp; I could see results right away.</li>
      <li>This lotion not only gives you a bit of color while your own melanine is processing, but really firms the skin and doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;Tooti</li>
      <li>This product was exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
      <li>Produces a nice dark brown color with no streaking!</li>
      <li>and I always feel like I really do tan faster using it.</li>
      <li>was fast</li>
      <li>I do not notice a cooling action as the label says but I don&#x27;t mind missing out it since I&#x27;m getting such great color.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t the best but also not the most terrible...</li>
      <li>I am very fair and it takes a good month to month and a half to even get a base tan.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product highly!What a great price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried several other and this is the best at least I think so.</li>
      <li>manages to tighten up the skin slightly for a full feel!</li>
      <li>Sure there are many new products with 50 million bronzers and silicone and even though I am not too crazy about the scent after I have tanned, I will stick to what I know works.</li>
      <li>The only downer i can see people complain about is there is a bit of a funny after smell...but that doesn&#x27;t bother me any.</li>
      <li>This product is a very quality lotion, it gets you dark fast and conditions your skin very well.</li>
      <li>Today my friend who has super pale skin tried it too, and was amazed at the results.  </li>
      <li>really gets you dark and the tan last for days!</li>
      <li>it is a little expensive but it is a good product.</li>

<li> but within a few hours you will see that you are darker</li>
<li> a shower a few hours after tanning fixes that.</li>
<li> , You won&#x27;t need to tan everyday</li>
<li> Because I had stopped tanning for a few years, I sort of forgot about, and I never saw it in my tanning salon.  </li>
<li> in a few days</li>
<li> The product was as described, wrapped and sealed tightly!</li>
<li> and the smell was awful</li>

    <li> Great product! Produces a nice dark brown color with no streaking! manages to tighten up the skin slightly for a full feel! The product was as described, wrapped and sealed tightly!</li>
    <li> I rate this product a 5 (: I love everything about this product! It will for sure get you darker, you may not notice it right away but within a few hours you will see that you are darker, You won&#x27;t need to tan everyday it last for about 4 days before I go again that way the tan won&#x27;t fade. It doesn&#x27;t turn you orange like most tanners do. I&#x27;ve used this product for 4 years and I&#x27;ve tried several other and this is the best at least I think so. The only downer i can see people complain about is there is a bit of a funny after smell...but that doesn&#x27;t bother me any. hope this helps.</li>
    <li> really gets you dark and the tan last for days! the smell isn&#x27;t the best and kinda gives me a headache but a shower a few hours after tanning fixes that. i love this lotion!</li>
    <li> This product is a very quality lotion, it gets you dark fast and conditions your skin very well. It has a bit of a feminine after smell though, it doesn&#x27;t really smell that great.</li>
    <li> it thought it was just ok nothing special i didn&#x27;t like the greasy feeling it left afterwards and the smell was awful will not buy this product again but did have great customer service and shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Just as the title, this is by far the best tanning lotion.  EVER!  I have tried many different ones, and this one is the one that makes you really dark, evenly, creates a beautiful color.  I even used it on the beach WITH additional SPF.  I strongly recommend to anyone.  Today my friend who has super pale skin tried it too, and was amazed at the results.  GET IT!</li>
    <li> Great product shipped in speedy delivery, new in box! Quality of merchandise excellent! Will buy from again! Excellent tanning product from the past, but this is a step above from what I have purchased. Love it, and a very positive purchase! Product sent was product advertised.. Just what I wanted! Thank you!</li>
    <li> You know how most of the time when you go tanning, you leave and have to run home to take a shower or smell like burnt rubber the rest of the day. Not with this lotion!  It smells fantastic and almost better after going through a 20 min tan.  Smells a lot like Cool Water!  Great color, good feeling!</li>
    <li> I like the feel and other aspects of this lotion - suited a tanning desire.  However the smell of it is not that pleasing.  I would use it while outside tanning but you need a shower afterwards.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I hoped it would be. I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the smell &amp; I could see results right away. I will definitely be ordering this lotion again!</li>
    <li> I have used this Tanning lotion for yrs. It gets you so golden brown and looking great for all yr round.I would recommend this product highly!What a great price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I have used many lotions over the years, but dangerously dark is the best by far and has helped me achieve the darkest tan possible.. Sure there are many new products with 50 million bronzers and silicone and even though I am not too crazy about the scent after I have tanned, I will stick to what I know works. I would recommend this lotion to everyone!!</li>
    <li> Without a doubt the very best product from Swedish Beauty. This lotion not only gives you a bit of color while your own melanine is processing, but really firms the skin and doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;Tooti Frooti\\&quot; tanning product scent.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what the packaging said it would do. I have a good tan. But I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference after using this product</li>
    <li> Porduct works great.  Helps you tan nice and brown and the tan seems to last longer.  I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> If you have problems with your legs tanning like the rest of the body this is a wonderful product!  I love it and it is the only thing that has ever worked on my legs.</li>
    <li> I think its ok but not my cup of tea</li>
    <li> I think the shipping was great. The seller is great. But I did not really care for the product itself. I am a Swedish Beauty fan but I felt that this leaves more of an orange color.</li>
    <li> I used this lotion years ago and it was great.  Because I had stopped tanning for a few years, I sort of forgot about, and I never saw it in my tanning salon.  I finally found it on Amazon and started using it again.  It&#x27;s my favorite lotion and I always feel like I really do tan faster using it.</li>
    <li> it smells good and it does really well. it is a little expensive but it is a good product. I tan good with it.</li>
    <li> I got my lotion w/in a few days &amp; it works great. The company even sent me an email for a discount on my next purchase!</li>
    <li> It works! I use this product before the use of the tanning bed and I come out with a very nice tan.</li>
    <li> I am very fair and it takes a good month to month and a half to even get a base tan. This lotion has gotten me darker than I have ever been after using it twice. The smell isn&#x27;t the best but also not the most terrible...a little bit of a cologne/after shave scent that wears off quickly. I do not notice a cooling action as the label says but I don&#x27;t mind missing out it since I&#x27;m getting such great color.</li>
