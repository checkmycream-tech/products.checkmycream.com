<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I needed a new electric after the airport broke my old one. Still smooth and clean cutting as the day I got it. Still holds a long charge.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item after 4-5 years with my previous Norelco - in fact, I&#x27;ve never used any other brand of electric shaver.  The differences are remarkable: 1. It is so much quieter than my previous shaver that it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be working very hard.  2. Its design allows much closer contact with the skin than my previous shaver.  3. The fact that it can be cleaned after every use with running water from the faucet is its greatest feature for me.  In summary, I am absolutely delighted with this shaver and have nothing but praise to give to its designers.  Thanks, Norelco!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t leave many reviews here, but I had to write a quick \\&quot;Thumbs Up\\&quot; for this razor. It&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve had with an electric razor so far. It&#x27;s my first rotary. My previous razor&#x27;s were Panasonic&#x27;s and Braun foil razors. Two of those were more expensive than this one. I&#x27;ve always touched up with a twin blade razor... UNTIL NOW. Also, I shave my head. Not only is this great on my neck and beard, it even get my head including the tricky spots near the ears. Cleanup is quick and easy and I don&#x27;t have to shell out $5 a bottle for some solution. I never had any razor burn and didn&#x27;t need to give it a few weeks to adjust the manual suggested was common. The shave was close and comfortable from day 1. It&#x27;s very quiet, which initially caused me to think it was underpowered.  It&#x27;s got a 60 day return policy - give it a whirl.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for over 40 years.  I wanted one that was easier to clean, hated that little brush, etc.  The 8140 can be washed after each use under hot tap water to keep it fairly clean.  It still requires the in-depth cleaning monthly but even that is so much easier since most of the hair is removed daily.  It is quiet and light.  I would rate it as the best Norelco that I have owned.</li>
    <li> This razor is built to extremely high standards with quality materials.  The razor is both waterproof and very quiet.  However, the shave quality is horrible.  I got a much better and quicker shave from my $35 remington that unfortunately gave up after about a year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used razors, as I like a very close cut.  I&#x27;ve tried once in the past an electric shaver and since I had left my beard grow 1/8 of an inch or so, it didn&#x27;t cut a thing and I never looked back.  I got a Braun portable as a gift and I tried it with just a 1 day beard and it worked (never as close as a razor, forget about electric if that&#x27;s what you want, don&#x27;t care what anybody tells you, it&#x27;s not even close) but it was good enough that I could go to work without looking like I have not shaved. &lt;br /&gt;I did some research and this Norelco came on top (second best was another Braun, but it had a washing system with a liquid that you have to replace once a month and that was a deal breaker for me).  I&#x27;ve tried it twice now and is very similar to my Braun portable, that is, just good enough. &lt;br /&gt;Instructions say to use only this shaver (don&#x27;t mix with razors) so that the machine gets \\&quot;used\\&quot; to your beard...which sounds like a lot of crock (don&#x27;t see any A.I. chip buried in the machine) but will humour the manufacturer.  Anyway, my main reason to get it is that some times after shaving with a razor often my skin does get irritated and some times in the morning I&#x27;m not feeling like doing that to my face.  The other nice thing is that on a  Saturday afternoon if I decide to go out, I can just touch up with the electric instead of having to wash my face, apply shaving cream, and maybe getting my shirt wet in the process...much simpler with this thing. &lt;br /&gt;But it really depends on your beard I guess, I have a not very dense beard, which grows parallel to the skin (specially around the cheeks) and so it is difficult for electric razors to do a great job.  Around my chin for example, where hair grows more perpendicular is where I get the best shaving (also, it&#x27;s the most dense there, so it is were the razor hurts the most!). &lt;br /&gt;But if you are on a budget and $80 is a lot for you, don&#x27;t buy it, it is not worth it, if you are just itching to buy a new gadget though, I would recommend this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope this is useful.</li>
    <li> This is my first new razor in several years, so it&#x27;s basically being compared to a 7+ year-old Norelco.  Also, I have never shaved using traditional blades, so I can&#x27;t compare it with that experience.  With this said... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: There&#x27;s a lot I like about this razor.  It gives a really close shave.  Much closer than I&#x27;ve gotten from previous electrics.  It still could be a little closer, though, but not by much.  It&#x27;s cordless, which is very convenient, and the charge seems to last quite a long time.  So far, one charge seems to last about 4 weeks for me, with shaving every day for about 3 minutes or so.  Pretty good.  It also is very ergonomically designed -- very comfortable to hold.  I like that it is so quick to charge -- only takes about one hour.  You also have the option of cleaning it with either water, or with an included brush.  The water does a great job of cleaning out all the little hairs.  I still worry about getting it wet too frequently, though, so I usually clean it with the brush and just clean it with water about once a month. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: The biggest con is that while there are \\&quot;charging\\&quot; and \\&quot;done charging\\&quot; LEDs on the razor, there is no \\&quot;Battery Low\\&quot; LED.  This means you only know when the battery is dead when it dies while you are shaving.  Once you&#x27;ve gone though a couple charge cycles you will learn about how long it goes between charges, but nonetheless it&#x27;d be nice to have a warning.  It&#x27;s really only because of this that I knocked off one star.  But one other con is that the power adapter is somewhat large, as opposed to older Norelcos, so if you choose to use it as a corded razor, it might be inconvenient to store the adapter near the razor if you keep in, for example, a medicine cabinet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts: Worth noting that you don&#x27;t need to use the included stand if you don&#x27;t want to -- the cord can plug directly into the razor for charging. Also, it can operate as either a cordless or corded razor, although the manual warns that using it as a corded razor too often will hurt the battery, so you pretty much have to choose one or the other.  Comes with a very small travel pouch, head protector, and brush.  Great razor overall.  Only knocked it one star because there&#x27;s no Battery Empty LED... some other Norelcos have this feature, but many of them are more expensive than this one.  This is a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Its probably a case of these rotary head shavers either works well for you or it doesn&#x27;t.  In my case it doesn&#x27;t.  Very disppointed after spending that much money.  As some reviewers have pointed out you have to pass the machine over the same spot several times and still it doesn&#x27;t shave properly.  I have to end up using a razor \\&quot;to clean up\\&quot; so what&#x27;s the point.  I may as well use a razor and shaving cream.  I thought it would be quicker than using a razor but its NOT.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old Remington R845 which cut very close and clean.  It doesn&#x27;t come close and I hated shaving with it.  Waste of money.  Went out and bought a R845 at Frys on sale for 20 bucks on sale and it is soooo much better.  I like shaving again...</li>
    <li> I use Philips products for a long time already. Their technology is far better than all the other ones. When competition release similar products in shape they come up with another breakthrough grooming system. Awesome!</li>
    <li> Before this shaver, I had a Remington trifoil, and I have to admit that this shaver is way better.  It was cheaper, and it&#x27;s performance is much better.  This shaver is very quiet, gives a great close shave, and holds it&#x27;s charge well.  I also love that you can just rinse it out to clean it.  No, fancy liquids or cleaning devices are needed.</li>
    <li> Going from corded to cordless shavers over the years it seems that each time I buy a new Norelco they go down in quality and up in price.  My last one (I don&#x27;t remember the model #) was pitiful from day one.  This time they got it right.  Fast charge, long run time and super quiet operation.  Excellent shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Norelco man.  In my mind, it isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;neat\\&quot; as my last Norelco 5885XL.  That model had a LCD that told you how many shaves you had left, it would tell you when to clean it, etc. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This new shaver is cute.  It&#x27;s real quiet.  It&#x27;s so quiet at first I thought it wasn&#x27;t very powerful because it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;sound\\&quot; powerful.  But after several months of use I have grown accustomed to it and really like it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do like the stand where I can set it and it stays charged.  And you can rinse the heads under the water faucet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So all in all, I would recommend buying this shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver and says it gives the best shave he&#x27;s ever had!</li>
    <li> The shipment came on time. I did use it as per the instructions, it shave was poor, discomfortable, burning face. Not worthy for the money spent. I&#x27;m not using it any  more</li>
    <li> The razor was bought for my son for Christmas. He said that in order to get a close shave he had to push it up against his skin so hard that he got razor burn from it.  We returned the razor.</li>
    <li> The motor for this shaver goes so slow compared to what I am used to. It feels like the shaver is in slow motion. It takes a long time to shave compared with the remington I used to use. The blade heads stay sharp for about a month, after chich you have to go over and over the same spot.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you how it works other than the fact that I love how my husband&#x27;s face feels after using it.  He seems to like it just great.  We are firm believers in the Norelco brand.  It seems to be very durable.  I bought him this one because he had one that was who-knows-how-many years old.  It was still working fine, but I thought it would be fun for him to get a new one instead of just buying those replacement heads.  That&#x27;s the one thing I don&#x27;t appreciate about corded/cordless razors in general is that it costs so much for replacement heads.  Overall, what a great product!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have owned Norelco shavers for over 40 years and this is by far the best of the lot.  It is fast, shaves close and the battery life is wonderful.  I use it to not only shave my beard but my entire head and neck.  This is the first shaver that allows me to do that without the need to follow up with a blade occasionally.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Norelco that I have owned in 20 years and each time I have been happy with my purchase.  Key features for me is the ability to run on cord or cordless, and of course smooth shave.  In past models the battery has never lasted very long, so I would not buy one without corded capability.  This delivers and this and more.  Motor sounds less powerful, but the efficiency of the shave is superior to previous models. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for almost a year now and it still works and shaves perfectly. Cuts down on shaving time and gives you a nice, clean look.</li>
    <li> This gives me a much closer shave than my previous electric razor, and is comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Bought this beauty in January 2007 and have never had any problems.  Charges perfectly everytime - cleans wonderfully - shaves great.  Everything you need and/or want in a razor - at a great price!    This is a great value razor!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my husband&#x27;s worn-out electric shaver - he loves this one! Says it&#x27;s the best shave he&#x27;s ever gotten from an electric shaver. Our regular Army son tried it out while he was home on leave as well and said the same thing. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor, my husband loves it. (his face never felt so smooth)I love it too!! It charges fast and is easy to rinse off, So far So good!</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco shavers for several years.  This is the best yet.  Doesn&#x27;t let you know how much useable  time is left on the battery if that is important to you. Otherwise works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the shaver for 8 months of daily use.  Gives a clean shave and cleaning it under hot running water is easy and quick.  Much better than the braum it replaced.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Needs to have a low battery indicator  Works fine.  Good shave.</li>
    <li> great shaver, i bought this one to replace a less expensive norelco shaver that i had that the battery charge would only last a bit over one week. this new shaver shaves a lot closer and after 3 weeks i still have not had to recharge the battery. would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> GIVES A GREAT CLOSE SHAVE. I WOULD RECOMEND IT TO EVERYONE. IT IS EASY TO STORE. IT RECHARGES VERY FAST. EASY TO CLEAN.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Phillips Norelco razor after using my last one for 5 years.  I&#x27;ve been using Norelco nearly all my life, and haven&#x27;t found a better razor.  My last razor needed a new head, but rather than replace it, I just decided to update my razor.  Norelco has always given me a clean, smooth shave.  I have never cut myself, and only had a few minor rashes.  I just can&#x27;t imagine a better, easier shave.</li>
    <li> Shaves much quicker than anything I&#x27;ve used.  It has a hard time getting a couple spots on my face though.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent straightforward shaver.  Does equally well on neck, chin and cheeks. Battery last a long time between shaves. Cutter head may be rinsed in plain tap water eliminating the need for a more expensive cumbersome cleaning system. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Norelco and I am satisfied with it. My previous Norelco was a 2 row blade system which I had bought in 2001 used for 6 years. There was nothing wrong with my old shaver, but I thought this shaver would be a substantial improvement over the 2 blade system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that this shaver is overall better than the older 2 blade system. The most significant improvement is the battery life. This shaver uses Lithium Ion batteries which lasts me about 2 months with a single charge (my old shaver lasted about 3 weeks). When you travel, chances are you will not need the recharger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is that the shave, which the 2 blade system did beautifully, is not substantially improved over the 2 blade system. This is not necessarily bad since the 2 blade system was a very good shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the older 2 blade Norelco, you may want to keep it and change the blade once every two years. If you are looking for a new electric shaver, this shaver will give you a beautiful shave in a short duration with a very long battery life.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my husband as a gift.  For the amount of $$ I spent, I expected it to work much better than it did.  Doesn&#x27;t shave very closely and just doesn&#x27;t have much \\&quot;power\\&quot; behind it.  Looks like a sturdy product, just dissatisfied w/ the effectiveness of it.</li>
    <li> I have owned this razor for about 2 years.  This thing holds a charge like no other product I have ever owned.  I think I must charge this razor maybe once a month or every 3 weeks - and I use it daily.    However - the other day the razor stopped taking a charge.  The lights would not light up, and when they did - the \\&quot;full\\&quot; indicator would not light up.  I figured that the \\&quot;full\\&quot; light may be broken... but after a couple of days the razor died and the charge light stopped lighting up.    So I called Customer Service - A recording comes on and says do you want to make a purchase or say \\&quot;other.\\&quot;  I say \\&quot;other\\&quot; and in 20 seconds an ONSHORE CSR answers - asks me 5 or so questions - when you bought it, how you use it, when you charge it, etc.    Then she says a new razor will be sent out to me - and Fexex labels will be included to send my old one back.  WOW!!  It was that easy - No Hassle, no RA#, No send it to a repair facility with a check, no refurb!    Great Razor and A+ customer service - you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Norelco Cool Skin shaver. I had the Cool Skin for 2 years and loved it, but the battery wore out.     The Speed XL 7800XLCC is a waste of money. There is no \\&quot;Speed\\&quot; in this thing at all. The motor is weak, the charge does not last for more than one shave.     It takes a half hour to shave, and the shave still sucks. The heads barely cut.     I am going to send his back to Norelco.     I don&#x27;t know what I will try next. I liked the Cool Skin, but the lotion dispenser is fragile, and I&#x27;d rather have a pop up trimmer.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t complain about this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it in November of 2005, which is nine years ago, and it is still working, and the battery has only just begun to seem like it needs to be charged a little more often (maybe every 2 weeks now - I don&#x27;t keep close track).&lt;br /&gt;Based on longevity alone, I can&#x27;t fault it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shave, &amp;#34;Meh.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cut, scrape, or pull, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t shave super-close, and, frankly, when I replaced the cutters after about 8 years, I didn&#x27;t notice a significant improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect a super-close razor shave when I got it, as I have the kind of beard that produces a five o&#x27;clock shadow at noon, so who would really notice if it showed up at 11, and shaving with an electric is much simpler and faster, and, in an emergency, can be done almost anywhere (I was a medical resident when I bought it, so being able to shave in inhospitable surroundings had become important).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a shaver that will give good service, but aren&#x27;t obsessed with closeness, this one will do the job, and may save you a LOT of money on razors and shaving cream if you use it for as long as I did.</li>
    <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs out of my face like some other razors do.  I&#x27;ve had it for two years now and still like it.</li>
    <li> I bought my first electric shaver about 55 years ago and my first Norelco only a few years later. Since then I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this is by far the best. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I joke that it is a magic shaver, because you don&#x27;t hear anything and don&#x27;t feel anything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a slight exaggeration. You do hear a very slight hum, but it it is so quiet that I really thought something was wrong the first time I used it, but I quickly noticed that whereever it touched my face, the whiskers disappeared. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does cause some minor skin irritation, but it is instantly cured by a few drops of after shave balm. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean, and a charge lasts about two weeks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Very light, very comfortable in your hand. Can&#x27;t find a single negative.</li>
    <li> Razor does not always give a very close shave and at times causes slight abrasions in the area of the chin. It is very easy to clean and holds a charge for at least 15 shaves. I have owned several Norelco razors which provided closer shaves.</li>
    <li> This has been a very durable shaver.  I have used an electric shaver for the past forty years, and this is one of my favorite models.  Wet shave or dry shave, it works well. Replacement heads are easy to install.  I use a pre-shave powder, and this razor is easy to clean.  For everyday purposes, it is a good shave.  It is not as close a shave as I would like--but that is a function of the electric shave process. The Norelco 8140XL is a great shaver.</li>
    <li> I really liked using the 8170XL (didn&#x27;t try the 8140XL), until the hinge at the razor&#x27;s head started rusting.  The head just falls off now...it&#x27;s really easy to rinse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If the 8140XL rusts like the 8170XL, DON&#x27;T BUT IT!</li>
    <li> I got this from my wife as a gift.  It&#x27;s a bad design.  The cleaning light came on after one shave. Trying to put the head guard back onto the blades after cleaning is very tough and frustrating.  Also, with the plastic head guard attached, you can&#x27;t put the shaver in the case that came with it.  The shaver also feels cheap.  Not woth the money at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several electrics over the last 5 or 6 years or so including a Norelco from a couple years ago and most recently a Panasonic Vortex 8178. The Vortex is loud, powerful, and by and large does a great job. I ended up dropping and breaking the Vortex which is why I bought this Norelco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This Norelco does just as good a job as the Vortex, and does so in a much gentler, softer way. It cuts just as close without the loud noise and without the irritation the Vortex can give you at first. This doesn&#x27;t have the fancy cleaning machine like the Vortex does, but that was more trouble than it was worth--you have to buy replacement cartridges and it takes hours on end to clean it. You just rinse this Norelco under the faucet and it&#x27;s as good as new. The only weak spot on this Norelco is its trimmer--it just isn&#x27;t very powerful, not nearly as powerful as the Vortex and even not as good as my old Norelco. But the weak trimmer isn&#x27;t enough to bring my rating down because the shaver works so well overall. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my forties and have never used an electric shaver before.  Got this model for myself as a Christmas present, as of this writing, two weeks of use and am very, very happy with it, with one exception.  I will upgrade my next model so it will have the low battery indicator. My luck with keeping batteries charged and &#x27;healthy&#x27; so they don&#x27;t die completely too early is always a concern and I don&#x27;t want to be bothered with trying to figure out when it&#x27;s best to recharge.  This model is extremely easy to clean by opening the top and running water through it.  Haven&#x27;t yet taken apart the shaver parts and clean monthly as the instruction booklet recommends.</li>
    <li> I have had a Norelco for many years. The batteries were going dead so I decided to get a new razor. GREAT choice. The new speedXL is just that, SPEEDY. It is very easy to empty and clean, open it up and wash it out. I love it and would buy it again and again. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I purchased this model for a christmas present intended for someone that is absolutely AGAINST electric razors. Let&#x27;s just say he uses it all the time now :)</li>
    <li> After using this shaver for 2 years now, I feel it is quicker to shave a disposable razor.  This razor takes as long, if not longer to shave with than the time it takes to prep your face with shave cream, shave, and rinse.  It is doesn&#x27;t actually shave close enough to give a smooth shave either.</li>
    <li> I loved this shaver, easy to use, great shaving, much better to use everyday than a commom shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Regards, &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Michael Rodrigues.</li>
    <li> The 8140 SpeedXL model is the first time I&#x27;ve tried using a Norelco shaver in almost a decade, and the results have been superior to earlier models, equaling the closeness of shave seen with midrange foil models from Braun or Remington. There are some caveats however, as the head is less well suited to going over any given area of the face a single time, and has more difficulty with the areas above and below the lips. Unfortunately, the attached trimmer is one of the worst designs I&#x27;ve seen unless you use it exclusively for thinning out your beard hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This particular unit is very quiet for an electric, and is possessed of a NiMH rechargeable battery making it less apt to developing a crippling \\&quot;memory-effect\\&quot;. This is a plus, and while the battery capacity is not the absolute best, the shaver does seem to recharge rather rapidly. The NiMH battery also reduces the mass of the shaver; the seemingly low-powered motors add little more, making this a very light shaver for it&#x27;s size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  While the closeness of shave is quite comparable to pivoting foil-head models from Braun and some of the dual-foil Remingtons, the Norelco seems to require going over the same &#x27;section&#x27; of skin more times. The area of the head of the shaver is of course larger, so there are fewer total &#x27;sections&#x27; to shave, but the Norelco does seem to take a bit longer, with plenty of touch up needed above and below the lips, the top of the chin, and the neck. Overall however, a very close shave is possible without using a mirror. Beware of shaving with only one of the heads however (as on curvy area of the upper lip), as skin can get pulled uncomfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Norelco touts this shaver as being directly washable, but I would not wash the razor more than monthly, rather mopping up the inside with a piece of tissue three or four times a week (if you have thick, quickly growing hair). Also note that the head section dries rather slowly, and should probably be shook vigorouslydry before reattaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The pop-up trimmer is a disappointment as it seems much lower-powered than Remington or Braun trimmers, requiring more attention in use than it should. Much like the head of the shaver, the trimmer must go over the same section multiple times to get the job done. It&#x27;s not possible to do precise trimming with a corner of the trimmer, and it is also definitely wider than is preferable for precise trimming. Still worse, the trimmer has even more of a tendency to fold back into the main unit than the competition. The sole saving grace of the low-powered trimmer is that it is probably the best design going for trimming and thinning out large areas of beard, mustache and sideburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Barring the trimmer, and using care when shaving the upper lip, this is a high quality design that should stand the test of time. Since it does not have an easily tear-able foil or a bendable head that require replacement, it should also be cheaper to maintain over the long term unless one washes it daily. Finally, the percieved level of irritation induced by the shaver seems comparable to Remington/Braun and less than the thin-foil Panasonics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get around the trimmer and the trade offs inherent in the head design, this shaver is one of the better units on the market, and should serve you well for many years.</li>
    <li> Despite some of the negative reviews of some responders, I have found this shaver to meet all my needs. It shaves close and in reasonably good time.  It does not pull hairs.  It is easy to disassemble and easy to clean.  Also I like not having to adjust for closeness.  It has just one setting and its just fine.  Recommend that buyers buy a replacement head at the time of shaver purchase.  I did not. Prices are high at other retail outlets.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009MFUOA Philips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL Men&#x27;s Shaver]]    I purchased this product for my 86 year old father who must be on a blood thinner-so no more straight razors!  He swore he would never go to an electric razor since the shave could not possibly be close enough.  Well, he is thrilled with this Norelco product.  He says the shave is just as close.  He did mention that the mustache trimmer was a little tricky to use but this could be because his hands are a little shaky these days.  I would recommend this for anyone who is caring for a senior citizen.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the lack of closeness that this razor provides. Would not buy this model again. Probably ok for a younger persons beard that is not too tough.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Norelco shaver and I must say it&#x27;s cheaply built and doesn&#x27;t give the kind of shave I&#x27;m used to with Norelco. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the razor I purchsed.  The delivery was fast and accurate.  The product shaves very well compared to my old razor.  It is light weight and charges very quickly.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Recharging is fast and it lasts for a long time.  Shaving is smooth and it does a good job.</li>
    <li> I finally replaced my old, widely travelled, Norelco Advantage Shaver with the 8140XL. The table on this page is very helpful, as was Brendan&#x27;s detailed review. After the usual struggle with the shrink-wrap, I charged it and put it to work. What a difference! I was amazed at the closeness, speed, and quietness of this newer generation of shaver. I consider it a huge step forward from the older versions. Somewhere in the battle with the shrink-wrap, I must have lost the little cleaning brush, they talk about in the manual. I expected to have it and maybe a little vial of mineral oil packed in the soft case, but no luck. However, it rinses easily, and using any mineral oil will be just fine. Also, for traveling, not having to physically switch it to 220VAC is a nice touch.  What I do not like: The goofy stand. It looks like some store display stand, and lacks the stability and heft of the older Norelco shaver&#x27;s charging stand. I also don&#x27;t like the pins in the charging well of the stand. Flush contacts would have been a better and stronger choice.   All in all I am very pleased with this purchase and with Philips&#x27; 15% off promotion, consider this an excellent deal.</li>
    <li> this is the thrid electric shaver i&#x27;ve tested in my life, and i think i&#x27;ll, stick with it, i&#x27;ve just had it for 2 weeks, but it&#x27;s great, no skin itchinng, no redness in the face, long battery life, i certainly recommend it to anyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nov 2009: Almost two years now with it and i don&#x27;t regret anything, everything like the first day bought</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a lot to get excited about concerning shaving but the [[ASIN:B0009MFUOA Philips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL Men&#x27;s Shaver]] is well designed and gets the job done efficiently and effectively.  It provides a close shave in a minimum amount of time and does so easily and quietly.    I&#x27;ve previous experience using a Braun shaver (about ~10 years) and after that a less expensive Norelco shaver (~5 years) with about half the shaving surface.  Both were adequate, the Norelco being a definite improvement over the earlier Braun shaver.  However, I purchased this one in the hopes that it would be both more efficient (length of time shave) and effective (closeness) and I have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> My wife bought the Philips Norelco 8140XL for me as I&#x27;d been complaining (her patience ran out) about the battery failing in my Norelco 7885XL shaver. I tend to complain a long time before I get around to getting something like that fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave with the 8140XL was just ok. The shaver runs quietly until you actually shave. The heads are straining in their cheap plastic support frame.  Philips Norelco has really cheapened the product if this is any example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality of the 8140XL is just plain cheap. The plastic seems to be the same type found in the cheapest consumer electronics components these days .. that silver powdery look. That must be why the shaver doesn&#x27;t weigh much The shaver is constructed of it as is the &#x27;automatic charging stand&#x27; that&#x27;s just a base with a pass-through wire from the plug-in charger. The plug-in charger cable isn&#x27;t coiled. It&#x27;s a cheap long black thin cable, way too long for the average bathroom vanity, and probably won&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sending this back. It&#x27;s something to use while my 7885XL gets repaired and will sit in the cabinet beyond that.  The 7885XL shaver is well constructed. The plug-in charger has a nice coiled cord.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with Norelco shavers for about 20 years and the 8140XL is what might be called an incremental improvement over the 835RX that I have had for years.  The 8140 gives me a slightly closer, and a little more comfortable shave, but not a great improvement in these areas.  The 8140 is certainly lighter and quieter, and gives me more shaves per battery recharge.  I suspect it won&#x27;t last as long as the 835, but only time will tell.  Knowing what I know now I probably would have waited till the 835 stopped working to buy a new razor but would still have purchased the 8140.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver in early January of 2007.  For the first month or so that I had it, it worked decently.  The shave was relatively close and it did get most of the hair, but it did take a few passes over the skin, and a touch-up using the on-board trimmer to get the ones it missed.  I also found myself having the stretch the skin quite a bit to get a close enough shave.  However, it did offer an irritation-free shave (I have sensitive skin, thus why I stay away from blade razors).    Over the next few months, though, I noticed that the shave started to get more irritating: more &#x27;pulling&#x27; instead of cutting (had always pulled a little, but got more frequent), takes more passes to cut what it once would, etc.  I changed the blades after 3 months (short period, yes, but I tried anyway).  It helped a little, but it still wasn&#x27;t as good as it once was.  Then, I started to realize that the shaver wasn&#x27;t holding as strong a charge as it once did.  It would come off the charger and be &#x27;full power&#x27; for less than one shave, and would need to go back on the charger after 6 shaves (far less than the advertised two weeks).  A call to Norelco led nowhere, as they said it was &#x27;expected&#x27; for the battery to wear down over time (4 months?).    I kept using the razor as I wasn&#x27;t about to waste the $90 investment.  On a trip in late July, I had forgotten to pack the shaver, so I purchased a $10 Remington battery-operated foil razor at a local convenience store.  Sad to say, but from Day 1 that foil razor has outperformed the Norelco by leaps and bounds in all areas (closer shave, gets all areas better, less passes needed, etc.).  Also on a sad note, the Remington is kicking the bucket (a year later), and I am forced to go back to the Norelco for the time being while I look for an acceptable foil shaver as a replacement.    In short, this razor performed decently at first, but it seems as though compared to a $10 battery operated razor, this $70 shaver isn&#x27;t a good value for the investment.</li>
    <li> What impressed me about this shaver is how quiet it is. I retired and have slipped into twice a week shaving so I was looking for something that could cut effortlessly through the stubble quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t.  The motor seems underpowered.  After many passes there are always a few whiskers left standing that I have go back and give special attention.  It also pulls more than I was expecting and leaves my face slightly irratated.  I have had this shaver for 6 weeks and it is still running on the first charge, but battery life is not a big concern to me.  I think that if I were to shave daily, ugh, it would perform much better.</li>
    <li> This shaver works very well, and has a very long battery life before you have to recharge. Cuts very smooth, and is easy to clean. No complaints, I have always been happy with Philips shavers.</li>
    <li> I had owned a Norelco rotary shaver years ago (1970s) and it worked well; eventually the battery would not take a charge (rechargeables back then were always having this problem). I replaced it with a regular (non-rotary) rechargeable electric razor. When that one finally died, I tried a Norelco rotary again--and it would not give me a good shave and I returned it. I went through a few more non-rotary electric razors since then, usually Remington models and one Braun (the latter was really nice, but expensive and also expensive to maintain as it was one of the self-cleaning models and the cleaning solution was expensive and never lasted quite as long as they claimed). My current razor, a Remington non-rotary has seen better days so I decided to get a new one and tried this Norelco rotary. Big mistake (I should have learned from my last Norelco rotary shaver experience!). I have a tough beard but VERY sensitive skin. I could not get a close shave with this shaver. I had to keep going over the same area multiple times and it still did not shave as well as the old Remington model (which has not had the blades replaced in over a year). Now I&#x27;m stuck with this piece of junk, since Amazon doesn&#x27;t take back opened merchandise.</li>
    <li> This shaver is light-weight and recharges quickly. It is so quiet that I sometimes think it is losing power prior to failing, but it does not. It just continues running. It is recommended that the recharging stand be disconnected from the AC in between recharges, so the most absurd thing about this new shaver is that the owner is constantly having to plug and unplug the AC plug to the recharging stand. I don&#x27;t understand why Philips didn&#x27;t provide a simple on/off switch on the recharging stand such as the one on the shaver itself. I also found that the cleaning brush is too short to clean the long thin connections inside the razor head. It is O.K. for the blades though, and I am able to blow the beard cuttings out with an air hose. I also use a wire bristle brush from a another brand of razor that I formerly owned.</li>
    <li> Have owned and used about six electric shavers.  Without a doubt, this is the best one of all. Close shaves as good a razer.  Easy to clean by running under the faucet. Been using it for about a year.</li>
    <li> Shaver just works great as advertised, had one earlier that lasted more than 5 years...Thanks to Amazon for speedy shipping.</li>
    <li> This shaver works great!  The blades shave really close, and I love the fact that I can clean and rinse it under water after I use it.  The charge stand is nice as well... keeps it safely stored away, and I always know where it is.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a nice shaver, but if you skip a day of shaving you really notice the pull on the whiskers.  I figured that would happen when it got dull after a few months but it was that way out of the box.  Also, the light that&#x27;s supposed to come on when you need to recharge doesn&#x27;t.  Not sure if I got a lemon, but I&#x27;m not super impressed.  But I just make sure I shave every day and no whisker pulling.  Also didn&#x27;t get everything I was supposed to get in the package.  Missing the cleaning brush, but I can use my old shaver brush.  Not a huge deal by itself, but when added to the whisker pulling, and lack of recharge notice, not overly happy.  Hope others have had good luck with this one.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Norelco I have had. I love it. It is similar to the XL model I had before and I use both in the shower. I use a wet razor first, with shaving cream, although I don&#x27;t have to and I finish with the electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor sounds like it is running slower than my old one, but it cuts faster and smoother. It has more cutting area on the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> my husband had been considering switching to an electric razor for years but the ones he had previously tried all seemed to pull at the hair rather than cut it cleanly.  i did some research and got him this for a x-mas present.  it has worked wonderfully.  it has a nice clean shave,  maybe not quite as good as a regular straight razor but certainly does the job for everyday needs.</li>
    <li> I have only have the Norelco 8140 for about a week, but I am already impressed with it.  I have used a Norelco in the past, but I have been using a Braun foil shaver for the last 6 years.  The first thing I noticed about the Norelco was how quiet it was.  It sounded like my Braun right before it lost all power.  So I was really impressed with how quiet the new models are.  The shaver works very good, although it does not get around my neck as close as I would like. (my old braun is a little better around the neck).  Shaving also takes about 1/2 the time as my Braun.  So overall I am very impressed with the Norelco 8140.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for years with electric shavers.  Back when Remingtons were still made in USA and Norelco&#x27;s in Japan. This shaver is good.  It is very quiet. The shave isn&#x27;t as close as the older model 850RX. My cheap Wahl shaves closer and faster but is far too noisy.  &lt;br /&gt;The batteries would give many shaves if I didn&#x27;t have to spend so much time getting a close shave. Because of the time it takes and the marginal quality of the closness I could not give it more than 3 stars. &lt;br /&gt;One for being quiet, one for being non-irritating, and one for overall construction quality. &lt;br /&gt;But it lost one for being a slow shaver, and lost one for not shaving closer. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Actually, by the time you hit Medicare, you&#x27;ve shaved a bunch!  and this is definitely the best shaver ever.  I&#x27;ve owned 4, kept giving up and going back to a blade, got tired of the blade, you know the drill. &lt;br /&gt;This one is quiet,very quick, smoother shave than ANY blade, and a total pleasure.   &lt;br /&gt;This one is a definite \\&quot;recommend\\&quot;.  Thanks to the manufacturer for continuing to improve and upgrade to reach this point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve switched from using BIC throw away razors to the 8150XL and now it takes me three times longer to get rid of all the stubble. Even after wasting all that time I still find it necessary to go over my face with a throw away razor. (And, I have lite facial hair; I pity the guy that must use this on anything heavier).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using it only when I absolutely need to do a dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, on the positive side, the ergonomic design is cute, the LEDs are bright and cheerful, and the stand holds the shaver well.</li>
    <li> This item works well. The newer version contains a \\&quot;warning\\&quot; when the battery is low. Other than that, its a great item, and worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace an older Norelco I had.  After reading the reviews on here this one sounded like what I wanted and was at a price I was willing to pay.  I was a bit surprised by it as it is much quieter than my old one, which is nice early in the morning when I&#x27;m trying to be as quiet as I can so I don&#x27;t disturb my wife.  The razor is a bit deceiving in that it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s putting out much power, but it cuts right through my whiskers with ease.  I find it a bit tougher though cutting under my nose than I did with my old one, but I think as I become more comfortable with this one that will change.  It, like my old one, is extremely easy to clean which is another big plus for me early in the morning.  Overall, the razor isn&#x27;t as heavy as my old one, so it&#x27;s easier to handle.  The three independent heads make it nice shaving on the chin as I&#x27;m getting closer shaves now than I did with the old one that didn&#x27;t have the independent heads.  I would definitely recommend this razor for those looking for a good shave at a price that won&#x27;t take your breath away.</li>
    <li> Having been connected with the Marine Corps for over 40 years, early in my career I began searching for a blade replacement because I had sensitive skin and was often cutting myself.  It didn&#x27;t take long to realize that with a foil shaver, the slightest rip in the foil could cause a good amount of bloodletting. So over the years the quest has been to find the best rotary. I thought the state of the art had been exhausted until I encountered the 8140XL. Although it doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles, it does give a close shave having the greater shaving area; gives a faster shave. I am surprised how powerful, yet quiet it is, and always holds a charge for at least 2 weeks. Am most satisfied.</li>
    <li> I had an old Norelco that worked pretty well, but I broke it somehow...I ordered the 8140XL as a replacement and I was not satisfied.  It left stray hairs all over my face which looked terrible.  I had to use the Norelco follwed up by a mach3 everytime that I shaved to the point where I returned thr item.  I have a very tough beard, but I find that I get somewhat better results from my brothers electric Braun than I did with this Norelco.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ved used electric shavers basically all of my adult life.  None have been perfect and none have been lousy.  This one is no exception.  If you&#x27;ve been using an electric and are just looking for a replacement (as I was), this is a fine choice.  If you&#x27;re a blade user and looking to convert to electric, this one isn&#x27;t going to win you over, most likely.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good points: &lt;br /&gt;holds charge for 10 days! &lt;br /&gt;easy to clean &lt;br /&gt;lightweight and good contour for holding &lt;br /&gt;decent, if not perfect, shave  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bad points: &lt;br /&gt;Not as close as a blade &lt;br /&gt;No warning when the battery is about to die.  It just stops.  Fortunately, if you charge it for a couple of minutes, you can finish your shave.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever had.  I have been using Norelco shavers for years.</li>
    <li> I find that I don&#x27;t get a shave that is any closer than I got from my old Remington. &lt;br /&gt;I also feel that the MSRP on this item warrants an alert when the battery gets low. &lt;br /&gt;A personal family problem caused me to bypass the 60 day return warranty.(Don&#x27;t get old: let them shoot you first!)</li>
    <li> I gave this razor the 1 month trial period, and while it does shave and charge very quickly, it still falls short in the neck area as most electrics do. For those who enjoy rotary electrics, this is a quiet razor that fully charges in an hour and does the job well enough.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  Have used it for about a month now and no problems.  It really does shave faster than previous Norelco models.  I love the fact that you can just rinse it out.  Much better than sitting there with a brush and getting all the little hairs out.  Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver. I have shaved using disposable razors for years, and I was reluctant to switch because I had tried a cheap electric shaver and found it very uncomfortable. I was very pleased with this shaver. Not quite as close a shave as I am used to, but much more convenient. One thing I was impressed with is that the first charge of the battery lasted at least 3 weeks with daily shaving.    Update 1-26-2010: After 3 years, this shaver still runs 2-3 weeks on a charge with daily shaving.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Smooth and powerful. Good close shave. Slick design.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. As with any typical male, I really hate to shave. This is my very 1st electric razor. So far it&#x27;s been great to me. I gave it 5stars although I do wish it could get a closer shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Norelco shaver for ten years and it&#x27;s still running but I figured I&#x27;d try a newer one. I&#x27;m not disappointed. The new shaver is much better with a closer, cleaner, less irritating shave. I hope this one lasts as long as the first.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t wake up the family if one shaves at 4.30 a.m. because Norelco&#x27;s are quiet. It won&#x27;t hurt the skin because the blades do not irritate the skin.  All in all, this is just a very good electric shave.  Easy to clean, too.</li>
    <li> I have used blade and electric off and on. My beard grows patchy, with some areas growing fast and others not so fast. Also, I have some straight areas and other curved areas.  &lt;br /&gt;  I did the full 21 days and found that this razor is close and does not irritate my skin so that instead of using a blade every other day (and wondering if my patchy shadow will pass on day 2), I can shave every morning. In addition, it is light and quiet, so that shaving is a not so bad experience. The best is that I can rinse it under the sink. The other foil I used previously irritated my skin after a while and didn&#x27;t rinse at all, so I am pleased &lt;br /&gt;  I think the expanded cutting area makes the shave better.</li>
    <li> My old Norelco was better, more sturdy. This one is lighter - a plus - but being lighter seems to make it somewhat flimsier. Worse, despite the \\&quot;improved\\&quot; shaving heads with 50% more shaving surface, the shaving time takes much longer, which took me by surprise. I&#x27;m not sure why the longer shaving time, but I sense that the shavers spin slower than my old Norelco. It is quiet, which was important to me, and, ultimately, I do get a fairly close shave. The pop-up trimmer works fine and the recharging stand is convenient.  I like the form-fitted case. The head opens too easily, so I&#x27;m forever cleaning up shaving stubble due to accidental openings. I cannot comment on the battery life, as it is still too new to see how economical the shaver is, however I can say that a full charge lasts me about a week (five shaves). Overall, I&#x27;m fairly satisfied, notwithstanding the above disappointments, but I cannot say I&#x27;m \\&quot;wowed\\&quot; by this new model over my older model.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t to impressed for the amount of money I spent but that is just how the cookie crumbles.  It doesn&#x27;t really deliver a good shave without causing you  to bleed profusely from pressing it hard against your face.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is actually a pretty good shaver.  As with any electric shaver, it takes a bit of effort to really get a close shave, but for someone with sensitive skin like myself, its a whole lot better than a regular blade.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Braun shaver that was about 5-6 years old. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, and here are my pros and cons.    Pros:  -I love the trimmer. It&#x27;s far enough away from the cutters to make trimming easy, and it does wonders for my skin as a pre-shave in case I missed a day. That might actually be the best part of the product.  -It&#x27;s very quiet. I can shave at night without disturbing anyone. My last shaver sounded like a wood chipper, so this is a welcome feature.  -Cleaning isn&#x27;t much of a hassle. (This isn&#x27;t a great pro, but it is worth mentioning.)  -Affordable, which is probably why I&#x27;m not sending it back. If I spent $100+ on it, it wouldn&#x27;t be in my house right now, but the current price is what attracted me in the first place.    Cons:  -To be honest, it doesn&#x27;t really come through with a complete or very close shave. It still leaves many hairs, especially on my neck, and I can still feel a little bit of stubble, even after going over my skin enough times to chop it to bits.  -Irritation is still a problem. I have the unfortunate combination of coarse hair and sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s very hard to get a close and comfortable shave. This doesn&#x27;t help. I end up cutting myself about half the time in order to get a full shave, and in some cases, the razor burn is brutal. I find myself applying aftershave at least twice after a regular shave.  -The design makes it difficult to shave particular places, like under my sideburns and above my mouth. Having a wide face is good for shaving a larger surface area, but it makes finer shaving a bit clumsy.    Honestly, this unit should be better. If I didn&#x27;t need a new foil on my old razor (which would be about $30 after shipping), I would almost be financially obligated to send this one back. For its main functions, it really isn&#x27;t an improvement on my old razor, which is disappointing when you consider that this is new and carries a trusted brand name. Some of the other features provide added convenience, but I didn&#x27;t buy this just to have a quiet trimmer.</li>
    <li> this shaver is the best I got. power shaving. smooth cutting. long lasting energy. fast charging.</li>
    <li> Well all I can say is that it is very light to hold &amp; does a good job on my beard. I have used it for three weeks &amp; find it to be suitable for my needs. So I give it a five star rating.  Robert,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about three weeks and I am very pleased with it.  It is quiet and gives a close shave.  It replaced an eight year old norelco and at this point I do not have any complaints.</li>
    <li> Have used a 5810 XL for a few years now and been very happy with it.  Unfortunately the trimmer broke, so I bought an 8140 XL.    Improvements ...  - Quieter  - Lasts longer before it needs to be recharged  - Trimmer works much better than the 5810  - Nice to simply clean the heads with water, not having to pull it apart regularly for cleaning.    But ...  This new shaver doesn&#x27;t actually shave as well as the old 5810.  It&#x27;s not much different on my face, but is not effective at shaving neck hairs.  It takes roughly 3x as long to fully shave with the 8140 as it did with the 5810, and the 5810 gives better results.  I&#x27;ve consulted with my barber, who has suggested a couple things, but to no avail.    In my assessment, the improvements are meaningless if it doesn&#x27;t shave well.  Hence my low rating of this shaver.</li>
    <li> Norelco has definitely gone downhill since being acquired by Phillips.    This unit is too light and cheaply built. The engineers opted for light, quiet, and battery capacity at the expense of sturdy, efficient, and useful.    The blades spin much more slowly than with previous models. I am sure this makes it quieter and makes the batteries last longer (friction being proportional to the cube of velocity?), but the shave is not as good and it pulls at times.    Make the blades go faster. Put in a bigger battery or accept a shorter time between charges.</li>
    <li> when you buy a new norelco, you expect to get some improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have been using norelcos my full life! I am not truly dissapointed by this one, but it nothing close to a \\&quot;manual razor\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard grows in all directions, so it is quite dificult to get all the hairs in a couple of passes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to go over the same place quite a few times, and I don&#x27;t feel like it is as soft as \\&quot;just shaved\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as bad as needing a new shave in early afternoon... but the hairs are there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for more than a month, everyday... and it might have imporved a little bit from the first days, but it still is not the perfect shaver.</li>
    <li> bought this and it is quiet and works great holds a charge.  Then the clip holding it broke.  Got a new head replacement from seller and great service.  All in all I am very happy about this purchase...</li>
    <li> [ASIN:B0009MFUOA Philips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL Men&#x27;s Shaver]]    I have been using a Norelco 6826XL. I recently bought a Norelco 8140 SpeedXL.     The cutting heads of the 8140 SpeedXL seem to rotate slower (less RPM) than the 6826XL. It seems to take me more time to shave. I  have to keep going over the same areas to shave. Cutting quality in my opinion is only fair--I can not seem to get a close enough shave.    Also, I like the heavier weight of the 6826XL rather that the light weight of the 8140 SpeedXL. I am going to try other razors to find a faster and better shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great electic razor at a great price! I love it and have been impressed so far. Time will tell if it continues to keep a charge and provides a close shave. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I expected a close shave like I get with a blade, but that isn&#x27;t so. My beard is kinda heavy so this shaver works better if I shaved the day before. It doesn&#x27;t work as well if I have to chop through a lot of growth. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I still love it.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for many years, I guess 8 different models. I am so dissappointed with this on, its so noisy, heads are not adjustable any more on the midrange razors, I will never buy this brand again. I am sure their top line is better but who will pay $140 for a razor?</li>
    <li> I am a very lazy guy, who always had a beard on my face. After buying this, I started shaving very regularly because of its convenience (no soap and water on my face anymore :). Pretty much it gives a close shave. Very little noise and long battery life (once charged fully, no need to charge for next 10 shaves). I did not write this review earlier because, I thought that my interest towards this product will fade away as it happens with all new products that we buy. But after 45 days also, it did not happen. Nowadays, I always want to be with a clean shaved face. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my husband   The shave head broke the rod holding heads within third week of ownership  Now the heads are destoryed  The body mechanical system is destoryed   I believe that less than 3 weeks of use for the expense of @ $80.00 is too much   There are no replacement parts available   tjc</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband and he said that It works very well, charge lasts a long time. But he wish it had more power like his old Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I am more than pleased with its performance. It took a few days to get used to using an electric razor but now I find it is a much easier and pain-free shave. So far it seems very rugged, battery life is good, and it is easy to clean. Really can&#x27;t ask for more other than a lower price.</li>
    <li> This is probably at least my 7th Norelco Razor. I purchased it becuase of the advertised larger cutting surface. I find that it does not cut  quite as good as some of the older models with, I beleive 6 &amp; 7 style cutting blades. Its OK, but I expected better.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor over 2 years ago and I am still using it.  I really love the charger stand since I can leave it plugged in and charge the razor on it when needed.  I have had problems with cords going bad after repeatedly plugging them into a razor and unplugging them.  With the stand that is no longer a problem.  It is not as close of a shave as a Remington, but I prefer Norelco because they seem better at getting everything and not missing the thicker ones.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used norelco shavers for the last 20 years. i&#x27;ve tried other electric shavers, but with my softer whiskers, norelco shavers with their floating heads seemed to work best. however, even with my previous quadra action norelco shaver, i sometimes had to touch up spots that the shaver missed with a regular razor blade. this shaver shaves so close that i have actually cut myself. it is very light weight and the first battery charge lasted me a month. this is a great shaver and now the only razor i&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
    <li> Used Norelcos for about 10 years now; most recent is the Norelco Spectra.  Decided to try this new shaver and I have to say that this is my first Noreclo that does more then lift and cut hairs.  It actually pulls the hairs right off your face.  I guess you can&#x27;t get a closer shave than that and it will definitely wake you up in the morning.  I tried to get used to it, but ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s old Norelco fizzed out and he decided to try a Remington he purchaed on Amazon.  BIG MISTAKE! The shaver gave a terrible shave and just didn&#x27;t come up to the Norelco standards.  I purchased a new Norelco 8140 XL Shaver for him for his birthday on Amazon and he is extremely happy with his new Norelco.  He&#x27;s getting a great smoothe shave, and he will be sticking with Norelco in the future.</li>
    <li> I had to return the new style 1050 razor and get this one.  This one shaves me much better and the batteries stayed charged for several days.</li>
    <li> I loved my previous Norelco.  It lasted over a decade.  I bought this as a replacement, and it went dead in a matter of months.  It just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any longer.  I sent it back, and customer service was promt in replacing it.  Then the same thing happened again a few months later.  This is too much hassle for the amount of money this razor costs.  I went and bought a $30 Braun that has been going strong for a couple years without any problem.</li>
    <li> According to my Amazon&#x27;s purchase records, I bought this shaver back in June 2008 and I&#x27;ve used it almost exclusively up until recently when it was replaced by a [[ASIN:B000PKNPES Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] not because it stopped working but because the Arcitec was on sale for a price where it made more sense to buy a brand-new shaver than to replace the old SpeedXL&#x27;s shaving heads. As of now, the SpeedXL is still in perfect working order and it&#x27;s likely to be one of my kids first shavers when they are going to need a first shaver (soon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this only to testify to the quality of this product. I had no problems with it whatsoever, it never let me down, the battery still holds enough charge for maybe half a dozen shaves, runs as silently as on day one and it&#x27;s a near-zero maintenance item, requiring nothing beyond the heads cleaning after each shave by placing them under the faucet. The one issue I had was that the skin on my neck got irritated from time to time but it was never anything major that wouldn&#x27;t go away after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Si, it&#x27;s goodbye to the SpeedXL for me (hello Arcitec) but it&#x27;s not this shaver&#x27;s end of career. It&#x27;s going to be in service, again, in about a year or two, who knows for how much longer :)</li>
    <li> Its just perfect....I have been looking for something that doesnt bother me to shave. This is just great. &lt;br /&gt;U can shave while you are watching TV, is for use before or after shower. &lt;br /&gt;I have troubes with the razors because makes me cuts and irritation on my skin. &lt;br /&gt;I own this norelco for 2 weeks I am very happy. And also they have 60 days money back gurantee.</li>
    <li> I researched and researched and then I researched some more and eventually selected the 8140.  While I do like the unit, it does not shave as close as a blade.  It is quicker then shaving with a blade, easier, there&#x27;s no mess, etc.  The unit is also exceptionally quiet compared to other electric razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It&#x27;s lighter then I would have expected.  The new head design is also more advanced then Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past and it does a better job in tough spots like your chin.  I have no intentions of returning the unit and I will continue to use it happily, but it does not shave as close as a blade.  The good thing is that when you come home from work with that 5-o&#x27;clock shadow, you can spend less then 60 seconds running it over your face to get a quick clean up. Lastly, it&#x27;s a nice looking shaver and having the ability to clean it under the tap is great.  I do recommend this product.    UPDATE JANUARY 2009 - I&#x27;ve been using this razor at least 5 times per week since originally posting this write up.  A charge still lasts a good two weeks.  I&#x27;ve replaced the blades once.  I&#x27;m still very happy with this unit.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my dad and he loves it. He had Norelco before but the battery died and the new battery didnt perform as good as the old one. So we got him this one. He loves the fact that he can wash it to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There might be other products with extra features but ask yourself : Do I really need the shiny digital display or Do I have to have the X feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy 8140XL and trust me you will love it.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for 6 weeks now (that&#x27;s past the 3 week adjustment period) and overall I am disappointed with it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First, what I like about the razor: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The quick rinse cleaning is a very nice feature and the reason why I choose this razor.  I am not very good about cleaning the razors. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is on a spring release that works much better than my old Norelco&#x27;s trimmer that took some force to open. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Indicators to let you know when to recharge and when the razor is at full charge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I did not like about the razor: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the other posts who said the larger blades did not seem to make a difference from older razors, I must agree. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The charger light is only a light, not a gauge.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the subject of charging, the manual says that you should not let the razor sit in the charger to preserve the internal battery.  This can be a real problem since I shave close to the time I am leaving.  So, I don&#x27;t have the time to wait and remembering to charge it when I get home usually doesn&#x27;t happen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although quiet (something that I could not care less about) it feels weak.  I find myself constantly checking to see if it needs recharging.  My problem areas were not solved by this newer razor with larger blades and my shaving time was not reduced. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Better make sure you are happy with your shave before rinsing the razor.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I find it works great if I skip a day of shaving, but daily shaving and 2 days or more of growth can give this razor trouble.</li>
    <li> I found this shaver to be a really good shaver for me.  It&#x27;s quiet, quick and does not irritate my skin at all.  Fully charged, it gives me quite a few shaves before it needs recharging.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This shaver is extremely light and almost silent. The battery holds the charge a long time and delivers even power throughout the lifetime of the charge instead of getting gradually weaker. It is very nice to be able to clean the razor by rinsing. It is very gentle to sensitive skin, but does a good job of giving as close a shave as can be expected from an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I decided to get rid of my last electric shaver (Panasonic ES8152NC) and go back to using a rotary one, so after looking around and reading reviews I deided to buy this shaver.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The good things about it were that it looked cool, it was extremely easy to clean after each shave, and the battery lasts a long time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem was that this thing can&#x27;t cut.  When I first got it, it would sometimes pull hairs. I thought I just needed to get used to rotary head shaver again, but it&#x27;s now been 1.5 months  and it&#x27;s gotten worse. I have to go over the same are several times and it pulls hairs constantly... I even use the pre-lectric  preshave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine more than 6 months now, and I don&#x27;t seem to have any of the problems other reviewers have written about.  A full charge lasts about one month.  Yes, the RPMs are slower, and it is quiet running, but I have never been able to stall it by pressing too hard on the foils.  Sometimes, I will shave stubble that is several days old, and it has no problem with that.  The only DOWN SIDE is when I am shaving my upper lip -- if I get too close to my nose, the edge of the cutters will grab a nose hair and yank it out, rather than cutting it. Ouch! I quit using Norelco after using them for 30 years, but I am glad that I returned to buy this one.  My greatest complaint about the older Norelco&#x27;s was that the blades would become DULL in less than a year, and new blades cost almost as much as a NEW razor.  Norelco has a HIT with this razor by adding 50-percent more cutting area in the triple-heads.</li>
    <li> I would rate it at 5 starts except that the power switch is no longer working. I expect a razor to be trouble free for 4-6 years. &lt;br /&gt;Could it be related to the water cleaning? If I was careless it would have shown up in the first few days or weeks.  It seems to me that a minute amount of moisture can seep down the back--into the trimmer area and then what may happen over time?? Or did the switch go bad?  Or did some water get into the switch? How water proof is it over the long term?</li>
    <li> Does a good job, almost as good as a blade. The advantage is that you can easily use it again the same day if needed. Good battery life too.</li>
    <li> This Norelco is powerful and quiet (as are many shavers).  But the multiple shaving rings reduce the shaving time by a third (even for a heavy beard). Of equal importance is that the shaver cleans up with hot water and does not  have to use some solution that results in an additional monthly cost and effort.  If you want to pay monthly, buy blades and shaving cream (they give a better shave as well).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this since the beginning of Dec. &#x27;06, and so far, I&#x27;m impressed. The initial charge lasted about 2 weeks. The second charge is lasting almost 4 weeks - shaving 4 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The increased shaving area definitely cuts down on shaving time. And, don&#x27;t let it&#x27;s low weight fool you. In terms of \\&quot;closeness,\\&quot; it does a very good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is very easy - just rinse under water. It&#x27;s recommended to take apart the cleaning heads once a month to clean. Again, very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to this model after several years using a Braun. The Braun did fine, but if the outer \\&quot;foil\\&quot; was damaged (small breaks in the metal), you were out of luck, had to buy replacement parts and be lucky that your face didn&#x27;t get cut up in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> i bought this gift for my husband and he enjoys it.  he has sensitive skin and has been through many electric shavers.  after a few days it was easy for his skin to adjust to it.  he says it&#x27;s a good bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> The shaver is portable and replaced our 25 year old Norelco shaver.  They are excellent shavers.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and it works great.  I got 2 as gifts and they love it.</li>
    <li> This razor is junk.  I have had several Norelco razors over the years and this one, as well as their entire current product line, is junk.  First, the cord is not coiled and has a \\&quot;wall wart\\&quot;.  Second, you have to pay $40 extra to get a model that includes a travel pouch - travel pouches used to be included with all of their razors.  The power cord doesn&#x27;t fit in the travel pouch - which is odd given that one of the features of the razor is that it can handle world voltage.  Third, the plastic cover for the blades doesn&#x27;t cover the entire shaving surface so any of the \\&quot;whisker dust\\&quot; left in the razor is likely to fall out and make a mess.  Finally, the charging stand is a poorly conceived feature.  The razor can only be stored in the stand when plugged in if the razor needs charging, otherwise, the stand needs to be unplugged.  I never saw any value to these charging stands but, for the person that wants it, it seems that they will be spending an inordinate amount of time plugging and unplugging the power cord. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping the razor because I don&#x27;t have time to invest in finding something else. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As far as shaving, this razor is adequate.  The heads move around quite a bit in the head assembly so I&#x27;m not sure how durable this unit will be.  Despite the manufacturer&#x27;s claims of superlative shaving, the shave is completely typical of all of the electric razors I have used - not horrible but nothing incredible.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, this razor (as well as the current line) is a classic case of a manufacturer cutting value and quality while inreasing costs and claiming more features.  Clearly, the only people who will be excited with this product are first-time electric razor users.</li>
    <li> What a surprise! My face is certainly better off with any blade, but I had grown VERY tired of spending the money on 17 blades of stainless steel. So for the last 4 years I&#x27;ve had a \\&quot;linear\\&quot; Panasonic electric which did ok, after I had lightly gone over my face with a cheap 2-blade disposable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My razor(s) had been left on our last vacation and I picked up this one at WalMart expecting to return it. WOW! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It seems kinda cheaply made at first - very light, not much vroom in the motor, etc. But when the first charge lasted 5 weeks I understood why! It really doesn&#x27;t take much power to spin the blades fast (good gearing) or cut one day of whiskers. It really is a joy to own. For a week long vacation you don&#x27;t even need to take the stand.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is the ergonomic design of the whole body - an S shape that fits comfortably in your hand up or down or sides.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And yes the shave for my medium beard is VERY close! No more disposables!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I certainly I hope I can replace the battery!</li>
    <li> It is quiet while powerful.  I get consistently very close shaves. I am very happy with my model 8140XL.</li>
    <li> Having used Norelco razors for the past 25 years, they keep getting better.  This is the ultimate in shaving comfort; close, clean and very comfortable.  The razor is lightweght and I&#x27;m still shaving (1 month) on the initial charge!  This razor is a bargain at $79.</li>
    <li> The major convienence with this razor is washing the blades out with hot water. No tedious brushing is required. Let it air dry and it is ready to use again. Of course the shave is no match to a blade for closeness but very good for an electric razor.</li>
    <li> This is by far the quietest shaver I&#x27;ve owned (after a Braun and a Remington) since I gave up blade shaving. It also gives me the best shave with the least amount of stretching and fewest second passes. &lt;br /&gt;Very little not to like: a quibble is that the connection to the dock can be difficult and a pain when in a hurry.  Maybe I&#x27;ve yet to master it. &lt;br /&gt;Only had the shaver a couple of months but so far it&#x27;s totally satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for years and have always been happy with their razors.  This razor is no exception - it works well and is comfortable to use.  Surprisingly, the razor itself has a cheap, toy-like feel to it.The good news is that it has a two year warranty but I am not very confident that it will last much beyond that two year mark.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace a literally 12 year old Norelco.  Frankly, not much has changed over 12 years.  Cutting quality is the same (sad, when as I&#x27;m comparing against never oiled, never cleaned 12 year old razor).  I do like the easy-cleaning, washable heads... this is worth the upgrade.</li>
    <li> I was deeply disappointed with my recent purchase of the Philips Norelco 8140XL.  :-(  It was so under-powered that I returned it.  I had a full charge but it didn&#x27;t cut and I ended up using my blade.&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping the Norelco corded razors have more power!!!&lt;br /&gt;On the 8140XL don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!  If they had a rating of \\&quot;0\\&quot; stars I would have put that down.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly :-(((</li>
    <li> This shaver was a Christmas present for my Husband and he loves it. I read through reviews for about every brand before selecting this one and it was worth the time. He says it&#x27;s the best shaver he&#x27;s ever owned. For the price, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a better shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my second Norelco shaver and the 8140 XL is much improved from earlier ones. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for about three weeks now. It works very fine right out of the box. was fully charged ready to go. I am very pleased with thsi razor.</li>
    <li> Have been a Norelco user for years and each replacement shaver is usually a bit of an upgrade.This model has very nice features and is easy to use/clean. I get a great shave, in a short time. If your a Norelco man, then I recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for a year and am quite pleased with it.  But, if I were to buy again, I would probably go with the lower-cost 7xxx series.  There are a few more features on the 8140XL -- the charging stand and full charge LED -- but basically Norelco makes a decent electric shaver.  Upsides:  1) One significant benefit is the LONG time before the battery needs to be recharged -- perhaps a combination of using a good battery and low power requirements. I have taken it on a week-long business trip without bringing the charger.    Downsides:   1) $45 for a set of replacement blades is high. However, after a year, the original blade set is still adequate.    2) A \\&quot;needs charging\\&quot; LED would be useful.     Note that my shaver gets relatively light usage -- my beard is not overly thick, and I use a Gillette blade after not shaving over the weekend -- a blade gives a much quicker and better shave on a couple days&#x27; growth.  This Norelco gets used Monday-Friday. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this shaver and am glad to see Norelco back with a quality product.</li>
    <li> Have had this razor a few months now, and it&#x27;s been perfect. I bought it to replace the Braun razor I&#x27;ve had for the past few years, for which I was always having to spend $4 a month on for the cleaning fluid. This one is more like I&#x27;m used to...free cleaning. Gives a cleaner shave as well. With the Braun, it just didn&#x27;t shave certain types of hairs, and I&#x27;d have to pull them out with tweezers. This one just lops everything off...no problem, and close. Perfect razon, and great price as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers of one form or another for over fifty years, and this one I rate as the best yet.     First it&#x27;s one of the most comfortable. I can comfortably shave the back of my neck with this shaver where others irritated. Second, it&#x27;s by far the fastest shaver yet, plus it gets any long hairs in its path. I attribute at least part of its speed to the third row of cutters which sets this one apart from many others. Third, it works fine wet, lotion or water, or dry. I&#x27;m using up some of the lotion cartridges from a previous Norelco dispensing shaver and it works very smoothly with them. Fourth, it went well over a month on the initial charge. Fifth, the built in trimmer is effective and convenient as opposed to some trimmers I&#x27;ve had that had to be attached in place of the shaving head. And finally it&#x27;s easy to clean and packs light and compact for traveling.    The battery level meter is nice for checking when the charge is full. When the battery does finally give up and you&#x27;re in the middle of a shave the charging cord can be used directly into the shaver to finish, then when ready for charging it can be connected to the charging stand for a regular charge. Charging is done relatively fast also, in roughly about an hour or so it&#x27;s full and ready to go another month or longer.    There&#x27;s often the argument between basic types of shavers, foil or rotary being two of the subjects. I recently tried one of the newer and recommended foil shavers and it&#x27;s now on the shelf. Foil shavers for me miss too much, long hairs for sure, but they are not as effective on the regular stubble for me as a rotary shaver. That would be bad enough but my experience with foil shavers was if you missed a place in the previous shave, you won&#x27;t get it next time either even though you go over it. I often had to use the trimmers on foil shavers, even the best of them, for just regular shaving chores.    I&#x27;ve bought and used a lot of electric shavers, but I&#x27;ve never had onethis good before of any brand.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 17 year old. Great starter. Wish I had waited a week or so till it was a gold box item though...missed that one.</li>
    <li> Tras 15 a&amp;ntilde;os de fieles y diarios servicios, decid&amp;iacute; reemplazar mi antigua Philishave 715.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luego de una peque&amp;ntilde;a investigaci&amp;oacute;n, me decid&amp;iacute; por este modelo  considerando que presenta un buen equilibrio entre precio y prestaciones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produce una excelente afeitada en corto tiempo.&lt;br /&gt;Es liviana, silenciosa y de f&amp;aacute;cil manejo.&lt;br /&gt;Buena duraci&amp;oacute;n de la bater&amp;iacute;a.&lt;br /&gt;Puede usarse con o sin el cable de conexi&amp;oacute;n el&amp;eacute;ctrica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creo que el dise&amp;ntilde;o del sistema de recarga debe pensarse mejor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Tanto la plataforma como el mecanismo mediante el cual se apoya la m&amp;aacute;quina en dicha plataforma no parecen muy resistentes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Para un funcionamiento m&amp;aacute;s inteligente, la recarga deber&amp;iacute;a funcionar autom&amp;aacute;ticamente al detectar que la bater&amp;iacute;a llega a un nivel bajo de carga. As&amp;iacute; se podr&amp;iacute;a tener la plataforma conectada permanentemente al enchufe y colocar siempre la afeitadora en su plataforma cuando no est&amp;aacute; en uso. Actualmente, y por sugerencia del fabricante, es el usuario el que debe administrar el proceso de recarga \\&quot;cuando la bater&amp;iacute;a esta cerca de agotarse\\&quot;.&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;Solo que el equipo no tiene ning&amp;uacute;n indicador para saber el estado de carga de la bateria y, por lo general, simplemente nos enteramos porque la afeitadora se detiene en medio de una afeitada !!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent electric razor. It has good performance and it is easy to use . it can be cleaned with water completely. I recommended it</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009MFUOA Philips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL Men&#x27;s Shaver]]did not do a very good job ruff shave  ouch! sent it back</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. I love the switch from my razor to this. It gets real close and holds a great charge. This is my first electric shaver and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I think that if you&#x27;re looking to go electric, nothing can beat the quality and price point of this shaver. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This is a fine electric shaver. I don&#x27;t shave daily so I needed a fighter and this one does it. My only disappointment is the long wait to get the car charger that I wanted for it initially.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for 4 weeks. It&#x27;s very quiet, easy on the face, and it gives a better shave than my old Remington. I like being able to clean it with hot running water. And I have yet to have to recharge the battery -- that&#x27;s 28 shaves and counting. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> Summary:  After using the 8140xl for almost 3 weeks, I can say it is giving me a very close shave with no irritation, the battery lasts over a week between charges, the trimmer works well, it feels well constructed, and the hot water rinse clean is great.    Background:  I&#x27;ve used electric shavers ever since I started shaving over 20 years ago.  For the past ~12 years I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco 5825xl rotary shaver.  The battery has long since died (I only used the power cord on the 5825xl for the past several years) and I haven&#x27;t replaced the cutter/heads for at least 2 years.  So, going from this situation with my 5825xl to the 8140xl has been a huge leap forward.  The shave I am now getting with the 8140xl is so much closer than any I recall ever getting with any razor in the past, with no skin irritation.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews that state the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work well, I use it to trim my sideburns every 3-4 days and it works well for me.  I was a little concerned with some of the reviews I read stating the razor starts to smell from cleaning it with hot running tap water, but I run the water only on both sides of the shaving heads and prevent water from flowing through the entire razor and out the bottom (which the directions state it is designed to do).  This seems to allow the heads to air dry rather quickly, and keeps water from remaining in the main body for a long period of time which is what I assume would lead to the razor smelling badly.    In the past I always felt as though I was sacrificing the closer shave of a blade for the convenience of an electric shaver.  I&#x27;m not sacrificing anything anymore - the 8140xl is giving me a shave that&#x27;s virtually as good as a blade.    Update:  Have been using this razor regularly for 2 months now, and I remain extremely happy.  I&#x27;m getting 2 weeks of shaving daily between battery charges, and I remain very impressed with the closeness of the shave.  I do agree with other reviews that it would be nice to have a little warning before the battery runs out, but when that only happens once every two weeks it simply isn&#x27;t an issue for me.    Great razor, great shave, great value!  Wish I bought this sooner.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Dad, who nothing is ever good enough for...especially something that you actually have to pay money for.  So, last month I asked him how the new razor was working, and got an \\&quot;eh, it works ok, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks now, so, we&#x27;ll see how it keeps up\\&quot;.  Well, it&#x27;s been a month now and I&#x27;ve had no complaining (it must work pretty good), no questions like \\&quot;how do you turn this thing on?\\&quot; (it must be easy to operate), and he has a clean, close shave almost every day I see him.  It&#x27;s a winner in my book!</li>
    <li> I use it for almost one month and it works very well. The battery is great either. really good deal.</li>
    <li> I was foolish enough to leave mine at a hotel. I needed to get a new shaver and I immediately decided to get this model again, even though it was more expensive than the first time I paid for it! What better praise is there than that! It is quick, goes through my tough beard easily and painlessly, and cleaning it with water is a brilliant step in razor cleaning technology. It makes such a difference. Just don&#x27;t leave it behind like a dope like me!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009MFUOA Philips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL Men&#x27;s Shaver]]  I made the mistake last year of buying my first foil type razor from Amazon(Braun 360 Complete)after using a Norelco rotary for years. I only wish I could return it since it was much more expensive than the Norelco. After using for almost a year I gave up on it and recently purchased the 8140XL. This is without a doubt the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. It is unbelievably quiet and shaves very close without irritation even on the neck hairs. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator that shows how much charge is remaining and  it doesn&#x27;t charge without a charging stand. Other than that so far I&#x27;m very pleased and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product works as well as any shaver I have had.     NOTE: the head can fall off easily when open for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I am 65 years old and have owned several electric shavers throughout my life but this is by far the best ever.  I&#x27;ve had Schick&#x27;s and Braun&#x27;s and they have always given me a burn and I was not satisfied with the closeness of the shave.  I have owned several older Norelco&#x27;s, and with the floating heads they were comfortable, but still electric shaving wasn&#x27;t close enough especially for formal outing, but I would use it for work.  Over the years my batteries became weak so I decided to upgrade to the 8140xl.  What a difference!  Light as a feather, great improvement in the floating heads, comfortable enough to make shaving a delight, and a much closer shave.  The water cleaning (though I still Prefer the old fashion way &amp; clean with a brush), charging stand, looks and feel etc. are all additional perks, but the real quality in this machine is the close shave and comfort of use.  Hats off to you Philips, I have no idea of how you can improve upon this shaver.  Also, have been using it now for almost two weeks on a single charge and still going.  Fantastic!!</li>
    <li> Those new XL shaving heads make a huge difference.  The additional blades they added change the whole feel of the shave for the better. The shave is a more friendly shave.  The heads almost feel soft against your face as you&#x27;re shaving.  For years I have used Afta pre-electric shave to cut down on irritation but I find with this razor it&#x27;s no longer needed.  It is very quiet and I must agree with another reviewer that it sounds like it&#x27;s on low power.  It&#x27;s not.  I thought that the new heads would shorten the amount of time I needed to shave but that wasn&#x27;t true.  It took just as long.  Go figure. I would have given this razor 5 stars except after I got it I realized that it does not have a low battery indicator.  That was an unwelcome surprise.  The 8150XL or 8151XL does.&lt;br /&gt;ADDITIONAL REVIEW AFTER TWO MONTHS OF USE: Other razors wind down slowly when running out of juice.  Not this one, it goes from full speed ahead to dead in three seconds.  When it does that, turn it off and then back on.  It seems to have another 30 seconds of shaving when you do that.  I don&#x27;t know if this was an accidental or intentional design but that little trick is not in the manual.</li>
    <li> It takes me now three times longer than with a blade razor to even get rid of all the long hairs. My face has less irritation, but having to go through and individually \\&quot;fluff up\\&quot; hairs that are lying down so that I can shave them off is ridiculous and probably offsets entirely the benefit of not shaving off the top layer of skin on my face every morning. Additionally, of course, the final shave isn&#x27;t nearly as close as with a blade, but I expected that. What I did not expect was the razor&#x27;s complete inability to shave long hairs without manual assistance from tweezers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I remember having a previous model razor of the same type when I was in high school that worked much better. I expected this one to work even better than that, as it&#x27;s more modern. No such luck, this new one did a far worse job of shaving effectively than a 7 year old razor.</li>
    <li> If you rarely shave or shave often. This is the one to get. It is comfortable, no itching for sensitive skin, and yet very quiet. You can leave several days without shaving and within 1,2 mins you have an absolute clean shave. For long neck hair I normally run the trimmer through first and then use the shaver. I only do this if I did not shave for more than 3,4 days. Washing is easily done, but you have to remove the cover first by pulling it straight out. It save me a lot of time shaving in comparison to other shaver like my old $70 remington which takes 15 mins to shave if you skip shaving several days.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It shaves me very close...as good as a straight razor.  The rechargeable battery has a long life.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone should try it.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco triple header with height adjustment for eight years.  It gave a close shave, but I had to work at it, especially the neck area.  I got my money&#x27;s worth and more given the trouble free service and I didn&#x27;t have to replace the blades.  The 8140XL is performing the same in terms of quality of shave and speed.  I expected more given the hype of the triple rows of blades w/in the each of the three heads.  Water cleaning works well.  Much quieter than previous one.  I get 3 to 4 shaves from a charge.  The 8150 model offers a \\&quot;need to recharge\\&quot; light.  The 8140 does not, and it just stops w/o warning so better have the charger handy.  Hard to believe that Norelco can justify a higher price just for the convenience of a charge warning light.</li>
    <li> Timely shipped and received.  An excellent product.  I have had different versions of this model in the past, but this is the best yet.  Smooth shaves without irritation and the continuous charge stand means the razor is always available.</li>
    <li> I bought this saver as a gift to my husbant, so I write this review on his behalf. This is his first shaver. His skin got used to it after only a couple of days. The shaving lasts only 2-3 minutes. After that, he easily cleans it under tap water. He will never use razors again!</li>
    <li> When I was a teenager I got a Norelco as a gift and at first I got a really good shave, I really liked it over a razor. Then, I started to get such bad rashes that I finally had to give it up and went back to a razor for about 25 years. &lt;br /&gt;I was too dumb to know that you had to periodically replace the heads. I just assumed that they lasted forever. Oh well. &lt;br /&gt;My first new electric was a Remington, and I&#x27;ll say that their adverstisements, for me, were true; It gave the closest electric shave. &lt;br /&gt;The problem was my beard grows at a steep angel to the skin and electrics have a hard time getting all of the whiskers. If you missed a whisker on day one, you might get it on day two, but after that, forget it. &lt;br /&gt;I went to a Braun after the Remington wore out, and it has a coarse cutter on the inside that can get those errant whiskers. It was not quite as close as the Remington, but was a lot faster because it would find the longer hairs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This has all been to give background to the Norelco. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for over 2 months now. &lt;br /&gt;It falls somewhere in between the other two. It is not quite as close as either, but very close to the Braun. &lt;br /&gt;It will get those stray whiskers usually, but every 4 or 5 days, I need to use the trimmer to get ones that have gotten away. &lt;br /&gt;As far as irritation goes, it borders right on the edge of a problem on my neck. The cause is obvious. The screens on this rotary are a lot rougher that a foil shaver. That is to say that you can feel the grid of depressions and holes. Be careful in pressing too hard or using repeated passes, to avoid irritation. &lt;br /&gt;Because of the large surface area of the heads, I find shaving to be about 1/3 faster now, as long as I don&#x27;t try to get a blade quality shave. &lt;br /&gt;This razor is extremely quiet, with only a very soft whirring versus the loud buzz of any foil. &lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works adequately with my only complaint that it does not lock in the up position. If you push it the wrong way, it folds back down. &lt;br /&gt;The batteries last 3 to 4 weeks on a charge. If it starts to get low I just plug it in and continue shaving. To get around the lack of a low battery indicator I will charge it up before a trip so that I don&#x27;t need to take the charger with me. &lt;br /&gt;I consider the lack of an indicator to be a non-issue. &lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the shaver a lot &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> First I have to say that my previous experiences are minimal, I used to use razors then switch to electrical shaver under my skin doctor&#x27;s advised. I was using a CruZer3 from Braun, I love its design, ergonomic and sturdy feeling but it took me very long time to shave and it left whiskers around my neck area. When I tried the Norelco 8140XL just could say whoao, I mean whoao, it took me no time to get a smooth close shave. The things I didn&#x27;t like were the package, it is very hard and difficult to open, the razor seems very \\&quot;Light\\&quot; constructed when compare with the Braun (I think it is more a psychological issue, what really matters is how well it performances), but it amazed me how close and fast it shaved me, even the neck area.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that the shave won&#x27;t be as close as a razor&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s pretty close and smooth (No irritation at all).&lt;br /&gt;I decided to get this model because it uses the same shaving technology as the more expensive Norelco shavers but at a great price, the major differences are led displays, sensitive adjustments, among other non important features to me, overall it is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;(Finally to be fair, it is like comparing a Chevy to a Benz, both shavers are in different categories)</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco in 30 years.  It provides the smoothest, quietest shave that I have ever had.   It does not appear to be as ruggedly constructed as my two older Norelcos, which, by the way, still run.</li>
    <li> Not as close as a blade, but usually it&#x27;s less trouble to just run this thing over my face than do the whole set-up for a blade shave. If I&#x27;ve been shaving every day, a touch up takes no time at all, BUT, if I go an extra day, the time it takes to actually get a clean shave seems like forever, going over the same areas over and over again. After all is said and done, this my choice among electrics. My solution to the weaknesses of an electric shaver:  1/When casual shave is all that&#x27;s needed, and I&#x27;ve shaved a day before: Electric only. 2/When I&#x27;ve shaved the day before, but want to be soft as a baby: Blade only. 3/When I&#x27;ve let myself go for two or more days: Twice-over with  electric,  to cut down on times the blade runs over the skin , then finish with the blade.  The dual technology  takes less time than either alone: The set up on electric cutting down on how much hair  gets stuck later in the blade, and the blade often finishing a section with only one pass, rare on electric. I also believe that alternating keeps the skin from getting too sensitive to either tool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED NORELCO FOR YEARS, NONE HAVE BEEN THAT GREAT, BUT IT WAS THE BEST OF TWO EVILS. NOW THAT PHILLIPS IS OWNER OF NORELCO THERE RAZOR&#x27;S ARE HORRIBLE. IT HAS NO POWER. IT TOOK ME OVER 30 MINUTES JUST TO SHAVE. IT IRRATED MY SKIN. AND STILL DIDN&#x27;T DO A GOOD JOB. THE MOTOR IS SO LOW YOU CAN&#x27;T TELL IF IT&#x27;S EVEN SHAVING. AFTER SHAVING I HAD TO USE A OLD GILLETTE STRAIGHT EDGE TO FINISH THE JOB. I TOOK THIS PIECE OF JUNK BACK AND BOUGHT A CORDED 29.00 BRAUN ELEC RAZOR. IT GAVE ME THE BEST SHAVE I&#x27;VE HAD IN YEARS. THE NORELCO BATTERIES ALSO DON&#x27;T LAST. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER NORELCO. GOOD BUY FOR EVEER</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a different cordless besides Remington.Been buying Rems&#x60; &lt;br /&gt;for 15 yr. or so.The Norelco 8140XL is slow and weak on my beard.If you shave again in under 24 hrs. It does a fair job.Anything over that it barely works.If you have heavy stubble,dont get it. &lt;br /&gt;                                              &lt;br /&gt;                                                   Wayne Howe &lt;br /&gt;                                                   Rochester,NY</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have ever used. Close, comfortable shave, long duration charge, easy cleaning. &lt;br /&gt;This best product ever, was sadistically placed in the worst, most dangerous plastic blister pack I have ever seen. The packaging engineer and all who approved this packaging should immediately be declared terrorists and sent to Abu Ghraib for some \\&quot;gentle interrogation\\&quot;...and please, me first! &lt;br /&gt;Although over 70, I am physically fit and a degreed engineer. I play golf 5 days a week, and hands on care of 3 residental properties and a 300 acre ranch. It took me over 20 minutes of creative cursing using words I did not even know existed! I cut myself 3 times. Only a set of sharp tools or unlimited supply of explosives will allow these horrendous packages to be opened.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for the past 57 years and this has to be the best yet.  It is now 7 years old and still charging and operating perfectly.  I have only had to replace cutters once and also needed a new cutter holder but other than those it is totally reliable.  I believe that the feature that allows after-shaving cleaning by rinsing with water instead of brushing has contributed to this shaver&#x27;s useful life.  It saves wear and tear on the head and keeps everything nice and clean.</li>
    <li> I was very, very disappointed in this shaver. I&#x27;ve always been one of those people with a sandpaper beard that&#x27;s hard to shave closely, and sensitive skin. So every few years, I begin the quest for a new shaver. Sometimes I have to go through a few of them. I&#x27;ve been using both a Norelco Spectra and a Panasonic Pro Curve linear, and was intrigued by the new design. I&#x27;ve used Norelcos since I was 16.     First, because of the reviews, I tried a Spectra, before this discontinued model was all sold out. Got a super close shave, but it really gave me a sore neck. Took it back to Fry&#x27;s, no problem. That night, I saw an 8151 (an 8140 with a stand) on sale at Target for $77.00 and grabbed it. What a mistake!    First, it seems to be less powerful. It&#x27;s lighter and quieter and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as the Quadra or Spectra. I had to go around my face in circles for 10 minutes to get it remotely smooth, and I can still feel some stubble. It really wimped out on the upper lip, and could not get that slope between the lower lip and crease of the chin smooth. I tried it for a day or two and the same results. Forget what they say about needing 30 days to get used to it -- I was already conditioned to rotaries.     Also, the flex resistance was too weak. I barely pushed and the cutters were pushing in, with very little resistance. This also prevented me from getting a close shave.    So I packed it up and took it back to Target. The girl in line tells me they don&#x27;t accept used items for refunds. No  satisfaction guaranteed clause. Tough luck, sorry, get out. I finally got my refund after tracking down a manager and arguing with him and threatening to small claim them. It was more trouble than it was worth. Yeah, I could have read the back of the receipt, but because most other stores have a satisfaction guaranteed policy, I just assumed.    Next up I&#x27;m either going to try the new Panasonic Vortex or Braun Activator -- not sure yet.    UPDATED: Well, a few more comments, with nearly a month having elapsed. First, to \\&quot;anonymous\\&quot; who said I shouldn&#x27;t blame a product for the fact that I don&#x27;t like Target&#x27;s return policies, if the product had been adequate, I wouldn&#x27;t have been aware of Target&#x27;s return policies -- obviously! My point was that the lesson of my experience is that, with this or any electric razor, you should familiarize yourself with return policies as everybody&#x27;s beard growth and facial configuration is different, and you can&#x27;t know if a razor will work without test driving it first.    Next, while my experience is not unique, in having spoken with some friends and coworkers, the new Norelcos are a hit or miss proposition for you -- if it works for you, it works very, very well. If it doesn&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t. It depends on the variables. My problem was based in the fact that there was too much resistance in the floating heads. Now I&#x27;m using a 9190, with adjustable resistance, and it works much better.</li>
    <li> My old Norelco wore out - battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and blades got dull.  After months of shaving for what seemed like 15 minutes a day, I thought it must be time to get a new one.  AM I GLAD I DID!  The 8140 gives me a really close shave in just one or two passes on the beard - literally done in 30 seconds or less. The old one never did well on the jaw line, and this one mows it right down.  Plus, it&#x27;s lighter, quieter, and you can rinse the head with water.  You don&#x27;t have to use the charging stand if your don&#x27;t want more stuff stacked up on the counters - the cord that fits the stand also fits the shaver.  GREAT TOOL!</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for 40 years and when I saw the deal on the triple head at Sam&#x27;s Club I decided to retire my 10 year old Norelco. A mistake! I should have taken advantage of the 30 day test period because I am not satisfied and am back using my old shaver.  Using the new shaver takes 2 or 3 times as long and even then I miss spots.  The overall shave is not nearly as close. The Sam&#x27;s club version does not come with a stand so I have to store the shaver in a glass.  I called Norelco and a stand in not available as a seperate item. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The triple shaving heads are not nearly as effective as the old one and are just a marketing gimick. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you are currently using an older Norelco triple header the 8140 will be disapointing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Having used my Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL daily for a little over a month now, I think it is a pretty good electric razor. The large cutting area cuts hairs effectively and efficiently. I have owned low-end Norelco models in the past--ones with smaller cutting areas--and have to say that this model is worth the extra $30 or $40 that you would pay for a lower end model. The large cutting area means that I don&#x27;t have to shave the same place over and over again. With my previous models, I often had to run the razor over the same area numerous times, often applying a good deal of force to the razor. I don&#x27;t have to do this anymore. My time spent shaving is now reduced and my skin is less iritated.</li>
    <li> As a long time Norelco owner, there were no surprises for me. My previous Norelco (a 5000 series) was still going strong (with long battery life after 8 years. This one is lighter and quieter and the battery lasts just as long. The water rinsing is a bit of a gimmick but not bad to have.  The only wish is that there were a charge indicator that indicates how much charge is left. (At present a light comes on only when the battery is low.)</li>
    <li> It is an excellent razor with a proper fit for the hand when shaving.  It lacks the Nivea Cream dispenser my old razor had which gets the whiskers ready for snipping by the heads.  The new razor with new and more cutting surfaces does not give a closer shave than my previous Norelco and is no faster either.  I just like the shave of a Norelco razor.</li>
    <li> My husband has been Norelco user for decades and needed a new unit.  I bought the 8140 and he loves the weight, feel and look of the unit.  His only concern is that it never \\&quot;sounds\\&quot; fully charged. The RPM is lower than his previous Norelco units, BUT it is a great shave.  If you expect the sound of a \\&quot;monster truck\\&quot;, be ready for the sound of a \\&quot;economy car\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. In his words: \\&quot;Works great with one small glitch and a minor concern.  Several times I have accidentally popped opened the shaving heads while closing the trimmer -- the release button is in the wrong place.  This, of course spills \\&quot;trimmings\\&quot; all over the place.  I prefer the original, non-hinged head.  Also, I&#x27;m not sure about the affect of constantly using the charger stand on battery life, so I only plug it in when it needs charging.  Other than that, great shaves.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lifelong Norelco user for about 40 years.  While I read some of the reviews that had negative comments  from the first time I used this shaver is was clearly the best Norelco I&#x27;ve used.....period.  Very smooth and quiet and gave a close shave.  I purchased an expensve Braun last summer but was so disappointed that I went back to my old Norelco and then purchased this new model with a Christmas gift card from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Razor was received from Amazon quickly. Runs a long time on a single charge but has no warning when the battery is down, it just stops. Somewhat inconvienent if that is all you have shave with.  I agree with other reviewers that the blades do not seem to turn as fast as my old one but it seems to get the job done just fine.  The thing I dislike was the packaging!  The clamshell package was impossible to get into.  I finally used tin snips to cut into it.  I would buy this razor again I would just hire someone to open it!</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco Shavers in the past and this razor is as good as all the other Norelco Shavers I have used.</li>
    <li> Husband was hesitant on buying this shaver, as he had used his for years, well needless to say, he loves this one....The price was outstanding, the shipping fast, and I would not hesitate to buy from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used a blade and just made the switch to electric.  I was very worried about irritation on my \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; but much to my surprise there was none.  Obviously, it not as close of a shave as the blade, but it&#x27;s really not far off. Of course, everyone&#x27;s face is different, but for me, I could not be more pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor as my second Norelco razor.  The RPMs on this thing are very slow.  You can get a decent shave, but takes a while to get the stubborn curved hairs.  I&#x27;ve since then bought a Panasonic Linear Motor Razor and it works much better!!</li>
    <li> I have owned Norelco rotary shavers for at least 25 years. I recently bought a Braun thin foil razor because it got such a great rating on Amazon. I returned it in  two days because my 9-year old Norelco shaved me closer. I have used my new Norelco only two days, but I am already very happy with quality of the shave. My old Norelco still works great, but the battery no longer holds a decent charge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for years.  This is the worst Norelco product I have ever had.  The shaver heads are not adjustable and do not provide a close shave.  It seems like it lacks power.  It is lightweight and easy to clean, but other than that, I couldn&#x27;t recommend it.  There are many shavers on the market at this price that will do a far superior job.</li>
    <li> Unbelieveable product. Best shaver I ever purchased. Shaves in half the time compared to other models I owned. Great feature is its washable, I just hold under hot water and sometimes add some soap, totally cleans it without harming shaver.</li>
    <li> This ia a great shaver for the price. My old Norelco is 15+ years old and this model gives even closer shaves with great battery life.</li>
    <li> This is the third razor from this manufacturer and highly satisfied with every one.  Plan to purchase another one (for my friend) when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> As usual, Philips came up with a great shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, fast and comfortable. Easy to clean and reasonably priced. Easily the best Quality-Price relationship you&#x27;ll find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver comes with the following elements:&lt;br /&gt;- 1 Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;- 1 Recharging base.&lt;br /&gt;- 1 Cord that can connect the base with the power supply OR the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;- 1 Brush to help cleaning the rotary heads.&lt;br /&gt;- 1 Protective cap for the rotary heads.&lt;br /&gt;- 1 Lovely and soft small case to keep the shaver when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;- Instruction manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Press a button on the back of the shaver and open an additional grooming comb for longer hair (ideal for those who spend a week or two without shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shaver in the market.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The 8140XL shaver was purchased to replace an older and very tired Norelco triple head shaver which had served me well. The new Phillips/Norelco out performs that one tenfold. It is quicker and closer shaving, saving me precious time in the morning when preparing for work. I was so impressed by its efficiency that I bought one for my 18 year old son. He was equally satisfied.</li>
    <li> This shaver has a nice balance between cost and features.  I really like the ability to clean it with tap water.  It&#x27;s very quiet and gives a very nice share.  I&#x27;ve had it about 4 weeks and have only charged it once so far.  No, I don&#x27;t use it every day, about 3 or 4 times a week.    I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend twice the money for a shaver with a bunch of features I really didn&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for years, after having tried many other shavers. The 8140XL is the best Norelco yet. It is very quiet, super easy on your face, and a great shave. The 8140XL is not the top of the line, but has all the needed features and is reasonably priced. A lot of shaver for the money. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> very convenient and efficient in use.[[ASIN:B000VX6P3C Philips Norelco 8020X Cool Skin Moisturizing Shaver with Accessory Kit. Includes Philips Norelco 8020X Cool Skin Moisturizing Shaving System, Philips Norelco HS85 Replacement Head, Philips Norelco HS800 Nivea for Men Lotion Cartridge]]</li>
    <li> The Norelco 840XL is a very good shaver.  Hubby liked the shave he got from this shaver.  It shaved almost as good as a razor.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s only been two weeks the Norelco 8140XL has performed very nicely.  A good clean shave for an average beard.  It may take a minute or two longer than I would expect to get a really close shave but that&#x27;s what a portable shaver is ideal for.  I would recommend it without hesitation for the price range.  Simple to charge and clean.</li>
    <li> The item was a Christmas gift which was never delivered; plus no reason was given why it didn&#x27;t ship</li>
    <li> So the 1980&#x27;s gave us lift &amp; cut. The 90&#x27;s gave us Norelco&#x27;s Reflex and Quadra systems. Now finally, for the first time in its 70+ years as the leading maker of rotary shavers, Norelco gives us a system that covers more area, with more speed and comfort than ever before. It doesn&#x27;t just promise a faster, closer shave, it delivers.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for all guys, but let me try to break-down the electric / blade dilemma. Blades are closer, but cause irritation. So most blade users tend to skip a day to avoid that. Furthermore, you get a closer shave with a blade if you let the stubble grow a bit, so skipping a day is a common practice. But blade shaving gives guys far more options in terms of products to choose from, both for shavers and shaving conditioners and gels. Simply put, if you want a close shave and the ability to control all aspects of shaving, and see what you&#x27;re cutting, the blade is the best way to go.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s electric. An idea hatched from the 1930&#x27;s, and later re-marketed in the late 1950&#x27;s space age / cold war era that told us that blade shaving was a thing of the past. Electric shaving promised to be as close as a blade for decades, but never delivered. But over the years it has delivered its promise of a safer, faster, and less irritating shave. For guys who don&#x27;t like shaving around the sensitive lips and nose areas, electric has its advantages.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All electric shavers fail to cut the longer neck hairs effectively, including the new Norelco XL series. But the XL is still a major breakthrough. Simply put, it has switched me back to electric after 6 years of using blades. The new rotors have three rows of blades, and an innovative mix of slots and holes for stubble, making-use of dead space that was Norelco&#x27;s weakness since their beginning. The XL has the inward tilt mechanism introduced with the Reflex system. And it has the late 80&#x27;s lift-and-cut technology, which doesn&#x27;t work exactly as advertised, but it does shave flat areas of the face as close as a blade (the cheek and upper lip areas do get the closest cut).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The XL series is easy to clean under hot water, another development from the Quadra series, which is even better and more effective here.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The XL gives me the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had. And I can use it daily for a consistent smooth look without irritation. Add the recent development of products like Anthony for Men&#x27;s alcohol-based pre-shave solution, and electric shaving suddenly has advantages worth making the switch. I liked the XL so much, I got the 9160XL for home, and the less-expensive 8140XL for my office. The 2 shavers are the same, except for the smart touch pivoting feature, which is not a big bonus in my opinion. The pivoting feature makes it possible to shave the neck and chin faster, but the results for both shavers is exactly the same, meaning that some neck hairs are going to be missed, making it necessary to use a blade to do some quick cleanup. Electric is far from perfect, but this is the closest and most comfortable electric yet. I&#x27;m sticking with it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And since the XL is Norelco&#x27;s top of the line model, it is still made in Holland. All other Norelco&#x27;s are made in China. it won&#x27;t be long before the XL is made in China as Norelco develops it&#x27;s next breakthrough. But the XL is the big breakthrough as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I&#x27;m hooked. And I&#x27;m a total shaving geek now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband to replace one that was slowly dying. The biggest negative on this model is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t let you know when the battery is getting low. It just stops. So my husband isn&#x27;t too please about that. Fortunately he did keep his old one, so he &lt;br /&gt;uses it when the new one stops working in the middle of his shave.</li>
    <li> I never owned a Norelco before, and have been using Panasonic electric razors for quite a while.  When the Panasonic I used for traveling broke recently, I decided to give this Norelco a shot.  I returned it because: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* It pulled hair like no other razor ever has &lt;br /&gt;* Even if it cut well, it seems that this razor would take 5-10 times longer to shave with than my Panasonic ES 8077.   &lt;br /&gt;* I wanted to try the Norelco because I have heard/read they do a good job with neck hairs.  Not mine, none of which the Norelco seems to want to cut.  (The Panasonic isn&#x27;t great, either.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am returning this product and will never try Norelco again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor in September of 2005. In December of 2005 the blades were so dull, that it took forever to shave, and I certainly don&#x27;t have a heavy beard. I am very disappointed with the short life of the blades. At this rate it would cost me $ 120.00 a year for blades. I am sorry to say that I would not purchase this item again, nor would I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shaver provides a close shave with no irritation.  I am very impressed with the battery; it lasts much longer than other shaver batteries that I have used.  For any man who wants a close shave, no irritation, and little noise, this is the real thing!  Also, this shaver was made in the Netherlands; not cheaply in another country: it is the real thing!</li>
    <li> Barbeador excelente, não irrita a pele, faz uma barba bem rente, a bateria dura bastante e também é bem silencioso. &lt;br /&gt;Inicialmente, nos primeiros dias de uso, a pele sente um pouco o barbeador, mas a própria norelco avisa que podem haver irritações de pele que faz parte do processo de acomodação da pele. &lt;br /&gt;Já estou usando ele a 10 dias sem recarregar e nem sinal da bateria estar proxima do fim.</li>
    <li> We I worked daily, I used a manual razor during the week and a low end electric razor on the weekends.  This razor has all the desireable features and gives me a close shave.  I now use it every day.  I like the rechargeable battery which charges quickly.  When I went on a one week trip, I didn&#x27;t have to take the power cord.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric men&#x27;s shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I&#x27;ve had several Norelco&#x27;s over the years, but this one is far superior.  Outstanding product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years but this is the first time I had one that has more than one blade.  This one has three.  I was pleasantly suprised that it only took me about 3 minutes to completely shave my face, and the razer took off the whiskers right down to the skin line without irritating my face.  I will definitely buy another Norelco when \\&quot;it is time\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  It shaves close, quickly, and it is easy to clean. Open it and just run the water through it.  This particular model has one huge disadvantage, however.  There is no low battery indicator.  You either have to leave it plugged in, which, according to the instructions will shorten the battery life, or guess when it&#x27;s going to run out of juice.</li>
    <li> This was the worst razor I have ever used, was very excited to get it but when I did I charged it and the first time I used it spent 20 min trying to get a decent shave.  Then I opened it up and was hard pressed to find any hair.  This thing is so underpowered that if you press the foils to hard against your face it will acculy stop the cutters on a fully charged razor.  I will never buy another Norelco Product I had this thing on Ebay the next day.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009MFUOA Philips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL Men&#x27;s Shaver]]  I think this shaver has broken my addiction to Gillette. Now I get a reasonably close, comfortable shave that&#x27;s quick and easy. In reality, a few more weeks will tell the tale since it takes a while for the face to get used to an electric shaver. Pricewise it&#x27;s a good compromise between the el cheapos and the 200 plus dollars jobs that, most likely, get a similar result. It&#x27;s great for travel, no more expensive blades to buy...hey, give it a try, because you never know!</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that the unit was extremely quiet and looks nice. It is funny that it has SPEED in the name. It took forever to cut sufficiently. You have to keep going over and over the same spot to get everything. It also doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a blade and not nearly as fast. It went back to Norelco asap.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether Philips has had anything to do w/ it, but this Speed-XL is the worst Norelco i&#x27;ve owned to date. I&#x27;m 42, medium bearded, and this is my 4th Norelco since i was 18. They&#x27;ve gotten progressively slicker looking and quieter, but i make so many passes over the same spots to pick up whiskers it&#x27;s RIDICULOUS. I could go on and on, but suffice to say it just isn&#x27;t worth the money. Wish i could recommend an alternative, maybe AMF will branch out THIS time from bowling balls and football helmets to electric shavers!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean.This razor glides over my face and neck.Very light weight.I&#x27;ve had mine for a month and am very happy with it. I retired my old Norelco after 18 years of service and am sure this one will serve me just as well.</li>
    <li> Bought the Norelco 8140XL after using Braun products for the past several years.  Couldn&#x27;t believe how light and quiet this thing is.  I had to check it to make sure it was really running.  Gives me a close shave in less time than the high-end Braun I&#x27;d been using (Braun is self cleaning and the whole thing).  Not sorry.  I get a faster shave also.  Looking forward to years of service.  My first electric was a Norelco.  My last one might be also.  Good bye Braun. Amazon did their normal fabulous job in getting it to me fast in in good shape.</li>
    <li> One reason I bought this was to get a razor I didn&#x27;t  have to plug in and remember to unplug after charging. This is not a real charger stand its just an extension of the charger cord which still must be plugged in to charge and unplugged after charging. The old shaver I replaced at least had a meter on it to tell you how much time you had left, this one doesn&#x27;t. Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with the 3 cutting blades per head either.  Sent my old one out to have new batteries put in and will probably use the new one as a back up. On the + side it weighs less! not that it makes any difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shaver for about 3 weeks and have been very pleased with the closeness of the shave.  The only potential downside is that the shaver is much lighter and seems less well built than my older Norelco shavers.  Hopefully this shaver will last as long as my other Norelco shavers.  Overall very happy with my early experience with the product</li>
    <li> Smooth shaver, holds charge for 5-6 shaves. No indicator to show how much  battery power remains.</li>
    <li> Summary: Nothing not to like!    Background: Previously, I owned the earlier model of this razer. It was the same exact razer except it used to be blue. I loved this razer, but it was eaten by a dog! I didnt want to cough up the full cost of this direct replacement, so I used a lower-end Norelco. As you may know, the lower models do not feature the \\&quot;Speed-XL\\&quot; shaving heads (which have 3 concentric rings of blades (per head)). Instead it had the single outer row of blades, which is pretty typical of any non-high-end razer.    Why this razer is good:  The point of my background story is that there is a SIGNIFICANT difference between the Speed-XL models, and older style heads. In fact THERE IS NO COMPARISON!  With the cheaper razer I had to go over my face at least twice as much, and usually more like 3x as much as with this razer. As with all electric&#x27;s, you&#x27;re not going to be able to make a single pass and get everything, but as electric&#x27;s go, this razer (and all the Norelco&#x27;s with Speed-XL) works great. Both myself and my dad (who is used to foil razers) agree that Speed-XL is the best electric we&#x27;ve used!    Some niceties of this razer are that its VERY easy to clean. Usually you can just pop the top and tap most of the hair out, maybe use the brush real quick. I dont feel like I have to do a deep cleaning (taking the heads out and apart) very often because it doesnt seem to trap a lot of hair in the heads. But if you want to, its very easy to access everything.  The body is waterproof, so you can clean it out with water as a middle ground between just tapping hair out and dissassembly.  The charger is now VERY small, and takes up only a single plug (even on a strip), and the base is also small.  Battery life: lets me shave for multiple days (at least 4) before it needs charging.    That said there are some minor quibbles. Like most Norelco razers, the charger doesnt shut off automatically, so you need to be careful with leaving it plugged in all the time. My solution: leave the charger in a draw, keep the stand on my countertop to hold the razer all the time, and then just get the charger out (and plug it into the stand) when the razer actually needs charged, which for me is only ever handful of days. this also has the added benefit of saving some small amount of energy by not having the wall wart plugged in while you&#x27;re not charging.  This razer now comes with a form fitting travel case, and you cant put the razer in it with the hair gaurd on it :( so make sure you clean it before you travel with it. You also cant fit the charger in the case...its really a case JUST for the razer, to protect it in your regular toiletries bag.    All in all any of the speed-xl razers will cut the same, so just buy the model that has the accessories you want. I think this model represents the best value because its the cheapest :) personally i dont care about a multi-step battery readout, or a cleaning station...but if you do buy those versions.</li>
    <li> This razor is not good to my knowledge.    It is not giving close shave.  Particularly in the neck.  I started to continue with my Mach3.</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor. Easy maintenance and it does the job. Unfortunately, it lacks an important feature. There&#x27;s no recharge indicator. You only know it has to be recharged when it stops working. No warning of any kind. I admit I made an assumption based on my last Norelco model. A lesser problem is with the power switch. The location and incredible sensitivity make it too easy to accidentally turn the thing off while shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my life partner and he prefers it over the razor.  They&#x27;ve really improved these electic razors.</li>
    <li> This is the best ever shaver that I purchased gives you a close shave&lt;br /&gt;without irrating your face.</li>
    <li> After using this shaver for the past month I can honestly say it does a very fine job.  The shave is close and comfortable.  I have an average thickness and growth, and am very pleased with this product.  The batteries have yet to need recharging, so I cannot report the length of the recharge.</li>
    <li> This was a disappointment. Bought this based on the reviews but its performance was only ok, it does not shave close and causes a lot of burn. I thought the skin burn would be gone after using it for a while but it does not. It does not come any close to a razor shave. Ok for quick use and an ok shave though.</li>
    <li> The New Speed XL systems work ok but remember, this is very subjective as faces differ. I&#x27;ve tested several of the Speed Xl series and found them all adequate provided I don&#x27;t press too firmly. They can quickly irritate the skin or actually cut. Not sensitive skin friendly by any means. This shaver has 3 rows of rotating blades which cut perfectly well but don&#x27;t do as well as a good foil shaver in my case, even after the 21 day recommended break in period. You might need that much time to adjust but you&#x27;ll know up front how any shaver will perform new as it is the sharpest. There is a lot of plastic and cheap feel but the heads and motor seem well built. I compared this shaver to my Panasonic pro curve linear and Braun activator. Both shavers did much better overall than the Norelco. The Braun is decent but the head quality is not the best. The Panasonic, on the other hand, did very well and seemed much better in quality. There&#x27;s nothing really wrong with the Norelco and I can recommend it if you must have a rotary. If you don&#x27;t, the Panasonic is the best going. Meanwhile the Norelco must be used with care and they&#x27;re a bit pricey. Make sure to stock up on Remington&#x27;s shaver saver spray. It sharpens and lubes the heads of any good shaver and lengthens life of the head. As always, follow the directions.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my father.  He states it provides a very close shave with minimal skin irritation.  The shaver grip is a step up from mine (slightly older model) and it keeps its charge quite well.  Excellent product, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This Norelco was purchased for my husband for Christmas.  This is the second shaver he has had and has always been happy with it.  The durability and the functions which is long lasting without any problems will make him a Norelco user.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for years. This latest product from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco is outstanding! The circular heads were increased by 3 times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;making many more slots to catch wiskers. The shave is remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!</li>
    <li> Quick service. Excellent product. Stylish, quiet, long battery charge, excellent shave. Much improved over earlier models.</li>
    <li> The shave I get with this is fine, but be warned: The Norelco SpeedXL series has a built in blade life. Once Norelco thinks you need to change the blades (and they tend to think you should spend the $36  more often than you will want), the shaver disables itself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The way it does this is that it turns on the \\&quot;change blade\\&quot; warning LED. And this LED uses so much power that it drains the batteries in just over one day. Worse yet, the shaver will not operate unless the battery is charged, so this results in a dead shaver until you replace the blades. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Way to go Norelco. I used to be a big fan.</li>
    <li> Gives a close shave on tender skin with tough whiskers without razor burn. Tops as far as electric razors go.</li>
    <li> This shaver is nice. It takes about 2 or three uses to get used to but it is nice. The battery life it excellent. I took it on vacation for 10 days and never needed to charge it even though I used it everyday.</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  I needed a new razor, and I needed one that wouldn&#x27;t wake up the baby.    This razor is very quiet and leaves my face very smooth.    The only drawback for me is that I have to shave my neck VERY slowly so that I don&#x27;t irritate it - because the razor shaves so closely.  But as long as I&#x27;m slow and use some pre-shave on my neck, I don&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
    <li> For someone like me that has a beard like nails, I go through about two electric shavers a year. I&#x27;ve had Remingtons, Brauns, Norelcos, and Panasonics, to name just a few. After recently wearing out my Remington micro-screen, I decided to try the 8140. Well, after a full charge out of the box the RPM speed on the blades was so slow about all it did was pull some facial hair out by brute force, but not by cutting. This item is a plastic piece of junk and cannot call itself a \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; - don&#x27;t waste your time or money. I&#x27;m already filling out the paperwork to return it after only two attempts. I mean this thing runs sloooooooooooooow.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user, The shave is close enough. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It takes only few minutes to shave.</li>
    <li> Probably the best Norelco yet. I&#x27;ve owned Norelco products for years and am extremely pleased with this razor.</li>
    <li> My husband received this product from my family for Christmas...after much research on the pros and cons on this product. My husband said that after getting use to shaving with an electric shaver (after shaving manually all these many years) has its advantages. Shaving in the car is great; except when it is so cold outside that the shaver doesn&#x27;t work, like anything else that has batteries. It does take a little longer to shave than if you shaved the old fashioned way, especially it you have really stiff facial hair. My husband seems really pleased with the convenience and freedom that this cordless electric shaver has given him. Plus it is really simple to clean.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this electric razor. I have had many Norelco razors but this one actually pulls hairs instead of cutting them. I contacted Norelco and Amazon with my dissatisfaction. I would not purchase another one.</li>
    <li> This razor is very, very good. The only draw back is that it does not have a low battery indicator. Norelco has a very liberal return policy which is one reason I have always owned their products.</li>
    <li> The 8140XL gives a very good shave--better than some of my older Norelcos. &lt;br /&gt;The charge last a reasonably long time.   &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is trying to discharge the batery.  When the shaver battery stops working there is still power in the battery and it is best to discharge the battery as completely as possible.  This process on the 8140XL is a little tiedious and not as positive as my old shaver. &lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is great.</li>
    <li> Item purchased works great and was as described on internet.  We are very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I used to use a Remington. I&#x27;ve had it for six years and decided since the battery was going bad / I broke the trimmer a long time ago that I needed a new one.    I got this one from Walmart, which I always do and then find it on here cheaper. ... serves me right.    I used it for the first time tonight. It cut wonderfully. Closer than my Remington ever did. In parts it looks/feels like I shaved w/ a straight edge, which is great. I am having quite a bit of razer burn, but that&#x27;s absolutely expected. Hopefully it does go away, but Philips has a 60 day guarantee. Buy it and if you hate it you can fill out a form and they&#x27;ll refund your purchase. It can&#x27;t get any more simple than that. All the others have 30 days. They give a full 60 to make DARN sure you hate the thing before sending it back. I&#x27;m giving it the full 21 day suggested break-in, and hopefully it does me good.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband&#x27;s birthday...not knowing much about them, I read the reviews and decided this is the one I would purchase.  Glad I did as it shaves close, easy to clean and he like it.......worth the money!</li>
    <li> Purchased as my travel razor -- I do 100,000+ miles in the air and 60-80 nights/year away from home.  Small, holds a charge well, nice protective case.  Overall, seems to do nearly as well as the more expensive Norelco I use while home and like my new home razor, is quieter than early versions.  Only comment is that the case does not have room for the cord, so I need to remember to take the shaver out between trips to recharge.  Directions urge waiting until battery is low before recharging to lengthen battery life -- but that risks a trip where the battery runs down, so I&#x27;m ignoring the guidance.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, holds a long charge, easy cleaning and storage for a cheap price</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.   I&#x27;ve been hurt so badly. I&#x27;m planning to return it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband.  He had one exactly like it but after a number of years it finally broke.  He really likes it.  It saves him time in the morning.</li>
    <li> The first Norelco shaver I had lasted 9 years.  The second one I had lasted 10 years.  Here I am on my third one.  If you expense the cost over the years you are looking at roughly less than $10 per year (maybe replace the blades once or twice ... of course I never did).  For a shave this close, reliable, long battery life, stylish - it is a no brainer.  Buy this razor.  Remember, if you are not use to this type of shaver give it three weeks or so, your face will get used to it.  It will save you a BUNCH of time in the morning.  100% recommended.</li>
    <li> This product has great battery life and is fairly quiet when running.  However, it sometimes requires two or three rounds before I have a complete shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for an uncle on his Bday and he just loved it. It works  well, is washable, easy to grip and handle. The charge lasts for long and charges quick. Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut my neck (a first), pretty close shave (for an electric), good trimmer (watch out, it&#x27;s sharp), looks cool, comes with a base and a cord, charges so fast I feel cheated somehow, doesn&#x27;t cost a mint, comfortable. All in all, I&#x27;m completely content with thsi shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Norelco 6848XL (about 10 years old?) that has worked well, but is beginning to have poor battery life.  This new 8140XL appears to me to be cheaply built, to the point that I find myself still leaning towards using the older model.  In more detail, the cutting heads are slightly larger on the 8140, but much less smooth (even painful to an extent) than the older model.  Also, the cutting head is held on to the 8140 by a very sloppy connection and falls off very easily when you are trying to clean it.  The whole general construction of the 8140 seems to much less \\&quot;solid\\&quot; than the older 6848.    In short, Norelco seems to have gone towards cheaper cosnstruction in an attempt to save on costs (and yes, to be able to offer the 8140 at a \\&quot;low\\&quot; cost to the consumer).  However, this consumer is not impressed.  In hindsight, I should have instead sent the 6848 in for new batteries.</li>
    <li> Congratulation for you good choice, I choose this item for my father, and he likes it.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my dad. I got it when there has a good deal. So, i think it is valuable.</li>
    <li> i;m 62 years old,and for the first time in my life i look forward to shaving.i;ve never shaved this close with a razor.this is the best razor ever.three weeks of shaving before i charged it.words can&#x27;t describe how good this razor is.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razer since shaving with a blade for the past 20+ years. I really like the convenience of shaving without cream, water, etc. The razor is nice and light and is very comfortable shaving. With a little practice, it gives a nice, clean shave. So far, I have not required any pre or post shaving lotion/cream to stay comfortable. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean the heads..just put them under running water and out comes the hair. My only gripe is the \\&quot;automatic charging\\&quot; claim. Everytime you want to charge the razor, you have to plug it in. They recommend unplugging the charger when not in use because it shortens the battery life otherwise. It would be nice if you could just leave it plugged in and forget about it. However, so far it recharges very quickly, only taking about 15 minutes 1x/week and the \\&quot;full charge\\&quot; blinky light tells you when to unplug it. A previous review reported using it for 3 weeks without charging. If you run the battery dead, it takes only 3 minutes charging for 1 shave, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the charge state too much. Besides that one gripe, it&#x27;s a great razor and I highly recommend it. While shaving with a blade I was skipping days because of the hassle. Now it&#x27;s a shave every day, and I actually look forward to shaving!</li>
    <li> Not sure who can get a close shave from this, but after buying this, it leaves me with a nice Don Johnson look.  I may be on the thicker beard side of things, but I would expect this to atleast \\&quot;speed\\&quot; through to a nice close shave, etc.  Even after putting a large amount of pressure on my skin, it appears these plastic razor blades still would not get a close shave.  I have an older Norelco (metal blades) that has always done a decent job (but never as good as an old-fashioned manual razor shave), but nonetheless efficient.   This newer version, however, is an extreme disappointment.  I think they tried to save $ on materials, and ultimately killed the quality or usefulness.</li>
    <li> I live in a nursing home and bought this electric tripple header because my caregiver took my thirty-year old tripple header that still worked great when he quit taking care of me. A nurse&#x27;s aid broke my new tripple header after she dropped it many times while cleaning the head over a waste basket. The manager wouldn&#x27;t replace it since it was a little over two years old. I told him it worked fine and would have lasted many years before it broke when dropped. Now I have extra parts if they break this one and I love the great shave I get. I&#x27;d recomend this shaver to anyone wanting a great shave for many years.</li>
    <li> I switched from the Braun electric razors (last two generations) back to a rotary electric razor with this purchase and FOR ME, I prefer these rotary razors. I say, \\&quot;FOR ME\\&quot; because I realize that my own experience may be different from others.     BRAUN - CLOSE SHAVE FAST  Both razors are pretty good at quickly shaving the easy spots where the hairs stick straight out (upper lip, cheeks, chin). However, in those easy spots, the Brauns give a closer shave in the first pass or two. It might take as much as twice as long using the 8140XL to get it as smooth as possible. So, the Braun wins the race for getting a very close shave as fast as possible.     ROTARY - BETTER AT DIFFICULT SPOTS WHERE HAIR LAYS FLAT  However, the rotaries get a reasonably close shave for everyday use in a pass or two AND they do much better in tough spots where the hair tend to lay flat, like my neck. With the Braun, I would always have a few hairs that would never get cut. They would get so long that I would eventually have to pull them out with tweezers. The 8140XL get&#x27;s those hairs every time I shave so that they never get long enough to be pulled (or seen) individually.    8140XL - BETTER VALUE THAN LATEST BRUANS AND EVEN LATEST NORELCOS  To me, I found those neck hairs a bigger frustration so I much prefer this rotary design and I&#x27;m very glad I switched back. It&#x27;s almost a secondary issue for me, but the latest Braun&#x27;s (and the latest Norelco&#x27;s) are much more expensive than this model. As far as I can tell, the only difference between this model and the latest Norelco&#x27;s is that the latest Norelco&#x27;s have a more modern looking design and they don&#x27;t have floating heads. Another nice thing about this model is that the top flips open so that you can rinse it under the sink. There is no need to purchase costly cleaning solutions. All-in-all a much better value even if you had a more neutral preference for flat laying hairs/difficult spots versus quick close shave in easy spots.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Meeets the traditional standards of Norelco. Quick charge. fast and complete shave,easy to clean, comfortable,etc. There are no adverse issues with this razor.    I got it to replace one of the Arcitec models which,for me, was totally unsatisfactory. The contrast between the two is immediately apparent with the 8140XL.    With a five star rating, I would give it a seven.</li>
    <li> i researched this shaver very diligently and found&lt;br /&gt;great reviews.  the one i received is very light weight&lt;br /&gt;apparently because of an undersized battery.  does not&lt;br /&gt;have enough power to give a decent shave.  i quit even trying&lt;br /&gt;to use it and bought a remington that is just satisfactory&lt;br /&gt;but a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> I hope some day eletric shavers will be as good as regular blades, but I have to be honest that this Philips Norelco 8140XL was better than I expected. No irritation of the skin, time gain (I shave in the car), fast battery recharge (it lasts for an hour or so) and, above all, clean face are the topics that made me really like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric thinking I would get a closer shave than a blade. Wrong! The instruction say give it 3 weeks to get broken in. Its been 3, now 4 momths and the shaver barely trims my one day growth ( and I do not have a heavy beard). I have to use a blade to finish the job anyway, so why do I need to pay for this thing? It is horrible and a waste of money. Its not worth shaving twice so this is going into the garbage basket. I&#x27;ve been ripped off to the tune of $150.</li>
    <li> Update: Still going strong after almost 3 1/2 years...to get a better shave I&#x27;ve started using Electric Shave...it helps.  Next time I&#x27;ll still look for an electric razor that shaves close enough without Electric Shave.    I&#x27;ve used this razor for almost 6 months.  Sorry, it just does not shave close enough, and I always get a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  The Remington I purchased in 1998 shaves closer (I&#x27;ve replaced the blade a few times), but the battery is long dead and only works if plugged in; hence the new purchase.  Also, the trimmer is nearly useless...I still use the Remington for trimming.  On the plus side, the rinse feature is outstanding and it is very quiet.  Wish I could have tried before I bought...I will next time.</li>
    <li> I used a Norelco Quadra 6865XL for several years. It took 30 to 40 days before the razor (or my skin) adjusted to give a good shave. The Speed XL takes longer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried a Spectra. Was as good as the Quadra. However, the plastic cap would not stay in place. And the shaver head detached and flew off when I pushed the release button. The Quadra was worse -- the cutters would drop out during cleaning. Speed XL does not suffer from either problem. The plastic cap fits very well. And the cutters stay firmly in place. The motor is very quiet and, initially, I felt the blades were too slow. Be patient, the shaver works very well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have an average beard and it took 15+ minutes for a good shave. It dropped to 10 mintes in 4+ weeks and now, at 3+ months, it takes 7 minutes. The shave is particularly close on the chin (despite a cleft) and moustache. The clipper is quieter and nick free, compared with the Quadra. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The design of the carrying case is brilliant. I wish I had done it. Small and perfect for inter-continental trips, as it packs easily into a briefcase. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The charging stand takes too much space in the bathroom. I plug the wall wart into the shaver when needed; improves battery life and is eco-friendly, as the charger is unplugged between charges.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco razor&#x27;s for years.  This is not one of my favorites.  It seems more irritating than the older modles.  I tried shaving my bicept area and received a rather severe shaving rash and it actually scraped the tender skin on my inner bicept.  I also notice that it is harder on the skin on my face and neck than my previous razor (a Norelco modle 5822XL).  I think the 8140XL shaves closer but it too irritating.  I have been using it for one month.  Maybe I will get used to it</li>
    <li> After many years using an old Norelco, I recently upgraded to the 8140XL.  This is an superb product.  I find the shave to be very close -- approaching that of a blade.  Battery life is excellent, and it charges very quickly (30 min is plenty).  After two weeks of use, I recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> Shaving with this razor is quick and easy. Cleaning it is a snap. I charged it once when I first got it as per instructions, I use it every day for a few minutes, and it&#x27;ll be a month tomorrow that I&#x27;ve had it. My only problems with it are that it is not as close as a blade, though this is quite understandable, and that it often misses a few longer hairs - so I either have to spend more time or do a quick once-over with a blade or some tweezers.</li>
    <li> Tried the new 8171XL, a slightly more dressed up version of 8140XL. Comparing to my old 6886XL Quadro, the new one is cheaper in most aspect, material, workmanship, look and feel. The whole thing feels flimsy. With the only exception of the motor, which sounds more solid and together than the 6886XL. The worst parts are the trimmer on the back and the charger and the power cord. It makes me wonder just how long this thing is going to last. My 6886XL worked for me faithfully for 8 years. Never replaced anything. The battery is dying, instead of lasting 35 min as it did in the beginning, it now last about half that much, not bad after 8 years. I left it charging long after it&#x27;s full for countless times. The blades gets dull. But still, shaved with the new 8171, the old 6886, and Braun 7505, I&#x27;d say the Braun is the closest and loudest. The Braun looks balky and its plastic feels cheap. But better than this new 8171XL! Norelco seems to have gone hip-pop, with the new color and design, cheap everything and all. I&#x27;m going for the lesser evil - Braun 7505. The German one feels like it will last longer than the Norelco and it looks more like a honest shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: &lt;br /&gt;If you want something good for a couple of month before you get tired of it and switch, it&#x27;s not bad. It works as good as my 8 year old 6886Xl, but no better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you are into something solid and reliable for the long term, try other brand.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Without real competition in its rotary niche, it&#x27;s no surprise that Norelco goes the way it does today. But very disappointing to me nevertheless. I am returing the new 8171 tomorrow...</li>
    <li> 1/2 year update: I went back to Braun brand (360 w/ cleaning station). While overall Speed XL continued to perform decently, it started pulling hair a little bit more often than I would tolerate. I also started noticing a lot of issitation on the neck. I would expect that as my skin got used to it this would not happen. Perhaps the blades needed to be replaced, but if that is the case 1/2 year is way too short of a life time. So I&#x27;ve been using Braun 360 for twoo weeks now, and it is definitely a little bit better (I&#x27;ll have a separate review later).     Original Review:  I used to have Braun 5100 series, which was a good razor but not ideal for the neck and chin. Norelco SpeedXL is as good on the cheecks and much better in the curved areas. It is definitely \\&quot;faster\\&quot; in a way that it takes fewer passes to shave off the whiskers as they advertise. I also like the idea that you can just pop it open and rinse it. Newer Brauns have self-cleaning system, but I&#x27;d rather not spend extra $$$ on the cartridges and save space on the bathroom counter.     Using preshaving lotion improves the results even more. But keep in mind that while it does a very good, \\&quot;presentable\\&quot; job, it is still not a match for a good Gillette razor, so don&#x27;t expect miracles.     Some users commented on the cheap feeling of this shaver compared with Norelco&#x27;s old metal models. On the other hand it is very light and with modern plastics the way they are it is probably durable enough for the purpose. Unless you shave regularly while hanging off the cliff or trecking in the Himalayas this model will probably last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have owned two Norelco Quadra-Action razors, and I was very pleased those. When I accidentally dropped my last one I decided to go ahead and step up to SpeedXL line, thinking I would notice significant improvements. The razor still does a great job for an electric, but I have to say the changes Norelco has made over the Quadra line are not noticeable to me: It takes the same amount of time for me to shave, the same few places are hard to get smooth, and the battery life is about the same. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, if you are considering this and a Quadra-Action, I would suggest you save yourself some money and go with the latter, seemingly-identical razor.</li>
    <li> On the plus side, like most mid-line Norelco shavers, it delivers a decent shave, is fairly quiet, and deals with longer hairs fairly well. I&#x27;ve been a loyal Norelco rotary fan for close to 20 years.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Times have changed since Philips bought Norelco. The early Norelcos were the best shavers I could find and lasted a long time. The last several Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve bought, however, have either gone dull and/or the batteries have grown week within a year of buying them. I honestly believe Philips/Norelco is doing this on purpose to sell more expensive replacement blades and shavers? The sad thing is you buy a $70 shaver and the replacement blades run about $40. And, in my experience, the batteries (which cannot be replaced) die before the second set of blades wear out. So you&#x27;re out $110 in about 18 months and have to buy a new shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fed up spending a small fortune these last several years on Norelco products that just don&#x27;t last I tried the latest Braun \\&quot;360 Complete\\&quot; shaver and so far am very pleased. To my surprise it shaves MUCH closer than my 8140XL and with less irritation. I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but based on the quality of the shave, and their short life, I&#x27;m done with Norelco.</li>
    <li> I expected that the 8140XL would perform more like the Norelco razor that I have had for several years -- it still works, but is starting to show signs of slowing down and therefore the reason for the purchase of the 8140XL. The more I use the 8140XL, the more I am getting used to the differences between it and my old razor; like weight, charging duration, and quietness of the 8140XL. &lt;br /&gt;    I am OK with the new product, but I am not as thrilled with it as I was with my old Norelco razor when I bought it.  Maybe I&#x27;ll grow into it.</li>
    <li> Shaver shaves very close, almost as good as a blade.  This is my 1st electric razor and I am sure it will do 99% of what a blade will do in half the time.  I am quite satisfied with the overall results and will most likely buy another before going back to a blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an old safety razor guy...at least I was until recently.  This machine is a very pleasant surprise; very little noise and it cuts the wire growing on my face as close as a blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Great work, Norelco ! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Gave this shaver to both husband and son for Xmas. Husband says it&#x27;s the best electric shaver he&#x27;s had. Better than old Norelco he had. Hasn&#x27;t even had to recharge it since 12/26.</li>
    <li> This razor is lighter and easier to clean than previous ones owned.  Excellent shave!  Like the razor stand.  Would have liked a minute display for the charge remaining, but seems to be working out fine with just charging on the weekend.  Takes less than an hour to recharge!  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I wish I had known the problems I would have with this lemon I would&#x27;ve made sure I took Norelco up on their satisfaction guarantee!  I have an old 5601X that works as well.  I expected quicker, closer shaves and it takes just as long.  The top pops open without warning and I&#x27;m sure the slots are smaller than my previous Norelcos so my whiskers don&#x27;t get shaved as close nor as fast.  Gee!  Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this puppy!  I&#x27;ve had at least four other Norelcos since I started shaving about forty years ago and this is the worst!</li>
    <li> I checked at the local big box retailers and the price at amazon was approx $10.00 less with free shipping.  I charged the unit as soon as I received it and as of 4 weeks later I have not recharged it yet. I highly recommend the Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a blade shaver, but it seemed I was changing them weekly, they cost ever-more, and I was never happy with my shave.  I really liked the fact that it&#x27;s suggested I start with a dry face, no shave crap to buy or anything like that.  I like how this electric razor holds a charge for four hours and can just rest in the medicine cabinet in the interim.  (It should only be charged when it&#x27;s fully dishcharged, according to the packaging info)  I like rinsing the heads in running water when I&#x27;m done shaving and leaving it open to dry, and if I use the sideburn trimmer, brushing it clean (as directed) is no big deal.  I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to do monthly maintenance (remove the three floating heads, keeping them matched togethor, and rinsing them with water) but it all sounds pretty easy.  I&#x27;m content with how this shaves my face, as well.  No complaints, no suggestions for improvment, no regrets...  It comes with a travel case.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted to use an electric shaver in between my normal days of shaving with a razor...shaving has never been such a chore! I literally never use it because it takes me at least 15 minutes to get a decent shave, and even then it&#x27;s nowhere near as close as my normal shave with a blade.</li>
    <li> Shop around if you are looking for a good quality shaver. There is nothing special about this shaver. I read great reviews, perhaps I expected too much.</li>
    <li> I did careful reasearch on the shavers... This one turned to be the general favorite. It is easy to use and clean.... I got good shave starting the first day. I would definitely recommend it to anybody who is trying electric shavers for the first time.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long.  I&#x27;ve had others that lasted much, much longer.</li>
    <li> I believe my husband is satisfied with this product - I was impressed with the customer service.  For some reason my order was doubled, I returned second item and was pleased to see that I was not required to pay the postage - also, a credit was promptly given.</li>
    <li> Instead of viewing this shaver as something revolutionary, I would instead view it as solid fine-tuning. Though not quite through my first month, I can&#x27;t say the shave is significantly closer than my previous triple head Norelco vintage about 1999. It does shave more quickly given the larger cutting surfaces and clean-up is wonderful-- simply rinse and store. It is also quieter. I am very satisfied with the purchase and would recommend as a fine upgrade, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend throwing away those blades just yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for many years. I was very disappointed in the quality and feel of this razor when I received it. It feels cheap when you hold it and it doesn&#x27;t have a good solid sound like the previous models I owned. There is no light or meter to indicate when a charge is needed. You can tell when its running down or it just stops when the battery is exhausted.    The packaging it came in is deadly! It was encased in numerous layers of blister packs with no easy way to cut the packaging to get to the razor. If you&#x27;re not careful, you can easily cut yourself on the plastic packaging.    The shave is adequate, but as I mentioned above it lacks the sound and feel that I used to experience with previous models which diminishes the satisfaction of the shaving experience.    I would not recommend this razor and I&#x27;m looking for a replacement even though I just purchased it a couple of months ago.</li>
    <li> My husband thinks I&#x27;m the bomb because I got him this razor.  It took him some time to open it because the packaging was so tight.  One thing he did complain about was the fact that you can over charge your razor because it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic cut-off when its full charged.  Other than that he loves it and you would too.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Norelco 8140XL is a fantastic Razor.  I&#x27;ve had no problems what-so-ever with it&#x27;  I highly recommend this Razor.</li>
    <li> I have been using another Philips shave for years, and I needed a new one since the previous one broke due to my mishandle.    This one is much lighter, convenient (washable), but the same performance.  Price was also good.</li>
    <li> This baby is super quiet and fast!!! the pop up trimmer is great. battery life is even better!!! i charge it about once every 2 or 3 weeks and use it every other day for about 10 mins so imagine that. only problem is spring loaded pop-up trimmer and the rotating head cover... :/ and this DOES NOT simply stop at low battery... it winds down quickly though. cleaning is easy. Gets REALLY close w/e cutting your skin!! not so great near the neck, but then again what is?!?! Hope you decide to buy this model. :D if u you enjoy it all you can :D  Linear to rotary convert!! :D</li>
    <li> Quite frankly, this razor gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  The triple blades work wonders and it even cuts the neck hairs that are usually the downfall of electric razors.  Well worth every penny I spent.</li>
    <li> The quiet shave and ease of cleaning this unit are great!  The charge lasts for about two weeks during normal use and the comfort of the shave is very nice after a couple of days for your face to get used to the change from a foil razor.      The only thing keeping it from a 5 star rating for me is the closeness of the cut.  It is not as quite close cutting as my Braun was but the other things outweigh the difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver thinking it was better than my old Quad Norelco.  It is not because it doesn&#x27;t have some of the features I expected.  I am disappointed that what was a simple Norelco shaver now has so many features that it is impossible to tell the better ones from the standard ones, except for prices differences.  When I look on the web (Amazon and Norelco) it would be great if there was a side-by-side chart comparing all the fetures of all the Norelco shavers.  That would do a lot to help customers sort out which features and prices range work the best for them.  It is easier to buy a car because at least the manufacturer has grouped the options so that customers don&#x27;t have to look at 20 simular but different cars (other than colors).</li>
    <li> This Hi-Tech Shaver is Excellent.  The instructions must be read and followed.  The few negative reviews I looked at indicated that the user did not read the instructions.  This Shaver is even better that my previous Norelco (which lasted 14 years).</li>
    <li> I had to switch to an electric razor due to irritation caused by using a blade. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about it, knowing that an electric will NEVER give as close a shave as a blade. This did indeed prove to be true, however, I will give this razor more credit than I thought I would. It is extremely lightweight and quiet. Cleaning it couldn&#x27;t be simpler, simply rinse under hot water. Charging and simple maintenance are both as easy as cleaning it. As others have said, it will give a good, close shave on the cheeks and other broad flat areas. On the neck, especially under the chin/between the Adam&#x27;s apple area and either side, it is lacking. I go in different directions, and gently pull the skin, etc. and still I can&#x27;t it as close as I want. That said, however, it is convenient to shave with an electric. The manufacturer claims that the shaving head should be changed once a year. Since the hair on my face is closer to the wire bristles you&#x27;d find on a wheel mounted to a grinder instead of hair on a person&#x27;s face, I figure changing them twice a year will be a better idea for myself. All in all I&#x27;m satisfied with this item, and the price I paid for it. I rated it four stars because this is my first experience with an electric so I don&#x27;t know what would constitute a five star product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009MFUOA Philips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL Men&#x27;s Shaver]] Better than I even expected.  Best deal for the price.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009MFUOA Philips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL Men&#x27;s Shaver]] My husband complained and complained about the terrible shaves he was getting from the three shavers he was using. So I ordered the Norelco SpeedXL Shaver for him. All I have heard is how close his shave is and how much he enjoys it. 5 stars to it. My ears are resting from all the griping!</li>
    <li> Product was accurately described and received in a timely manner.  Quality of shaver is excellent for the price range.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in good condition.  Works one hundred percent better than old shaver it replaced, excellent shaving experience and smooth skin without pulling. My husband definitely recommends this product.</li>
    <li> I have had another norelco for years. The blades have worn out and buying a new razor is almost the same cost as replacing the head so I got the 8140. Noreclos still work much better than other electrics. Have not had a bad one yet.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Norelco 8140XL shaver after reading several positive reviews. I cannot get a good, clean shave with this razor and it takes a long time going over and over my face to try to get a smooth shave. Even after doing this, I can still feel my face is rough and not clean shaven !! Am I doing something wrong ????</li>
    <li> The Norelco 8140XL is the best that you are going to get from an electric shaver.  I tried a Remington foil shaver and it was horrible.  It did a poor job of shaving, was VERY loud and made a mess of my bathroom when I cleaned it.  I returned it and bought the 8160XL because it was the same price as the 8140XL on Amazon.  The Jet Clean system is a waste of time and space.  You clean the cutting blades by opening the top and holding it under running water - done!  I don&#x27;t see any reason to use the cleaning system.  If can&#x27;t use a multi-blade razor and need to go electric then I recommend the Norelco 8140XL.  My rating system:  *****(5 stars) - Good old multi-blade razor and shave cream (my old skin can&#x27;t take blades anymore)  ****(4 stars) - Norelco 8140XL  ***(3 stars) - Norelco 8160XL  * (1 star) - Remington foil type shaver</li>
    <li> First some background. It is my first time using an electric shaver, all my life I have been a blade guy, so I have not point of reference respect others electric shavers. I arrive to the 8140XL trough a friend recommendation for Norelco shavers and after researching a lot. For the price it looked as the better value for money I could get.    Let&#x27;s go with the review. The 8140 is well designed, easy to handle, easy to move over your face, not heavy, and very quiet. The heads feels very soft and they do not get hot, I was afraid of burns, but after two months of using it that has not happens. The shave is very close, not as close as a blade, but not bad. I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband, who was willing to try and replace the wet with a dry shave. The head is flexible, but takes a while getting used to and he cut himself way too many times in that first try. In the end he said he will stick with the traditional razor and we returned it. It is probably a great shaver, just didn&#x27;t work in our case.</li>
    <li> When my husband&#x27;s Norelco was showing signs of old age, he went to Walmart and bought a Braun shaver.  He hated it and took it back the next day. Fortunately I had ordered the Norelco 8140 XL as a Christmas gift several weeks ago. When he opened his gift, he was thrilled with it in every respect, especially the length of time before needing to recharge. He also loves the stand that comes with it.  A good buy all around.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  It gives a close shave, is very quiet and he loves the fact it can be rinsed right in the sink for easy cleaning.  It is also very light weight and stylish.</li>
    <li> You cant get a closer shave with any other razor! We have two of these. One for the lake and one for home. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have owned numerous Norelcos in the past, and kept them for 5-6 years each.  So I gladly bought this one back in Aug 07.  I was disappointed in Dec 07 when it had an electrical problem, turning itself on and off at will.  But customer service was terrific, and they sent me a new one with no questions asked.  Then that one went bac in Jul 09.  Again, a replacement with no problem.  Now in Dec 09 that one has gone bad as well -- out of warranty.  I don&#x27;t know if any shaver company is better, but I&#x27;m done with Norelco and will be trying Braun or Panasonic or Remington.</li>
    <li> I had Norelco razors before that shaved well that used the lift and cut blades.  With those razors you were supposed to shave with a rotating motion.  With this razor if you shave with a rotating motion it pulls the whiskers out and it is very painful.  You have to shave with and up and down motion, but you have to be very careful or it will still pull the whiskers out.  This Speed XL shaver is much more expensive and does a bad job.  Shame on Norelco.</li>
    <li> Good shaver, I wouldn&#x27;t pay over 100 $ for it. Amazon delivery wasn&#x27;t that fast even if I paid 25$ + to have it fast. That&#x27;s probably because it had to go through border. Satisfy of the product overall. Don&#x27;t make negative comment from seller, they will call you home to have it removed.</li>
    <li> I went through two of these over the last 3 years. The first one failed after one year. I received a replacement from Norelco because it was still under warrenty. The second one lasted two years. I opened it up and it appeared the motor burned out. There was a burnt smell coming from the motor.    I liked the shave but these things just do not last very long. I have a 15 yr old 885RX and it works great. Still gives a pretty good shsve. You can see the difference in quality. The 885RX had much better construction than the 8140. I just ordered a Panasonic ES7103K. The reviews indicate it is well constructed.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 3 years now and it still works great. It is especially good on the curves under my jaw and my neck.  I have only had to change the blade once a year.  I keep mine in the shower and just shave with soap and water for a smooth shave. I recharge it in it&#x27;s stand once a week. Takes less than a hour to get back to full charge.</li>
    <li> Still works well after 6 years of usage and more convenient design than the newest 2D  Norelco models. It works also quitely than the newest 2D handsome blue-design model, which has trimmer only as an attachment, not as a part of the main body. Do not waste your money buying the newest Norelco otherwise handsome blue-colored models, this works as well for less money. Definitely the better value for your money!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this razor. I have used electric razors most of my 35+ years of shaving. I was skeptical using it for the first time, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working because it is so soft to the face and so quiet. It didn&#x27;t sound \\&quot;agressive\\&quot; like my other razors did. WRONG!!! The shave was close, my skin was not irritated at all, and it cut smooth basically in the first pass. This unit is first class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous razor was a Braun foil. I bought one for myself and another for my son from Frys because of the price. JUNK!!! We both have heavy beards, he more so than I, and both of us had terrible 5 o&#x27;clock shadows by 10:00AM! And the skin irritation on my neck, just horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a long time comparing all the available models. For me this model provides the best mix of features and price. I definitely recommend the Speed-XL shaving heads. Other nice features are it can be cleaned under the faucet, it charges quickly and maintains that charge for a long time, and it provides what I consider one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve had in a long time. The heft and feel is good. Materials are good. Workmanship is good. The only feature I&#x27;d like to have is a battery charge indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other Speed-XL model is the 8160. It includes the cleaning system with a much higher price. Now there is the SmartTouch-XL which may be overkill. But if price is not an issue...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May, 2012 - I can&#x27;t believe I wrote the original review almost seven years ago. I&#x27;m still using this razor and it still works just as I expressed back then. The battery still keeps a great charge, and the shave is still excellant. I went on a 10 day vacation last year and the charge held for the whole trip. This is truly a great product.</li>
    <li> I agree with most of the other reviews.  This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had--lightyears better than the Braun Syncro I was using before.  I don&#x27;t expect to get as close a shave with an electric as with a blade, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to judge them by that standard; the only thing that makes sense is to compare them to other electrics, and this one is outstanding.  It&#x27;s quiet, it charges quickly, and it shaves your beard.  I like products I don&#x27;t have to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not pleased by the fact that this model doesn&#x27;t have a low-battery indicator.  That&#x27;s a demerit.  The stand is a little gimmicky.  You can charge the unit without using the stand; the stand just makes the product look a bit more pretentious.  (My shaver came with a free \\&quot;personal groomer\\&quot; for beards as well as ear and nose hair; this was a nice addition, but not enough to make or break the sale.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, to the guy who had a hassle at Target: don&#x27;t blame the product for the fact that you don&#x27;t like Target&#x27;s return policy.</li>
    <li> has it all--great shave with NO bells and whistles.  Cleans easily, shaves closely--not a blade, never will be--is light, is well made.</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelo rotary razor user for over 30 years.  The 8140XL is the first I have owned with three cutters in each head setup.  Why didn&#x27;t I get this shaving system sooner?  (Well my old one was still going OK, but was not holding a charge as long.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 8140XL is quiet, light weight and shaves my beard with no problems.  The little neck hairs that have a mind of their own, which my old razor would miss, cannot hide from this razor.  In the morning, I find my beard is not has long as before, therefore it has to be shaving closer that the old one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend all of you with the old single cutter heads (cannot speak to dual cutter heads - if they ever existed), seriously look at any of the new Norelcos with the three cutters head design.</li>
    <li> I am a man who hates to shave; it&#x27;s a daily chore I happily forego any time I&#x27;m not working and have no place to go.  I&#x27;ve been through a number of electric shavers in my time, of both the three-headed and foil varieties, and I have not really been happy with any one of them.  As far as my face goes, foil shavers just don&#x27;t do the job, especially on the neck - and those blasted foils tend to break quite easily, so the first thing you know you&#x27;re rubbing a sharp metal edge over your face.  The three-headed Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past have worked fairly well but never seemed to deliver as close a shave as I wanted or expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Norelco XL shavers may cost a little more than your average electric shaver, but they really do the job.  Finally, I have a razor I can be happy with.  This little beauty delivers what is easily the closest shave of any razor I&#x27;ve ever used, even on those neck hairs that eluded all my retired and discarded models.  I&#x27;m talking about a huge, very noticeable difference.  This shaver seems to mold itself to my face as I move from one area to another - the feeling was downright uncanny the first time I used it.  I&#x27;ve probably cut my shaving time down by two-thirds, and I get a much closer shave, to boot.  That alone makes this product worth the price, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery has been a wonder all by itself, as well.  It takes almost no time at all to fully charge this shaver - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s taken less than a half hour for me as of yet.  And that battery charge lasts forever.  I can go two weeks or more without needing to recharge, whereas I used to have to charge my old shavers at least once a week.  These XL shavers are also wonderfully easy to clean.  No longer do you have to worry about popping the cover off and fumbling it into the toilet bowl (hey, with my luck, it could happen) because the top doesn&#x27;t detach itself completely - it attaches via a hinge that makes for really easy access and cleaning.

This is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find an electric shaver that shaves as close as a straight razor, but I like to alternate to give my face a break.  The Norelco is very quiet and almost vibrationless.  It shaves as close as any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Although it is difficult to know when the battery is wearing down, i just plug it in every few days to make sure it always has power when I need it.  That is not big deal.  I read the Amazon reviews before purchasing this item and I am satisfied with my choice---I pretty much knew what I was getting.</li>
    <li> While this shaver seems to give a quick shave, it does not shave as closely as earlier Norelco models.  This particular model does not tell you when the battery needs recharging.</li>
    <li> This razor shaves very well after the \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period for your skin. Yhe battery has a very good life without charging. This razor has a rinse feature that is also very handy for cleaning. I would purchase an identical one when another is needed!</li>
    <li> I just bought the 8150XL at Target and, tomorrow, I am going to get a refund and buy the model where there is a satisfaction guarantee.  (and that is what I&#x27;m going to tell the clerk as well.  Hopefully they&#x27;ll care enough to let management know, though company loyalty on the part of workers is understandably low these days... :(  )</li>
    <li> This Razor seems to work well so far (about 6 weeks) but I have the feeling that it is not very robust. I have another shaver from Philips which is 20 years old and which still works fine and it seems to be better built en rest better in the hand. The other question I have is that the motor is so low in noise level, that it is hard to know when the battery runs down.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaces another Norelco shaver I had been using. This one is much more quiet and easier to clean and use. I&#x27;m not sure why I waited this long to replace my old shaver. However, one thing I miss is the audible alarm when the unit needs recharging. After reading through the literature that came with the unit, I discovered that this feature was available on an upgraded model; too late to exchange at that point.</li>
    <li> As a long-time electric shave user I looked forward to finally replacing my eight year old Norelco with a new model.  The 8140XL does everything as promised, a very close shave, a long-lasting battery, no irritation and very, very quiet.  The larger heads glide effortlessly and quickly across the face; while the pop-up trimmer is at an unusual angle it works well once gotten used to. &lt;br /&gt;I would rate the shave as a 9 of 10 when compared to a barber-shop, straight edge cut.  And that&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and I am very satisfied with is product; It shaved well with too much effect. Only thing is that the shaver does have a battery meter; so you have to guess. (kind of pain in the butt when traveling)</li>
    <li> I used to have a simpler shaver, with 3 head but a lot simpler than this one. Now I have a really good one. My skin when I end shaving becomes really soft. My previous shaver (Philips also) used to leave a lot of hairs back in my face and almost all other I could fell with touch. NOW the felling at the end is awesome, my face becomes really nice in the touch. A nice product, I&#x27;m really happy with him.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned four Norelco shavers in the past twenty years.  This one is by far the nicest to date.  It is quiet, fast and leaves my face really smooth with minimal pressure required to do the job.</li>
    <li> Seems like it will be a reliable shaver but sort of weak on speed and battery. The extra light material makes you believe it is a cheaper product however nothing else makes me believe it wont last a while. I dont believe I am not getting my moneys worth but I would have spent some extra and upgraded for something a little stronger. I like to beleive my investment is what I will be using for several years.</li>
    <li> This shaver has the XL heads - more cutting surface, faster cleaner shave.  I love the fact I can wash it under the tap and i even got used to the stand.  The time between charges is excellent too.  I have been using Norelco shavers for the past 20 years and this is the best model.</li>
    <li> The shaver was everything advertised.  It works excellent easy to use and charge.  My first experience with an electric razor.  Should have changed 40 years ago.  I am 68 years old and changed at direction of a doctor,  Regular shaving resulted in nick in the skin which caused severe bleeding due to medication.  No worry now.      Service and shipping of the product by Amazon.com was as promised and as a mater of fact 5 days early.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t keen on this razor. I had a Braun for two years and the battery died on me. So it would not recharge. I thought I would give Norelco a go. I don&#x27;t like the plastic feel of the unit and after a few weeks it is not shaving my neck well at all. I know it takes time for your skin to adjust, but for me this does not give a close enough shave.    I was so frustated that I have turned back to using a regular razor. I will be returning this product to Noreclo. Fortuanately it comes with a full 60 day money back guarnatee. Although you have to pay for the shipping back to them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco shavers over the last 20 years or so, and this offers the best shave of all of them.  I also appreciate the fact that this unit holds a charge for more shaves than any of the previous units.  However, this unit does not provide any indicator of the remaining charge in the batteries, otherwise I would give it a 5 star rating.  This can present a surprise when the unit just stops when it runs out of juice, or one must be more proactive in recharging.  Yes, it will quick charge, but my personal preference would be to have some sort of charge level indicator, which is offered on other, more expensive units.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had used an electric shaver in many years, and this model was a pleasant surprise in some ways: It is extremely silent, and easy to take care of (you can put it in running water w/no problem). The shave is also very close, which is basically what I was looking for. &lt;br /&gt;A big downside for me is that the shaver doesnt work as well in tricky places (e.g., neck), so I need to shave the same area many times and the skin gets a bit irritated. Overall a good buy, but technology is not there yet for me to completely discard my manual razor.</li>
    <li> The razor itself  is a good product. But  the plastic razor cap was missing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hate the clamshell packaging. It is  almost impossible to open, and it can be dangerous to break through the plastic. Please  make it easier to access the razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver for almost 50 years.  For the last 35 years I&#x27;ve been using Norelco products.  I am pleasantly surprised this model 8140XL gives me a closer shave than a blade razor.  With previous Norelco products, I would have to go over each part of my face several times.  With this model it is once, and it&#x27;s done.  Astounding!</li>
    <li> I have used Braun for a long time (&gt;5 years). This time, my wife gave me this one as a gift. I really like it. It is easy to clean. The movable head can fit my face pretty well anywhere I need it. The only thing I do not like it is that this does not shave as clean as my old Braun. I think it is because the difference of the heads.     My old Braun had worked for almost 6 years and still works great. I hope this one can work that long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been user of philips shavers for several years. At this time, I bought the Norelco 8140XL and I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks, and now I can say that this shaver is an excelent cost-value product. The most remarkable features are:    - Very silent operation  - Long battery life  - The cutting heads do not overheat  - Close an confortable shaves    I have no doubts. A five stars product.</li>
    <li> The Razor works well and cleans easily.  I noticed that when the batteries run down it just shuts off,  it does not seem to slow down as the batteries run down and need to be charged.  The charger cord has a tranformer at the plug end so it is larger than a standard plug. The charger stand does not have to be used, the cord will plug directly to the razor or into the charging stand. This may be an important consideration when travelling.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for over 40 years, and have always sworn by them. My father and both grandfathers used them--and now, my son. However, I am now looking at other brands for the first time ever. I have had three SpeedXL models in the past year--and all have had the on/off switch go bad within a few months. One of the razors was replaced by Norelco--but I am tired of the hassle of undependable razors! The last one woke us up in the middle of the night when it turned on by itself. The razors do give a very nice shave--they just do not last very long.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it and can&#x27;t stop talking about how quiet it is and close shave with very little effort. Head movement is perfect. Best buy of the season!</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as a travel razor since my Braun was a bit too bulky to transport. This shaves almost as close as the much more expensive Braun 9595 and feels better on your face. It is compact enough to travel well and is very easy to clean (just rinse with warm water). For the price, this is an excellent choice and has survived several drops from the sink, being thrown around with my luggage for countless thousand miles and generally being abused. I would recommend it as either a travel or primary razor.</li>
    <li> I ordered my Norelco model 8140XL because I had a Norelco previously and received great service from it.  The battery finally stopped charging after years of excellent service.  I am very pleased with my new shaver and the battery is holding a charge very well so far.  I have not recharged it in almost a month, following the directions not to charge until the charge light comes on.  The shave is excellent and I also got some lubricating spray which I use regularly on it.  I also am enjoying the ability to wash out the shaver rather than having to use the brush after each shave.  I would recommend this shaver to others.  The only drawback is the price of the new heads.  It seems like companies are prone to almost give away a product and then charge an outrageous amount for replacement parts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Norelco owner so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than everything else, but that&#x27;s because Nerlco does the best at shaving faces that have gone a few days without a shave. After having three or four Norelcos in my day, I think this one does the best job. It shaves very close and smooth, even longer hairs, is very quite and incredibly light. It charges fast and holds the charge for weeks. I only wish it had a meter indicating battery life left, but no matter, cause it runs evenly until it stops and then you can quick charge in minutes and full charge in an hour. Once again, Amazon had the best price!</li>
    <li> Nice, smooth cut.  Extremely easy to clean- rinsing it under a faucet of all things!  Holds a charge very long- well over a week.</li>
    <li> works well, but should have bought the next one up,8160 with the battery charge level indicator</li>
    <li> Shaver works fine...but, there is room for improvement with the stand setup. The shaver stand is also the plug-in charger; this is what comes with the shaver. This means there is no place to stand the razor so it can drain completely,afer you have water-washed the head. I.E., the water remaining in the body drains down thru the body to dry.  I for one ,certainly won&#x27;t stand it in the charger when it is doing this. Thus it ends up laying on the countertop, which is undesirable.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver.  It is a great transition.  Gets a close shave and doesn&#x27;t pull.  Charge lasts a long time and it&#x27;s so easy to clean.  A+++  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased a 8151XL which looks identical to the above 8140XL and I am not sure what the difference is. After using my Norelco Quadra for about 8 years and having absolutely no issues to with it I thought to myself, why don&#x27;t I try a new razor. Since Quadra never gave me the close shave, I thought I experiment and see how technology has evolved over the years. I purchased the best: The Arcitec. What a disaster it was. It gave me terrible irritation, cut the hair very slowly and refused to pick up some. My face would not adjust to it. I struggled with it for a month and returned it to Norelco who hopefully will refund my money. Since I no longer had my old Quadra Action, I decided to give Norelco another try and purchased the 8151XL. I only shaved with it once, however, it was the best shave in my life. It picked up all uneasy hairs without struggle and I never expected the closeness it gave me. I love it and actually look forward to my next shave. I strongly recommend purchasing any shaver from this line up.</li>
    <li> The best Norelco ever my Dad used them I have had 3 this is the third.    Rechargeable,featherweight and can be rinsed to clean.    It makes shaving easy and believe it or not fun.</li>
    <li> I am really happy I purchased this item. I FINALLY replaced my old one after 4 years and so far no complains. Works great, battery is great!</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this Norelco.  He had a very old one and he says this one is fantastic.</li>
    <li> The head is not strong. When I swep the water out of the machine.  The head is disconnect from the machine.  And it is not working good now.  I just buy it one month,</li>
    <li> I used this for about 2 months and the battery died. Called philips and they replaced it within a week. You count on them making it right if its no good.</li>
    <li> This razor is over priced and a very poor performer. It has very little power, shaving is more of a task than it should be. I have a 20 yr old Norelco that gives a much better shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Shaver and it took time but it seems to work better after time. What does one say about a product like this. I wanted one and I now have it.</li>
    <li> Thought I would see a difference. I should have saved my money</li>
    <li> Thinking my Speed XL might die and wondering what the years have brought in new technology I picked up a new Norelco, and it shaves no better than the Speed XL. I thought I would use one in the bathroom in the morning, and keep the Speed XL in the car in case I had a night meeting, but now I use the XL driving to work and if necessary after work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the interim I also tried a Panasonic which was terrible. It is unbelievable how expensive electric shavers have become, and how some brands want an annuity too, with proprietary cleaning cartridges. I don&#x27;t think my XL was more than $100 and now it&#x27;s doubled, maybe because it&#x27;s become exotic over the years.</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor. I have used Norelcos for the last thirty years and this is the best one yet. It is very quiet and being able to clean it under the faucet is an outstanding feature. The only thing keeping me from giveing it five stars if the fact that the heads are a bit too big to reach some of the tighter areas, (like under my nose) as easly as my old razor. Possibly, I should not have gotten the XL. Smaller heads would have made that spot easer to shave. All in all, I love the razor. I have recomended it to several people.</li>
    <li> The Norelco 8140 rotary razor is the best I have used in more than 40 years shaving; it shaves fast, close, comfortable and a charge last from two to three weeks.  However, not everyone can get a good shave from a rotary shaver.  If you cannot use this style of shaver I would recommed the Braun  which cost a lot more.</li>
    <li> My wife is so happy with the razor because her cheeks are not suffering any more. I have a very close beard and the Norelco product has helped me very much,to deal with it.</li>
    <li> Much quiter, Closer cut, and nice handling, easy cleaning and slick styling....a #5</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my BF, and he likes it a lot.:)</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this razor for the purpose of shaving my head.  I was a little worried since none of these reviews says anything about head shaving.  I just wanted to let you all know that this razor is perfect for head shaving.  It shaves close without all of the knicks and little bumps of a bic.  I swear by it and will use it from this point on.</li>
    <li> I bought a braun syncro, after I had my older Norelco Quadra for a few years. While the Braun was good, I still preffered the rotary shave that my Norelco gave me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I let 2 more years go by and decided to get another Norelco, I still have my old one but I dropped it and cracked the head where it latches, it&#x27;s still useable though. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, This Speed XL does not feel as solidly as my older Norelco and it is not as powerful. This gives me a very uncomfortable shave  as it tends to pull my whiskers, it hurts a little.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Braun syncro is a better razor than this one.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although Norelco boasts to have a newer and better razor every year, they really aren&#x27;t any better than the older models, and in my case it&#x27;s not even as good as the older ones. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can no longer stay faithful to one brand. I have read some very good reviews on some of Remington&#x27;s foil shavers and even Panasonic, so maybe in two more years I will try one of them. &lt;br /&gt;You just don&#x27;t know which razor is best until you try them all... Unfortunately they are too expensive to try them all.</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and paid more than $50 for an electric razor.  I am really glad that I did.  It&#x27;s still not as close as a razor but close enough that I can use it daily and only pull the razor for those special occasions.  Very happy with the item.</li>
    <li> Razor does a good job for an electric razor.  None seem to shave as close as a blade, but this one is close and  certainly shaves more quietly, cleanly and smoothly than the Remington it replaces.  A razor this expensive should include a recharge light.  Has a ni-cad battery.  I wish Norelco would use a newer power source like a lithium Ion battery, which should last longer.  I also wish the batteries were user replaceable.  If past experience holds true,in a few years I will be faced with a perfectly good razor with dead batteries.  I can then either send it in and go without a razor for a few weeks and pay a big repair bill, or simply buy another new razor.</li>
    <li> Close, comfortable shave; easy to use; easy to clean. I have no basis for comparison besides traditional razors, but objectively the 8140XL seems to be a good electric razor.</li>
    <li> been a Norelco guy since whisker #1 and this is a good choice for the person who does not need all the bells &amp; whistles. Very easy to get a super-close shave and incredibly easy to clean. the only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 is the fact that it does not give any warning that it is about to crap out and require a recharge. Granted in a minute you can be shaving again, but it is a minor annoyance.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009MFUOA Philips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL Men&#x27;s Shaver]] &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and it works quite well for me. It&#x27;s much better than the old razor I was using, which was about 10 years old and on its last legs. I suspect that with care and maintenance this product should last that long as well. The heads on the product work well, and I&#x27;m impressed by the science of the development.  You&#x27;ll get a pretty close shave with this. It treats my skin well. I&#x27;ve had no major nicks or chuncks of skin taken off with it. I like the fact that you can rinse it with water. I rinse mine after every 2 or 3 uses. The only caveat is that you have to leave it open to air dry.  Other than that, it&#x27;s been a good product so far, and I believe that $80 is a fair market price for this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for 35+ years. I&#x27;ve used all methods and a few different electric razors. Since the first Norelco razor I haven&#x27;t gone anywhere else. With the new one I just purchased the shave has gotten even better! Way to go Norelco!</li>
    <li> This is the 4th Norelco triple header I have owned. All of the others were superior to this one. It has a light cheap feel to it. The on/off switch is placed where it easily turns off when you grip the handle while shaving. The heads slip under the cover and stick there if you press the shaver firmly against your face. The battery charge is only 55 minutes..my old one was about 76 minutes. Not very pleased with this razor.</li>
    <li> Again this was a Christmas gift to my son.  I hope he will enjoy the  shaver.  His brother has the same model shaver and he enjoys it</li>
    <li> I bought this Shaver for my husband as a Christmas Gift. He loves it. He said that it is such a smooth shave, it doesn&#x27;t nic his skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave irritation like his old one. He also made the comment that the hair didn&#x27;t grow in as quick as it usually does. His face and neck fealt VERY smooth!</li>
    <li> the norelco 8140 is a nice razor but i should have paid more attention to the specs. it doesn&#x27;t have a battery indicator.  when the battery charge gets too low it just shuts off--no warning. i would have been willing to pay more for another model if i would have realized this at the time of purchase.     bill</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver. I am satisifed with it. Obviously the technology is very good and the battery goes normally over the specified time. Has to admit that it provides a deeper perfect shave when you allow the stub to grow.     Have only one complaint though, As claimed its not possible to get a clean shave in 3 mins, though I admit shaving time can get lesser as u get used to it. It more or less takes the same time as manual shavers but the degree of closeness is amazing.    One suggestion would be if you find the Norelco rough for the first time as specified in the manual, give your self a weeks time, and you will see the difference, unlike the manual shavers, don&#x27;t press the Norelco much hard against your skin, and don&#x27;t move it up and down hastily. Move it slowly and effort lessly, that&#x27;s all is needed !!     I have never got such a clean smooth shave before !</li>
    <li> I had been using the Norelco Cool Skin Advantaage for 4 years when it finally broke. So I got this.    I have an extremely thick beard and have to shave daily. The 5 o&#x27;clock shadow happens around 11 AM.     This razor did a great shaving job. It did the neck better than the Advantage. Most importantly, it does shave faster. I can honestly get a good shave within 3 - 5 minutes, the Advantage took 8 - 10, if not longer.    Drawback - it feels flimsy. Especially after the Advantage, this razor feels light and cheap. But it still works great.    All in all, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It seems as if it&#x27;s way weaker than my older 8825xl and it seems that it takes more time to clean the neck than if I would have used the 8825.  It does get rid of facial hair better though and that&#x27;s what counts the most.  I like the overall design and the blue led is a nice touch.  Haven&#x27;t noticed the advertised effect of the 50% shaving surface, oh well.</li>
    <li> a very good close shave and with the lithium battery, recharges aren&#x27;t needed nearly as often as before..</li>
    <li> After much too much research, I ended up buying a Philips Norelco 8140XL electric shaver.  I had been using a Remington of a similar design, but the battery failed after about 18 months.  This shaver has all the features that I wanted and none of the features I didn&#x27;t want.  I wanted the speed shaver set-up, the charging stand, and an LED that indicates when the shaver needs to be charged.  I didnt want the cleaning stand, the LED that tells you way too much info (8150XL), lotion dispensing, etc.  I wanted a close, comfortable shave - at a fair price.  That is what I got.  Great shave, easy to use, and good price.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Closest shave ever.  Love the cleaning method.  Just run under hot water and your done.  Rxcellent shaver.</li>
    <li> I think this product is good because I never heard any complains from my husband since he started using it.</li>
    <li> This is the finest electric shaver I have ever owned. Its heads are very well designed for close comfortable shaving.  When my last one (same model) finally died, my wife immediately told me to get another one just like it, and so I did.  I love the cleaning feature of just washing it in water.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this shaver. It gives a very close and comfortable shave. It has a very low recharge time that I like too. I would recommend this shave. It gets top rating from me.</li>
    <li> Over all am pleased with the shaver.  It is lightweight and easy to use. It shaves relatively close in a short period of time. Considering the price it is a good value</li>
    <li> Did a lot of research before getting this for my husband as a Christmas present. Other reviewers seemed happy with it, so I decided this was the one. It does a nice job. Holds a charge for a LONG time even with daily use. My only complaint would be that if it isn&#x27;t emptied regularly the powdery wiskers dusk the counter in the bathroom. Having said that, it&#x27;s super easy to pop the head open and dump the junk out right into the sink.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this shaver. It&#x27;s his third Norelco, and the only brand of electric he&#x27;s ever used. He finds that he doesn&#x27;t get quite as close a shave using it \\&quot;dry\\&quot; (recommended by the manufacturer) as he did with his previous one that used a cream, but that&#x27;s his only complaint. It&#x27;s very smooth, quiet, and holds a charge for weeks!</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver and the charge lasts a very long time.  Much longer than my last one.  However it does not have a light or other signal that lets you know when the battery needs charging.  It just stops so you have to take the cord out and plug it in to finish shaving and then to recharge the shaver.  One just has to remember to have the cord handy.  It does have a light to show when it is fully charged.</li>
    <li> In the 40 years that I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors, this one is by far the best one. It shaves as close as a razor blade. This razor is quiet, fast, and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he&#x27;s been very happy with it. He says it&#x27;s lighter than his previous Norelco shaver (which he also loved) and says it charges quickly and holds the charge for days. He doesn&#x27;t seem to need the travel charger I bought to go with it. He says it gives him a close and comfortable shave and I can feel the difference in his skin since he started using this shaver, very soft. He&#x27;s very happy so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The 8140XL Speed XL Men&#x27;s Shaver  (8140XL)Was much lighter in weight--Good. I did not realize it could be cleaned with Hot water. This was a good feature once I got used to doing it.It gives a nice smooth shave. It is not as loud as my old Norelco. I purchased this during the week of Father&#x27;s Day when all of the local stores had them on sale. The same 8140XL for $10.00 dollars less and not have to pay a mailing charge. I feel Amazon should have a program to match local prices with in a month of purchase. I still have the receipt in case you are interested. I have used Norelco Shavers since 1957. They are good.</li>
    <li> The new generation of Philips aren&#x27;t like the old. Battery life is nothing like it used to be and not a great shave either.     They&#x27;ve put too much into features instead of function.</li>
    <li> I recently bought my husband the Norelco 8140XL because his Norelco 6885XL bit the dust.  We bought the 8140XL based on customer reviews.  Since using his new shaver, he has mentioned many times, \\&quot;My 8140XL is, by far, the best shaver I have ever used\\&quot;.  His face feels like a baby&#x27;s behind in no time at all.  His 8140 XL gives him the fastest and smoothest shave he has ever had.  There is no razor burn.  He actually looks forward to shaving in the morning. His only complaint is that the shaver is so light weight he has to concentrate on holding it tighter, so he does not throw or drop it.    My husband received his first Norelco shaver as a Christmas present 45 years ago.  Before that he used various shavers that never came close to his first Norelco.  He always says, \\&quot;I will never buy anything but a Norelco\\&quot;.  It appears Norelco is still #1 with him.</li>
    <li> I have been delighted with this shaver.  I have used Norelco shavers for the last 50 years.  This is the best of the lot.  It gives a close smooth shave; it&#x27;s fast and quiet.  It holds it&#x27;s charge for a remarkable length of time.  I have been using it every morning for the last two and a half weeks and have yet to re-charge it.  This is a winner!!</li>
    <li> I have used this razor daily for around three months now. At first, there were a couple of hairs it always missed, but now it gets them all and overall it has given a very good shave; I hadn&#x27;t realized electric razors could be so good.    Two small hassles, though: (1) There is very little warning that the battery is low and about to run out. If you notice that the speed has dropped slightly, you have maybe a minute at most before it stops dead. (2) The metal sprung hinge attaching the razor head assembly to the main unit has become loose enough that in mine the base of the hinge detaches from the main unit far too easily and is a bit of a pain to wedge back in, meaning that cleaning it is suddenly much more of a chore. For this price, I&#x27;d have expected better build quality.    Update: the hinge I mention in (2) is replaceable. The problem is that there is a flimsy bit of plastic that came off that holds the hinge pin in place, but the part \\&quot;Norelco 4222-036-12150 Head Holder\\&quot; provides a new one. However, this razor is now down to being used when I have a short trip somewhere: it again always misses certain hairs, whether with the regular shaving part or the flip-up straight part, which makes me wonder if I have a few hairs that are simply too large to poke through the metal mesh guard to get cut. My rating remains, though: it&#x27;s probably rather good indeed for people with beard hair that is less coarse than mine.</li>
    <li> On the whole, my experience with this razor has been positive. Although I switched from manual razors mainly because I was tired of nicking myself and expected a trade-off in closeness, my girlfriend says that my skin is actually softer now that I used the 8140XL. Definitely give it a week or two after switching from a manual razor to let your skin adjust; my shaves got remarkably better after the first few days of use.    - Pros: Leaves skin softer; shaves upper lip better than any manual razor; hair length after shave is consistent (including on neck); easy and quick to clean.  - Cons: Inevitably misses hairs (although it&#x27;s hard to tell without close inspection); not quite as close as a manual razor, so you will have to shave every morning if you want a clean-cut look; sideburn cutter not especially useful.    I recommend buying Lectric Shave or a similar product to prep your stubble for shaving with the 8140XL, it makes a small but significant difference in the closeness of the shave.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement shaver for me.  I have owned Norleco shavers previously.  My latest one died because the battery would no longer hold a charge.  This is somewhat of an upgrade, in that it has more advanced shaving heads.  It does a very good job, gives a close shave and is easy to clean.  It can be run on the electric cord, if the battery dies unexpectedly, or it can be charged enough for one shave in about 3 minutes.    My only regret is that its signal lights don&#x27;t have any indication when the battery is weak and needs a charge.</li>
    <li> best shaver I have ever owned--love that you can clean it by rinsing with water-still need to take it apart on occasion but gives a great shave and trimmer does a great job also-battery life is excellent-I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not even sre if they still sell this model, as I&#x27;ve had it for quite a few years.  I would get another one ina  hearbeat, if I ever need one.  The battery charge lasts forever (even still)... the motor&#x27;s great... and cuts clean.&lt;br /&gt;I have replaced the heads (OEM bought from Amazon) once or twice after I noticed a few hair tugs were becoming more frequent, and it becomes like new again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Norelco and this new one is the best.  Longest battery life and lightest and includes an attached trimmer.</li>
    <li> Not a bad razor. While the razor does not shave as close as I would like, it does shave very quickly. Very smooth with no irritation to my skin. The screen glides over the face with no effort. Over all not a bad product</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my boyfriend for Christmas and he is happy w/ it. His only complaints were that it doesn&#x27;t shave as well under the chin and you have to be careful not to shake or bang the razor when cleaning it b/c it will come apart.</li>
    <li> I know it says \\&quot;Men&#x27;s\\&quot; on there, but I am a woman, and I use this razor. I just happen to have very coarse hair on my legs. Lady shavers don&#x27;t do it for me. In fact, I&#x27;ve always had to use 2 razors, a men&#x27;s for the legs and a women&#x27;s for the underarms. I know, more information than you wanted, but it&#x27;s relevant.    This razor is the only one I have ever had that works for everything. Oh, I had some really nasty razor burn before I got the hang of it, but since then, it&#x27;s been great! No cleaning and maintaining 2 razors any more.    I have found with this razor, that putting pressure on it is a big no-no. If I do that, it will tear up my skin big time. I have to just sort of guide/glide it over the area, no pressure on it, and it does a beautiful job without the razor burn. Now, I honestly don&#x27;t know how that would go for a guy and his face, but that&#x27;s how it works for me on ALL parts I shave.    This razor only needs charged about every two to three weeks. There is no indicator system on this razor, and when it needs charged, it just quits. If you keep playing with the on/off button, it will run for 2 or 3 more minutes, but that&#x27;s it. It takes one hour (about) to recharge, much better than any razor I ever had before.    This razor is easy to clean, just run the head under the sink, shake the water off, and let it dry out. I do that once a week. Easy peasy.    Like I said, I&#x27;ve no idea how my experience might translate for a guy. I gave it 4 stars because of the lack of a recharge indicator. Other that, it is wonderful for me.</li>
    <li> Makes shaving easy, quick and fun.  Feels great.  Always works fine and it gets the job done fast and neatly.</li>
    <li> This shaver was shipped and packaged very well.  I have no problems with this shaver and it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for the past 6 years. Get a nice &amp; close shave every time. The battery is GREAT. Lasts me for at least 3-4 shaves, each 5-10 mins. I love the fact that it&#x27;s water proof. Put it under running warm water and it&#x27;s clean.</li>
    <li> Bought this item in 2007, now finally 8 years later it is giving up the ghost.  Best electric shaver I ever had, had to replace the blades once, it still gave me a fine shave this morning even though it sounds like a broken lawnmower.</li>
