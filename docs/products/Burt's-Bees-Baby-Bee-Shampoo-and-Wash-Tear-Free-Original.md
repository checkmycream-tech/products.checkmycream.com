### Positive Reviews

      <li>Best shampoo for babies ever!</li>
      <li>The best!  </li>
      <li>and it works beautifully in both roles.</li>
      <li>Product is great but the pump was broke when it arrived.</li>
      <li>This wash smells great, works great, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my baby&#x27;s eyes.</li>
      <li>also love the dispenser, and it has worked perfectly for me.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Not too thrilled about that.</li>
      <li>i find the scent nice.  </li>
      <li>Hint of honey leaves skin feeling awesome and soft.</li>
      <li>Smells good and keeps my baby skin so smooth.</li>
      <li>It has not been a problem for me up until now, because I knew that we were using a good clean product.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle on my grandsons and smells great.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>so you have to use more.</li>
      <li>It would be better if it just had a cap and no dispenser.</li>
      <li>I freakin love</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>we all use them and love them no need for anything else.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>This stuff smells amazing and is a good natural product.</li>
      <li>Good product and fast delivery</li>
      <li>As a body wash, it easily cleans off markers and playground dirt and lets us get the kiddos cleaned up without a struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find this bigger size, and the pump top is very convenient.</li>
      <li>shampoo gets hair squeaky clean with no tangles or pulling, and no irritation or tears.</li>
      <li>I prefer this bottle, as it doesn&#x27;t allow water to seep in, if it falls into the bath (it happens with little kids).&lt;br /&gt;We are now using this shampoo and wash for our son as well, and it makes us happy to know that he might avoid any skin rashes, because of a good, natural and clean product.</li>
      <li>He has sensitive skin, and this wash is natural, gentle, and smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>girl.&lt;br /&gt;The regular shampoo smells so good, clean and gentle, just like a baby shampoo should.</li>
      <li>Wish there was lotion available in a large pump container too.</li>
      <li>I buy this repeatedly as it smells good and has none of the harmful ingredients other products can have.</li>
      <li>pump makes dispensing a breeze, and the pump amount is just right for hair washing or applying to a wash cloth for body washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very good product, a little bit expensive but very good.</li>
      <li>product is very gentle</li>
      <li>No scary ingredients.</li>
      <li>We have used many different shampoos and body washes on the kids over the years</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo and wash, the only one my daughter uses.</li>
      <li>and they did not stay true to the natural claims-</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>As many of the other reviews mention this shampoo does not lather.</li>
      <li>i love it and recommend it to other parents.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this mainly for the pump, but received package in damaged condition.</li>
      <li>Product is good, but the package is so poor that my whole parcel was returned to the  transfer agent by customs.</li>
      <li>The scent is subtle but amazing - keeping a touch of &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; to kids growing up so fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was really surprised.</li>
      <li>even the unscented version has plenty of smell from the &#x27;natural ingredients&#x27;</li>
      <li>/&gt;We would highly recommend this, and will be ordering another bottle shortly!</li>
      <li>my daughter is nearly 4, and has long curly hair.</li>

    <li> I should have listened to all the reviews. The pump came damaged. Some of the shampoo had leaked out. I will not order again.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and wash, the only one my daughter uses. Love the scent.</li>
    <li> Product is good, but the package is so poor that my whole parcel was returned to the  transfer agent by customs. So I spent $60 to re-send it via USPS to China.</li>
    <li> Very good product, a little bit expensive but very good. Smells good and keeps my baby skin so smooth.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for babies ever!</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo.  I hate it that the dispenser does not work.  It would be better if it just had a cap and no dispenser.</li>
    <li> Product is great but the pump was broke when it arrived.</li>
    <li> I had it within 24 hrs.  I was really surprised.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that top wasn&#x27;t completely on one of bottles and it had leaked out. I won&#x27;t order pump anymore.</li>
    <li> Not good sealing, leakage of shampoo</li>
    <li> We have used many different shampoos and body washes on the kids over the years but none can compare to Burt&#x27;s Bees!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo gets hair squeaky clean with no tangles or pulling, and no irritation or tears. The scent is subtle but amazing - keeping a touch of &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; to kids growing up so fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use this as both shampoo and body wash and it works beautifully in both roles. As a body wash, it easily cleans off markers and playground dirt and lets us get the kiddos cleaned up without a struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump makes dispensing a breeze, and the pump amount is just right for hair washing or applying to a wash cloth for body washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would highly recommend this, and will be ordering another bottle shortly!</li>
    <li> I buy this repeatedly as it smells good and has none of the harmful ingredients other products can have. My kids end up smelling like honey after a bath and I love it!</li>
    <li> i have been using this wash on my kids for years.  i love it and recommend it to other parents.  even the unscented version has plenty of smell from the &#x27;natural ingredients&#x27; so beware if you are looking for a truly unscented product.  i find the scent nice.  not overwhelming.  product is very gentle and i used it on my newborns to school aged kids.</li>
    <li> We swtiched to the Regular Burts Bees Shampoo and Wash when my daughter was 18 months and had started to break out all over her body. We were using the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; johnson&amp;johnson baby products, but the perfume etc. in those products still caused rashes on my little girl.&lt;br /&gt;The regular shampoo smells so good, clean and gentle, just like a baby shampoo should. When using it in a bath it does create foam (if you put it in the tub prior to the water) but if you add shampoo last, you can avoid the foam if that is your preference.&lt;br /&gt;Now my daughter is nearly 4, and has long curly hair. As many of the other reviews mention this shampoo does not lather. It has not been a problem for me up until now, because I knew that we were using a good clean product. I still give this product 5 stars, for a baby shampoo, it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the dispenser, and it has worked perfectly for me. I prefer this bottle, as it doesn&#x27;t allow water to seep in, if it falls into the bath (it happens with little kids).&lt;br /&gt;We are now using this shampoo and wash for our son as well, and it makes us happy to know that he might avoid any skin rashes, because of a good, natural and clean product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mainly for the pump, but received package in damaged condition. The shampoo had spilled out and the pump is broken. I should have gone by the reviews and not ordered it.</li>
    <li> Good product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Totally irritated that Clorox owns them- and they did not stay true to the natural claims- I have switched to RAW products for my kids now- we all use them and love them no need for anything else.</li>
    <li> The best!  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my baby.  No scary ingredients.</li>
    <li> Not very satisfied. The bottle arrived inside of a tall plastic bag however the bottle had nearly a third of the shampoo leaked out into the Ziploc bag and was wasted. Not too thrilled about that.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and is a good natural product. My biggest complaint is lack of lather so you have to use more.</li>
    <li> It is very gentle on my grandsons and smells great.  Wish there was lotion available in a large pump container too.</li>
    <li> cant beat the price or quality for little ones</li>
    <li> Love it but they need to ship it in a bag .. I opened the box it was all over.</li>
    <li> I trust Burt&#x27;s with my baby&#x27;s care and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed. This wash smells great, works great, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my baby&#x27;s eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s the only wash I&#x27;ve used for my son since he was an infant. He has sensitive skin, and this wash is natural, gentle, and smells wonderful. I was so happy to find this bigger size, and the pump top is very convenient. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I freakin love this stuff bought it for my daughter but i use it for a body wash. Hint of honey leaves skin feeling awesome and soft. Won&#x27;t buy body wash no more.😄😄😄😄</li>
