### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have oil and acne issues around the t-zone and this is the best product to help treat acne as well as to prevent breakouts.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product!! I have been breaking out for years, a lot of off and on , clear skin then not so clear skin. But after this past summer it seemed like there was no reprieve from my breakouts. I bought this and literally 3 days later a friend of mine commented about how great my skin looked. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been switching all of my products to cruelty free gradually. When I ran out of my normal face scrub (used to be cruelty free, but now is no longer, for some reason), I checked the PETA website for alternatives. The Yes To brand was listed, so I researched and ordered based on other Amazon reviews. I was pleasantly surprised when I used the scrub for the first time. It works just as well as my old scrub, maybe even better. My face feel fresh and clean every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally oily skin so I can use the scrub daily with no problems, but I can only use the repairing lotion once every few days. The lotion dries quickly, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as soft as my other moisturizer, so I sometimes put another moisturizer on after. The spot stick is nice. I normally use it at night before bed, but have used it on other occasions. It dries quickly and you can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> I love the spot treatment and the repair cream.  The scrub is okay but I prefer more of a gel face wash so I bought the gel facewash and much prefer it.  This makes my skin feel clean and soft. It is not super drying. I have tried everything for my acne from proactive and Mary Kay to tea tree oil and nothing has really worked.  This is by no means a miracle face wash but it keeps my acne under control.  I still have black heads and the occasional pimple but I no longer get a lot of painful swollen pimples.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say it didn&#x27;t work for me at all :(</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve had severe acne since I was younger and I&#x27;ve tried everything from proactive to 200 $ creams from my dermatologist but none of that worked for me like this. Acne takes a while to heal so don&#x27;t expect imediate results but of you stick with this and don&#x27;t over do it you&#x27;re face with be pimple free!  I will be using this till I die! It&#x27;s great to find something that works when you&#x27;ve spent years crying and wondering if you&#x27;ll ever have clear skin.  :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! The scrub smells a little weird but the rest smells great!</li>
    <li> When I first started using the system it seemed to be working then I realized that my complextion was turning red.  Step 3 actually burnt my skin (even after I shook it up) I dont think that it is smart for me to continue to use this product any more.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for anyone suffering with acne - better than anything in the shops (in UK)</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product only worked for about a week. I cleared up within 2 days and I thought wow, this stuff is great. Afterwards, I broke out worse than before.  I did use it as directed on the box and I guess it was way to harsh for my skin. It took 2 weeks to clear up the pizza face it gave me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Best advice I can give is, if you notice you start breaking out again and you are using it correctly, stop immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just some ascetic notes:&lt;br /&gt; It doesnt smell good at all.&lt;br /&gt;The Lotion and the roll on zit zapper takes a while to dry so do not have anyone kiss or touch your face.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  After trying several different skin regimes, Yes To Tomatoes provides a gentle yet effective result.  If used properly, twice a day, this product will definitely help your skin glow and be the best it can be.  I definitely rely on user&#x27;s reviews, and I just want to tell everyone - I DEFINITELY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love yes products! Great for my combination skin. Fewer breakouts and happier me!</li>
    <li> Took longer than the two day shipping but it was way worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive &amp; very acne prone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 15 weeks pregnant so I want to stick to natural  making sure not to harm my growing baby.&lt;br /&gt;So far its the best acne/redness medication I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
    <li> i started seeing results towards the end of second week of using it(acne) i broke out after the first 3days but now its doing its job!! i have dry skin and it started feeling much better in the second week!(moisturizer)AMAZING! hoping it keeps working like this i&#x27;m extremely satisfied! the ONLY thing is the scent it has, its not too bad. but you&#x27;ll notice it. and i changed the steps i use the spot stick and THEN the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works perfectly to clear blemishes.  Very effective!</li>
    <li> I liked this product, but it personally doesnt work for me. But everyones skin is different. I had a little noticeable change in my skin, but wasnt enough for me. I like that its almost all completely natural products and I still use them from time to time. But I wouldnt buy the set again. Just isnt worth it for me.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and other products that I have used leave what look like burn marks on my face. This, however, has been great. I am very satisfied and have continually purchased.</li>
    <li> love the idea, did not find any assistance for my troubled skin from any of these products unfortunately. i like the cucumber better, or carrots.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. Not only did the spot stick burn my skin, it took forever to dry! After using for about two weeks, my skin was left more abused than before. I broke out in various spots, and now have extra dark spots to remove. So, Say yes to more pimples when using this product!</li>
    <li> I did not notice any significant acne help, and the smell becomes increasingly disturbing with each use, I don&#x27;t think I will buy these products again.  The only product I might consider buying again is the repair lotion because it left my skin feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> I love this product line. I have used this a box 4 months or so now and my skin is completely different now. I have tried several different lines for my horrible acne before and nothing helped for more than a week. This product cleared my skin within a week. Which was great because my sister&#x27;s wedding was that following week and her skin is flawless. Lol. At first I was thinking it would be a waste of 20 bucks but I noticed a difference with in 3 days and after a week my skin was glowing and smooth. It&#x27;s really eliminated the amount of makeup I wear. And I see a lot of people are complaining about the smell but I love the scent. It&#x27;s pleasant. And the spot stick dries in a matter of a couple of minutes. The only bummer to this product line is I can&#x27;t find the repairing lotion in stores anymore and now have to resort to ordering online. But hey my face misses it. So here I go. Don&#x27;t know why some people are saying it doesn&#x27;t work. I know everyone has different kinds of skin and acne but maybe they also are using it wrong or were hoping for overnight results. But don&#x27;t get me wrong.. that darn spot stick burns like the devil but it works! The exfoliating cleanser is super gentle and the gel cleanser smells great but makes my skin sticky so I just use it as a light wash after the pore scrub. But that&#x27;s me. Good luck my fellow sufferers.</li>
    <li> OK so, I&#x27;ve had acne problems for YEARS and this is seriously the best product I have ever used. This is the only product that has literally cleared ALL of the acne off my face. Even after the first day of using it, I saw a difference. After a week, my face was almost entirely clear. And it doesn&#x27;t dry up your skin like my prescription creams did. All I can say is wow...I am amazed at how well this worked for me. :) I love all three of these products together, but I especially love the spot stick because you can use it up to three times throughout the day right on the pimples. The cream doesn&#x27;t smell great, but who cares! It gets the job done and that&#x27;s all that matters. Definitely give this product a try. :)</li>
    <li> I love the &amp;#34;Yes to Tomatoes&amp;#34; line of products because I feel that they are not excessively harsh on my skin and have a fantastic smell. I also love their compact size which makes them easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> only used few times, need more time to know more</li>
    <li> Made my face feel clean, and really helped to clear up my blemishes. Highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a natural effective cleanser and treatment.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!! My skin has NEVER been this clear!!! I was worried that it would smell like tomatoes, but it doesn&#x27;t. It smells really good. My favorite part is the roller, it works great! I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> The face wash has a smell that doesn&#x27;t agree with my nose.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in my acne when using this product.</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Smell: It&#x27;s not pleasant. All three pieces of this kit have a unique smell that I&#x27;m not fond of. The lotion is the strongest, for me.&lt;br /&gt;-Contents: There&#x27;s no face wash. Just a scrub. You aren&#x27;t supposed to use that daily. I hoped a three piece kit would be a wash, lotion and spot treatment. I think switching the scrub out for the Yes To Tomatoes daily wash would really maximize the progress potential in treating acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Ingredients: This stuff doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like a lot of other acne products have. In three months use I haven&#x27;t experienced any dryness or peeling from any of the three products. I like that it&#x27;s paraben free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Function: Once I realized this kit contained a scrub and not a wash I continued to use my 2% salicylic gel face wash as normal. In one week I used the scrub twice. The lotion and stick were used daily, at night. I had a major improvement of my cystic-like acne in 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would buy this again due to the 3 piece system being such a great price compared to buying the items separate.</li>
    <li> The face wash is horrible at washing off any oil and leaves a film over your face. The lotion is not moisturizing and did nothing for any of my acne, even after continuous use. The only thing worth anything in this is the roller stick, which somewhat dries up pimples.</li>
    <li> My husband has adult acne. He works outdoors ...so retinal products are unusable for him. Yes to Tomatoes works on the cyst like breakouts without negative reaction to the sun.</li>
    <li> It dries out your skin and did not help with any of my acne. I used it for weeks and there was no improvement. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Works well. Took about a week for my teenager to see improvement and she likes the results. The smell is interesting, I don&#x27;t think I could stand it but she doesn&#x27;t mind. Good value compared to other products. The item was rec&#x27;d quicker than expected. I&#x27;m saving this seller for expected purchases in the future.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I have tried cheap and expensive products for my teenage skin, and none have felt so productive as this kit. I have seen results with in the second day of use! There is no chemical fumes in anything except the spot treatments has a slight smell of it. My skin is left untouched by dry skin if I moisturize after every use. Most products would leave my skin dry and flakey. Now one if my friends recommended me per chasing a toner and using it after I cleansed my face, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the kit is just as affective by itself. I do recommend this product to anyone because it&#x27;s natural and you get instant results and it isn&#x27;t super harmful! And what a great price!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried several different Acne Systems over the last 10 years. I have always had troubled skin and no matter what other systems have actually showed little to no results or even made my skin worse. This system (after 2 months of proper and regular use) has reduced most of my redness down to nothing and has reduced the amount of breakouts that I usually have. The smell does not smell like tomatoes at all (which is something that I was worried about) and it makes my face feel clean, but not over exfoliated. I also love the toner because it is a gel that you rub in ( rather than a pure liquid that you have to dab everywhere or a spray that never hits the right areas). Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who has been searching to a genuine and inexpensive system for acne and redness.</li>
    <li> This set did nothing for my skin except make it even oilier.  I appreciate that it is organic, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter as much when it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to.  May work for others, but not for me.</li>
    <li> I noticed results as soon as day 4! Im sooo happy withthis brand!&lt;br /&gt;Glad its cruelty free too!</li>
    <li> The face wash and the acne cream worked fine. The roller burned my skin and it took about a week and a half to heal.</li>
    <li> I am totally happy with these products and they have proven to be effective in clearing my acne when I use them twice a day daily.</li>
    <li> love this line of product, shipped very fast and works great for my skin</li>
    <li> This is the first product that has worked overnight- I can already see a huge difference in my skin. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results with continued use! I&#x27;m using the Yes To Tomatoes towelettes for morning and then the scrub at night so that I don&#x27;t over-exfoliate. I love love looooooooove!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all. Made my skin very dry and red even going days between use. The moisturizer did nothing to help the dryness. Would have returned if I hadn&#x27;t missed the time window.</li>
    <li> I read all the positive reviews and was very looking forward to using it. I used it for a few weeks now and it is almost gone. From the very first time I used the cleanser, I have struggled. First, it leaves a very greasy residue. when I wash my hands beofore I wash out my face, my hands feel very oily and sticky. I have to use a soap to wash my hands first. Then, I can never wash off that scrub residue off my face. It sticks to my skin here and there (I can see it) and I have to wipe it off with my facial towels because it cannot be just washed away. And even after I then dry my face with a clean towel, I can still scrub some of those residue off my face... I did not see any semilar comments in any reviews here on the Amazon or tother shopping sites, I am wondering it is just happening to me?? Anyway, my skin did not improve at all, but it did not make it worse... My skin stayed exacly the same as three weeks ago and I still have the same acne problem, not better but not worse either.</li>
    <li> My skin has never been so bad since I&#x27;ve started using this product. I broke out so much that I look like I have a serious acne problem. I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ve ever had such terrible skin in my life. I&#x27;m sure that this product is good for some people, but for someone that had sensitive skin, forget it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter....she loves it. Says she loves the way it makes her face feel</li>
    <li> Did not work well on my skin but it is an ok product. The mask is good for oily skin</li>
    <li> I came across this product on MakeupAlley.com and read raving reviews about it. I was under the impression that it would work WONDERS for my skin. I have been using the product for several weeks now, much to my dismay, without any improvement. My face actually got worse for a while and is now back to where it was before. I use the facewash in the morning because it does have a wakening smell and a cool feel to it. I apply the &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; (does not moisturize) at night and also I apply the treatment stick, which seems to be the best out of all three products. Overall, i dont think this product is helping my acne, but isnt making it worse...currently...so i will continue to use it until the bottle is empty, but will not be repurchasing. For $30 i think it is worth it. This may be the product thats for you! I think it just was not strong enough for my face, but under different conditions may be a great product for someone else.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product.</li>
    <li> great products. very happy.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good and feels good on your face; you&#x27;ll feel clean. But it didn&#x27;t really clear up my acne. It didn&#x27;t get worse, but it didn&#x27;t get better.</li>
    <li> The Say Yes line is excellent and the Yes to Tomatoes is the best acne solution product I have ever tried.  I have oil and acne issues around the t-zone and this is the best product to help treat acne as well as to prevent breakouts.  The after effects of using the product is very refreshing.  After purchasing the 3 count, I have gone back to buy additional Yes to Tomatoes products.  I highly, highly, highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Personally did not work for me. I did see a slight difference in my face at first, but it was never anywhere close to clearing up my skin. If you have even mild acne, I would suggest just going to the dermatologist to get your skin cleared up instead of trying lots of products(such as this one) you think may work.</li>
    <li> You can buy for only lotion. Because other two are junk, i used scrub in shower, otherwise it is not easy to clean from your face.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this system.  It has made my skin smooth and so much clearer.  I need alot less makeup and it is really simple .  If you are looking for a simple routine that really works .... say yes to tomatoes!  I also use the yes to cucumber  eye makeup remover  pads ...they work well and don&#x27;t irritate  my eyes.</li>
    <li> ive tried everything from proactive to Clearasil but this is by far the best product. if youre not willing to spend a ton of money on other good acne products like murad. this is a really good product, the spot eraser is the best and the toner is great but leaves your skin peely. (which is what its suppose to do) the face wash runs out faster than the other two so i would recommend buying a second one. would recommend buying yes to cucumbers face towelettes with this product to balance out your skin for maximum effect. 10 out of 10 would recommend, if you have any hesitation for this dont its amazing and this one month supply with set you straight.</li>
    <li> First off, let me start by saying I am a redhead. That goes hand in hand with pale, sensitive, and red skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 3 pack, the moisturizer and the exfoliant (so I could switch it up between the gel and this). Obviously I bought this because my skin was getting ridiculous. My main concern was acne and redness. The results I have received were beyond what I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it clear my skin (still in the process too) but its starting to make my blackheads a lot smaller and almost gone. I&#x27;m feeling my face to be a lot tighter (in a good way) because my pores are getting smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind with a good cleansing system, it will bring out all your acne and then eliminate it. Also, since my skin is sensitive, I had to be careful using the daily acne treatment because it would dry out my skin (Why I bought the moisterizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been washing my face twice a day for a little over 3 weeks now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t already, make the change! You won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many acne face washes over the years. This is the ONLY system that actually works for me. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product has worked very well for me, the scrub worked fine with my skin and the lotion is very lite and I like it. This product has cleared my skin in a week and a half. Keep in mind all skin is different so think real hard before you buy something, also the Yes To tomatoes brand is specially made for oily skin.

    <li> PROS: Gentle exfoliating wash. Smells pleasant. Seems to be clearing up some of my acne or at least keeping it at bay. CONS: The blemish spot stick smells like it contains alcohol. Dries out skin. Stings on the areas applied. Leaves my skin red, puffy and irritated. I expected a more gentle skin care system for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; company. I normally don&#x27;t use Yes To products because they aren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; as other products but I became pretty desperate with my recent breakout. Needless to say I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love YesTo&#x27;s tomato line, and this works great for my acne. Other products tend to over dry my skin or make it irritated, but this face wash keeps my skin feeling fresh and smooth. the spot treatment works well on blackheads and acne that isn&#x27;t too serious. I also use the gel cleanser, which can be an add on item.</li>
    <li> I have had acne ever since I was a teenager.  I am now in my mid 30&#x27;s and had the worst skin I&#x27;ve had in my life!  I have been to the dermatologist and tried many products out there.  All I gained was a bigger hole in my pocket.  Nothing worked!  I would say I had moderate acne, blackheads, and a lot of it was cystic.  Give this trio the 21 day trial to prove it works!  I am blown away.  My skin has never looked this good!  It also feels wonderful.  I recommend using all three products to get great results.  I hope it works for you as well as it did for me!  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I found this at Target for $19.99 as the regular price--I love it! I definitely can tell a difference in my skin after using this system, and I feel like my skin is much more radiant and overall healthy! Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I was terribly disappointed in this purchase because in the past I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results of using the YesTo Tomatoes Facial Wipes in combination with the YesTo Tomatoes Daily Balancing Moisturizer.  I would recommend that combination over this &#x27;system&#x27; any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the cleanser smells great but does a poor job of exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the instructions to use the spot stick several times per day you will literally burn your skin which will begin to flake away at the application site making the blemish worse.  The fact that they provide it in the system at all just proves that you will continue to have breakouts using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The repairing lotion is somewhat noxious smelling but is acceptable as a salicylic acid treatment as long as you apply a moisturizer after because it is in no way a moisturizing lotion and is very drying to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that the repairing lotion included in this set is not the same as the daily balancing moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and i usually always have a bump or two on my face, but after this pack it got worse. The exfoliator was to hard on my skin, it felt like it was to agressive on my face. The moisturizer dries my skin completly, and i only use it  once a day. Thr only thing that i keep using is the acne stick. Thank goodness i bought it while i was visiting the country. Back in Spain these products are very expensive cuz they are new here. Dissapointed. I guess this treatment is for severe acne :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 18 hispanic male and I have used everything from proactive to home remedy and this is my all time favorite! Been useing this for 2 months now and seeing amazing results,  others have notced too! This doesnt keep 100% acne alway but its really close to it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: No side effects! !!&lt;br /&gt;  No over drying!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Feels great and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t smell great but not a strong smell either!</li>
    <li> My face was going through issues after getting off a medication. I&#x27;ve never had bad acne before and this saved my face!</li>
    <li> I have suffered with acne ever since I can remember. I have tried numerous products and my face is finally clear! The scrub isnt my favorite product ever, I enjoy more of a lather so I do use it at the same time as a mild cleanser on my face. However my face isnt dried out or damaged. I really enjoy this and will continue to use it</li>
    <li> This is the second purchase for me. My daughter loves this kit! It smells great, works, and does not irritate her sensitive skin. I put this on auto delivery.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: No longer use. Acne became worse while using this product for several months. Had to discontinue using it and switched to Proactive to help fight all of the breakouts that occured while using the carrots line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!!!! Love this product and the fact that it doesnt have any nasty chemicals in it. Really helps to control my acne and I love the moisturizing lotion and spot treatment. My face feels very clean after using.</li>
    <li> Does a great job keeping acne under control and the spot stick works well for sudden breakouts. Definitely recommend this product (and we&#x27;ve tried many others!).</li>
    <li> I love this treatment regimen. However, I don&#x27;t think the first step does too much, because it is much too watery to be a good facial scrub. Because of this, I ran out of the Daily Scrub first. When I started using an apricot scrub instead, and followed it with the repair lotion and roller, I saw much better results than with the Yes To Daily Scrub. Had to minus one star for the first step, but the 2nd and 3rd are great.</li>
    <li> I received this product fast! I wanted to try something new because my previous face wash was not working. I decided to try a chemical free face wash and I chose this one. I already see a huge difference in my skin. I&#x27;m in love! It does dry my skin out a little bit, but I don&#x27;t mind as long as my skin is clear. Havnt had  a zit or pimple since I started using this product !</li>
    <li> Made my sensitive face break out worse but it worked pisser for my friend</li>
    <li> It worked okay, you really have to give it 21 days before seeing good results also i recommend you find a good make up remover as the scrub does not take off makeup and find a lotion for day time only use the repair at night , ur face wont be dry</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling for years to find a non-prescription way to treat my acne. I was skeptical, but within 2 weeks or so, I noticed a big difference. I have fewer breakouts, and the spot treatment really seems to help. After my face started to clear up, I did start to have some dry patches, so I cut back to just the face wash and spot treatment as needed. I found a moisturizer at Walgreen&#x27;s that is part of this line of products and I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t smell as...interesting?...as the other products and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I did not see any improvements in my skin with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product set. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s has acne problems.</li>
    <li> You want clearer skin?  Get this set.  I mainly use the lotion, but the scrub and spot treatment are great too.  At 35, you would think I would have outgrown acne issues, however always seemed to have one, two or three big ol spots/pimples.  Not any more.  I sometimes still get a small one, but it is gone in a day.  Get it!</li>
    <li> I liked the cleanser and moisturizer. But the box was damaged when I received it. Have not bought again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin which drys out easily. I used this system for 3 weeks to give it a fair shot and my acne became worse. The exfoliating cleanser was too harsh to use on a daily basis, moisturizer is ok nothing special. The spot stick wasn&#x27;t able to completely get rid of the acne bumps which formed after using this system. The smell is odd but not horrible. If you have sensitive skin stay away.</li>
    <li> Yes to Tomatoes for Acne is AMAZING! The price is so much better than Proactive and hands down a better product.</li>
    <li> I use this Yes product when I have a break out.  Great price great results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m not crazy about the face wash. I haven&#x27;t seen too much of a difference, BUT I do love the spot stick roller and repair treatment. It works great! After the product is empty, I honestly don&#x27;t see myself buying it again. It&#x27;s alright, but I have really oily skin and most I&#x27;ve seen that have tried this have more dry skin. I have more oily adult acne at 22 years old and it&#x27;s not really a product for me or my advanced acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sad that I wasted twenty dollars on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scrub:&lt;br /&gt;Really harsh and smells weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spot Treatment:&lt;br /&gt;When it dries, it leaves little flaky things. It also smells weird and doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion:&lt;br /&gt;Just completely unnecessary. I&#x27;m trying to use it up, though.</li>
    <li> The cleaner leaves my face feeling dirtier than when I started, and did nothing for my acne. The moisturizer was oily. The only redeeming element of this package is the spot stick. It works great, and gets rid of zits overnight, but is on the drying side. Over all I wouldn&#x27;t bother. Ive found better for cheaper.</li>
    <li> the good, the bad and the ugly&lt;br /&gt;the good: much better ingredients than many&lt;br /&gt;the bad: not free of all chemicals I wish it was like Phenethyl or Maltodextril. It helped me up to some degree. I&#x27;d say cleared my acne a 35%.&lt;br /&gt;the ugly: didnt work a 100% so I had to keep looking :( sad face</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Did nothing for my daughters acne, in fact likely exacerbated it.</li>
