      <li>I received a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>

      <li>So I found this on Amazon and am pleased to say this is as good as what we sell at work.</li>
      <li>Since using this Marula oil, I&#x27;ve experienced significant improvement within a period of 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>I am more satisfied with this oil!</li>

      <li>This Marula is Non-greasy, absorbs beautifully, softens and hydrates my skin so deeply and effectively!</li>
      <li>I just wanted to find a good workable solution to improve his condition and decided to go with Marula oil, as it has good antioxidants to aid in blood flow and boost growth of new cells.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use anything else on top of it.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this marula to anyone who loves to keep their skin healthy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started using a thicker moisturizer on top of it and that seems to work better, but I don&#x27;t see the noticeable benefits of marula oil.</li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>I like it better than argan oil or rosehip oil as it gives a radiant glow to the skin.</li>
      <li>I see that many of the reviews for this product are from people who received a promotional bottle of this oil.</li>
      <li>Sure, it just did change his condition in a week of application.</li>
      <li>I am definitely pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that this is so versatile.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s getting better.</li>

      <li>but I have to admit I love Marula Oil better.</li>
      <li>I checked the ingredients once it came and was pleased to see that there was nothing that would keep me from using it on her hair.</li>
      <li>It is very nice and light and is absorbed easily.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Slice Of Nature&amp;#34; has fantastic customer service and this product is wonderful as a facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This is a very luxuriantly smooth, moisturizing oil, I had been using emu oil as a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; but adding some of this oil makes it flow much more smoothly and last longer, I&#x27;m very impressed, wonderful value for a large sized bottle.</li>
      <li>I tend to break out with many carrier oils - despite the luxurious,thick feel - it goes on light and soaks in well.</li>

      <li>This marula oil gets absorbed very quickly into the skin and, after a week of using it, I have seen an improvement in my skin, specifically in texture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rate it right up there with 5 stars!</li>
      <li>I would safely say this is a great product to use for anyone with sensitive skin or fragile hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is true for all Slice of Nature oils, but the dropper for this bottle does not hold the oil in, and causes the dropper to uncontrollably drip during transport.  </li>
      <li>They are chock full of chemicals and silicone.</li>
      <li>So far just loving it.</li>
      <li>Be sure not to use too much.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly</li>
      <li>and I find that it absorbs quickly and soothes, hydrates, and protects my skin...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My friend suggested me this and I bought it. I only use it at night. It&#x27;s a bit much for me under my makeup. I put it on after I wash my face in the evening or after my shower and leave it on all night. I can tell a difference in how my skin feels. Its an awesome feeling.</li>
    <li> I have lotions with marula oil in it.  It absorbs quickly so I decided to order the pure oil. I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Great seller; love the product; quick ship; highly recommend product &amp; seller.  Five Stars!!!!! A+++++!</li>
    <li> A friend ordered some for me after I suffered a bad burn on my fingertips, and it worked great to heal the skin and minimize scarring. I am happy about it and would be purchasing for my family.</li>
    <li> Sinks into your skin instantly and makes it soft and plump! Amazing! I use this on my hair as well and it makes it soft and smooth and shiny and no frizz! Wish it came in a bigger bottle because at the rate I’m going, it&#x27;ll run out very soon!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the name brand Slice of Nature marula oil that sells for $25. I&#x27;d definitely repurchase this. It&#x27;s a lighter oil than argan, absorbs much quicker. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great miracle oil that softened my skin within a week. I feel very young with a glowy and smooth skin and hope to find other outcomes of it. So far just loving it.</li>
    <li> I work at a spa where we sell another brand that costs about $80 for about an ounce and a half. Even with my employee discount that&#x27;s expensive. So I found this on Amazon and am pleased to say this is as good as what we sell at work. It&#x27;s a great buy! You will see results if used daily on your neck and face. I also use on my hands and cuticles and rub whatever&#x27;s left on my scalp at night.</li>
    <li> This Marula is Non-greasy, absorbs beautifully, softens and hydrates my skin so deeply and effectively! Love! I will be purchasing  again and plan to use this oil for a lifetime. Highly recommend this seller for Marula oil.</li>
    <li> I heard great things about this oil and the benefits to the skin and wanted to try it.  It works very well and it has no scent.  I put it on my legs since it is summer time when wearing dresses without pantyhose to give a healthy glow without having to ruin my skin in the sun yet have a nice glow on my legs.  The bottle has a pump and a cap cover which is great to prevent spills.  I am very glad I took advantage of a promotional code to try this product, and honestly, this you can see the difference to your skin after the application.</li>
    <li> From spouse if account holder..I love this oil!! I use on my face and my cuticles . For the face it leaves my skin feeling smooth and plump soft. My lines around my eyes are less noticed.  For my fingernails it&#x27;s amazing. I use in my body lotion Amlactin also.  It&#x27;s an all around good thing. Does not seem to clog my pores. O would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bee using the oil for over a month now and I am very pleased with it.  It keeps my skin feeling soft and it is absorbed fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It sinks in well without irritation and left my skin really soft in the morning. Skin is supple and feeling hydrated. NO blackheads or clogged skin that I must exfoliate every couple days. I like it better than argan oil or rosehip oil as it gives a radiant glow to the skin. I&#x27;d rate it right up there with 5 stars!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Slice Of Nature&amp;#34; has fantastic customer service and this product is wonderful as a facial moisturizer. I will continue to purchase items that I need from your company.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face mixed with argan oil at night. When the temperatures are very low I apply the oil with facial lotion. The combination keeps my skin moist. In the morning my skin is still moist and it is for sure that no more dryskin.</li>
    <li> If you want a wonderful oil for your skin this is it! I would definitely repurchase, and recommend to anyone looking to try a high quality facial oil at a decent price!</li>
    <li> I often travel and it has greater impact on my skin always. So I decided to go with some control measures and ended up with marula for its positive action towards skin. I put it on after I wash my face after my shower and leave it on all night. I have felt difference in how my skin feels, which is much enough. I would continue using this oil.</li>
    <li> Received this at no cost during a recent promo. Have only used to twice yet on my face and am loving how it. It doesn&#x27;t give you an oily look and absorbs almost instantly. I always apply moisturizers on damp skin to help it absorb. By the time I got to apply this my skin had actually dried up and even then it sunk in. Felt my skin looked hydrated and smooth on first application. Used it again yesterday night and woke up with no oiliness around my nose. I plan on using it twice a day. will update in a a few weeks.  Update: I don&#x27;t think that I am hallucinating but the lines on my forehead are less visible.</li>
    <li> Great slice of nature product.. Marula is lightweight and nearly odorless, my mature skin drinks it up. Feels good and nourishing when i apply it day and night!</li>
    <li> This is beyond my expectations. I bought this oil to serve my purpose and it does.&lt;br /&gt;Feeling good and it is nourishing well, when i apply it day and night!&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> It really helped me out to keep my skin getting dehydrated and also it works well on fading scars. I will be trying our other useful oils from this seller. The price is much lesser compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> Love it! Feels great, not greasy. My skin soaks it up. And nice fragrance too! A great product for the price! Absolutely fantastic stuff!!!</li>
    <li> At first I was scared to try this oil on my face as I had previous tried out marula from a local shop and it turned out to react terrible on acne prone sensitive skin but I took the chance as this brand has set its standard on amazon. Well, surprisingly it worked extremely great without any issues. I find this marula suits my skin and would gladly use it further.</li>
    <li> Definitely this one of THE BEST Marula I&#x27;ve used to improve elasticity and wrinkles on my face. It&#x27;s really amazing. Organic, 100% natural, no fillers. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I had a scar on my left eyebrow for the past 4 months. I decided to get this marula oil when I came across this in a magazine with its benefits. And to my amazement I could see the best results! My scar was just fading away! Wow! Now my scar got healed completely! Unbelievable product! I am more satisfied with this oil!</li>
    <li> I am so tired of big brand lotions being filled with chemicals and ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce so I have started using as many natural alternatives as possible. Marula oil is great as a massage oil for sore muscles and clears up dry skin spots after a couple days of use. I have extremely dry and sensitive skin on my legs but the marula oil made my legs smooth after about a week of using every day after I shaved and the best part is that it did not irritate my skin whatsoever. The smell is citrus-y but nice and the mini pump on the bottle makes it so easy to take a small drop or a lot - depending on what you are looking for. I received a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This said &amp;#34;marula oil&amp;#34; on the front but the ingredients read &amp;#34;Argan&amp;#34; oil. So, that was a bit misleading as the two oils are completely different. Sent it back and felt a bit betrayed by amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!! I use on my face and my cuticles . For the face it leaves my skin feeling smooth and makes my skin where applied silky smooth and gives my skin a radiant glow. Cold pressed and all natural skin care is the way to go. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil. I use it for my granddaughter as an additive to her conditioner. I do not put it in the conditioner, we use it before the conditioner goes in. Her hair is very curly and it tangles easy. She is only 2. For 2 year olds there is nothing great on the market for hair with tangles. Yes, there is detangler, but if you have ever bought it, even the leadings brands, you most likely have felt that you&#x27;ve wasted your money. that is how I was feeling. I was offered this product in exchange for my unbiased opinion and review. I ordered it and while waiting for it to arrive, I did some research on its uses. I read about how people were using it for their hair. I checked the ingredients once it came and was pleased to see that there was nothing that would keep me from using it on her hair. So we tried it. I LOVE IT and so does my daughter. Her hair is softer, manageable and it really adds some shine and bounce to her hair. She is in swimming lessons and she also goes in the pool often, so with her hair being fragile the Marula oil helps coat it, protecting it from the sun and the elements. I would safely say this is a great product to use for anyone with sensitive skin or fragile hair. I love the fact that this is so versatile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used to improve elasticity and wrinkles on my face. It&#x27;s really amazing. Organic, 100% natural, no fillers. I love the feel, the natural scent and of course, the results!</li>
    <li> It worked great to heal the skin and minimize scarring. Now the whole family uses it on our sensitive skin instead of lotion or moisturizer. It absorbs very quickly and does its job. I would be buying again from them.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the reviews.  My findings are that I didn&#x27;t see that it did much for me. They said it didn&#x27;t make your face breakout -- wrong.  I did like how my hair looked &amp; felt with just a dab of oil.  I probably would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> My skin loves this stuff!  I apply a few drops to my face at night.  My skin is very sensitive so I was expecting a reaction, like stinging or redness, but there was none.  My skin drank this oil up without any issues.  It softens lines and adds a nice glow.  I only use it at night because my skin is pretty normal, with some oiliness in the T zone, so using it under makeup is out of the question.  But as a nightly routine, it calmed my redness and soaked right in without any greasiness.  I will definitely keep using it.  I also use it for my hair, on the ends, to remedy dryness and I add it to my hair color mixture for added softness and shine.  There are myriad purposes for this oil and I like it better than argan oil, which does cause some slight stinging when used on my face.  All in all, I highly recommend this oil as a nightly facial treatment and as a hair treatment.  I am definitely pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan oil for over a year but I have to admit I love Marula Oil better. I use it on my face, neck and hands. I also put on my lower arms because they get so dry. Softens facial skin and diminishes wrinkles. I am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> This is a very luxuriantly smooth, moisturizing oil, I had been using emu oil as a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; but adding some of this oil makes it flow much more smoothly and last longer, I&#x27;m very impressed, wonderful value for a large sized bottle.</li>
    <li> Nice quality oil - I use it in my daily moisturizer, smells lovely - and no breakouts.</li>
    <li> The Marula has helped my dry skin tremendously. I also use it on my hands during the winter months when my skin is at the absolute driest. One application at night and my skin is like new in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue with it; very pleased with Natural.</li>
    <li> I love the feel, the natural scent and of course, the results!&lt;br /&gt;It contains no additives, as it&#x27;s far more expensive competitor does.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second bottle, absolutely fantastic stuff!!! Surely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am happy to tell that this marula oil is a miracle for my skin. Since I started using this marula oil, I haven&#x27;t notice any new breakouts and the blemishes are disappearing so much faster. I want to share this with everyone especially if you are trying to restore your skin and thinking to go this.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  My complaint it is with the packaging.  Unfortunately, the dropper for this oil is no good.  I don&#x27;t know if this is true for all Slice of Nature oils, but the dropper for this bottle does not hold the oil in, and causes the dropper to uncontrollably drip during transport.  That&#x27;s all I wish was different.</li>
    <li> This oil is very effective in hydrating the skin and it&#x27;s in fantastic shape. I tend to break out with many carrier oils - despite the luxurious,thick feel - it goes on light and soaks in well. I will definitely recommend this to all.</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed using this marula oil as a daily facial moisturizer. It is a nice light oil and is absorbed easily. I feel it has helped improve my skin.</li>
    <li> Not only is Marula Oil one of the lower priced oils, but I also happen to love the results it produced! Using it at night helps my skin glow in the morning and it does not break me out in any way. It highly improved my skin tone. I especially appreciate how light and non-greasy it is for day wear! Great consistency also and absorbs well!</li>
    <li> I use this Marula as a body oil and I find that it absorbs quickly and soothes, hydrates, and protects my skin...originally used a much more expensive brand, but now that I have tried this sliice of Nature, I will continue with it; Very pleased with my purchase and results.</li>
    <li> I struggle with red blotchy skin and I was looking for a remedy. Since using this Marula oil, I&#x27;ve experienced significant improvement within a period of 2 weeks. Really pleased! It&#x27;s now a part of my daily cleansing routine</li>
    <li> This marula oil gets absorbed very quickly into the skin and, after a week of using it, I have seen an improvement in my skin, specifically in texture. It has given me enough hope to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I am much satisfied with the results on my damaged hair from this cold pressed natural marula oil. I noticed slight smell, which is good as well. I would definitely purchase this again from Slice of Nature.</li>
    <li> My sister has started to find fine lines and was worried about it and I got this marula oil for her. This oil actually sinks deeps into her skin leaving no traces of oil and the fine lines are nowhere. She recommends them.</li>
    <li> My dad&#x27;s skin cells are much damaged due to his working environment and he looks very much dull. I just wanted to find a good workable solution to improve his condition and decided to go with Marula oil, as it has good antioxidants to aid in blood flow and boost growth of new cells. Sure, it just did change his condition in a week of application. He looks great now.</li>
    <li> This oil works really well and can be used for several purposes. It can be used on your body and hair. It makes your skin feel soft and provides moisture to hair and scalp. I really enjoy the products by slice of nature they work great, odor free,and affordable. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Feels great as its not greasy. My skin soaks it up.&lt;br /&gt;Its fragrance makes my day!</li>
    <li> First let me say I use marula oil on my face daily.  Love it&#x27;s moisturizing properties.  Product smells fresh, no hint of rancidity.  Slice of Nature offers this oil at a good price, too.  That said, I am a little uncomfortable about the total lack of information on the sourcing of the marula fruit, where the oil is extracted, how the purity is determined, etc..  If I&#x27;m applying a product to my face daily, I&#x27;d like to know that the quality is well monitored.  There isn&#x27;t even a lot number on the bottle I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple request to the importer, please provide more labeling information.  Perhaps country of origin? sustainably harvested? how the purity is ensured?  Thank you in advance.</li>
    <li> It does goes on real smoothly and makes my skin feel great. I use it as my day moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Be sure not to use too much. Usually one to two drops is plenty unless you have very long or very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I see that many of the reviews for this product are from people who received a promotional bottle of this oil. Since their reviews swayed me to buy this instead of the Shea Terra Organics Marula Oil, I thought I should weigh in. As mentioned, I purchased this bottle based on all of the stellar reviews it was receiving on Amazon and I am unimpressed by this product. Previously I bought the Shea Terra Marula Oil and when I ran out and it was time to repurchase, all the glowing reviews and price led me to buy Slice of Nature Marula Oil instead. I do agree that Slice of Nature is not as thick/greasy as Shea Terra and does not have the nutty smell, but it also does not work as well. With Shea Terra, I used it at night before I went to bed as an evening moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t use anything else on top of it. I also used it for a nasty burn I received as a result of boiling water. In the morning my skin looked great with Shea Terra. It was well moisturized and had a brighter appearance. If I exfoliated the dead skin, my skin was glowing. I haven&#x27;t used retinol products because my infant daughter is always near my face, but with the Shea Terra, I had no need for them. I have been using the Slice of Nature product for a week now. The first few days my skin was definitely drier in the mornings and had a duller appearance. I&#x27;ve started using a thicker moisturizer on top of it and that seems to work better, but I don&#x27;t see the noticeable benefits of marula oil. My burn is also not healing as nicely as it did with the Shea Terra. I&#x27;ll try to return this product and get the Shea Terra instead. For my burn, I would really like the scar reducing properties of the thicker marula oil.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother wasting money on the expensive department store type marula oil. They are chock full of chemicals and silicone. Whereas this oil is very light, doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor like some other oils I&#x27;ve used (hemp seed oil works great but smells hideous) and in a pinch one pump will moisturize your hands like they have never been moisturized before. Seriously cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this oil as a daily facial moisturizer. It is very nice and light and is absorbed easily. For my face, I use a few drops, warm it in my hands and press to the skin and it’s all I need. I would recommend this marula to anyone who loves to keep their skin healthy.</li>
    <li> I can see that it has helped improve my skin&#x27;s texture and hydrates the skin too. The redness of my skin is still there but it&#x27;s getting better. I would repurchase this once I&#x27;m finished.</li>
