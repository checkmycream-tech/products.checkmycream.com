      <li>Shipping, etc was all fine.</li>

      <li>It tamed by semi-frizzy hair and works great with the shampoo of the same brand.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this item because I loved the packet that comes with the natural hair color I use.  </li>
      <li>I love this product but it&#x27;s really so expinsive&lt;</li>
      <li>Most days, I do the normal thing where you leave it on for a couple of minutes after you wash your hair and then rinse it out.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as good as expected.</li>
      <li>like this product very much.  </li>
      <li>and I like is very much</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many commercial and health food store brands of conditioner.</li>
      <li>This product just doesn&#x27;t leave hair texture smooth or soft.</li>
      <li>Did not do much good for my thin, fine hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pure with no, not one additive.</li>
      <li>If I use too much my hair gets oily fast</li>
      <li>I really like it and recommend it.</li>
      <li>Wonderful on my thin dry hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s leaves my hair soft &amp; SHINEY!!</li>
      <li>Too bad because they would have had a loyal and happy customer.</li>
      <li>A small amount works great, doesn&#x27;t build up in my hair or weigh it down.</li>
      <li>Maks your hair soft and shines.</li>
      <li>absolutely the same as the one in a hair color package!</li>
      <li>and it makes my hair soft.  </li>
      <li>This deep conditions very well.</li>
      <li>This product smooths the cuticle of the hair creating a soft feeling.</li>
      <li>This cream has the same color and consistency but the results that I felt were not the same, even using exactly the same amount.  </li>
      <li>This does appear to be the same stuff and it leaves my hair luxuriously soft.  </li>
      <li>so you just have to be careful how much you use</li>
      <li>It is a lumpy liquid when it should be a smooth thick cream.</li>
      <li>wash my hair, put the conditioner on, put a plastic bag over my hair, wrap a towel around the whole thing, and leave it on for half an hour.</li>
      <li>I purchased this cream because I really like the little pack that comes with the color dye.  </li>

<li> I purchased this cream because I really like the little pack that comes with the color dye.  </li>
<li> so for the price, this does not last very long.  </li>
<li> But my hair has gotten very dry recently, so I also do this once a week:</li>
<li> No chemical smell, no allergic reactions, and the color lasts long.</li>
<li> definitely helps the color last longer with less fade</li>
<li> I read other reviews about this conditioner before I bought it, and like some of the other reviewers said, this doesn&#x27;t seem the same as the conditioner that comes with my hair color.  </li>
<li> and I use about half an ounce each time (long hair)</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> The conditioner in this particular shipment is broken down.</li>
<li> bottle was 3/4 only not full bottle !!</li>
<li> I will not purchase this again because it is not worth the price.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair.  </li>
<li> Provides condition but doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair.</li>
<li> I have long thick hair.</li>
<li> Not sure what happened, but this had to be mishandled at some point to cause the breakdown.</li>
<li> I have thin hair and other conditioners were making it oily.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t hate this conditioner, I just had higher expectations for it.</li>
<li> One disappointment is that you only get just over 5 ounces</li>
<li> It is a little bit expensive</li>
<li> I find it a little expensive.  </li>
<li> I thought they would be same, but I was disappointed.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s too bad that it comes in a small container, but charges quite a lot for it.  </li>
<li> This is almost impossible to find in the store.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Different as the one in the permanent box. Low quality.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair.  Forms a lather.  Not like normal conditioners but does a great job for me.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews about this conditioner before I bought it, and like some of the other reviewers said, this doesn&#x27;t seem the same as the conditioner that comes with my hair color.  The description, name and container picture are the same, but the results are not.  I don&#x27;t hate this conditioner, I just had higher expectations for it.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it&#x27;s really so expinsive&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was 3/4 only not full bottle !!</li>
    <li> I color my hair--shhhh!--and most shampoos and conditioners strip the color. Not this one! It makes my hair look and feel healthy, shiny and silky. I&#x27;m fussy about avoiding certain chemicals and am very pleased with Naturtint&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Greatly satisfied with product. Timely delivery.</li>
    <li> I color my hair. I&#x27;ve tried many commercial and health food store brands of conditioner. Some work fairly well and others leave an oily residue. This is the best conditioner that I&#x27;ve used so far. Most days, I do the normal thing where you leave it on for a couple of minutes after you wash your hair and then rinse it out. It leaves my hair silky and there&#x27;s no residue. But my hair has gotten very dry recently, so I also do this once a week: wash my hair, put the conditioner on, put a plastic bag over my hair, wrap a towel around the whole thing, and leave it on for half an hour. This deep conditions very well.</li>
    <li> I use the naturetint hair coloring- I like the smell of this conditioner and it makes my hair soft.  If I use too much my hair gets oily fast so you just have to be careful how much you use</li>
    <li> This product just doesn&#x27;t leave hair texture smooth or soft. I&#x27;m not prone to tangles but have experienced them since using this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream because I really like the little pack that comes with the color dye.  I thought they would be same, but I was disappointed.  This cream has the same color and consistency but the results that I felt were not the same, even using exactly the same amount.  I will not purchase this again because it is not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is awesome product and I like is very much</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as expected. It was different from the one that came with the die .</li>
    <li> the product it is just fine</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for years. No chemical smell, no allergic reactions, and the color lasts long. You can easily use this product at home. We like to buy from Amazon, convenient, fast shipping and the quality is good and original.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve found to date!  It&#x27;s pure with no, not one additive. It&#x27;s leaves my hair soft &amp; SHINEY!! NO frizzys.</li>
    <li> Probably the best conditioner I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;Ever used. A small amount works great, doesn&#x27;t build up in my hair or weigh it down. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> The conditioner in this particular shipment is broken down. It is a lumpy liquid when it should be a smooth thick cream. Not sure what happened, but this had to be mishandled at some point to cause the breakdown. I&#x27;ll try buying locally next time.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and other conditioners were making it oily. This one works great. My hair is softer-- looks and feels better and thicker.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner,  my hair looks amazing every time I use it. It is a little bit expensive so I get to use it twice a a week only. But overall I love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner for color treated hair</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I loved the packet that comes with the natural hair color I use.  This does appear to be the same stuff and it leaves my hair luxuriously soft.  One disappointment is that you only get just over 5 ounces and I use about half an ounce each time (long hair) so for the price, this does not last very long.  I still love it however I have moved to only using it once a week..</li>
    <li> This is almost impossible to find in the store. I really like it and recommend it. Shipping, etc was all fine.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great. absolutely the same as the one in a hair color package! Like it and buy it next time again!</li>
    <li> Wonderful on my thin dry hair.  Actually gives it body.</li>
    <li> I use naturtint hair color and the multiplier definitely helps the color last longer with less fade but it was pricey for the quantity in the tube.</li>
    <li> Maks your hair soft and shines. I have long thick hair. It works great</li>
    <li> Naturtint-Nutrideep Multiplier, 5.28 oz. cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product very much.  I find it a little expensive.  Other than that, I have not complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cory</li>
    <li> Coloring hair opens the follicles and causes a coarse feeling when the hair is rinsed.  This product smooths the cuticle of the hair creating a soft feeling.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner.  It tamed by semi-frizzy hair and works great with the shampoo of the same brand.  It&#x27;s too bad that it comes in a small container, but charges quite a lot for it.  And now after reading a reviewers comments, I believe I may have also received half-full bottles for both.  Too bad because they would have had a loyal and happy customer.</li>
    <li> Conditions nicely and it gives my hair and nice shine and feels clean</li>
    <li> Did not do much good for my thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Provides condition but doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll always take it with a grain of salt with anything self-claimed to be &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Nature&amp;#34;!</li>
