      <li>The wig cap inside is nice.</li>
      <li>This wig is nice for the cost.</li>
      <li>This wig is really nice quality.</li>
      <li>I had to cut off a good bit, but it was still really easy to work with.</li>
      <li>I bought this with seeing so many good reviews, now I must say I LOVE the way it looks</li>
      <li>It was packaged and shipped very nicely and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>so that was handy as well :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to come by again to shop for more cosplay needs here! :)</li>
      <li>so i was also pleased with that.</li>
      <li>it has a lot of shine to it (which i dont mind), but nothing that some baby powder cant fix :)</li>
      <li>that its light weight and has a nice flow.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, thisis definitely THE BEST wig I have ever bought for twenty dollars.</li>
      <li>The picture picks up the color a lot lighter, but i love this wig.</li>
      <li>I have not ordered from anyone else because I am completely satisfied with the QUALITY</li>
      <li>, I would get one knot out and end up with five more, I have put all sorts of detanglers on it and I am so upset.</li>
      <li>This wig is fantastic!</li>
      <li>The one I received doesn&#x27;t have that glimmery falseness that most wigs have.</li>
      <li>and it came when it said it would :)</li>
      <li>OK.</li>
      <li>Sprays and  specialize conditioners and shampoos will not make this wig any better.</li>
      <li>Such a beautiful wig!</li>
      <li>Overall, a wonderful buy whether just for fun or for cosplay!!</li>
      <li>The nice thing is, if I can get over my fear of wearing it in public, I know it will look great despite being a bit over the top.</li>
      <li>I extremely love this wig so much because it feels very soft, smooth, and silky, looks very sexy, and smells clean, healthy, and beautiful!</li>
      <li>I received it really quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
      <li>I love it because its so comfortable and cheap!</li>
      <li>The way that it&#x27;s shipped is perfectly good for shipping, but unless you want to have to restyle it and comb the whole thing out (an endeavor, I assure you)</li>
      <li>It arrived faster than expected and is packed inside a slim plastic sleeve inside a compact box which is easy to put the wig into again for storage, although one of those heads would probably be best (if you don&#x27;t have cats).</li>
      <li>I keep mine braided, so that I can easily unbraid and comb it out.</li>
      <li>but that was also easy with no issues.</li>
      <li>This was very high quality and a very cute shape.</li>
      <li>so now I&#x27;m going to have to ruin the beautiful shine just to add some blonde tint into it!</li>
      <li>If you like to tuck the bangs/fringe to the side, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Just get yourself a light-colored wig cap, and you should be fine.</li>
      <li>With the conditioner, it stays nice and silky, which is good because (again like all long hair wigs)</li>
      <li>It might end up tangling a little bit, but that does not ruin its beautiful, silky gorgeousness!</li>
      <li>I was so hoping forward to a light blonde/platinum wig to wear for my cosplay</li>
      <li>but overall it&#x27;s a great wig to add into my cosplay wig collection.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a white wig, this is great.</li>
      <li>Nothing like the cheap Halloween wigs.</li>
      <li>That said, it&#x27;s really fun to play with right away because the hair comes so silky and nice.</li>
      <li>I was able to crimp the hair with braiding and boiling water and has to cut it a bit for the right length.</li>
      <li>I was extremely excited when I ordered this wig as I had been searching for about a month to find a color and length that I liked, as well as not costing too much.</li>
      <li>Shipped in a week or so and it was wrapped up really nice in a net and with a wig cap :)</li>
      <li>This is such a soft, silky wig and is perfect to wear for anything: cosplaying, conventions, costume parties, etc.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly, too.</li>
      <li>and it still down to my butt other than that its great and looks ad feels great</li>
      <li>it was so long the good 5 inches i took off dident matter</li>
      <li>Color is pretty much the same as the picture which makes me happy and the package arrived before the estimated delivery date.</li>
      <li>The wig looks exactly like the picture!</li>
      <li>The submitted pictures depict it pretty well, but for anyone familiar with hex, it&#x27;s right around a EFFFB8.</li>
      <li>but I love wearing the front like old pinup style.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the wait.</li>
      <li>and you just need it for halloween, it&#x27;s easily worth the $16.</li>
      <li>I thought I was going to trim the bangs right away</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get the wig so fast in the mail and with such a beautiful cut and texture, BUT IT&#x27;S NOT BLONDE or even close to Kotobuki&#x27;s color!</li>
      <li>It was a nice light blonde color, just like I wanted, and perfect for cutting and styling.</li>
      <li>Besides, if I choose not to wear it in public, it will function great as a costume wig for Galadriel or Daenerys Targaryen (for all you nerds) or if you&#x27;re into anime cosplay, it&#x27;s definitely that type of cut.</li>
      <li>Most wigs would take a week to completely detangle and style, but this one I got today, and it&#x27;s already styled and ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also kind of heavy if you hold it out and feel the weight of it, but otherwise it rests comfortably.</li>
      <li>So it is very much like the picture.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s exactly the color I wanted.</li>
      <li>;).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s platinum blonde--exactly the same colour I have always dreamed of having but have never quite been able to achieve through bleaching.</li>
      <li>But when I got it it was more yellow than the picture and SO shiny!!!!</li>
      <li>(I personally have mine on top of my bookshelf).</li>
      <li>this is my first wig EVER</li>
      <li>It is exactly the color as shown on my screen.</li>
      <li>This is a higher quality than store bought Halloween wigs.</li>
      <li>Color is exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>In that vein, since the hairstyle is so extreme, a good deal of styling is necessary before trying to pass this off as a day to day look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another important element of caring for this wig is storage.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was a Christmas for my nieces. They started screaming and yelling! They are Frozen fans so it was perfect for them. For the price, was amazed with quality. Lots of hair. Nothing like the cheap Halloween wigs. I hardly ever write a review, but you will not be disappointed in this product. It also arrived ahead of schedule!</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful wig! Just very heavy and got knotted easy.  I would def buy again. I have not ordered from anyone else because I am completely satisfied with the QUALITY</li>
    <li> Great job at customer service. This got to me lightning fast and came with a wig cap (which is always nice)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, time to lay down some truths. This isn&#x27;t a hair replacement wig. This isn&#x27;t a wig you&#x27;re going to have for the rest of your life. It is, however, a perfectly good wig that will last you a while if you take proper care of it. No wig looks perfect right out of the box and to expect that out of a $16 wig wouldn&#x27;t just be unfair, it would be insane. That said, it&#x27;s really fun to play with right away because the hair comes so silky and nice. Like all long wigs, however, it is extremely difficult to manage. I soothed that by adding some leave in conditioner to the fibers (a huge no-no for synthetic wigs, I know, but it&#x27;s a $16 wig, it isn&#x27;t going to last forever). With the conditioner, it stays nice and silky, which is good because (again like all long hair wigs) it requires frequent combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also like all wigs, it did require a little trimming before it looked natural. I just ran my razor comb through it a couple of times to feather the ends a little bit, but I could see how this wig could be useful for all sorts of dramatic updos. I&#x27;m considering buying another one just for the fibers, so that I can create a lace front for another project I&#x27;m working on. I prefer to buy long wigs like this, even if I plan on styling them into much shorter cuts, just so that I have the fibers that I need. In that vein, since the hairstyle is so extreme, a good deal of styling is necessary before trying to pass this off as a day to day look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another important element of caring for this wig is storage. Obviously you can&#x27;t just throw it in a drawer, you might never get it untangled in that case. I keep mine braided, so that I can easily unbraid and comb it out. The way that it&#x27;s shipped is perfectly good for shipping, but unless you want to have to restyle it and comb the whole thing out (an endeavor, I assure you) every time you want to wear it,I would recommend braiding it and putting it on a wig head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point of all of this is that, basically, it is a very difficult wig to maintain... but it&#x27;s no more difficult than any other wig this length would be. The colour is perfect for Daenerys, Rapunzel, or Saber. The submitted pictures depict it pretty well, but for anyone familiar with hex, it&#x27;s right around a EFFFB8. It looks good both indoors and out. The fibers look extremely nice in small braids and complicated styling and they don&#x27;t slip out too easily or require gel. The only time it starts to look somewhat fake is under bright florescent light (I&#x27;m talking about aiming a fluorescent lamp straight at it, so that shouldn&#x27;t pose much of a problem). It&#x27;s a lot of work, but it looks fantastic, so I definitely recommend it. Even if you aren&#x27;t going to take care of it and you just need it for halloween, it&#x27;s easily worth the $16.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money, super thin! You can totally see through the top and it sheds like crazy!!! The length does not make for how thin it is.</li>
    <li> This wig is nice for the cost. It is so soft and silky. It is exactly the color as shown on my screen. It is a very pale, platinum blond. That&#x27;s exactly the color I wanted. It&#x27;s not too silver, and it&#x27;s not too yellow. It&#x27;s really pretty. I put it on and cut about 3 inches off the length of the bangs/fringe. If you like to tuck the bangs/fringe to the side, it&#x27;s fine. I just chose not to. I cut wispy fringe around eyebrow level for a costume I am working on. The only con I can see is that it&#x27;s a little fine and not as thick as I&#x27;d prefer at the crown, where the occasional tract (hair band) can be seen. It is very light with a light lacy cap, so if you have super dark hair, it might show through a little. Just get yourself a light-colored wig cap, and you should be fine. Shipped quickly, too.</li>
    <li> i love it but with in the first 5 minutes it got all tangled and as i tryed fixing it it just got worse so i spent an hour with sizors and conditioner lucky it was so long the good 5 inches i took off dident matter and it still down to my butt other than that its great and looks ad feels great</li>
    <li> Extremely easy to get tangled and is also really thin</li>
    <li> OK. Yes, I agree with some reviewers that it is a tad thin in the front, but I bought this because I needed a long blonde wig in this color and nothing will make a dark haired short girl look like Thranduil from the movie. BUT...that being said, when this wig is on and trimmed a little with the crown, it looks FANTASTIC! Everyone I&#x27;ve shown was really impressed. I personally think its easy to style and despite being long (my own hair is long) I don&#x27;t have a problem with the maintenance. Shipped in a week or so and it was wrapped up really nice in a net and with a wig cap :)</li>
    <li> This wig Is beautiful at a glance; the hair isn&#x27;t too shiny, the color is a very pale blonde (not gold, not yellow, but not white either), and the hair is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the hair is a bit thin around the back of the head. This was easily fixed by pushing the &amp;#34;roots&amp;#34; up a bit and spraying them with hairspray. Basically, if the hair isn&#x27;t pressing down on the mesh (which is pale nude) you cannot see the mesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is a costume wig for $20. This is not a wig for daily use. This wig is above any wig you would by at K-mart or Wal-mart for Halloween, but it is not a high quality wig for hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig does not have a lace front mesh, but the mesh isn&#x27;t flimsy either. The mesh also comes with a clip to secure the wig to the back of the head, and it came with a wig cap.</li>
    <li> The wig looks exactly like the picture! It even arrived a day early! I&#x27;ll be sure to come by again to shop for more cosplay needs here! :)</li>
    <li> The wig served it purpose anf look great with my costume. It does get tangled [as aspected], but not a big deal just finger through strating from the ends and work your way up. Other tham that its light weight and has a nice flow.</li>
    <li> looks just like the picture, it&#x27;s great. I got it because I wanted hair like Taylor Momsen. Only problem I&#x27;ve had is it tangles easily.</li>
    <li> The picture picks up the color a lot lighter, but i love this wig. Go for it! Customer service is amazing! The bangs are a little hard to part, but it came with a wig cap which i am very thankful of. Its long beatiful and fun to prank people with if put on properly. A great purchase a lot better then the Rhexia wigs. It does get tangled a bit fast, but treat it well and it will last.</li>
    <li> Color is pretty much the same as the picture which makes me happy and the package arrived before the estimated delivery date. I bought this to wear as Elsa I just need to cut and style great color beautiful wig</li>
    <li> Super long light platinum blonde wig! I love it because its so comfortable and cheap! Awesome wig for an awesome price! Only downside is that it is a little thick and tangles but comes out with a brush</li>
    <li> I extremely love this wig so much because it feels very soft, smooth, and silky, looks very sexy, and smells clean, healthy, and beautiful! This is such a soft, silky wig and is perfect to wear for anything: cosplaying, conventions, costume parties, etc. It might end up tangling a little bit, but that does not ruin its beautiful, silky gorgeousness! A perfect wig to resemble beautiful, healthy hair!</li>
    <li> This was very high quality and a very cute shape. It didn&#x27;t smell like some wigs do. I got another from this same company and they both seem very high quality. The only thing to be aware of is that it is positively white. There is no shade of blonde to it at all, not even light platinum blonde. If you are looking for a white wig, this is great. Unfortunately, I had to return this because of the color but that was also easy with no issues.</li>
    <li> COMPLETE CRAP  DON&#x27;T WAIST YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> This wig is fantastic! The one I received doesn&#x27;t have that glimmery falseness that most wigs have. It was a little longer than I expected but that&#x27;s wonderful because I&#x27;m going to be using this for my Chii cosplay! Overall, it&#x27;s very pretty and the material is thorough. It was packaged and shipped very nicely and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Color is exactly as pictured. Great shipping speed. This is a higher quality than store bought Halloween wigs. Very soft. I don&#x27;t expect it to last as long as some other wigs. Like others, hair is shedding. The cut wasn&#x27;t paid too much attention to, there were some shorter pieces in the back, but it was under the longer pieces so it wasn&#x27;t too visible. I bought this for a Daenerys cosplay. I was able to crimp the hair with braiding and boiling water and has to cut it a bit for the right length. Worked out wonderfully in the end</li>
    <li> A little more yellow than expected, but the quality of the cap, and fibers are great.  It also has a small skin top to make it more natural looking.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and got excited because its very hard to find a blonde wig that&#x27;s not shiny and totally fake looking. But when I got it it was more yellow than the picture and SO shiny!!!!, one look at it and i packed it up and sent it back.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even do the style that I wanted, wig was too thin. It did arrive sooner than I expected though. The color was just like the picture too. It&#x27;s just that it got tangled much more faster than the other wigs I have even if I do brush it how I supposed to, and also it was super thin.</li>
    <li> The wig cap inside is nice. Has a lot of places to adjust the wig. The hair is of great poor quality. Worse then walmart wigs. Sprays and  specialize conditioners and shampoos will not make this wig any better. It&#x27;s like dried out grass that&#x27;s so thin and tangles just by blowing on it. I got one in green like this it was crap too. Then I got the blue one last year in April and it was much better quality than this one. They may have changed the quality to much lower ones.</li>
    <li> This was way better quality than I expected! It took nearly no detangling, it&#x27;s extra super soft and fluffy, and was very easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had many wigs, most of them would lose hairs through the first several comb-throughs, but this one hardly lost any! I could even count the hairs it lost on one hand! Most wigs would take a week to completely detangle and style, but this one I got today, and it&#x27;s already styled and ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it&#x27;s the best decision I made to buy this wig for my cosplay!</li>
    <li> The wig is of good quality. It lets off some hair when you brush it but all wigs do that. It is not the classic yellow blonde that you see a lot of blonde wigs use. This is a more platinum blonde which means it is a more of a white blonde. So it is very much like the picture. Its not a super thick wig so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled as bad as some of your thicker wigs. The bangs on the wig are rather long, longer then you expect, they came down passed my chin when I got it. So if you want bangs, you&#x27;ll have to cut it. I bought this wig to wear it with the character Chii from Chobits and when you cut the bangs, the wig is perfect for Chii. It may not be the softest wig I have ever bought but it is still pretty soft and it isn&#x27;t that heavy on your head. Though, I will say it is a little warm to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the anime character that this wig is suppose to be for, and it would work for that if you want a more natural looking blonde for the character rather then the out right yellowish blonde she has. But again, you&#x27;ll probably need to cut the bangs to suit your needs. Over all I say this is a great wig and I would recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> It says in the review \\&quot;blonde\\&quot; but I received a white wig so I had to return it. I was so hoping forward to a light blonde/platinum wig to wear for my cosplay but now I have to try another venue.</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited when I ordered this wig as I had been searching for about a month to find a color and length that I liked, as well as not costing too much. This wig met all my criteria and I ordered it without a second thought. It arrived within the expected arrival time and it was in perfect condition (all it needed was a little comb through). I cut the bangs myself because I wanted them shorter, and I have used my hair straightener on it (on the lowest setting and for only small areas). I have worn it out a couple times and it is no hassle to deal with while driving or socializing. One thing though if you plan to buy this or another wig of this length - you will NEED a wig stand and a place high enough to store it without damaging it (I personally have mine on top of my bookshelf). Overall, a wonderful buy whether just for fun or for cosplay!!</li>
    <li> From hearing all of the other reviews, I was expecting for it to be &#x27;white&#x27; but it wasn&#x27;t, which I would of been fine with anyways. It was platinum blonde. It was shipped in three days, which was amazing, and came with a gift and a wig cap, which I did not expect. Good quality for a wig, and hardly any hair fell out when I was brushing and messing with it. The bangs are long, which I love, it gives you different options. You usually get a really tacky side part with other wigs, but these bangs totally allow you to do what ever. I will definitely order from them again (:</li>
    <li> This wig is really nice quality. I received it really quickly and nicely packaged. It was a nice light blonde color, just like I wanted, and perfect for cutting and styling. I styled this one for my Viral (from Gurren Lagann) cosplay! I had to cut off a good bit, but it was still really easy to work with. And for a very good price!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get the wig so fast in the mail and with such a beautiful cut and texture, BUT IT&#x27;S NOT BLONDE or even close to Kotobuki&#x27;s color! This wig is PURE WHITE. I do not have time to return it so now I&#x27;m going to have to ruin the beautiful shine just to add some blonde tint into it! NOT COOL. Contacted customer service to see if they could help and was simply told to return it. Thanks but no thanks, not again.</li>
    <li> I personally like this wig. The only problem with it is that that it&#x27;s not blonde at all. It&#x27;s PURE WHITE. I didn&#x27;t mind because that&#x27;s what I was going for but others may not. The quality is good but the price is a little too high for my liking.</li>
    <li> I recently destroyed my hair due to over processing and bleaching it, so i figured i&#x27;d get a wig to wear while i wait for my hair to strengthen up. this is my first wig EVER and i love it! i liked that it was extra long so that way i could cut it and style it any way i wanted. the part in the wig is very versatile to part on whichever side you normally wear your hair so i was also pleased with that. I had read reviews about people getting a pure white wig (which didnt bother me because my hair is basically white as it is) but i got a platinum one just like in the photo. Do keep in mind that it is a cosplay wig, it&#x27;s not meant to look like real hair. it has a lot of shine to it (which i dont mind), but nothing that some baby powder cant fix :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the seller, had two day shipping and it came when it said it would :) Also the seller included a wig cap so that was handy as well :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig has started my new addiction and i will be buying from these guys again!!! :D</li>
    <li> This wig was not blonde at all as advertised. It is pure white and completely unusable for the character that I needed it for without alteration. I will not be using this company to buy anything again and will be returning the wig.</li>
    <li> I was honestly a little apprehensive about buying a cosplay wig for under $20, but my friend encouraged me to go for it and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s definitely a cosplay wig and not a Halloween Store wig. It&#x27;s not too thin and cuts and styles well. The arrangement of the hair in the net is in straight rows rather than being more evenly distributed, but you don&#x27;t notice it when the wig is on the wig head, only when you&#x27;re styling it. It&#x27;s a really natural platinum blonde color. Like other reviewers said, it does tangle easily.</li>
    <li> Super thin. If you braid it all it&#x27;s about 1-1.5 inches across.</li>
    <li> i like the shade and it&#x27;s so long! it&#x27;s Mugi&#x27;s shade (a little darker than the image so it doesn&#x27;t look &#x27;almost white blonde&#x27;) i really love it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this with seeing so many good reviews, now I must say I LOVE the way it looks, it doesn&#x27;t have that weird shiny false hair thing going on, but the problem I am having is the tangles! The second I pulled it out of the bag and put it on it became a tangled disaster and I could not seem to get it to stop, I would get one knot out and end up with five more, I have put all sorts of detanglers on it and I am so upset. It came just in time for my cosplay and I can&#x27;t even use it because of what a horrible rats nest it is. I am very very unhappy with this product and I do not recommend it at all. It&#x27;s just horrible. It really is a shame.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the exact shade of blonde that is pictured above. Yes it&#x27;s very long and unfortunately pretty thin but overall it&#x27;s a great wig to add into my cosplay wig collection. My tip to keep it from getting tangled is to put it in a braid when not in use, it will save you time when you go back to wear it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what some other reviewers are complaining about, because my wig is exactly the same colour as pictured. It&#x27;s platinum blonde--exactly the same colour I have always dreamed of having but have never quite been able to achieve through bleaching. Besides always ending up a little brassy or a little too golden, the bleaching also damaged my hair and I had to stop. I&#x27;ve been so sick of having dark dirty blonde roots, but now that I have this wig, I can be a platinum blonde whenever I feel like it and don&#x27;t have to worry about the damage it&#x27;s doing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I DID buy this wig in the hopes of wearing it out, but it IS a very extreme hairstyle and therefore won&#x27;t really be believable as real hair. The nice thing is, if I can get over my fear of wearing it in public, I know it will look great despite being a bit over the top. Besides, if I choose not to wear it in public, it will function great as a costume wig for Galadriel or Daenerys Targaryen (for all you nerds) or if you&#x27;re into anime cosplay, it&#x27;s definitely that type of cut. It helps that my boyfriend likes it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very soft and shiny and goes down to my waist. It&#x27;s also easy to style by side-parting or cutting the bangs, and if you wanted to make it into a more realistic hair style, you could easily cut it to any length. The fact that it&#x27;s so incredibly long gives you endless options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only sort-of downside is that it is just like having really long hair. For anyone who has had hair nearly as long as this, you&#x27;ll know that it tangles easily or gets caught on stuff (be extra careful when going to the bathroom! ;). It&#x27;s also kind of heavy if you hold it out and feel the weight of it, but otherwise it rests comfortably. It also came with a snug-fitting wig cap that helped me cram my real hair (which is pretty long) into it. It&#x27;s a very high-quality piece with a nice built-in cap as well that fits tightly without being itchy or headache-inducing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, thisis definitely THE BEST wig I have ever bought for twenty dollars. Whether you&#x27;re buying it for a costume, for fun, or because you just want to look awesome, this is the wig for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It arrived faster than expected and is packed inside a slim plastic sleeve inside a compact box which is easy to put the wig into again for storage, although one of those heads would probably be best (if you don&#x27;t have cats).</li>
    <li> The color is a beautiful pale blonde, exactly what I was looking for. I thought I was going to trim the bangs right away but I love wearing the front like old pinup style. Will be a treasured piece for my collection</li>
    <li> I got my wig earlier than expected! Good quality, great length, perfect color. Totally worth the wait.</li>
