<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was given this product to try for free and LOVED It. It is now going to be my go-to hair color. I found the price comparable to the ones I previously used and the overall product was tremendously better. I have lots of gray hair, and this not only covered it, but lasted longer than other brands. There was no fading like I have experienced with other products and it was not hard to use. I am definitely going to be using this product from now on for my hair coloring at home. I have to color once a month due to growth and this will be worth every penny because it lasts so long, has a wonderful overall color and is easy to use. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I really like this hair color but they don&#x27;t give you enough.  I only have shoulder length hair and there wasn&#x27;t enough.  I like how the color is bright orange when you it it on so you know where you&#x27;ve applied it (like purple ceiling paint).</li>
    <li> DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DYE!!! It is HORRIBLE!! Turned my dark brown roots with a little gray, ORANGEISH RED!!! Absolutely Absurd!!! Never had a hair dye do this before!! Going to Walmart tomorrow to buy Clairol or some other brand that isn&#x27;t awful. Just terrible</li>
    <li> I got this in a different color but was unable to find it on Amazon but either way, here goes! I decided to color my hair this evening after not having done so for two years. I bought Vidal Sassoon because I typically like their products. They work well and they are decently priced. Well, I&#x27;m definitely wishing I went with a different brand. I followed the directions and left the color in my hair for a full thirty minutes. When I washed it out though and dried my hair, it was like I hadn&#x27;t done a thing to it! Except for my roots. My roots are definitely a different color. The rest of my hair though? Aside from a couple strands here and there.... Totally the same color as before. So, now, I&#x27;m stuck with red roots and brown hair for at least a week until I can color it again. If you haven&#x27;t figured it out already, take my advice and don&#x27;t buy hair color from VS. It&#x27;s not worth the $8. Try Garnier instead.</li>
    <li> Great rich colour and leaves hair soft. Colour did come out darker than expected based on the box colour. Still provides good coverage. Overall a good product. Received this product for free to try it thanks to Vidal Sassoon.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom! Great price compared to store! Works great too. Color comes out well and it is very easy to use!</li>
    <li> really loved this brand and the color thank you so much</li>
    <li> Great product. Applies with no mess, no chemical smell, and doesn&#x27;t stain your skin. Did my hair 3 weeks ago and my hair is still as vibrant &amp; shiny as the picture on the box. Best of all I  #GotItFree  from Vidal Sassoon through a BzzAgent campaign along with several coupons for my friends to try it.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon is a company to trust. This color is so pretty on hair. Don&#x27;t go more than two shades beyond what your normal hair color is. That would be too drastic of a change for your hair to handle.</li>
    <li> I actually really liked this product. I was fortunate enough to be sent this for free by the company to try out.  I feel its a little too pricey for a home hair color, but otherwise I thought it turned out great. The mix was easy to use, I thought the color was great, and it lets you wash your hair when finished. Hasn&#x27;t faded in over a week so far. Love it, but a little too expensive for me to purchase regularly</li>
    <li> Great color pay off!  I have very stubborn grays around my temple, but they were completely covered!  I usually have to do another application within a week, because my stubborn grays are showing.  Not so with this color, which I&#x27;ve never used before this time.  My natural hair color is a very dark brown, and this color added a nice red to my dark brown.</li>
    <li> Got this to die my daughters hair back to normal for school</li>
    <li> First time using this brand but I like the Feria soooo much better, this left hair somewhat dull.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product.  Nice color</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need of dying my hair due to my roots coming in strong and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this New London Luxe Dark Royal Chestnut!  The box alone was exciting and shouts Bold new color.  It was super easy for me to apply the color myself and one box was just enough for my mid length hair.  I really enjoyed the Conditioning Treatment included as it made my hair super soft and left smelling great.  The color shade is almost spot on with the chart on the back of the box and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my results.  I highly recommend this dye to all looking to color their hair from home with salon quality results.  I received this item at a discounted/free price in exchange for my honest unbiased review.  All opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon is one of the best hair colors on the market and works great .. My wife loves it and so do I . A great product made by proffessionals.</li>
    <li> Love Vidal Sasson Products. This hair dye is one of the easiest dyes to use and apply yourself. And it also has lasted me a little over a month with the color staying fresh! This product is definitely a Thumbs Up product.</li>
    <li> Love Vidal Sassoon hair color. I am never disappointed with how well my color comes out.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling soft and moisturized.  Coverage was great at first but fades after a couple washes.</li>
    <li> Recommended. It was just a little brighter.</li>
    <li> Very good price. Fast shipping. Good brand name hair coloring.  I would buy hair coloring again</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims. It&#x27;s a mess free, chemical smell free application, and does not leave any dye marks on your skin. I had highlights and roots before I used this product and it covered it all! I was left with a vibrant beautiful brown that compliments my eyes. What more could you ask for?! I would recommend this dye to anyone, It&#x27;s super easy to use and you are left with fantastic results. I received the product for free in part of promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it ,but I received a broken item let me unhappy.The color I wipe it for a while, and I have to clean it for myself.</li>
    <li> Great product gives amazing color</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do a very good job of covering up my red hair. Instead of dark brown hair, I have auburn hair. It&#x27;s not hideous, but not what I was going for. However, the dye wasn&#x27;t harsh and the conditioner that came with it is FANTASTIC. I wish I could buy it by the gallon!</li>
    <li> I Received the Vidal Sassoon Hair Color I was impressed at the price of this product and also the color. It came as a dark brown and I applied it to my daughters hair. She is a light brown and we used it on her hair to darken it. It turned out the great! The color was great and her hair was so soft and it had a great smell</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Vidal Sassoon so you know it&#x27;s quality. Bought for a friend of mine and she loves the color.</li>
    <li> First time trying this color. I Love the color and the product. Easy to use, hosts a wonderful scent. My hair is shiny and bright. Love the large tubes, easy applicator and durable gloves. Extremely Happy!!</li>
    <li> My daughter used this one, very pretty color. Hair is soft afterward. No odor. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The color was slightly different than what was expected. Still pretty, but not what I expected by far.</li>
    <li> Rich and vibrant color, beautiful shine. Like the rubber gloves over typical plastic. I generally keep my hair dark brown and browns can get &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; easy. This color has given a rich dark brown with a shine that is still going. Use the weekly conditioner provided it is there for a reason. ( I do not like the smell of it but hey it&#x27;s for one wash a week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine, straight and just below my shoulders. I require 2 boxes and that barely does it. For this reason I have taken off a star. I noticed that regardless of which shade I have used with this brand it is always orange when it goes on. It is a little thin and I apply vasoline around my hair line including the back of neck. ( it stains easy and fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this color over color treated (red) hair and did not have any issues. But because everyone&#x27;s hair is different yours may not except the color the same. Obviously result vary and best to get hair in correct condition to color ( beats having to pay out more money to have it fixed) .</li>
    <li> Perfect color.  I love this hair color brand because it doesn&#x27;t fade.  This color in particular is very vibrant and lasts at least 6 weeks.  The only reason I reapply is to the roots because the color is still in my hair!</li>
    <li> I like the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series, to me it&#x27;s my best bang for your buck hair colour. It seems to stay on long enough, and doesn&#x27;t fade like revlon.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect and was easy to use! Instructions were very clear and made my hair feel great when I was finished!</li>
    <li> I was very shocked on how well this covered grays. Very satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> I bought this on a special with a $2:00 coupon and it was almost free so plus for me.  I decided to use it today and I am very sensitive to smells and chemicals.  I must say the smell is not bad.  They color came out beautifully my hair is super shinny and not rough and dry.  I really like the turn out and would recommend  this London Luxe Hair color to everyone.</li>
    <li> My mother in law used this and loved it. She had never used VS brand color before but she said she will definitely  use it again. She loved the way her hair looked and felt. super soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Cheap is a very good product.</li>
    <li> I have used this previously, and it gave me a nice chocolate-y shade of brunette that I really liked.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply, easy instructions, and not too strong a scent.&lt;br /&gt;Not as long lasting as other brands, but a nice color for anyone looking for a good chocolate shade.</li>
    <li> I love this color,this is  a great product.</li>
    <li> Beautiful,bold,vibrant color.I love it and it arrived very quick.</li>
    <li> I got to try the product for free thanks to Vidal Sassoon. Excellent hair color! Love, LOVE the natural look! No mess, no dripping, easy to use and plenty of product to saturate my hair. I&#x27;m totally sold on this brand.  Definitely will be buying this for all my hair color from now on!</li>
    <li> For the last 17 years I have dyed my hair over and over, lots of different colors. Currently I am a light reddish/orange color that my husband hates! So I decided to just do a simple brown and since I was doing a simple brown color.. who am I kidding... when dying your hair there is no simple brown, there are hundreds of browns to choose from! Anyway, I decided to try vidal sassoon&#x27;s version since it seems to have great reviews. I don&#x27;t like to buy the cheaper brands since the color never seems to last as long and sometimes, depending on the brand, it does more damage than good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is really easy to use. You put tube 1 into bottle 1 and shake. No mixing in a cup, adding 3-4-5 items into it... just two items which I like. Now let me warn you right here, the mixture looks carrot orange. I am serious, I kinda of freaked out since my hair is reddish/orange and I was trying to get rid of that color. And it stays that color in the bottle throughout the whole process. But after about 10 minutes on your hair, it will darker to a brown color. So don&#x27;t freak out! I added what the bottle looks like with the color so you all can see. The dye is not runny and is not too thick, so its easy to apply and use on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait 30 minutes and rinse out. I personally shampoo my hair with a light color safe shampoo after dying, and then of course use the conditioner provided with the dye. This conditioner is silky feeling and has a nice texture. The color on my hair being so light is not as dark as the box shows, but it&#x27;s a very nice shade of brown. If you are looking to dye your hair, I would say this is a winner - quick, easy, and pretty close to the box even with reddish hair :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several of these brand and all of them have washed out in days. They even ruined a set of my towels</li>
    <li> Have to say I did not like this product. So glad I got it for free because otherwise I would be asking for my money back. I have been dying my hair for over 17 years and this is the first time ever that my hair color did not turn out like the box. So dissatisfied with it! I would figure that it was going to be a dark brown. All it did was turned my hair to a light brown. I didn&#x27;t like the fact either that when you put it on was orange. If it wasn&#x27;t for having red underneath I would be so mad. First time ever that I have gone dark and not covered a lighters color</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and true to the color. It is long lasting and made my hair silky and smooth! Thanks Vidal Sassoon.</li>
    <li> this is nice item for hair&lt;br /&gt;shipping is very fast and satisfied with this item</li>
    <li> It&#x27;seasy to use and beautiful color.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is very soft.</li>
    <li> Great product. Put me back to my natural hair color. Arrived on time</li>
    <li> Worked as well as I thought it would.  The color lasted approx. 3 weeks and then started to dull.</li>
    <li> The best hair color product and it last a really long time.</li>
    <li> Works well. Lasted well.</li>
    <li> very good quality...i like it</li>
    <li> I like this brand. Got two box and color my hair left my hair looking great. Didn&#x27;t kill my hair lol usually my hair get burn.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product. I received this product as a promotion from the band. I find that the smell was not bad, the little that you could smell. I loved the quality of colour that it gave my hair, it looked like something that came out of the salon. The Brown was as dark and deep as I was hoping for. I love the fact that this product didn&#x27;t sweat onto anything and it didn&#x27;t run after the initial wash too much, if it even did at all. Absolutely worth it!</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s wife here- I just wanted something to boost my natural color and add some shine. This didn&#x27;t do it. Color was fine, but it was dull and did not add any shine, which I&#x27;ve never experienced with any hair color. The conditioner that came with it also didn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as hydrating as others I&#x27;ve used in the past. I will not be purchasing this brand again.</li>
    <li> I had received this product from BzzAgent as part of a promotion from the brand. I had heard of the Vidal Sassoon London Luxe dye before entering the campaign. Specifically, I&#x27;ve heard great reviews of the shade London Lilac and had even considered choosing the shade myself to try. However, since I&#x27;m currently in a nursing program, the shade seemed too bold, so I had chose Dark Royal Chestnut instead. I had tried several brands of at home hair kits before. In comparison I found Vidal Sassoon London Luxe to be average. The method of application was like most brands, but I personally prefer a mousse or foam application instead of the cream consistency, since it&#x27;s easier and quicker to apply. The colour pay off is great and it gave me a vibrant brown shade. There were no streaks or patches and the colour applied evenly. There&#x27;s nothing bad to say about this product. It delivered as I expected and nothing bad or good stood out. I did notice however the retain price of this product, which is around $12, even though most drug store dye kits are often on sale to around $6. Honestly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll find myself purchasing this in the future, although I am REALLY tempted to the London Lilac, so that will be the only reason if I ever purchase this.</li>
    <li> I have never dyed my hair with Vidal Sassoon before. So when this product came up for a cheap price I checked it out.&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed with how well it covered my grey hair. How soft it made my hair. And I love that it did not stain the skin like most other dyes do. I would definitely buy Vidal Sassoon again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair dye. It covers very well. I used it on my mom. I was able to apply it to her hair with zero issues. I would definitely recommend using vidal sassoon.</li>
    <li> This was easy to use although my hands are chubby and the gloves in the box tore</li>
    <li> Perfect hair color with nice tint! Looks natural</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. I loved the conditioner and the color lasted a pretty good amount of time. My hair is pretty dark so I didn&#x27;t get this kind of color but it did a good job covering up grays</li>
    <li> Did not cover my gray hair and has washed out after only 4 washes. The color was beautiful before I washed it.</li>
    <li> I actually loved it! I was able to get saloon quality color at home. The only thing I can say bad is I had to have help I couldn&#x27;t do it myself. Oh and I got it FREE from bzzagent!</li>
    <li> pretty color and came in quickly!</li>
    <li> Great hair dye, my hair came out beautiful and its so soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> Nice color. I&#x27;ve always loved Vidal Sassoon.</li>
    <li> Starting Colour - Light Brown&lt;br /&gt;Length : Shoulder&lt;br /&gt;Type: Think, Curly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my first impression upon receiving the box was the high end appearance of the packaging.  When I opened the box, it did not disappoint.  I was super happy to see actual gloves (not the cellophane sandwich bag wannabes that they usually try to pass as gloves in these home colour kits).  It&#x27;s a small thing, but anyone with small hands will attest that proper gloves make a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;Inside the box was a tube of colour, bottle of developer, and conditioner.  Upon opening the bottle of developer, I noticed right away that it did not have much of an odour at all...another plus!  The colour mixed easily, however I was a bit concerned that the bottle seemed to be only a little more than 3/4 full when I mixed the colour.  I was worried that I was going to be unable to get all of my hair coloured with the one kit.&lt;br /&gt;The colour applied easily, a thick gel which did not drip even once.  Easy to apply, and although I still feel I could have used another three ounces of colour to get a good application, I did manager to massage enough colour through all of my hair that I could get it all covered, it appeared almost dry, not saturated, but I gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;I did a full 30 minutes, immediately noticing that the colour continued not to drip, there was a pleasant, and definitely not overwhelming scent (more light the scent of shampoo or conditioner, certainly not the usual stench of hair dye), and I felt absolutely no burning or tingling sensations on my scalp (which I usually do from hair colour).&lt;br /&gt;The colour is rich and vibrant, it applied well, rinsed easily from my hair, and despite my doubts about a sufficient coverage, it seems to have coloured all of my hair.  No stains on my skin (I actually left a few spots of colour on the back of my neck just to see).  The conditioner was also very pleasant smelling.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, an excellent product, I am happy I got to try it, would recommend it to anyone using home colour, and will definitely be using more colours by this brand in the future!</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my sister in law and she loved the color. It was easy to put on and condition colored evenly over the entire head.</li>
    <li> Very nice color. Love the look.</li>
    <li> Loved the color and smells great...immediately after coloring!! No intoxicating fumes!</li>
    <li> Leaves you with a beautiful color with great shimmering. Really ease to use and isn&#x27;t messy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Vidal Sassoon Pro Series hair color! It leaves your hair looks and feels absolutely fabulous after using. Not only is the smell easy to handle unlike other brands it is super easy to apply. I would highly recommend using this wonderful hair dye on your next purchase :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful shade. Great brand name. Great product!</li>
    <li> Out of all hair dye I prefer this one, as my hair takes well to the color and I lose less hair.</li>
    <li> The product is a good product to recommend.&lt;br /&gt;After even just want to buy.</li>
    <li> My mother has never used this brand before but said she really liked it. After using this product her hair looked so much more healthier and surprisingly smoother. The color is great and very vibrant. Her hair did not look fried like some products leave your hair looking</li>
    <li> Beautiful color!  U will just fall in love with your hair!</li>
    <li> I had received this product from BzzAgent as part of a promotion from the brand. I had heard of the Vidal Sassoon London Luxe dye before but never tried it before this campaign.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried other brands of at home before.

The colour pay off is great and it gave me a vibrant brown shade. There&#x27;s nothing negative to say about this product. It delivered as I expected and nothing bad or good stood out. You can find this on sale for $6 at most places or drug stores. Honestly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll find myself purchasing this in the future, it was great to try - but not for me</li>
    <li> Mixed this with a ruby red color and it made a really nice dark cherry color. I love mixing colors and this one turned out really nice. True to box color!</li>
    <li> I was given this product to try for free. First the directions were way to confusing for me. When I finally got it on my hair and waited the time. When it was rinsed out and my hair was just colored there was nothing fancy to it. Other brands I have used gave me highlights and shiny. I am now 1 week out from coloring and the color is fading pretty bad. I am sorry but I couldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
