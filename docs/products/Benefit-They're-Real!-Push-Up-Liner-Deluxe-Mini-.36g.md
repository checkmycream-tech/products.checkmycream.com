      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Really great doing business .</li>
      <li>If not, trying Maybelline Define-A-Line, which has a great consistency and includes a smudging sponge if you want a smokier eye.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner is great.  </li>
      <li>Nice!</li>
      <li>Otherwise it is nice, stays on forever!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there is a cheaper alternative, but this one works great!</li>
      <li>I spend good money on my make-up and I would like it majority of it to be on my face - not</li>
      <li>great staying power, easy to use!  </li>
      <li>The color is rich and when I could get it to glide it is like kajal pencils which is nice, but I cant seem to perfect the &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; technique.  </li>
      <li>I think a lot of it has to do with the packaging, and how to utilize it, but I don&#x27;t want to have to struggle to push the product out and then apply it to my hand so I can dab at it with my own brush.</li>
      <li>I liked it in the beginning</li>
      <li>Initially I loved the product, it made it so easy to do a cat eye.</li>
      <li>The eyeliner skips so easily too, so what doesn&#x27;t fall off your face in clumps leaves a skittish mark like a tire burn.</li>
      <li>I bought this as it was a groundbreaking product by Allure and supposedly very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on very smooth</li>
      <li>I received one of these as a sample, and I loved it so much I quickly ordered one.</li>
      <li>I got this for free with my sephora purchase and I love it!</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t wear it as an every day liner, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>I love love love this product...</li>
      <li>This liner takes a while to get used to applying as it is unlike most others out there.</li>
      <li>i love the application of it</li>
      <li>and I could see better.</li>
      <li>Had they put this into a pot like Nyx tends to do, and included an innovative brush that is a modification of the nozzle on this, then this would have probably gone a lot</li>
      <li>Not my favorite eyeliner by any means.</li>
      <li>Would love to see Benefit put this formula in a much better applicator/packaging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad I ordered the mini size.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>but it clumps up on the top</li>
      <li>Just find yourself an angled eye liner &amp; you&#x27;ll be better off .</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>IF done correctly, the result is great, but I&#x27;ve found the reviews stating that you end up wasting a lot of it pretty accurate.</li>
      <li>; mascara is hands down one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and their foundation is amazing too.</li>
      <li>I could make a pretty good cat eye with it</li>
      <li>Not user friendly at all!</li>
      <li>I thought this was awesome and enjoy using it as a daily eye liner!!!!</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It stays in place and is easy to remove-</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Once you get the hang of it - it&#x27;s easy to apply on your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle easily.</li>
      <li>Smudges fairly easily</li>
      <li>When I tried it at Sephora it was smooth, glided on easily.</li>
      <li>goodness I received the free sample version, because I&#x27;m not in the business of wasting make-up.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it comes out smooth sometimes its chunky.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of this product from my Sephora order.</li>
      <li>Most worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic eyeliner once you get used to it like any liner</li>
      <li>They get props for an innovative delivery system, but considering the hype this product is hugely overrated &amp; very much overpriced .</li>
      <li>Smooth clean</li>
      <li>A bit high maintenance for eyeliner, but yields nice results if you put in the effort.</li>
      <li>I love the way his product is easily applied and looks very fashionable.</li>
      <li>At first glance, it&#x27;s seems like this would be an innovative product.</li>
      <li>This is definitely more work than a simple felt tip liner, but nice to have.</li>
      <li>I bought the full sized tube.  </li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;ve already bought the full sized.  </li>
      <li>I usually love anything I try by Benefit, but this, noooot so much.</li>
      <li>My advance is to always make sure that you prep your eyes especially near the lash line when using this product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty easy to get off and does not smudge.</li>
      <li>it being a gel liner, which I find glides on the best of any liners and gives the most dark solid line.</li>
      <li>I do think that the mini is a better buy than the full size because the short length gives you more control.</li>
      <li>So if you are wanting a bold look - this product will give you that</li>
      <li>/&gt;the angle was great and it was dark which is what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>love that Benefit tries to be so innovative, but this was a huge miss in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I only bought the travel size and not the full!</li>
      <li>First, its really tiny, which is ok because it will fit in any makeup bag.</li>
      <li>it does not turn right away</li>
      <li>All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
      <li>, i feel as though no other eyeliner can beat this liner :)</li>
      <li>but once you get past that it works great.</li>
      <li>which is a huge problem when you are trying to tidy up the mess the applicator made.</li>
      <li>Works like a charm and very gentle to use.</li>
      <li>I probably will use this one up, clean it, and use it in as a brush with a normal pot of gel eyeliner.</li>
      <li>and I am quite sure the store would not take used make-up back even if the receipt had been retained.</li>
      <li>At first it was chunky</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much harder to get that nice &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34; than they make it out to be.</li>
      <li>only reason i don&#x27;t give it a 5 star is because when you click on it to get more of the product out, it clumps a bit.</li>
      <li>You have to get just the right amount of clicks up, otherwise it either clumps up because WAY too much came out all at once, or nothing comes out at all.</li>
      <li>It does get a bit crumbly at the top of the applicators tip due to drying so quickly.</li>
      <li>So pretty much every day.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I think that the silicone really helps the eyeliner glide across your lash line.</li>
      <li>I really like it too much</li>
      <li>It comes with a twist, but if you twist it, the product will not come out until it wants to, no matter how much you do it.</li>
      <li>I truly expected more from benefit.</li>
      <li>I purchased the kat von d tattoo liner and that was much easier since the brush doesn&#x27;t have an angle</li>
      <li>I actually really like this.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re Real Mascara--check out my five star review of the mascara (shameless plug)!&lt;br /&gt;~it</li>
      <li>but it really does I use this for school</li>
      <li>I like having this on hand for times when I want really waterproof eye makeup, but I like having variety, and for someone who just wants a go-to every day liner, I would recommend getting a potted gel and eyeliner brush-</li>
      <li>Makes cat-eye super easy, the tip is rubbery and moveable, the only trick is getting enough product out the end to do whatever type of line you are trying to do.</li>
      <li>Its 8 hours and by half of the day it already smudged on my top part of my eyelid</li>
      <li>it did help me get more symmetrical cat-eyes, which I usually mess up when using a liquid liner.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the one I received is old but the eye makeup is hard to come out and bumpy. When I tried it at Sephora it was smooth, glided on easily. This one is the opposite.</li>
    <li> Received this product and it was LITERALLY half the size of my pinky finger. It didn&#x27;t have enough product in it to use for both eyes so I&#x27;m not sure how well I like/dislike it. Very disappointed because I&#x27;ve heard really great things about it. More disappointed with seller than product</li>
    <li> This literally felt like drawing on my eyes with a small candle. It clumps, it rolls off in little balls, and the applicator gets caked with the product to the point where you have to do a 5 minute scrub of it before you can even use it. The eyeliner skips so easily too, so what doesn&#x27;t fall off your face in clumps leaves a skittish mark like a tire burn.</li>
    <li> The viscosity was far too much for ease of use. No amount of practice or slight of hand could make this product anything more than a high dollar waste of time.</li>
    <li> Smudges fairly easily</li>
    <li> Love it. Very dark and dry. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Size smaller than expected</li>
    <li> This eyeliner goes on really dark and dries quickly. It does get a bit crumbly at the top of the applicators tip due to drying so quickly.</li>
    <li> Really great doing business . I reviewed the product a day after I ordered it. I love it.</li>
    <li> No. This is so weird to apply. I had such high hopes for it, and it ended up being a goopy mess.</li>
    <li> This is the best gel eyeliner around. I use it when I know I&#x27;ll be out all day and I have to have makeup that lasts until past evening. So pretty much every day. It stays in place and is easy to remove-I use coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I like this eyeliner a lot. It gives the perfect winged look. I&#x27;m sure there is a cheaper alternative, but this one works great!</li>
    <li> Got this product for Christmas with the mascara.  The eyeliner did not work after several twists as mentioned in the instructions. I kept twisting and twisting and nothing. I went to a local beauty store and they said keep twisting and then the liner appeared. With the amount of wipes I had to do (when starting applications due to the drying and a clump forming at the tip)  this product only lasted for about 3 days of application.  I truly believe someone must have returned a used liner in the combo box I received as this larger sized product did not last at all.  I like the product but will be looking for something a bit cheaper to replace it.</li>
    <li> I think that as a starter for anyone to do a cat eye, or winged this is not the product for you. So i can understand why some people would give it a bad review.&lt;br /&gt;I used it and it stayed on the entire day. I was concerned since people freaked out about removal but i used baby lotion and it came off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the angle was great and it was dark which is what i was looking for. I wanted a dark pigment and this was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went on creamy and flowed well across my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only reason i don&#x27;t give it a 5 star is because when you click on it to get more of the product out, it clumps a bit. My advance is to always make sure that you prep your eyes especially near the lash line when using this product. I thought this was awesome and enjoy using it as a daily eye liner!!!!</li>
    <li> Initially I loved the product, it made it so easy to do a cat eye. However, the longer I had it, the more annoying it became. It comes with a twist, but if you twist it, the product will not come out until it wants to, no matter how much you do it. What happens is later on, it will all come out and you will have to wipe it off. Half of the product went in the trash because it would not come up when I wanted it to, and when it finally did, instead of being a fine line, it had puffed out and was impossible to apply without another brush. I&#x27;m glad that I only bought the trial size, which was expensive enough.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed after spending $15 on a mini version of the product to receive an empty box.</li>
    <li> hen turing to used it does not turn right away</li>
    <li> Smooth clean lines-- great staying power, easy to use!  The mini samples are easier to handle-- great product!</li>
    <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from my Sephora order. At first glance, it&#x27;s seems like this would be an innovative product. A push-up liner? Nice! Well... not to so nice - after a few tries I was able to get the right look, but that was after a few messy tries. Once you get the hang of it - it&#x27;s easy to apply on your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your eyes do sparkle after using it. So if you are wanting a bold look - this product will give you that look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness I received the free sample version, because I&#x27;m not in the business of wasting make-up. I spend good money on my make-up and I would like it majority of it to be on my face - not my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for professional make-up artist.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Pricey for amount.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this. When it first came out it seemed like a gimmick to me, and the mixed reviews put me off for a while. It actually works though. The actual gel eyeliner is pretty average, but it&#x27;s the shape of the applicator that I love. I think that the silicone really helps the eyeliner glide across your lash line. I do think that the mini is a better buy than the full size because the short length gives you more control. I probably will use this one up, clean it, and use it in as a brush with a normal pot of gel eyeliner. I may buy it again just for compact travel though.</li>
    <li> I guess the benefit (pun marginally intended) to this is that it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, but that&#x27;s about it. I just hated a lot about this liner.&lt;br /&gt;~it doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle easily. You have to push the actually product upwards and then squeeze. I would imagine this makes it very difficult for anyone with arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;~you have to keep pushing it out. A little does NOT go a long way like the fantastic They&#x27;re Real Mascara--check out my five star review of the mascara (shameless plug)!&lt;br /&gt;~it&#x27;s really, really hard to apply. Like, really hard. Had they put this into a pot like Nyx tends to do, and included an innovative brush that is a modification of the nozzle on this, then this would have probably gone a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;~it ends up smudging so much that you may as well use a soft liner and a smudging brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that Benefit tries to be so innovative, but this was a huge miss in my opinion. I think a lot of it has to do with the packaging, and how to utilize it, but I don&#x27;t want to have to struggle to push the product out and then apply it to my hand so I can dab at it with my own brush. Liner is hard to remove as it is, especially if you mess up, so scrubbing at my skin to get rid of it just isn&#x27;t going to be an option. I didn&#x27;t give it a one star rating because it&#x27;s not the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever used, but I wouldn&#x27;t order it. It&#x27;s just not worth it. I&#x27;d suggest waiting until Benefit revamps this or trying out Urban Decays array of liners if you want to up your brand game and stay away from drugstore brands. If not, trying Maybelline Define-A-Line, which has a great consistency and includes a smudging sponge if you want a smokier eye.</li>
    <li> was hard to get out of the pen did&#x27;t care for it</li>
    <li> I got this for free with my sephora purchase and I love it! After a few tries and twisting the bottom a ton I finally got product out. At first it was chunky but once you get past that it works great. I could make a pretty good cat eye with it and it&#x27;s close to my eyelids. I will purchase the bigger size once I finish the small one!</li>
    <li> I love the way his product is easily applied and looks very fashionable. However, by the end of the day (8-10 hours) I would forget that I was wearing the product and would rub my eyes and my eyes would become irritated.</li>
    <li> I just wish the tip was round and not flat. Otherwise it is nice, stays on forever!</li>
    <li> They get props for an innovative delivery system, but considering the hype this product is hugely overrated &amp; very much overpriced . Just find yourself an angled eye liner &amp; you&#x27;ll be better off . I&#x27;d return it if I could that&#x27;s how disappointed i was</li>
    <li> Great product. Works like a charm and very gentle to use.</li>
    <li> I liked it in the beginning but it clumps up on the top and there&#x27;s a lot of waste because once you get a lot of excess squeezed out, you won&#x27;t get the clean line you&#x27;re going for.</li>
    <li> This liner&#x27;s positive attributes are due to it being a gel liner, which I find glides on the best of any liners and gives the most dark solid line. The problem is, it&#x27;s extremely hard to remove, even with makeup remover. I like the soft rubber tip- it did help me get more symmetrical cat-eyes, which I usually mess up when using a liquid liner. The tip has a small hole in it where the product comes out. Each time you use it, there is a little bit of dried product left in it, so you have to &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; it up a notch or two, clean out the old product, and then use fresh product, or else you&#x27;ll get beads of dried product on your eye. I like having this on hand for times when I want really waterproof eye makeup, but I like having variety, and for someone who just wants a go-to every day liner, I would recommend getting a potted gel and eyeliner brush- you&#x27;ll get the same look without the hassle.</li>
    <li> Maybe the tube I had was dried out, but it applied like liquid latex and was very difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> I think every single negative review has not been taught how to apply this. One click covers both your eyes. This is the easiest application and I couldn&#x27;t even get it off my hand with shampoo. It does not budge or smere. I got mine at ulta and I&#x27;ve been looking for an eyeliner for years that doesn&#x27;t sweat off, rub off, etc. I would give this product and their mascara 1000 ⭐️&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and makeup artist....a product junkie! Go ahead and buy this if your a serious makeup user.</li>
    <li> They claim that it doesn&#x27;t smudge or move from where it&#x27;s placed but it really does I use this for school Its 8 hours and by half of the day it already smudged on my top part of my eyelid it&#x27;s not cool but I needed an eyeliner so three stars</li>
    <li> Sometimes it comes out smooth sometimes its chunky.</li>
    <li> The quantity &amp; quality were not what I expected. This liner comes in a very small tube and after only a short time of wearing it, it smears!!!! Definitely not worth the almost $32 that I paid total, including S&amp;H.</li>
    <li> I hate this liner. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviews and videos and it seemed like it would be a really great addition to my makeup. Boy was I wrong. It doesn&#x27;t go on very smooth, I had to fill in a bunch. It is impossible to get off which could be a good thing, BUT the whole point of the slanted liner was to make application easier, though I think it makes it worse.</li>
    <li> dries off at the tip of the pen after a while. hard to get the material out.</li>
    <li> I received one of these as a sample, and I loved it so much I quickly ordered one. The full sized product was not much bigger than my sample which was disappointing, but it goes on easy and lasts all day. Makes cat-eye super easy, the tip is rubbery and moveable, the only trick is getting enough product out the end to do whatever type of line you are trying to do.</li>
    <li> I use too faced primer so it doesn&#x27;t smear for me but it ran out in like 1 week. definitely not worth it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic eyeliner once you get used to it like any liner it&#x27;s easy to apply and stays on all day. Is a little hard to remove but with makeup remover it&#x27;s pretty easy to get off and does not smudge. (Of course it will if you&#x27;re rubbing your eyes constantly but so will any makeup) stays put all day!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 3 only because there might be user error involved. I bought this as it was a groundbreaking product by Allure and supposedly very easy to apply. Wrong! It was a huge mess. I tried a couple of times and I either get nothing or big black blobs.</li>
    <li> Love it, however, my only complaint is I think it&#x27;s consistency is a bit too thick.</li>
    <li> Would not by it again, it is hard to adjust for the correct amount and it always get all over my hands :(&lt;br /&gt;Not buying it again</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  While it is a very interesting approach to liner, the liner leaks badly when capped, and, considering the price, I probably lost half of it to waste.  When I informed the company, while they offered some tips to possibly prevent this from happening (it did not work) I expected, at the very least, to have it replaced.  They suggested that I return it to where I bought it along with a receipt (I did not retain a receipt as I did not expect to have to return make-up) and I am quite sure the store would not take used make-up back even if the receipt had been retained.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get this product at all. I even talked to the girl at Sephora and she went through how she loves it and uses it....still not getting it. Why would you apply a gel (paste) liner with a rubber tip? The liner comes out the middle of the tip when you twist the bottom of the tube and you&#x27;re supposed to spread it across your lash line with the hard rubber tip? Not sure what you were going for here Benefit but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with gel liner, its clumpy and thick and did not glide on smoothly like liquid liners. The color is rich and when I could get it to glide it is like kajal pencils which is nice, but I cant seem to perfect the &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; technique.  The angled tip makes it a bit annoying to get it on the eyelid perfectly with one fell swoop. I purchased the kat von d tattoo liner and that was much easier since the brush doesn&#x27;t have an angle and I could see better.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product... i love the application of it, i feel as though no other eyeliner can beat this liner :)</li>
    <li> I truly expected more from benefit. Their &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real&amp;#34; mascara is hands down one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and their foundation is amazing too. Basically anything I&#x27;ve ever used from them has been absolutely wonderful. This liner was so disappointing. It definitely takes some getting used to. I won&#x27;t wear it as an every day liner, that&#x27;s for sure. You have to get just the right amount of clicks up, otherwise it either clumps up because WAY too much came out all at once, or nothing comes out at all. It&#x27;s so much harder to get that nice &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34; than they make it out to be. I&#x27;m just glad I ordered the mini size. I&#x27;d have been REALLY disappointed if I wasted my money on the large tube. All in all, I would not recommend this, which is hard to say because I just love benefit&#x27;s products so much and it pains me to say one of their products is crap. I&#x27;ll use my CARGO liquid liner that I have.</li>
    <li> Thought it was just a smaller version with the same amount as the bigger version as it specified in the info but wasn&#x27;t the case . My girl still put it to use though just wasn&#x27;t what we expected</li>
    <li> This eyeliner has incredible staying power, but has an absolutely horrible applicator.  It sort of worked well the first couple of times, although a thin line was difficult to achieve.  Then after a week or so, the liner became cakey, dry and difficult to apply, even though I tightened the cap after each use.  Would love to see Benefit put this formula in a much better applicator/packaging.</li>
    <li> It was dry and no liquid would come down in the tip.  Unusable!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the full sized tube.  This product has a poor application system.  You can&#x27;t get a consistent amount of product out, it&#x27;s either not enough, too much or in clumps.  I had to click it probably 20 times to get the gel to start coming out of the applicator.. I thought it was empty!  A lot of the product is wasted in cleaning off the applicator.  It&#x27;s one plus is how well it stays on.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> old, clumpy, like a dry crayon</li>
    <li> Such a small package for $20?</li>
    <li> Used it once, trying to get used to it.</li>
    <li> I really like it too much you try it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I only bought the travel size and not the full! I&#x27;ve used lots of different liquid and gel liners- I wear winged eyes everyday- and this product is the hardest to use! Not user friendly at all! The applicator makes a mess, it&#x27;s clumpy. The eyeliner stays on like permanent marker- which is a huge problem when you are trying to tidy up the mess the applicator made. In order to remove it you have to scrub with soup and water- totally bad for the sensitive skin around your eye. I could&#x27;ve bought almost two of my usual Maybelline eyeliner for the price of this. Steer clear</li>
    <li> Black.  Deep black.  Deepest black.  Midnight black.  .... don&#x27;t even come close to the black this liner is.  Holy crap.  This eyeliner is great.  Rough sweaty night of sex?  Don&#x27;t worry about this liner even moving.  Need to shower, but afraid your liner will wash off?  Shower away because this liner isn&#x27;t moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually have to remove this liner with makeup remover or a thick lotion.  Most worth the price.  I bought the mini to see if I&#x27;d like it.  Well, I&#x27;ve already bought the full sized.  I thought the tip was going to be weird and take some getting used to.  Nope.  Works great.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This liner takes a while to get used to applying as it is unlike most others out there. IF done correctly, the result is great, but I&#x27;ve found the reviews stating that you end up wasting a lot of it pretty accurate. It is also really hard to remove yet it smears easily unless you let it dry before doing anything else. A bit high maintenance for eyeliner, but yields nice results if you put in the effort. This is definitely more work than a simple felt tip liner, but nice to have.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite eyeliner by any means. I usually love anything I try by Benefit, but this, noooot so much. First, its really tiny, which is ok because it will fit in any makeup bag. But, its a twist up, and because it is on an angle the eyeliner itself breaks all the time when you press it to your lid. it also does not allow you to create a thin line.I don&#x27;t feel like I have as much control as I do with other eyeliners. Its like owning an eyeliner with training wheels, only the alignment of the wheels is uneven. I am not a fan.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed because the product is drier than expected.  It pulls somewhat during application and takes practice to use.  I can never use it alone.  For a base, it&#x27;s pretty good when (and if) you get the hang of it.</li>
