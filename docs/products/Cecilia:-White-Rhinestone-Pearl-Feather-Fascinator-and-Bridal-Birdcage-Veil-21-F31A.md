      <li>They came separate and we were able to position the flower wherever we wanted it.</li>
      <li>that I hoped would be more what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>

      <li>Received so many compliments on my wedding day</li>
      <li>The White Rhinestone Pearl Feather that I received is very nice!</li>
      <li>My daughter wore this veil on her special day and looked amazing.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to wear it on my special day!</li>
      <li>The youtube video made it easy to style also.</li>
      <li>The flower (called a \\&quot;fascinator\\&quot; in the bridal industry, I&#x27;m learning) is very nice, and I will definitely wear it.</li>
      <li>the fascinator is beautiful, it looks much better in person, I liked a lot, arrived properly packed and fast, I&#x27;m looking forward to wear it on my special day, I highly recommended, thank you</li>
      <li>Pretty but quite cheap looking.</li>
      <li>but it looks great with your hair up or down</li>
      <li>The birdcage was nice; but the flower was too big.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Whatever you end up doing with the veil portion, the flower/fascinator is nice enough, and</li>
      <li>Other than that its gorgeous.</li>
      <li>This is absolutely beautiful and well made, but the birdcage veil is alot larger than i expected</li>
      <li>It was exactly what she wanted.</li>
      <li>Pretty packaging too, you can really tell they care about the customer experience of opening the veil!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Ordered for my upcoming wedding, looks exactly as shown</li>
      <li>cheap enough, that it&#x27;s still worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>At first I was very sceptical about ordering this veil</li>
      <li>When I first saw the Fascinator I thought it might be a bit too much, but once it came all together on her with the birdcage viel....</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly and youtube had several demostrations on ways to wear this piece</li>
      <li>Product arrived so fast.</li>
      <li>Will need to buy another one that is larger and longer in length; in order for it to fit as it is pictured.  </li>
      <li>birdcage veil, though, wasn&#x27;t really how it&#x27;s pictured.</li>
      <li>It was everything and more than I expected.</li>
      <li>I am excited to wear it on my big day and do recommend.</li>
      <li>In the photo it seems to have a lot more conformity to a human head than the actual piece that showed up in my mailbox.</li>
      <li>Netting is white, and the flower accent is really quite pretty also.</li>
      <li>I have a large head with puffy hair, and I found that if I put the comb towards the back of my head on the right, and allow the veil to come up over top my head from the back right, hanging down around my face, that the veil&#x27;s large size is actually an asset, because it covers my puffy hair without flattening</li>
      <li>The flower/fascinators on the same site on etsy where I purchase the other birdcage veil, pompandplumage.com, are $60-$70, and look similar, so even without the veil, this was a good deal.</li>
      <li>I ordered the white one first then ordered the Ivory one.</li>
      <li>First, you should know that you can iron the veil on low heat to help create the shape you want.  </li>
      <li>Classy!</li>
      <li>Finally, though, after watching the company&#x27;s videos (they give you a piece of paper with a link to some instructional videos) and keeping it near the shower for a few days to get it to calm down, it did actually look good.</li>
      <li>It was super cute and mad my wedding dress pop.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m having a simple summer picnic wedding with a white, cotton halter dress, and the bling might be a bit too much.</li>
      <li>Finally, I received my much awaited - White Rhinestone Pearl Feather Fascinator &amp; Bridal Birdcage.  </li>
      <li>You can thin them out if you like the look in this photo, or you can enjoy a more dramatic headpiece.</li>

<li> Secondly, there are way of the long fluffy ostrich strands than pictured.  </li>
<li> so much!&lt;br /&gt;But, be careful of the rhinestone and pearls on it</li>
<li> The one that I received is small and short.  </li>
<li> When it arrived, though, it was too small to wear without wearing my puffy hairstyle slicked back, which isn&#x27;t how I plan to wear my hair.</li>
<li> The real thing starts out unruly, and popped up in weird places on my head.</li>
<li> I tried calming the thing down with bobby pins, but it still looked unshapely.</li>
<li> I quality is not cheap.</li>
<li> The same fascinator locally is expensive.</li>

    <li> Finally, I received my much awaited - White Rhinestone Pearl Feather Fascinator &amp; Bridal Birdcage.  The Bridal Birdcage was a dissapointment to me.  It is not the same size as it is pictured.  The one that I received is small and short.  Will need to buy another one that is larger and longer in length; in order for it to fit as it is pictured.  The White Rhinestone Pearl Feather that I received is very nice!</li>
    <li> the fascinator is beautiful, it looks much better in person, I liked a lot, arrived properly packed and fast, I&#x27;m looking forward to wear it on my special day, I highly recommended, thank you</li>
    <li> This birdcage veil is nice looking. It does NOT have rhinestones on the veil. That&#x27;s my fault I misread it. Other than that its gorgeous. The same fascinator locally is expensive. This definitely looks the part.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Fascinator for one of my closest friends. Product arrived so fast. And looked amazing! But once it was on, words can not discribe how beautiful it truly is. When I first saw the Fascinator I thought it might be a bit too much, but once it came all together on her with the birdcage viel....it was simple perfection!</li>
    <li> Wore this for my wedding!! Loved it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful hairpiece!!! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it for my wedding!</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous! Well made!</li>
    <li> I bought this to wear to up up coming wedding. I am pleased with what I received. I quality is not cheap.</li>
    <li> I loved this piece for my wedding dat. It brought a simple gown to life. Arrived very quickly and youtube had several demostrations on ways to wear this piece</li>
    <li> The birdcage was nice; but the flower was too big.  It did not look all that elegant.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;You wore a bird on your head&amp;#34; is all I heard on my wedding day. The guests at my wedding loved this headpiece. It was everything and more than I expected. I actually bought two on accident. I ordered the white one first then ordered the Ivory one. I used the ivory one for my civil ceremony and plan on using the white one for my church wedding!</li>
    <li> At first I was very sceptical about ordering this veil but when I saw it I loved it. It is elegant and the fascinator is beautiful. It also arrived within the specified delivery time. I am excited to wear it on my big day and do recommend.</li>
    <li> The hair piece is great, everyone loves it, looks amazing on</li>
    <li> Simply beautiful. Received so many compliments on my wedding day</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter, she looked absolutely gorgeous. They came separate and we were able to position the flower wherever we wanted it.</li>
    <li> Really beautiful. Looks just as advertised. Netting is white, and the flower accent is really quite pretty also. Will need to use bobby pins or something to attach it though.</li>
    <li> Pretty but quite cheap looking.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my upcoming wedding, looks exactly as shown and I cant wait to wear it. The flower I think is actually more beautiful in person.</li>
    <li> It exceeded my expectation</li>
    <li> It looks great! I can&#x27;t wait to wear it on my special day! It has to be assembled but they sent instructions and they have extra instructions online!</li>
    <li> I love this and I cannot wait to wear it for my end of month wedding. Reallly good price it&#x27;s $70-120 at Davids Bridal. This is way better looking.</li>
    <li> I did not like the net on my face after i ordered it. Looks great on some people, but did not look good on me. I ended up taking off the net and using just the flower. It was perfect!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely beautiful and well made, but the birdcage veil is alot larger than i expected and i have to use a lot of bobby pins to achieve the look i desire (how she is wearing it in the photo)</li>
    <li> First, you should know that you can iron the veil on low heat to help create the shape you want.  Secondly, there are way of the long fluffy ostrich strands than pictured.  You can thin them out if you like the look in this photo, or you can enjoy a more dramatic headpiece.</li>
    <li> My daughter wore this veil on her special day and looked amazing. It was exactly what she wanted. Thank You.</li>
    <li> This cage veil is absolutely gorgeous! It was definitely the highlight of my wedding day look. I wore it with my hair up but it looks great with your hair up or down and/ or with long or short hair. Classy!</li>
    <li> I got this to wear to my wedding and it turned out to be just as gorgeous as I&#x27;d hoped! (:&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!&lt;br /&gt;But, be careful of the rhinestone and pearls on it they tend to get stuck on the netting.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again, it was beautiful!</li>
    <li> Just lovely, hope I can make it look like the photo. Lots of compliments when it&#x27;s just shown in the box. Pretty packaging too, you can really tell they care about the customer experience of opening the veil! Thanks!</li>
    <li> It looked great on me and was easy to style.  I loved it.  No complaints.  The youtube video made it easy to style also.</li>
    <li> This fascinator is absolutely gorgeous! I can&#x27;t even stop starring at it!! you won&#x27;t regret it, perfect size as well!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my upcoming wedding. The flower (called a \\&quot;fascinator\\&quot; in the bridal industry, I&#x27;m learning) is very nice, and I will definitely wear it. I may cut the wires with the bling off, but that&#x27;s just me. I&#x27;m having a simple summer picnic wedding with a white, cotton halter dress, and the bling might be a bit too much. I am going to ask my best friend before making this decision. Either way, it&#x27;s a nice piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The birdcage veil, though, wasn&#x27;t really how it&#x27;s pictured. In the photo it seems to have a lot more conformity to a human head than the actual piece that showed up in my mailbox. The real thing starts out unruly, and popped up in weird places on my head.

I have a large head with puffy hair, and I found that if I put the comb towards the back of my head on the right, and allow the veil to come up over top my head from the back right, hanging down around my face, that the veil&#x27;s large size is actually an asset, because it covers my puffy hair without flattening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so worried about the veil that I ordered a separate, handmade birdcage veil from etsy for $30 (see it at pompandplumage.com) that I hoped would be more what I&#x27;m looking for. When it arrived, though, it was too small to wear without wearing my puffy hairstyle slicked back, which isn&#x27;t how I plan to wear my hair. I actually went back to the cheaper veil I bought here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you end up doing with the veil portion, the flower/fascinator is nice enough, and cheap enough, that it&#x27;s still worth the purchase. The flower/fascinators on the same site on etsy where I purchase the other birdcage veil, pompandplumage.com, are $60-$70, and look similar, so even without the veil, this was a good deal.</li>
    <li> Beautiful piece can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> Looked like something from the dollar store. Nothing like the picture!</li>
    <li> It was super cute and mad my wedding dress pop. My theme was peacock feathers and i added peacock feathers to the flower</li>
