      <li>This cologne smells great and most importantly my wife loves it!</li>
      <li>If it smells good on my skin, I will gladly wear it.</li>
      <li>I have to recommend buy at your own risk.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon is offering a great price at just over $40.00 for the large bottle.  </li>
      <li>Not my favorite of the fragrances.</li>
      <li>I like the dedicated &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; fragrance better than the Brit Summer.  </li>
      <li>I love Brit Nd</li>
      <li>I would call this a unisex scent leaning more towards musky.</li>
      <li>, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was for me.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s safe for the office and</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I bought it for myself and fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, just meh.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this smell.</li>
      <li>The entire formula has been revised from the original fragrance and this colonge is perfect for summer.  </li>
      <li>i really enjoyed the light and airy scent.</li>
      <li>It is easy on the eyes and the nose..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to know where reviews on products like these are coming from.</li>
      <li>Great for slappin&#x27; on and wearing to the office though for a daily.</li>
      <li>Light powdery tone.</li>
      <li>And the Free Shipping is a bonus..</li>
      <li>I love Summer, this one is right under those two.</li>
      <li>Something about the clarity of the bottle that makes the fragrance seem more clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>first 20-30 of this are not my favorite.</li>
      <li>The original Brit is still my favorite, however, Brit Summer has some of the same notes - coming out of the gates with cedar, ginger, lime, and rosewood notes then finishing with those familiar vetiver (powdery) notes that made Brit one of a kind.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from mostly women on this particular fragrance.</li>
      <li>However it quickly grew on me and</li>
      <li>I would be more likely to purchase from a department store to make sure the smell lasted longer</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I wanted and came in so quickly!</li>
      <li>Burberry Brit Summer is a light and crisp fragrance that is not overpowering and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say that I would definitely put this one in the top ten list of my favorite colonges.</li>
      <li>It has hints of citrus and the distinct musk Burberry is known for.  </li>
      <li>this one ranks right up there</li>
      <li>/&gt;Truly the scent is a classic and unique.  </li>
      <li>Light scent (fades a little quickly), but very clean and fresh, and still unmistakably a Burberry scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like VERY intense baby powder and some flowery and woody notes.</li>
      <li>I could see this smelling rather soapy if you applied too much!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to making more Burberry fragrance purchases in the future.</li>
      <li>I have had numerous compliments from both fragrances, probably more from Brit than Summer -</li>
      <li>This was my first Burberry fragrance purchase.</li>
      <li>Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t last all that long.</li>
      <li>previously noted, I prefer the original Brit, but I will confess I do like the bottle and packaging of Summer more.  </li>
      <li>The scent remains pretty much all day and night.  </li>
      <li>It is not too strong like a few others which have too strong a smell..good buy..</li>
      <li>The product came as described and seems to be the real deal.  </li>
      <li>For the steal-of-a-deal from Amazon (plus Free Shipping), I definitely recommend adding it to your collection.  </li>
      <li>I SMELL LIKE AN ABSOLUTE BEEF CAKE.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 29 and a female who happens to enjoy wearing fragrances marketed towards males and females.</li>
      <li>I work in the corp world and many females love it when I walk pass them, because it leaves my scent behind...</li>
      <li>It is a little more floral than I am used to, and so the first time or two I put it on</li>
      <li>The cologne smells okay, but smells very much like the original brit in grey and black bottle.  </li>
      <li>Summer follows the older brother, original Brit, in making this a head turner from the opposite sex.  </li>
      <li>I now like it more than what I typically wear.</li>
      <li>I high recommend gentlemen.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend highly.</li>
      <li>Having just finished a bottle Burberry Brit Summer from a large higher end department store, Im not convinced this is the same stuff.</li>
      <li>AND I GOT NO COMPLAINT ABOUT IT.</li>
      <li>Ive worn it twice out of the new bottles and it lasts about an hour and its gone.</li>
      <li>Once you get to the dry down, it smells really nice.</li>
      <li>they take the first and rearrange it with the last..</li>
      <li>I used it couple of times, smell is light and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>wild</li>
      <li>the Wow Factor is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just a more subtle version of the opening I guess.</li>

<li> Just a more subtle version of the opening I guess.</li>
<li> I compared bottles and cant find any differences, but I don&#x27;t remember the original being this thin.</li>
<li> only thing is, it won&#x27;t last on me that long, maybe about 2hrs.  </li>
<li> Other fragrances I use are JPG Le Male Terrible (for men), D&amp;G Light Blue (for women), Armani Code (for men), John Varvatos Vintage (for men and my present favorite), CK Euphoria (for women) and Versace Dreamer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The other bottle I finished was stronger 8 hours later than this is 30 minutes later.</li>
<li> Similar to other comments</li>
<li> , Summer finds a different niche among the \\&quot;summer fragrances\\&quot;, opting not to go down the aquatic or citrus path.  </li>
<li> I googled and googled and finally nailed down on this one.</li>
<li> this is super light (almost impossible to over-apply) and you cannot get tired of wearing it..</li>
<li> I admit, I was a bit nervous buying this perfume from a company that had it at half the price of my local mall.</li>
<li> This is the cologne for you if you wanted something not as harsh as the regular Burberry Brit.</li>
<li> just like i expected it to be...</li>
<li> It smells a little heavy of baby powder and not enough of a floral or citrus smell that I&#x27;d prefer in a summer scent.</li>
<li> you already know what needs to be said burberry still hasnt let me down smells</li>
<li> SO STOP BEING LAZY AND JUST BUY IT.</li>
<li> Softer is not to be construed as being weak.  </li>
<li> The liquid is water thin.</li>
<li> In fact, writing this review some 14 hours after applying Summer, I can still get a (faint) whiff from my shirt.  </li>
<li> you won&#x27;t go wrong if you purchase Burberry Summer 2012 .  </li>
<li> Boy was I wrong though!</li>

    <li> Great buy it drives the women  wild I love all the burberry scents and this is a great one too</li>
    <li> I love this product! The entire formula has been revised from the original fragrance and this colonge is perfect for summer.  I have over 50 bottles of colonge and I can honestly say that I would definitely put this one in the top ten list of my favorite colonges.

    <li> I bought it for myself and fell in love with it.  I work in the corp world and many females love it when I walk pass them, because it leaves my scent behind... only thing is, it won&#x27;t last on me that long, maybe about 2hrs.  I guess everyone is different.&lt;br /&gt;I did buy a second bottle for my father, and He loves it also.&lt;br /&gt;Ya&#x27;ll gotta buy it.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t last all that long. I would be more likely to purchase from a department store to make sure the smell lasted longer</li>
    <li> Not my favorite of the fragrances. It smells a little heavy of baby powder and not enough of a floral or citrus smell that I&#x27;d prefer in a summer scent. I like the dedicated &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; fragrance better than the Brit Summer.  I love Brit Nd I love Summer, this one is right under those two. Great for slappin&#x27; on and wearing to the office though for a daily.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great and most importantly my wife loves it! This scent is very light and pleasant. Burberry this one is a winner!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. It has a pleasant smell, he wears it to work and likes it. It is not too strong like a few others which have too strong a smell..good buy..</li>
    <li> Burberry Brit Summer is a light and crisp fragrance that is not overpowering and lasts all day. Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I ordered this through perfume world on Amazon this stuff is awesome I have tried all of the Burberry and this one ranks right up there I truly would recommend it I will be ordering another just for backup.</li>
    <li> Light scent (fades a little quickly), but very clean and fresh, and still unmistakably a Burberry scent. I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments and questions from people asking what it is.  It is a little more floral than I am used to, and so the first time or two I put it on, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was for me. However it quickly grew on me and I now like it more than what I typically wear. Perfect for spring/summer!</li>
    <li> Burberry Brit summer is a great Scent, good projection, and great longevity and the bottle amazon sent me was made in 2013. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT AND I GOT NO COMPLAINT ABOUT IT. I SMELL LIKE AN ABSOLUTE BEEF CAKE. SO STOP BEING LAZY AND JUST BUY IT.</li>
    <li> Great scent, perfect for Summer !!!  I&#x27;ve  have gotten lots&lt;br /&gt;compliments on the scent and will buy it again !!</li>
    <li> yeah you already know what needs to be said burberry still hasnt let me down smells just like i expected it to be... delivery was ontime</li>
    <li> This is the perfect scent!  It has hints of citrus and the distinct musk Burberry is known for.  This is the cologne for you if you wanted something not as harsh as the regular Burberry Brit.</li>
    <li> I am a Burberry fan.  Currently in my collection, I have five (5) Burberry Fragrances.  The original Brit is still my favorite, however, Brit Summer has some of the same notes - coming out of the gates with cedar, ginger, lime, and rosewood notes then finishing with those familiar vetiver (powdery) notes that made Brit one of a kind.  I will add that Summer is softer.  Softer is not to be construed as being weak.  I will give kudos to Brit Summer with longevity, lasting from 8-10 hours depending on chemistry and activities.  In fact, writing this review some 14 hours after applying Summer, I can still get a (faint) whiff from my shirt.  Not too shabby..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly the scent is a classic and unique.  Similar to other comments, Summer finds a different niche among the \\&quot;summer fragrances\\&quot;, opting not to go down the aquatic or citrus path.  Summer follows the older brother, original Brit, in making this a head turner from the opposite sex.  I have had numerous compliments from both fragrances, probably more from Brit than Summer - the Wow Factor is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As previously noted, I prefer the original Brit, but I will confess I do like the bottle and packaging of Summer more.  Something about the clarity of the bottle that makes the fragrance seem more clean and fresh.  It is easy on the eyes and the nose..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is offering a great price at just over $40.00 for the large bottle.  And the Free Shipping is a bonus..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give Brit Summer 4.5 stars out of 5.  For the steal-of-a-deal from Amazon (plus Free Shipping), I definitely recommend adding it to your collection.  The current day is always a gift - make it count..!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. I was looking for a good one to replace the one he used to use. I googled and googled and finally nailed down on this one. I love the smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s important to know where reviews on products like these are coming from. I&#x27;m 29 and a female who happens to enjoy wearing fragrances marketed towards males and females. If it smells good on my skin, I will gladly wear it. Other fragrances I use are JPG Le Male Terrible (for men), D&amp;G Light Blue (for women), Armani Code (for men), John Varvatos Vintage (for men and my present favorite), CK Euphoria (for women) and Versace Dreamer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first 20-30 of this are not my favorite. It&#x27;s not terrible, just meh. It&#x27;s like VERY intense baby powder and some flowery and woody notes. I would call this a unisex scent leaning more towards musky. Once you get to the dry down, it smells really nice. Light powdery tone. I (think) I can smell the nutmeg and tonka bean. Just a more subtle version of the opening I guess. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from mostly women on this particular fragrance. I think it&#x27;s safe for the office and where ever else you may want to go in it. Not an obtrusive scent at all, but I could see this smelling rather soapy if you applied too much!</li>
    <li> Perfume i received is from 2009. I used it couple of times, smell is light and doesn&#x27;t last long. Only reason why i gave two star rating is because of the price.</li>
    <li> Having just finished a bottle Burberry Brit Summer from a large higher end department store, Im not convinced this is the same stuff. Ive worn it twice out of the new bottles and it lasts about an hour and its gone. The other bottle I finished was stronger 8 hours later than this is 30 minutes later. It might just be me, I cant say without a doubt, but I truly believe this might be an impostor. I compared bottles and cant find any differences, but I don&#x27;t remember the original being this thin. The liquid is water thin. I have to recommend buy at your own risk.</li>
    <li> A must in your collection if you like citrus type colognes.  Not too much musk which is perfect.  The scent remains pretty much all day and night.  I high recommend gentlemen.  The ladies and guys allows pass me a compliment.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this smell. I admit, I was a bit nervous buying this perfume from a company that had it at half the price of my local mall. Boy was I wrong though! It is exactly what I wanted and came in so quickly!</li>
    <li> this is essentially the brit version by inverse order with the ingrdients.. they take the first and rearrange it with the last.. this is super light (almost impossible to over-apply) and you cannot get tired of wearing it..</li>
