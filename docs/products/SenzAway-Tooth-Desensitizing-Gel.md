### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great!  </li>
      <li>I used before whiting my teeth and works great!!</li>
      <li>Works great, can be used on up to 3 or 4 teeth.</li>
      <li>This product does work good.</li>
      <li>so I tried with this item but not that good</li>
      <li>Not as good as the one that was taken off the market</li>
      <li>so I wanted to write a good review.</li>
      <li>Kind of burns when applying.</li>
      <li>So I decided to look for the effective desensitizer myself.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>not that effective as oragel advanced tooth</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>but once more not what was advertised here.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll just keep buying it if I need more.</li>
      <li>its OK did the job...</li>
      <li>I have temperature sensitivity in most of my front teeth.</li>
      <li>After two applications, Senzzzzz (why so many &#x27;z&#x27;s?)</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I use some Orajel for 2 days and it didn&#x27;t work more than 50%</li>
      <li>It is good to be able to find a place to order this as these type of products are not available in stores.</li>
      <li>I like the product because it is efficient, and priced right.</li>
      <li>Only Colgate Pro-Argin toothpaste has been able to provide any relief.</li>
      <li>After the examination, he told me that he would apply some desensitizer on the tooth first to see how it works.</li>
      <li>I felt no difference, except my wallet became lighter for $8+ (which is too much for 1 dose of medicine by the way!)</li>
      <li>What I found out when I got this product is the gel is in a little peel off package, so once you open it you kind of have to use it all right then, but it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
      <li>It might work for others but certainly did nothing for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this if you have some urgent sensitivity and want something to get you by for a week or so until you check out the real issue with your dentist.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think we have a choice really, since the orajel one was discontinued.  </li>
      <li>It really should come on a bottle</li>
      <li>I have problems with very sensitive front teeth.</li>
      <li>It really is one application only.  </li>
      <li>Complete garbage ...</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and had recently had some dental work, so I purchased this hoping for some temporary relief.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Since using this product I have not had any sensitivity to the  teeth involved. It is good to be able to find a place to order this as these type of products are not available in stores.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and had recently had some dental work, so I purchased this hoping for some temporary relief. Unfortunately, this stuff was a complete waste of time. No reduction in pain or sensitivity at all. It might work for others but certainly did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> its OK did the job...but package fooled me...pac big ...but very tiny amount of product inside...a little deceiving.</li>
    <li> Item packaging is not what was advertised; the product appears to be the same brand but once more not what was advertised here. I will apply such today to see if it helps or not</li>
    <li> Still had tooth pain &amp; sensitivity -- but it did help a little.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to break down and go to my dentist.</li>
    <li> This is the tiniest little amount you can imagine.  It really is one application only.  they don&#x27;t tell you that, and note the pix on the page does not show the bottle.  Intentionally deceptive if you ask me.  I won&#x27;t get it again.  Fool me once, shame on you...</li>
    <li> Works great, can be used on up to 3 or 4 teeth. What I found out when I got this product is the gel is in a little peel off package, so once you open it you kind of have to use it all right then, but it&#x27;s cheap.  And it works.  I love it and I&#x27;ll just keep buying it if I need more.</li>
    <li> This product is very, very small!  Also, I think that it will not work over crowns.</li>
    <li> Complete garbage ... Half of a star</li>
    <li> works very well, but small amount...need a larger version</li>
    <li> I have problems with very sensitive front teeth. The product I used before was discontinued so I decided to try this. Works great!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> After two applications, Senzzzzz (why so many &#x27;z&#x27;s?) Away did not alleviate the painful sensitivity I have in two of my teeth.  In fact, I believe the pain is now worse.  I carefully followed the instructions to a tee as well.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Helped a bit but not nearly as good as the product I was using before which has now been discontinued.</li>
    <li> I have temperature sensitivity in most of my front teeth. After applying this product as directed to my front teeth in 2 layers I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in sensitivity. I was very disappointed. I&#x27;ve also tried Crest Sensistop strips with similar poor results. Only Colgate Pro-Argin toothpaste has been able to provide any relief.</li>
    <li> Total wasted investment.  I bought several but 2 were dried up.  I didn&#x27;t contact the seller after determining it didn&#x27;t work anyway.  Bought sensitivity toothpaste instead.</li>
    <li> This little wonder product has been a GOD send.  Took the pain away from my tooth.  Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected.  I used before whiting my teeth and works great!!</li>
    <li> Over all it works okay. It really should come on a bottle so you could use it later on.</li>
    <li> Works for cold and hot sensitivity but not for sweet and salty sensitivity at eroded enamel spots. Kind of burns when applying.</li>
    <li> Ingredients: Salicylic Acid 2%, Acrylates Copolymer; Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice; Aluminum Powder; Anhydrous Citric Acid; Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract; Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane; Caprylyl Glycol; Cocamidopropyl Betaine; D&amp;C Violet No. 2; Edetate Disodium; Ethylhexyl Palmitate; Ethylhexyl Salicylate; Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate; FD&amp;C Blue No. 1; Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract; Fragrance; Glycerin; PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil; PEG-8 / SMDI Copolymer; Petrolatum; Phenoxyethanol; Polyethylene; Potassium C12-13 Alkyl Phosphate; Potassium Sorbate; PPG-26-Buteth-26; Purified Water; Silica; Sodium Benzoate; Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate; Sorbic Acid; Trolamine</li>
    <li> I like the product because it is efficient, and priced right. What I do not like is that it has little amount, but I recommend</li>
    <li> Not as good as the one that was taken off the market but it works. I don&#x27;t think we have a choice really, since the orajel one was discontinued.  I use it for a small cavity in one of my teeth. It covers the cavity and the pain goes away. Does Obama care include dental insurance? That&#x27;s the insurance I need.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim because I have Prime so I can get it ASAP and I also made an appointment with a dentist but they could only take me a week from the day i called. Fortunately, I use some Orajel for 2 days and it didn&#x27;t work more than 50% but it helped tide me over until this came. I use it yesterday and guess what? I went to two different parties last night, lots to drink &amp; eat, hot &amp; cold, and I had NO issues with sensitivity. I just realized how well I was doing this morning when I woke up so I wanted to write a good review. I&#x27;d recommend this if you have some urgent sensitivity and want something to get you by for a week or so until you check out the real issue with your dentist.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. My sensitivity is caused by exposed nerves at the gumline. The SenzAway burned like crazy on application but didn&#x27;t control my sensitivity to heat, cold, sweet.</li>
    <li> not that effective as oragel advanced tooth desensitzer.that product was not available so I tried with this item but not that good</li>
    <li> Maybe this stuff is helpful for somebody, but for me it didn&#x27;t work. I felt no difference, except my wallet became lighter for $8+ (which is too much for 1 dose of medicine by the way!)</li>
    <li> I hate to write this because I had a very high expectation about this product. I went to see a dentist to complain the oversensitivity about one of my teeth recently. After the examination, he told me that he would apply some desensitizer on the tooth first to see how it works. If the sympotom does not go away, I was told that I have to have the root canal treament on this tooth. Actually, the dentist&#x27;s desensitizer was not good. So I decided to look for the effective desensitizer myself. I bought this one. But the result was very disappointing. Although I followed every instuction they listed and applied the gel(too diluted, hard to stick on) on the tooth, my tooth still feels high sensitive when I breath in cold air, drink cold water and even warm water. I think I have to find other ones to try.</li>
    <li> This product does work good.</li>
