      <li>Again, I strongly encourage anyone to buy this wig.</li>
      <li>The color is a beautiful brown with red undertones.</li>
      <li>it is really full and cute.</li>
      <li>I wore it for New Years; everyone loved it and commented a lot on my Facebook pictures...</li>
      <li>it didnt fit my head, not even close.</li>
      <li>Also, the packaging was fantastic.</li>
      <li>and it came with a free stocking cap and socks that i gave to my youngest cousin .</li>
      <li>this wig came right on time and was in lovely condition</li>
      <li>Straight in the trash...DO NOT ORDER!!!</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s very nice considering</li>
      <li>Beautiful, soft, and looks and feels real.</li>
      <li>but i wear it all the time just for fun!</li>
      <li>but doesn&#x27;t look original on me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not very high quality, but it still looks very nice.</li>
      <li>Thanks :)</li>
      <li>Its a cool one</li>
      <li>This is an amazing wig and i definitely recommend!!</li>
      <li>I have not yet actually worn this wig beyond trying it on, but it seems to pretty nice for the price.</li>
      <li>So finding durable, full, real looking wigs is a must.</li>
      <li>the tracks dont show and it has nice curls and was very long.</li>
      <li>Arrived super fast.</li>
      <li>TThis order came in very fast....</li>
      <li>I will be back for more.</li>
      <li>Being my first wig, I am quite fond of it.</li>
      <li>It looks absolutely real!</li>
      <li>Only problem I&#x27;ve had is that my head seems to be a bit big for it to fit nicely, regardless of the adjustable straps.</li>
      <li>I would most definitely recommend this wig</li>
      <li>Pretty wig</li>
      <li>I was expecting a thin, cheap wig for this price; I ended up receiving a high end, full, long, gorgeous wig!!</li>
      <li>Color was right, quality not so much.</li>
      <li>i just recieved this wig in the mail and its so beautiful, just like the picture, only a little too shiny.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>It got shipped to me quite fast.</li>
      <li>I really like the wig</li>
      <li>thanks for the socks and wig cap.</li>
      <li>It also shipped quite fast.</li>
      <li>I guess I was expecting a bit too much from it.</li>
      <li>There are a few sections of it that I can only guess are supposed to be layered, on the outer parts, and I&#x27;m not crazy about the side-swept bangs, but otherwise its good and will work well for my costume for Halloween this year.</li>
      <li>With a little dry shampoo and a good professional cut it can look much more natural and managable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty, and very soft.</li>
      <li>For one says dark brown when I got is was very light.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty and soft but sheds way to much.</li>
      <li>product was nice, ran small and had to return.</li>
      <li>It was, I am returning it asap and accepting the fact that you can&#x27;t get a decent wig for under $80 dollars.</li>
      <li>Its not as nice as some other wigs but for the price it has potential.</li>
      <li>It looks great and not cheap!!!!</li>
      <li>im new to wig buying</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> not dark brown at all.  if it were, I would be keeping it.  very light brown.  other than the color, it is wavy as in the pic.  if you are looking for a wig that&#x27;s dark brown, this one isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> My hair color is dark brown and the wig i got is golden brown. Its a cool one but doesn&#x27;t look original on me. Either i should color the wig or my hair, to match eatch other.  Quality is awesome.</li>
    <li> She is a beauty. Arrived super fast. Perfect packaging. No tamgles. Better than described. She is a bit shiney but a small bit if baby powder or base make up powder does the trick.</li>
    <li> the wig and description iss for a dark brown wig which comes out to a color level 4-the wig i  ordered.  they sent today is labeled level 2 with reddish tones a #33 thats not what the description is for, after waiting for this for so long.  it needs to  returned</li>
    <li> I really like the wig and I am currently trying to get it to use for my Megura cosplay from Disney&#x27;s Hercules. It&#x27;s thinner than it looks but then I only payed a few bucks for it... I love the curls though!</li>
    <li> really realistic wig,,,,a little shiny tho.</li>
    <li> TThis order came in very fast.... I have ordered close to 20 wigs from here and they always make me happy with there products and prices..... The curls on this wig was lovely along with the color..... &amp; the thickness was good to for the price...</li>
    <li> It got shipped to me quite fast. It came in perfect condition with no tangles or knots. Its very pretty but the hair,to me, is a little too shiny</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my boyfriend for his J-Woww costume this Halloween and we were both so impressed with the quality. Really soft and it was packaged so well too. It was supposed to be just a one-time use thing but I&#x27;m considering using it for myself just because of how nice it is.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really pretty, and very soft. I was surprised it had no tangles. It also shipped quite fast. The color is a beautiful brown with red undertones. I just love the wig.</li>
    <li> i own a lot of wigs and this is the worst one i have purchased. it just looks like a jumbled up dead animal. no amount of coming and adjustments could be made to salvage this mess of a wig.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a specific cosplay but i wear it all the time just for fun! This wig looks so natural and beautiful. People actually thought it was my real hair. The hair waves all fall perfectly. This is an amazing wig and i definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> Looks nothing like the picture.</li>
    <li> It looks great and not cheap!!!! Soooooo many people thought it was real!!!!!</li>
    <li> Less than 1 star...You get what you pay for. The color is not as described, it&#x27;s a reddish color, instead of a dark brown. Straight in the trash...DO NOT ORDER!!! EVER!!!</li>
    <li> I thought it would look like other cheaper wigs but after reading others&#x27; about this wig I decided to try and bought it...it was the wonderful gift and everyone thought it was really my hair...I wish it was but its nice I wore it for New Years; everyone loved it and commented a lot on my Facebook pictures...it made me smiled and of course I&#x27;ll buy more!</li>
    <li> it is really full and cute. it look like a real hair and is also thick and long. thanks for the socks and wig cap.</li>
    <li> I had compliments on this one. ITS STUNNING WORTH EVERY DAMN PENNY ! Seriously I used it for halloween costume but I would wear it everyday. Its just amazing the hairstyle and all !</li>
    <li> The wig is VERY VERY small, probably made for a child perhaps? it didnt fit my head, not even close.</li>
    <li> I love this wig. I use it all the time. I have a long purple mohawk, and sometimes, I need to look half way normal. This was perfect! It looks great in photos! I&#x27;d but it again. Came tangle free! I didn&#x27;t find it was too shiny, but like someone else said, use dry shampoo and a wig brush and it will look superb!</li>
    <li> So, I tried this wig and it was too small. I wrote a nice review for the company but did explain that I ended up returning the product due to the small size and unusual shine. The company began sending me emails telling me to remove my feedback and then contacted amazon stating the my review was strictly about the product and didn&#x27;t reflect them as a company. WOW, they were acting like the mob! So here is my review on the company and product. product was nice, ran small and had to return. COMPANY WILL GET CRAZY ON YOU AND HARASSE YOU IF YOU STATE THAT YOU DIDN&#x27;T LIKE THE PRODUCT. isn&#x27;t that what a review is for? to review you experience and product? I&#x27;ll probably get harassed for this again, but I believe in the 1st amendment.</li>
    <li> My sister bought this and she wore it a lot after cutting her hair short. It wasn&#x27;t good, It looks fake and plasticy. I suggest extensions before buying a wig, or spend more on it(:</li>
    <li> It looks absolutely real! Only problem I&#x27;ve had is that my head seems to be a bit big for it to fit nicely, regardless of the adjustable straps. The hair isn&#x27;t as full as the picture, but it&#x27;s soft as sin and absolutely beautiful! LOVE the bangs!</li>
    <li> i just recieved this wig in the mail and its so beautiful, just like the picture, only a little too shiny. just wash it with some dry shampoo and it looks completely natural.</li>
    <li> Not the best ever.... But for he price it can&#x27;t be beat.... And I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist. I would most definitely recommend this wig</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty and soft but sheds way to much. Also the hair net that came with it was ripped so I couldn&#x27;t use it. You also need to have a bigger head to get this wig to fight, I did the wig at the tightest I could do and it was still slipping off. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The wig I ordered came around delivery estimate, along with a wig cap and a cute pair of socks. It&#x27;s not very high quality, but it still looks very nice. Being my first wig, I am quite fond of it.</li>
    <li> I have not yet actually worn this wig beyond trying it on, but it seems to pretty nice for the price. It does shed, but hopefully not too much, and the hair is very soft and silky and it combs through easily enough. There are a few sections of it that I can only guess are supposed to be layered, on the outer parts, and I&#x27;m not crazy about the side-swept bangs, but otherwise its good and will work well for my costume for Halloween this year. The length is nice and the color is just as pictured.</li>
    <li> The hair on this wig is very thin. The picture makes it look thick, but that is all the hair on the wig. There will be no hair on the back of your head. I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Color was right, quality not so much. Extremely thin, extremely false looking. I have extremely thin hair due to alopecia, and my own hair is thicker. I was so excited to receive this, so excited because of the price and reviews but had the sneaking suspicion it was too good to be true. It was, I am returning it asap and accepting the fact that you can&#x27;t get a decent wig for under $80 dollars. The total bummer, I have to now ship this back and wait until they recieve it before I get my refund? I couldn&#x27;t wait to pay them until I recieved their substandard product, so what gives? Now I won&#x27;t have the funds available in time to buy a \\&quot;REAL\\&quot; reputable wig for my event. I have to go half bald. How embarrassing. Do yourselves a favor, DO NOT purchase thiswig, the quality is despicable. Thin, tangled,  shedding nightmare that no one will believe is your real hair. Soon I will be updating with a video review just to save others my heartache! Check back for it soon.</li>
    <li> oh my glob this wig looks so real and very thick and long i order this for a friend and she went crazy and it came with a free stocking cap and socks that i gave to my youngest cousin . the service was awesome and im so going to buy more things from cool2day next week . love them &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Longer than I expected but not really I guess.  Still trying to make it work for me as the picture shows a headband and looks best with a headband but still very nice without it.  I would have liked it to be a #2 as it is a #4.  Overall, I like it very much and reccomend. I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the shipping, the product was exactly as described and beautiful very soft. Put a little silk therapy on the wig and worked it in to stop the minimal tangling. Plenty of compliments and happy smiles from this girl! Thanks :)</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting a bit too much from it. Overall it&#x27;s very nice considering the tracks dont show and it has nice curls and was very long. It came with a wig cap but I didnt get socks as others did. :( It gets awful tangles at the bottom and is super shiny. I also ended up cutting the bangs straight across and trimmed it all around so I could get the style i wanted. Its not as nice as some other wigs but for the price it has potential. With a little dry shampoo and a good professional cut it can look much more natural and managable.</li>
    <li> This wig is absolutely amazing! Since I have Alopecia(I do not have hair), I have to wear wigs on a daily basis... So finding durable, full, real looking wigs is a must. The wig looks great in the picture provided here, but it honestly does it no justice! I was expecting a thin, cheap wig for this price; I ended up receiving a high end, full, long, gorgeous wig!! I am so thrilled that I bought this! This is a wig that I can wear everyday and make it pass as real hair, my boyfriend absolutely loves it. Also, the packaging was fantastic. The wig box itself was encased in another shipping box, which is great. The wig was neatly placed in a netting to keep it from getting tangled. As soon as I opened the box and took the hair out of the net, the wig was ready to be worn! I also received this wig within 2 days, which was a very pleasant surprise. Again, I strongly encourage anyone to buy this wig. I plan on buying a lot more from this store! 5 stars for sure!</li>
    <li> For one says dark brown when I got is was very light. Can tell it is a wig. It had a huge bump on the side which made it look worse also there were no hair combs to hold I place either but i was able to work with it</li>
    <li> Pretty wig but if you brush it it sheds. The bangs are a little hard to deal with.  Over all glad I got this wig for a good price.</li>
    <li> Great wig. Beautiful, soft, and looks and feels real. Great halloween or just a great wig to change your look for fun. arrived on time and in great shape!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about ordering a wig online for so cheap but i can promise you wont be dissapointed in the least this wig came right on time and was in lovely condition im new to wig buying so i dont have a lot to compare it to but they&#x27;re weren&#x27;t any tangles when i got it and came with a hairnet which was a huge plus! I would definitely buy this wig again!</li>
