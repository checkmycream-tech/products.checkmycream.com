      <li>This is amazing.</li>
      <li>I had to buy him one of his own.</li>

      <li>Since then I&#x27;ve been a 3-blade kind of guy.  </li>
      <li>Blade is smoother than fusion proglide,  however vibration handle not as effective.</li>
      <li>Would recommend not for vibration but just because it&#x27;s a nice razor.</li>
      <li>If that strip is some kind of conditioner, it is gone within 2 or 3 days.  </li>

      <li>I originally had the Gillette Fuzion Proglide and it worked great.  </li>

      <li>I enjoying the hydro 5 power, and works amazing with shaving all my facer hairs.</li>
      <li>I must say that it gives an amazingly close shave...much better than Mach3.</li>
      <li>Hydro 5 does seem to be the best disposable I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>After using it for awhile, I must say that it gives the best shave I ever had by a considerable margin.</li>
      <li>Good razor, smooth glide</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent shave, lasts pretty long. I tried this because I wanted to see if the power doo hickey made a difference. I had never used a 5 blade razor before and thought it was kind of silly. After using it for awhile, I must say that it gives the best shave I ever had by a considerable margin. I don&#x27;t know (or care) if it&#x27;s the vibration, the blades, or whatever but this thing gives an excellent shave without scraping. One cartridge lasts me over a week. One battery lasts several months. At a large local discount club they are going for maybe $2.25 per cartridge in volume. Not cheap but comparable to quality disposables. You can make do with something cheaper, but these perform well.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Amazon has better price than grocery store.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if the vibration helps with shaving. It does seem to help with cleaning or maybe it&#x27;s just my imagination.&lt;br /&gt;I use Hydro 5 more that Fusion ProGlide. I get a much better shave. It also takes me less time since I don&#x27;t need to go over the same area twice. I think the blade lasts longer too.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement blades are very affordable. The price of Gillette Fusion blades are ridiculous. That is one big reason I use Hydro more.</li>
    <li> I realize everyone&#x27;s face is different, so here is my experience with the Hydro 5. The 5 blades and the vibrating feature are nice on paper, but it didn&#x27;t offer me any advantage in shaving. I still can&#x27;t use bladed razors on my upper lip because my skin is sensitive in that region. The sharpest/newest razor will tend to drag on the upper lip and cause sensitivity issues, and the same problems occur with the Hydro 5. Instead I use a Phillips Norelco for that region specifically. I can use bladed razors everywhere else on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro 5 seems to clog just as easily as the Schick Quattro. I figured the vibrating feature might jostle some of the hairs loose, but no dice. The Hydro 5 doesn&#x27;t get close to begin with, and after a few swipes it tends to just gloss over the hairs. I have to constantly clear the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What works for me are the inexpensive disposable Gillette Sensor 3 blades. They will easily last a year for me, and not present any problems. I shave on a 1-2 week basis, so that&#x27;s roughly 20 shaves out of each blade. Even brand new, the Schick Hydro 5 did not work as well as a year old Sensor 3 on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 3/5 stars, did not give a close enough shave on my face. I prefer the Gillette Sensor 3 and a Phillips Norelco. The Braun foil shavers don&#x27;t work well on my face either. I think it is because I have thick whiskers that tend to clog up most shaving devices.</li>
    <li> good, comparable to Gillette fusion use no. 2 0r 3 setting.  possible to have a good clean shave, comfortably.</li>
    <li> Already very satisfied with the standard Hydro 5, I ordered the Power Select model on the basis of positive online reviews and, to be honest, because I was tempted by novelty. After two weeks of use, I am very satisfied with the razor. It has provided a notably comfortable and smooth shave. For years, I have preferred Schick products because the blades provide a close shave without irritating my skin or causing in-grown whiskers. Judging from the feel of my face half a day after shaving, the Power Select gives an even closer shave while avoiding any irritation. Shaving is a little faster, not that the standard Hydro 5 is in any measure slow. The product carries the added convenience of using the same blade cartridges as the non-power model.</li>
    <li> I used this razor several minutes ago--I anticipated a clean, good shave...I was dissapointed. I have been shaving for many years...and this blade seems to have cut my face up. I now have cuts on my neck and face. I am an experienced shaver and know how NOT to cut myself. I will NEVER buy Shick again...if you want a good razor buy the Gillete Fusion Glide, I was much happier. This product will go in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Packaging was all torn....looks like refurbished or open item...question quality!</li>
    <li> First shave and I am a new man! The vibration is a &amp;#34;feel gud!&amp;#34; Even the wife loves touching my cheeks again :)</li>
    <li> If you like the Gillete Proglide Power, be sure to try this product.  I would say better then Proglide Power at half the cost. Switch today!</li>
    <li> I thought the blades were great, but this just brings shaving to whole different level.  The practically non-existent irritation from hydro 5 blades is lessened even more with the power handle.  It is a bit more awkward to hold than the standard handle, but it cuts your shaving time down because you really only need to go over each spot once.  The vibration does not prevent you from shaping facial hair in case you were wondering.  The battery is well insulated so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting the entire razor wet.  It is still a \\&quot;hydro\\&quot; product after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside, and it&#x27;s a big one, is that you only get about 15 shaves per battery.  That makes the device expensive to use and wasteful unless you buy a rechargeable battery.</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying too much for the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand and decided to try Schick blades. Schick&#x27;s prices are much more affordable and blades last just as long if not a little longer. I am very pleased with the shaves.</li>
    <li> Good razor for the money and cartridges are cheaper than my old ones. Battery powered vibrating thing doesn&#x27;t do much, BUT it does make the grip noticeably more comfortable to handle. Would recommend not for vibration but just because it&#x27;s a nice razor. Wish it came with its own clip on blade cover so I wasn&#x27;t bothered by throwing it in my travel bag for the time being.</li>
    <li> I thought i would give it a shot to compare it to the Gillette Fusion Power. Good razor, smooth glide but the blades are not as good as Gilette Fusion Power. If you want to save $$ then go with this one but Gilette is definitely better.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  I liked the manual one but the battery assisted one is even better.</li>
    <li> I have used the Gillette Proglide since it came out, and the Mach3 before that. Like others I have become frustrated at the sky-high prices for blade refills that Gillette charges. When I saw Schick had finally come out with a power five-blade razor I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, you can&#x27;t judge a razor until after a few weeks. Any new razor will cut well and it also takes a while for your beard to be trained to the new razor. In almost every way the Schick bests the Gillette. The shave is close and smooth, without the tugging after a couple of weeks. The lubrication strips lasts about 10x longer than the Gillette as well - my experience is that little strip wears out long before the blades do (yet another ploy by Gillette to get users to go through blades sooner). The power offers three levels to select from. My face feels great even after the razor has been used for a couple of weeks. And the handle takes both the five and the cheaper three blade refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that is not quite as good is the trimmer. The heft makes it harder to get under the nose, even with the flip-up lubricating strip out of the way. I still does a good job, but is trickier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best place where the Schick trumps the Gillette is the cost of the refills.  So long Gillette!</li>
    <li> I wish I had know to buy this years ago.  It simply glides over the skin cutting every little hair.  I don&#x27;t have to put any pressure on it to get a close shave for my legs - so no cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s hyping up the Hydro 5 like it was created by god and sent down to earth for man to have the best shave ever. Well, i&#x27;ve come to give you a more honest non-hyped review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the Gillette Fusion Power for 2 years until the Hydro 5. I considered that the best shaver I had ever used (previously using electric shavers and disposable ones). I bought the Shick Hydro 5 (NON POWER VERSION) a month ago, not knowing there was a power version. The powerless version was a great shave, but I have to say honestly that it shaved better about a week into use than at the very beginning. Maybe it was because my face was adjusting to a new razor. For the past 3 weeks, I had been shaving with the Hydro 5 and started getting better at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with the new Hydro 5 Power, I can give a true opinion against the GIllete Fusion power. The blade is obviously the same as the powerless version so no different there. The upsides of having the power version is a MUCH better grip (the powerless version was annoying to use after having the great shape of the Gillette. Hydro 5 power is pretty interesting in the features it comes with. There are 3 power modes; low, normal, and high. In order to cycle through these options, you simply push the power button. Push once for low, twice for medium, 3 times for high, and a fourth time to turn off. There is a small LED light indicator that shows you if you are using low, medium, or high. It also comes with a very user friendly format for battery strength. Green means power is good, red means batteries are dying, and it will flash red to indicate you need to change batteries (Power options will be disabled until fresh batteries are put in). It takes one AAA battery which comes included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about the Shick Hydro 5 (all versions) is the lubricant strip. It&#x27;s the best thing, but also the worst thing about this razor. I love that the lubrication lasts a very long time (easily 2-3x longer than Gillette Fusion). However, the annoying part is that during your first few shaves with a fresh blade, the lubrication will get all over your face, and spread your shaving cream around and get messy.

    <li> I just can say that its really best Razor than Gillette!! While I thought to change my Gillette to Schick it took some time:) but Try and you will really feel that difference!</li>
    <li> This razor is simply the very best that I have ever used.  I have used virtually all of them. Smooth as silk. I just threw away my Gillette Proglide. I received the non power Hydro free from Schick, tried it and I am now a believer. The power handle makes it even smoother. The only problem is, it does not come with one of those plastic storage cases like the other Schicks and Gillettes.</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used the Mach3 and Fusion razors, but they can&#x27;t compare to the incredible shave I got with the Schick Hydro 5 Power select. Using the Gillette, I would start to feel resistance on the blade from just the 5th or 6th shave. With the Hydro 5 I believe I&#x27;m on my 7th or 8th shave and it feels as new as the day I bought the razor. I&#x27;m wondering when this blade will start to wear down, because it&#x27;s shown no signs of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing. I never write reviews on Amazon for health and beauty items. I&#x27;ve done them for CD&#x27;s and electronics, but I was compelled to say something about this razor. Yes, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> This electric vibratory razor appeared gimmicky to me, until I used it. It is the best and smoothest razor I have ever had!</li>
    <li> My GF has confiscated this and uses it to shave her legs and loves it!  I on the other hand did not like it for my face.  I have since gone to a straight razor and like it MUCH better.  The razor itself is sort of nice and cool looking though.</li>
    <li> Gillette&#x27;s refill cartridge prices are out of control. I thought it was finally time to give Schick a try when I saw how relatively inexpensive the blades were, and when I saw that they finally came out with a power (vibrating) version of the Hydro it was time to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is in almost every way better than the Gillette Power Fusion. Cheaper blades, smoother shave, less tug &amp; pull &amp; pluck feeling, better trim cartridge, better hydration gel, thicker handle, etc, etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and its way cheaper to keep refilling than their big brother. Give it a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m going to try putting 3-blade hydro cartridges on this. I think 5 blade cartridges are a little ridiculous, but I do like the power handle - seems to give a smoother shave.</li>
    <li> I had a four-blade, motorized razor which did a pretty good job until the razor cartridge get to be about 2 weeks old (give or take). Then I saw this new 5-blade wonder with multiple settings, and the gadget-monster inside me awoke. WOW. 5 blades to shave with, and the blades are assisted by a three-speed motor (or vibration/agitation) to help prodice a smooth shave. Easy to order, came within the week, easy to charge with a battery and easy to use. Most importantly--YES! It works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the new Schick Hydro 5 for a few weeks now, and I love it! It gives me a close, close, CLOSE shave.  The rubber grips make it easy to hold; although it&#x27;s a bit bulky (almost need a holster for it), but I&#x27;ve never dropped it. I&#x27;m still waiting for the razor cartridge to show wear and need replacing; but, so far, my new shaving gadget works great!</li>
    <li> I liked my three bladed Wilkinson ... a lot! But I tried this on an impulse, and I have to admit ... the improvement is dramatic and definitely worth the transition to the newer technology. A great shave - with or without brush and a lather!</li>
    <li> I had been using Gillette Sensor for over 20 years.  I started with the double blade, then graduating to the sensor 3.  It always produced a great shave with minimal cuts to my face unless I tried to get more uses out of the blades than I should.  Then this razor came out along with Gillette&#x27;s variation.  So, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept is well thought, and it does produce a closer shave than a tri-blade, but it does have some consequences.  I frequently cut myself around the curvatures of my chin, no matter how careful I am.  Fresh blades did not make a difference.  Shaving the sides of my face were fine, but it got dicey around the chin.  I think the overall design and angle of the razor is that of a bad design for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using up my 4 pack of blades and going back to my old Sensor 3.  I get cut less.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item after seeing advertised on TV.  Used it and was very pleased with the variable speed of the razor and sharpness of the blades.  However the battery finally wore out and I replaced it with fresh battery and now razor doesn&#x27;t work.  Thought it might be a bad battery so tried 3 other batteries with same result.  I put in fresh battery and the green light will come on and razor vibrates then just stops.  The on/off switch does not turn the razor on. Its too bad as I just bought replacement blades for it and they are not inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I have been a Gillette user for decades. Not any more. The Schick razor is much, much smoother. The difference between this and Power Fusion is night and day. I&#x27;ll take this one all day long. You can get the refills for this for about half the price of the Gillette. Schick has a great product here.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with battery installation instructions.</li>
    <li> Best razors we have ever used.  The battery operated kind get the closest shave.</li>
    <li> While the razor works as advertised, I will only give it 4 stars due to the lack of a cradle to nest it in when not in use.</li>
    <li> Lots of good things have been written about the H5PS. I also own the Proglide Power and next to it, the H5PS is its equal, if not better. That being the case, why would anyone pay more for the Proglide to get essentially similar results? The gel reservoir certainly lasts longer than the Proglide&#x27;s lubricating strip. The 3 vibrating modes is gimmicky - medium usually does the job. At low you hardly see the benefit and at high, the shaver sounds harsh and like it&#x27;s gonna come apart. Don&#x27;t underestimate the benefit of a good shaving gel though. Pick a good one and you see super results : wet shave King of Shaves Alphagel. Pick a wrong one and you may blame the shaver instead : dry shave Boots (UK) shaving gel.</li>
    <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think the vibrating razor would be helpful but in the end I was very impressed by how well it lifted the hairs and resulted in a smoother shave.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. It basically shave you on its own. I can&#x27;t wait to order more. Nothing but perfect! Great.</li>
    <li> Beautiful razor. Before used Gillette. Once threw an old razor. Only Shic! Shaves very smoothly. Saves time for shaving. Be careful who has problem areas, it is not Gillette, very sharp. Use the adjustment of vibration.</li>
    <li> what can you say its a razor, the price was right and it was worth it. I don&#x27;t use it much but when I do it does the job</li>
    <li> I really like this razor and wanted to get another for Travel and as a backup. It wasn&#x27;t being carried in the stores or pharmacies so I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My new go to razor! As good as the competition for less!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 60 years.  In addition to facial shaving, as an avid cyclist I also shave my legs -  oh yes, I also shave my arms.  I received my Schick Power Select Razor today and my only regret is not switching years sooner from the antiquated Gillette Mach III razor system.  It was fun to finally make it out of the shower sans cuts and I suspect I will go longer between shaves based on how close a shave I got.  Buy one (or more!).</li>
    <li> Another long time Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power user here.  I switched to this, like many, to avoid the price gouging on the Gillette refills.  I must say, this razor shaves even better than the Gillette.  I don&#x27;t think there is any difference in the final shave (one shaves just as close as the other) but the Schick just doesn&#x27;t pull at all!  The Gillette was smooth for maybe 3 or 4 shaves but then started pulling quite a bit after that with just one day&#x27;s growth.  The first day I used the Schick, it was so smooth that it felt like it wasn&#x27;t even working: absolutely no pulling as it glides.  Now a half dozen shaves later, the Schick still shaves just as well and still doesn&#x27;t pull at all.  I&#x27;m impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think part of it has to do with the spacing and rake (angle) of the blades.  Looking at them side by side, the Gillette&#x27;s blades are much closer together.  All 5 blades on the Gillette fit in the space of 4 on the Schick, so the Schick has bigger gaps between the blades and the angle is a little more on the Schick (the Gillette&#x27;s blades are almost parallel to the head).  I think this helps the Schick since with the blades farther apart, it&#x27;s probably more like making 5 individual swipes with a single razor.  The skin guards really seem to work as well because I appear to be getting fewer nicks with the Schick, although part of that might simply be because the Schick doesn&#x27;t pull at the skin as much and glides smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint (and the reason for only 4 stars) is that the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; on the Schick is absolutely useless.  At the highest setting, the Schick has maybe 1/5 the vibration of the Gillette.  If you put the Gillette&#x27;s head in water and turn it on, the Gillette churns up the water and makes ripples.  The Schick doesn&#x27;t make any motion in the water at all.  So bottom line: you&#x27;re probably better off with the non-powered version.  Unless a buzzing sound somehow helps you shave.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I don&#x27;t believe the vibration helps at all with the shave on either model: but on the Gillette, I think the vibration helps dampen the pulling a little by &amp;#34;numbing&amp;#34; the skin a little as it goes.  That&#x27;s the only benefit.  And given the fact that the Schick has far less pull to begin with, you probably don&#x27;t need the power option on the Hydro 5 anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, one fantastic razor, even without considering the price.  But I do think Schick could knock it out of the park (as opposed to just having it clear the fence) if they made the vibration intense enough to actually feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
    <li> It seems to work better than Gillette proglide, it lasts more but also smooths better without cutting. It is also cheaper blades in price but not quality.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive but Not a close shave.</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro 5 Power glides through stubble so effortlessly that it seems to part facial hair before it arrives. The five closely set blades stick to the face, allow downward pressure, and seem to suck bristle up into their sway from below the level of the skin, to give a shaving experience and outcome of Biblical smoothness.  The ability to flip back the top, leaving just a thin bed of steel, makes it easy to trim right up below the nose and around the ears. The gel does give smoothness, but I am not sure I need it. With the top flipped back, the &amp;#34;suspension&amp;#34; too is reduced giving a more responsive shave. And here lies the problem.  The shave is so effortless, and additionally the shaft so thick, that it is very difficult to tell whether the razor is cutting through hair at all. I am bald on top and shave what is left of my hair and rely on the hair-resistance to tell me which parts of the back of my head I have already covered. This is like shaving with a light sabre; it goes through hair like butter so I feel like I am just waving my razor to the wind. [Addendum, after a few days use, I can feel when I am cutting hair]  The vibration feature on this razor is also futuristic. The lower two settings are like my Gillette Mach three Turbo, when it worked, with full and empty batteries. The third, top level feels like the beast is about to take off. The LED&#x27;s are a nice feature too. I was never sure if my Gillette Mach 3s were broken or whether the batteries needed replacing. With this Schick stick I will know, and glow in the dark.  I would recommend it to (1) people with tough bristles (2) people who want a really smooth face (3) People with sensitive skin.  Addendum after having used the razor for 4 months. I am still using the same blade!! Four months with the same blade? Admittedly I have fairly thin hair so that my bristles are no thicker than most people&#x27;s hair. All the same, I am shaving the back and sides of my head 5 times a week. I will treat myselfto a new blade tomorrow but the current one still works.  After 2.5 years it BROKE I can&#x27;t turn the razor off any longer. The the blades last a LONG time on my hair. The razor itself is coated in a porous white plastic that becomes mottled with black mould that can not be cleaned off, or whitened, even using bleach. Despite black mould (which is not nice to look at, but does not affect the performance) and the rather disappointing reliability, I will probably purchase another of these partly because I still have some blades, because they last so long, and because the shave is so good. And I note that the colour of this razor is now blue so the mould may not show up at all.   By the way, I am British so I spell colour and mould like I do.</li>
    <li> Let me start off this review with the Schick hydro groomer razor part. The blades are great and don&#x27;t slice or nick up my face, while delivering a close shave. The Gel Reservoir  is fantastic and I do believe it helps quit a bit. I wish that Schick didn&#x27;t get rid of the blade on the tip of the head that was used for precision cuts. I still have my Schick Hydro sitting around for that. I find it very disappointing that it was replaced with the close shave option. Where you have to flip back the plastic head on the razor, so the blades are closer to your face. I find this a step backwards and not very useful at all. I still believe the blades are great and that is the most important thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now on to the Power trimmer.So i get this thing in the mail and  Im like &amp;#34;Um..ok..um..I dont have facial hair..um..what can I use this for?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;And in this moment, it all became crystal clear to me. I had discovered the power trimmer&#x27;s purpose in my life. MAN- SCAPING!!1 I dont know about you, but I have hair in places, where I dont really want hair. So a press of the button and I was off and buzzin&#x27;(see what I did there? I know..super clever) I have a more expensive electric razor that I dont really want to use in &amp;#34;Parts Unknown&amp;#34; But with the affordable price this device is perfect for that! I was shaving away and had no cut, nicks or blood curdling screams. Just velvety smooth skin! So I would assume it would do the same for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if this was the intention of the power trimmer, when the scientists, engineers , shave specialists(or whatever they are called) had in mind when they were designing this in the &amp;#34;Blade lab&amp;#34; But either way, it works like a champ!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in closing I will say this. The Schick Hydro 5 groomer is a fantastic &amp;#34;full body&amp;#34; hair maintenance&#x27;r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this free from Schick, but it doesnt affect my feelings towards the product!</li>
    <li> Former Gillette fan.  Won&#x27;t switch back.  These are great and the blades last MUCH longer.</li>
    <li> We all know shaving is a hassle. (But, some of these dudes totally get into the whole shaving analyzation thing.) Simply, I like the results. I got a great shave; however, I deduce that the close shave I&#x27;m relishing comes from the mass of the razor weight and number of blades.&lt;br /&gt;Got it for a cheap price thinking - if nothing else - it will break up the monotony of shaving. I&#x27;m pleased. I&#x27;m not sure what necessitates the different power modes or if they are actually necessary. (Don&#x27;t care.) It works well for me and made me look forward to shaving just to try something new. Now, the real question is: Where can I hide it from the wife? If she gets hold of it I&#x27;ll be back to my old boring triple blade.&lt;br /&gt;  One other note: There were only one blade razors available when I started shaving. I wonder if they will have robotic infrared remote control 35 blade razors in ten years?</li>
    <li> The vibration seems to largely be a gimmick (or I just didn&#x27;t notice any effect it had).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a significant improvement over any other 5 blade razor.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have used yet, and it&#x27;s a bit cheaper here than at stores - very satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> I now look forward to shaving because of the Schick Hydro 5. It is comfortable while shaving and makes my face look great. I have a Gillette Power Fusion which produces excellent results but the Schick is even better. The Gillette is a little uncomfortable on the first few strokes but gets better as the shave proceeds. The Schick starts and stays comfortable. IMO the Schick does not look as good as the Gillette but that only proves the adage that beauty is only skin deep - and the Schick is deep on making my skin handsome.</li>
    <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion Power for a couple of years and always viewed the refill blades as quite pricey.  Just bought the Hydro 5, as I was tired of paying the high prices for the Gillette replacement blades.  Personally, I think it is just as good as the Gillette Fusion Power for shaving, with the exception of the trimming blade, as there isn&#x27;t a separate trim blade as found on the Gillette Fusion.  Rather, you flip down a plastic cover on top of the other blades and trim with the shaving razor, which does work alright.  Shave wise: just as good, cost wise; significantly less costly than the Gillette.  Recommendation; Schick Hydro 5 Power.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box with a 10-year old gap in my practicing the art of shaving (i&#x27;ve been using Norelco-type shavers) and i didn&#x27;t cut myself at all, and it also only took a few minutes.  I give credit to the head design of this razor for the lack of cuts, and the blades for the speed.  I played with the vibration feature a bit.  It has three speeds and i can&#x27;t find a use for those that aren&#x27;t the highest one.  I felt like it helped but it could&#x27;ve been a placebo thing: i paid extra for this razor so i WANTED it to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness for me wasn&#x27;t really an issue, i don&#x27;t get shaved as close as the Norelco i was using, but that&#x27;s good for me because of ingrown hair issues.  If i don&#x27;t shave for a day and a half, i can notice the stubble in a mirror at a distance.  I don&#x27;t know how long the blades are supposed to last, but the lubricating strip is given to be an indicator and seemed to be a good approximation, i started noticing tugging as i shaved and looked at the strip.  Unfortunately, and a reason for the one-star ding, that was only after two weeks and i recall cartridges in the past lasting longer.  The problem with such frequency isn&#x27;t the cost; to put things in perspective, the blades are about $3 a piece at the local drugstore.  I can spend more than that at starbucks on a random morning so i don&#x27;t know why so many reviewers are hand-wringing about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other component of the one-star deduction is the edging feature.  Basically, the lubricating strip clicks back.  That&#x27;s it, the whole surface area of the cartridge, including the metal bands on the borders, are still at play.  This means i can&#x27;t edge my sideburns (which i shave off at the glasses-line) entirely because the hair right next to my ear can&#x27;t have blade access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll close with a helpful tip i learned from my dad when he first taught me to shave that worked in my 2-blade razor they bought me back then and works now...to get the gunked up cream and hair out of the gaps between the blades, use a toothbrush.  A few swipes parallel to the blades under running water will knock it right out.  I noticed at least one other reviewer saying it was difficult to clean these 5-bladers.</li>
    <li> I have used 4 and 5 blade razors for several years.  This is as good a razor that I have tried!!!!!</li>
    <li> Like many others, I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products for many years, going back to the original Sensor razor in the 90s when I was in high school.  Through the years, I&#x27;ve gone along for the $$ ride as new Gillette razors come out, having used the Fusion for the past few years.  When Gillette came out with the \\&quot;power\\&quot; Fusion series of battery-operated razors, I laughed and assumed it was just a ploy to get consumers to burn through Duracell batteries (also owned by Gillette).  Getting tired of spending so much per shave, I decided to research Schick&#x27;s competing product and found many positive reviews of the Hydro.  I inadvertently ordered the Hydro power model but decided to keep it when it arrived.  I am blown away buy the ease and smoothness I am getting every day.  The electric pulsation does indeed work.  And as opposed to Gillette&#x27;s power option, the Schick uses the same razor refills regardless.  The lack of the extra blade for trimming/nose area is compensated for by the flipback head.  It took me a couple days to get used to but once I did, it was not an issue at all.  The price is right compared to Fusion, particularly with Subscribe &amp; Save through Amazon, and the shave can&#x27;t be beat.  I&#x27;ve only used it 10 days but so far it&#x27;s still very sharp.  I&#x27;ll update on blade life in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> As a frequent Fusion user I decided to try this razer because it was on sale. I only used it a couple times and it made me bleed everywhere.  Would not reccomend.</li>
    <li> Was a Fusion Pro Glide user but after trying the Hydro I&#x27;m convinced that this gives a much better - closer shave. It lasts longer than the Fusion and the lube strip works great and last longer as well. I use it on the highest power level and like the indicator light - the vibration definitely improves the overall shave. To sum up great razor for about 40% less than the Fusion Pro Glide.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor about 3 months ago. Got tired of paying the high prices for Gillette to pay for their commercials.  Absolutely love this razor. I set up a automatic delivery through Amazon and am now saving money. I shave every day and have had no problems with the blades. The few people that complain getting cut, might need to learn how to shave. I have a very thick beard and after using this razor, smooth, smooth, smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Power for years, but wanted to try the Schick Hydro 5 Power Select Razor because the blades for the Hydro 5 cost significantly less than those for the Fusion Power where I live.  However, I found that the saying \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; applies in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Schick Hydro and the Gillette Fusion have five blades and a vibrating handle.  However, the head of the Schick Hydro is larger than that of the Gillette Fusion (please see my uploaded photo).  I found that the larger head makes it more difficult to navigate the razor in tricky areas like around my sideburns.  Furthermore, the Schick Hydro does not have the additional, single blade on the back which can be used to trim sideburns.  This has required me to keep my Gillette Fusion blade to tidy up in tight places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time that I used the Schick Hydro I thought that the blades were giving a descent shave.  However, by the third use, the razor was irritating my skin, pulling and even nicking in places.  Running my hand over my skin, I can feel stubble even where I ran the Schick Hydro over my skin more than once.  There really is no reason for a razor blade to be dulling by the third use and I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put all of this in perspective, I spend a bit of time on my shaving to try to get good results with any razor that I use.  After showering when the bathroom is still hot and damp, I wash my face using Clinique Liquid Face Wash.  I then use a brush to apply The Body Shop Maca Root Shave Cream.  After shaving I rinse with cold water and apply Nivea Revitalizing Moisturizer.  So it is not as if I tried to use the Schick Hydro on dry, unprepared skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very disappointed in the Schick Hydro 5 Power Razor and wont be using it again.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend the [[ASIN:B000BUW8WM Gillette Fusion Power Razor - 1 Razor, 1 Cartridge And 1 Battery]] instead.</li>
    <li> Terrible razor.  You cannot get a decent shave with this razor.  The vibrating blade doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything except vibrate your hand.  This razor is a gimmick.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this razor after seeing it in the store and being sick of draining my bank account on blades for my Gillette Fusion Proglide Power.  I&#x27;m happy someone finally came along and gave Gillette some competition! I wasn&#x27;t really expecting a better shave from it, but wow, it&#x27;s so much better than the Gillette - less cuts and a much smoother, quicker shave!  I have incredibly thick hair too, which an electric can&#x27;t even touch.  I would always have problems getting under my jaw line with the Gillette, and this thing sailed right through it!  I don&#x27;t have to go over every area 20-30x as I did with the Gillette.  Thank you Schick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I didn&#x27;t realize at first as I was shaving near my nose is that the plastic piece at the top of the razor blade flips back so yoy can get the edge of the blade right up close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wishes for the next version of this would be:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The razor is so thick it&#x27;s hard to grip.  It needs to be designed easier to grip.  The Gillette definitely has an advantage on size and weight.  The Gillette also has stronger vibration.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Make the power on button so that it starts off on high vibration, then decreases.  Or, just have some way of setting the vibration permanently since having to hit the button 3x is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really deserves 4 stars because of these annoyances, but I didn&#x27;t want to deter anyone from buying it since it gives such a great shave.</li>
    <li> The product is awesome. Very smooth shave, minimal razor burn. The one thing I noticed was that the moisture strips wear out soon. Also the company I bought from Pacs and Gary were very quick in shipping and I had excellent service.</li>
    <li> I had been a loyal Gillette user for quite some time, but saw a great deal on Amazon for this razor and decided to give it a try.  The blades are a fraction of the price and work just as well if not better than the Proglide.  My only complaint is that there is no single blade on the back for sideburns and under your nose, which I personally find very convenient.  I keep an old Proglide blade around for those areas.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for many years, I used to buy Schick razors for test and possible replacement option once in a while. For many years Gillette was above its competitor and I do remember only one razor in Schick&#x27;s line that I&#x27;ve used for some time before moving back to Gillette product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Hydro 5 since it was on sale and I decided to give it a try. Now, I&#x27;m more than happy with this razor and not planning to move back to Gillette Fusion for a while (at list till the next Gillette razor release :)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick Hydro 5 Power vs. Gillette Fusion Power:&lt;br /&gt;1) Overall better build quality. Even though it&#x27;s not something to use for many years, I would say that Hydro&#x27;s handle provides better feeling.&lt;br /&gt;2) Three different speeds provide better control over the shaving process and after a few trials I ended up using the second speed and Fusion doesn&#x27;t have such option at all.&lt;br /&gt;3) Over my past experience with Gillette, I&#x27;ve never used an additional \\&quot;trimming\\&quot; blade and do like the fact that Hydro doesn&#x27;t have it, as IMHO it&#x27;s useless.&lt;br /&gt;4) Shaving experience is very comfortable and I haven&#x27;t got any irritation so far (I have sensitive skin and lots of shaving products are just not for me).&lt;br /&gt;5) Another thing to mention is that Schick&#x27;s replacement blades are 30% cheaper than those of Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I highly recommend Schick Hydro 5 Power.</li>
    <li> gave me ...and I am pretty much a Gillette guy when it comes to shaving products.  I grabbed this off the shelf of my local store as I had a try it free coupon [I had used Schick razors in the past and had been disappointed some what]  I really like the 3 power levels tonight I tried it on setting 2 and was pleasantly surprised I also like the fact I can flip back the top to give me a nice precision shave where needed.  For a power razor its a little bulky due to the size of the handle and I didn&#x27;t see a cradle although that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I gave this a spin because I wanted to find a cheaper alternative to the four dollar cartridge Gillette five razor option. I believe this razor is every bit as good as the Gillette for approximately half the price so I will be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t even know what it&#x27;s like when it&#x27;s actually turned on, because i&#x27;ve never tried it like that. I am a female and I used this razor but didnt turn it on because I was scared of electric in water. Even without thd vibrations, this razr gave me a close, smooth, effortless shave for my legs, underarms, and private area with absolutely no knicks, cuts, or razor burns. It glided on my skin effortlessly and my skin has never felt smoother with another razr (:</li>
    <li> i typically buy men&#x27;s razors, because not only are they cheaper but they tend to last longer when they aren&#x27;t pink. this razor is no exception, there is no female equivalent but dollar for dollar there is no better razor at the moment. I wish the refills were cheaper but hey, they will be eventually.</li>
    <li> The best shave I have ever had.  I received the disposable Hydro as a test sample. After an amazing shave, I ordered the power version.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a Gillete Power Fusion for several years and the Hydro could shut the Gillete down.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve, now , used the SAME, blade for over Seven weeks and I&#x27;m still getting the same smooth shave as on day one.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a &amp;#34;Slick Deal&amp;#34; for my fiance, as he has a proclivity towards growing an unruly beard whenever we are apart.  This gets the job done and leaves him silky smooth!</li>
    <li> The product is okay shaves pretty good but it doesn&#x27;t vibrate anymore. I mean I ran this underwater and it died out or something within the first few uses. Wouldn&#x27;t they expect people to use this with water to wash or something? Well the vibration is broken so now it is just a manual razor for me. Don&#x27;t pay extra for the vibration since it might happen to you as well.</li>
    <li> I switched from a Gillette Fusion to this and looked like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre the first couple of times I shaved with it.  I&#x27;m currently trying to decide if the Schick shaves closer and the operator needs to learn how to shave with it, or if it is just incompatible with my face.  I got pulled in by the commercials thinking this was the next great razor, but I&#x27;m not so sure yet.  The cost of blades definitely would make this a cost-effective switch, compared to the Fusion, but if it cuts me to pieces I would rather spend the cash for a less painful shave.</li>
    <li> Its so much quieter and closer shave than the electric razor I had.</li>
    <li> At first I loved it with the 5 blade version and then I switched back to the three blade which I normally use manually...so far with either configuration the neck area and around the Adams Apple seems to be very difficult to deal with. I actually use my new Norelco PT-720 to finish the job. This may require more experimentation....</li>
    <li> I had been using a double-edge safety razor previous to this and redeemed an offer that got me this for free.  My face seemed to really like it, but I didn&#x27;t go buying refills after this was done for.  Instead, I went back to an electric razor as I&#x27;ve had enough with cutting my face up all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been going back and forth between a Gillete Fusion and the Hydro. The Hydro gives me a much better shave and seems to last a tiny bit longer. I barely need to shave but when I do I normally have sensitive skin afterward. After a while I am FORCED to throw out my Fusion razor blades because it hurts so bad. I&#x27;ve been using the Hydro for the past few months and still get a great shave.</li>
    <li> my fussion razor died the schick was cheaper so I&#x27;d give it a try well you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> So as a soldier in the Army I&#x27;ve been shaving nearly everyday for the past 9+ years and have gone through many different razors trying to find one that won&#x27;t irritate my skin after shaving.  I started with the Mach 3 and it seemed to get the job done but after about a few days of using one razor cartridge I started to get a lot of irritation and knicks with the blade.  After a few years I switched to the Fusion Power. (not motorized simply the Power line of Razor cartridges)  I found that the blades did last a little longer but getting a good shave against the grain could only be accomplished within the first 2 uses of the blade after that I was forced to use it with the grain because it would irritate my skin.  Recently switched to the Proglide Power line of Fusion cartridges, and pretty much gained the same result, this time having switched to the vibrating razor body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So first of all the Hydro 5 was attractive to me because I&#x27;m tired of paying 28+ dollars for 8 cartridges of the Fusion Proglide Power.  So now that I have the Hydro 5 I&#x27;m simply amazed.  The best feature on the Razor in my opinion is the skin guards built into each blade.  They stop the razor from knicking as much and from irritating my skin as I shave, to include when I have to shave against the grain on my neck to get all of the hair.  The feel of the blade takes some getting used to as it does barely feel as though the razor is shaving as close.  I get a smooth shave with little to no irritation at all. Also the way that the moisturizor bar clicks backward in order to turn the razor into a trimmer may seem cheap or skeptical at first but I assure you it works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So for all you guys (and gals...no judgement :P ) that have to shave everyday this blade is amazingly smooth and won&#x27;t irritate your skin like other razors will, and at a fraction of the price for what you pay for the Fusion line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smooth shave everytime&lt;br /&gt;Vibrate feature to allow closer shave&lt;br /&gt;skin guard on blades for less knicking and razor burn&lt;br /&gt;Replacements much cheaper than the Fusion line of blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cradle for the blade like the Fusion has to help with storing extra cartridges&lt;br /&gt;razor is a bit more bulky than the Fusion.e to allow closer shave&lt;br /&gt;skin guard on blades for less knicking and razor burn&lt;br /&gt;Replacements much cheaper than the Fusion line of blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cradle for the blade like the Fusion has to help with storing extra cartridges&lt;br /&gt;razor is a bit more bulky than the Fusion.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to try this razor since I have been using Mach3 for many years. I must say that it gives an amazingly close shave...much better than Mach3. It does take a few days for your face to get used to it. The special trimmer feature is a brilliant idea. The only downside is its size. perhaps with time I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
    <li> Great razor, great shave.  Switched over from Gillette, haven&#x27;t looked back since</li>
    <li> Thank you Schick!!! I enjoying the hydro 5 power, and works amazing with shaving all my facer hairs. I try plenty of other products, and let me say that comparing the quality of this product it ranks high my list.</li>
    <li> I have always used Gillette and have always kept up with their latest shavers/blades.  The performance has always been great, but lately with the fusion pro power blades, I could only get a couple weeks max before it became very uncomfortable.  Combining that with the increasing high price of blades made me want to try an alternative.  That was the Hydro 5.  I am flatly amazed.  It gave me a comfortable close shave just like the fusion, it lasted 5+ weeks and it cost 40% less than the fusion.  You owe it to yourself to give this a try because if you have anywhere near the results I got you will be very pleased.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by how good a shave it gave and how well it worked even with a few days growth. The lubricating gel is maybe a bit excessive, but not too bad. We&#x27;ll see how well it holds up over a week or two, but after a week of shaving it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
    <li> I got a coupon in the mail to try this for free (though I don&#x27;t know how).  I was hesitant to try it, since I tried the Gillette Fusion - which also has 5 blades - and found it to be too much and a grating experience.  Since then I&#x27;ve been a 3-blade kind of guy.  I bought this in the store with my coupon yesterday (Saturday) - I hadn&#x27;t shaved since Thursday - I just tried it now (noon on Sunday).  This razor cut through my 3.5 day beard like a katana through tofu - I didn&#x27;t have to go over any area more than once like I do with 3 blade razors, or even the Fusion.  But the best part was I felt absolutely no resistance of the blades against the beard; it felt like I was shaving with a sponge, but the results were undeniable.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the \\&quot;hydro\\&quot; gel strip on it or the vibration or both, but it was quite possibly one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.  We&#x27;ll see how long the blades last - I&#x27;ll update after a week or two to see if the experience stays the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I posted this review the day I first used it, which was February 17th.  I just finally changed the razor cartridge on the Hydro yesterday, Saturday April 6th.  I can&#x27;t believe I got that much mileage out of one razor cartridge.  I have a pretty middle-of-the-road beard; certainly not peach fuzz but I don&#x27;t get a full Grizzly Adams growth either.  I shave 5-6 times a week (because I don&#x27;t shave on weekends unless I have to), so usually with other blades I will need to replace them when they get uncomfortable, which is usually 3 weeks. So to see I got 7 weeks&#x27; GOOD usage out of one cartridge is awesome.  I already went ahead and bought the GI-size cartridge replacement pack from Sam&#x27;s Club - I&#x27;m definitely sold on this razor.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best razor I&#x27;ve used. It shaves effectively without damaging skin. The price is just amazing for such an great razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with nothing but Gillette for 46 years.  After a follicle infection my skin was very sensitive and I could only use a blade one or two times.  I was using a Gillette Pro Fusion.  But it really irratated my skin and obviously the price of blades was insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the Schick Hydro 5 Power really because I was desperate to not have my skin irratation last for 24 hours after shaving.  The Schick is so much better there really is no way to really compare the two.  The shave is much less irratating, the blades last longer before I need to change, the lubricant last much longer and they cost so much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick is simply in a different world, it is that much better.  Particularly if you use Schick Hydro Gel or Nivea Shaving cream.</li>
    <li> To this date, I have used several razors in an attempt to find one that is cheaper, but just as good as the ProGlide razors. I can safely say that my quest has ended. It had been difficult before I started using the Power Select to get a smooth shave of the skin overlying my wind pipe, which isn&#x27;t the case anymore! Smooth shave all over. The shaving experience is wonderful and on par with the ProGlide as is the durability. I&#x27;m ecstatic to have discovered this wonderful razor.</li>
    <li> Works great, I say get it. smooth shave. not too expensive. It&#x27;s worth it becasue it works fine and is cheaoer than the store</li>
    <li> I cuts really close and makes his face very smooth will recommend to freinds and family and strangers also thanks</li>
    <li> I have a heavy beard and razor-burn prone skin, which is a challenging combination.  For the past number of years, I have reluctantly bought Gillette Fusion Proglide Power blades at $20! for 4, or on sale, $32 for 8!  I have resented Gillette every time I did so.  But my days of slavery to Gillette are over.  The Hydro 5 power is a brilliant system.  I get a super close, comfortable shave.  The blades last longer than the Proglide.  I can buy a refill of 8 blades for about $20 here, or for $22 at Walmart.  The flip away top is brilliant, and provides superior edging.  The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; strip lasts and lasts (though it&#x27;s not strictly even necessary).  The blades are quite widely spaced for this type of razor, so rinsability is excellent.  Each refill is a marvel of engineering and design.  Abandon your GFP blades, and go with the excellent Hydro 5!  I know this sounds like I could be on Schick&#x27;s payroll, but I&#x27;m not.  The product is that good.</li>
    <li> Less effort and more comfort with great results. I have a tough beard and sensitive skin, yet I find I get less irritation with this razor because I usually don&#x27;t have to go over the same area repeatedly, and even when I do, it&#x27;s smooth. Smooth to use and smooth results, low effort, low irritation.</li>
    <li> for my heavy beard this actually creates a better shave than without the power feature.  my only complaint with all brands of these new blades is the cost of the cartridges - they should be ashamed of themselves.  i&#x27;ve actually started to go back to my old double edge razor in between using this one (on non business days).</li>
    <li> I had a coupon for the power version of the razor and thought I would give it a try.  I always shave in the shower to get the most comfort, but this thing is not very good.  The blades seemed to rip my hair out as opposed to cutting it.  The vibration did little to change or enhance anything, and the giant 5 blade head makes shaving your upper lip difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two shaves, I am going back to my disposable Bic 2 blade razors.  Sometimes simpler is just better.</li>
    <li> Does a decent job of shaving, once you empty that oil slick of a lubrication reservoir. I found the lubrication TOO slippery, had to apply too much pressure til I finally drained it. But even then, the head on this thing is massive. Too much work to get around the bottom of your nose, shape sideburns, etc.</li>
    <li> Used this razor for about a year.  Changed the batteries twice during that time.  It does have a nice feel to the skin when shaving.  But I found myself having to shave the same area over and over.  Went back to my Mach 3.  What a difference.  Mach 3 shaves closer with less cuts and far less shaving of the same area.</li>
    <li> This razor works really fine! I dont know if the vibration is serving any purpose or it is just the well engineered blades, but the razor shaves really close, with no cuts or nicks and, above all, no razor burn at all (at least for me)</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette proglide power since a long time but after using this for the first time I had a very good feeling. I liked the over-lubrication which made the shave smooth without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Fusion Proglide&lt;br /&gt;--Comfort: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;--Shave: 4/5&lt;br /&gt;--Blade life: 3/5&lt;br /&gt;--Lubrication strip: 2/5&lt;br /&gt;--Price to effectiveness ratio: 2/5&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;OVERALL: 3/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hydro 5&lt;br /&gt;--Comfort: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;--Shave: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;--Blade life: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;--Lubrication strip: 10/5&lt;br /&gt;--Price to effectiveness ratio: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;OVERALL: 5/5</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this product from all the other positive reviews. However, maybe I received a defective razor or something, but when I used it for two weeks, the whole time I did not receive a very smooth shave.  Not only that, but the shave left a lot of stubble hair and I had to shave multiple times.  I have been using gilette 2 blade disposable razors before and those shaved alot better and closer too. So I really wanted to like this product as it was suppose to be a huge step up from disposable razors, but it turned out to be much worst than I had expected. I already bought refill blades and will try them out to see if it was just that I got a defective blade head with my razor or if all these razors are like this.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;ve just never learned how to properly shave after three decades, but I don&#x27;t see how the powered vibrations are doing any better job than the Schick Quattro Titanium I had been and am still using.  Also, the Shick Hydro 5 isn&#x27;t curved like a typical razor and unlike other Schick razors doesn&#x27;t have a hole in the middle/bottom to allow it to properly sit in a razor tray.  I do like the flip-down top, though, for under the nose and sideburns which is the Achilles heal for the Schick Quattro.  If this was the only razor I had, it would be fine, but, you know, old dogs, so I&#x27;ll probably just keep using my old razor.    Update: After writing this review, I decided to try to use it again this morning, to give it one more shot to impress me... uh, it might be sentient, did it know about my so-so review?  The darn thing nicked me on the chin in a spot I&#x27;ve never bled from before.  I feel like knocking it down a star, but I&#x27;m too afraid on what it might do to me next...</li>
    <li> This razor and blades are great ..Beats gillette and half the price....I like the manuel one better......Smaller in size.....But the power one is still great....</li>
    <li> Economical way to get a close shave.. blades last longer and work better than G.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend after her old one broke. I found out through other reviews that women are complaining about the new women razors and starting that the men&#x27;s are much better. Indeed they are, my girlfriend was amazed at how close of a shave this gave her. I really enjoy the close shave as well, her legs are extremely smooth and soft after she uses it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Schick products for 40 years and this is the worst ever.  The design of the blade cartridge is poor.  The cartridge is so wide at the top that it is virtually impossible to shave uder your nose.  The top of the cartridge contacts your nose before the blades get close.&lt;br /&gt;Poor design and I&#x27;d return them if I could.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy unless you&#x27;re using it on something else than your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;9/12/12.  Schick responded that I must not be flipping the top back to shave under my nose.  Wow!  The top flips back and no one told me!  I went through the documentation and I can&#x27;t find any mention of it, but I&#x27;m sure glad Schick chimed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they shaver works great.  My only minor complaint (other than the instructions) is...why have the big top at all?  If that strip is some kind of conditioner, it is gone within 2 or 3 days.  So why have it at all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a vibrating razor.  It&#x27;s smooth and quiet.</li>
    <li> There was a promotion to get this starter kit for $4. I figured I would finally try Schick after using Gillette since the Sensor Excel 2 days. I have to admit it felt awkward because the handle is bulkier. It feels comfortable but maybe too massive for shaving your face. The other issue I have with the handle is the power button is not easy to press because it is quite stiff and the position is on the underside of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridge itself is too cumbersome. It is horrible at the times you want precision. The top of the cartridge protrudes out too far and you are not able to shave directly under your nose. Gillette has no problem doing that and even has a trimmer blade when you turn it over. With Hydro 5 I was disappointed because I couldn&#x27;t reach that area and you also have to eyeball your sideburns to guess how high you should go because the blades are that far away from the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I realized these issues I knew I couldn&#x27;t switch over to Schick. However, the parts of my face that I was able to shave came out smooth in their defense. They might want to figure out a way to make under the nose and sideburns easier to do.</li>
    <li> Honestly It seems to be better than Gillette proglide,  my new favorite for shaving my legs without irritations and so much cheaper</li>
    <li> Then there is almost always a &amp;#34;but&amp;#34;.  In my case, it has little to do with the product itself, but more to do with my curiosity of the safety razors.  Keeping it brief because this is not a review about my Merkur razor, its just a world of difference.  I&#x27;d almost venture to say that in after experimenting with my new razor, disposables just dont cut it anymore...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pun intended.</li>
    <li> So much better than the Gillette Power Fusion. Able to get almost 15 shaves before changing blade.</li>
    <li> Terrible compared to the mach3 I&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how many times I go over facial areas when shaving, there are always large patches of hair remaining&lt;br /&gt;I get a much better shave out of a heavily used mach3 blade than a brand new Schick</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin, and thus have been an electric razor user for at least 20 years. Several times, I have tried to switch back to a blade, and have suffered cuts, irritation, ingrown hairs, bumps, redness, and just general misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Schick Hydro 5 Power razor on special, and figured it was worth a shot... The concept seemed sound, the power blade vibrates thus helping to cut the stubble without tugging and irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was magical! From the very first shaves, I had very little irritation, and only occasional cuts. After my skin had a few days to get used to the razor, it was glorious! This razor and blade is so much faster, cleaner, and closer than my $200 electric razor could ever hope to be! I have been using the Schick Hydro 5 Power for about 9 months now, and I will never go back to electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades last a long time, much longer than the hydrating gel on the blade. I have thick, coarse Italian hair, and I can still get a good shave even on a 3 week old blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This refill also fits the non-power version of my razor, but in my experience, the power makes all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a bonus, the razor and refill costs much less than other power competitors.</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying 4 bucks a blade for the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power cartridges, so I bought this baby for 4 beans.  I said to myself &#x27;how can they screw up a razor?&#x27;.  Well, this razor reminds me why I was so excited when I first got the Proglide Power- it just doesn&#x27;t compare.  I cut myself every time I shaved my face with this, and the although it has 3 stages of power, the max still isn&#x27;t as powerful as Gillette&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I started using this razor for my chest and back, which I tend to keep more smooth and it does a much better job.  It also has a far better lubricating strip than the Proglide Power, and I can shave my chest without shaving cream if necessary.  I imagine if my facial hair was a bit less rough I would have an easier time with it too.  I will continue to use this on my chest and back due to the significant price difference between this and the Proglide, but I will continue to use the Proglide Power for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated the product 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t want to deter people from giving this razor a try - especially if you can get it for ~5 bucks; thats basically the price of 1 Proglide cartridge anyway.</li>
    <li> The gel reservoir leaves a weird slime on your face, and its position above the blades prevents you from shaving certain places, such as right under your nose.</li>
    <li> Great shave. Blade is smoother than fusion proglide,  however vibration handle not as effective. Other than that is better overall</li>
    <li> Love this razor. So did my husband. I had to buy him one of his own. He was a firm believer in his old one. Now I couldn&#x27;t get him to switch back even if I paid him. This razor is fantastic for everyone. If you have anyone else in the house I recommend you buy enough for everyone. Please don&#x27;t put yourself through the misery I did having to rush each morning to be the first to the razor. I lost many early morning snooze chances, but the razor is worth it.</li>
    <li> I could find this type of razor in the store&lt;br /&gt;It is by far the best razor I ever bought at a good price</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a Christmas present and used it for a week. The first few shaves with this razor are nice but for me after the 3rd shave, I would get more and more nicks each time. The razor is quite large in comparison to razor i have used in the past. Also, it seemed to hold more water after I cleaned it each stroke and it would take me longer to shave or I would end up with water all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is nice, the power feature is okay but in the end for the money I will continue to use my non-powered Gillette Mach3 razor. The price is better, the shave is the same and I get fewer nicks and cuts.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this razor and I absolutely love it.  I have never been able to get a really &#x27;baby butt&#x27; smooth shave from 1,2,3,4 and now 5 bladed razors but this razor feels so wonderful while shaving and really does come the closest to a BB shaved face I have ever had.  I do not get nicks or cuts like I used to get on the others (electric rotary razors pull my hair out and swells my face even on a 300 dollar version I purchased) and the vibratory action coupled with the really large head just glides on my face while giving an extremely close shave without the fear I will cut my face again (I have a permanent scar from a 3 bladed dollar store razor I tried last year).  I think I finally know what a woman feels when they use those big headed leg shaving razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this razor and only one really minor negative and that is it doesn&#x27;t include the head protection case that the non power version has.</li>
    <li> The reason why I shave with this razor instead of my Gillette Mach3 Turbo is that the replacement blades are cheaper to replace, compared to those from Gillette. If you wanna consider buying any razor, then think of long-term replacement blades or parts, since those end up taxing your wallet more than the starting kit or items. Just my philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The locking mechanism for the cartridge is weaker than the Mach3 Turbo&#x27;s. It can release the cartridge accidentally if my index finger presses against it too hard. The Mach3 Turbo&#x27;s locking mechanism is very tight that I don&#x27;t ever get that experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle of the Schick Hydro 5 Power Select is more sturdy and tacky in my hands due to the fatter design with soft rubber lines. I have more control during each glide on my face compared to the smaller handle on the Gillete Mach3 Turbo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5-blade cartridge glides easier on my face since I feel less tug and snag. There is a little closer shave than the 3-blade Mach3 cartridge. I only notice the closeness difference when I use a fresh cartridge along with different shaving cream/gel. My best combination is this Schick razor with Edge Shaving Gel or Schick Shaving Gel. Otherwise, having a 5-blade provides a marginal difference vs using a better shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flipping feature on the top of the cartridge helps me align better for my sideburns since it flips away and reduces obstruction of the gel pad. That gel pad actually works pretty well for the first several shaves as it eventually runs out. But I can attest that it does provide some moisturizer to the skin as soon as I finish shaving. Great feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration feature does not give me much of a benefit, according to the hype from commercials highlighting that as a bonus for a better, closer shave. It is the same to me with or without turning it on, although it is more dynamic shaving with a little vibration to remind me of the old electric-shaver days. There are 3 modes with light levels indicating where you are. The 1st mode is the lightest vibration with 1 light line lit up; the 2nd mode is medium with 2 light lines lit up and my preferred level; and the 3rd mode is the strongest available with 3 light lines lit up. There is 1 AA Energizer battery included in this kit and it&#x27;s pretty durable &#x27;til now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I prefer to use the Hydro 5 instead of Mach3 Turbo due to:&lt;br /&gt;a) Cheaper replacement blades&lt;br /&gt;b) More control in each glide&lt;br /&gt;c) Longer lasting moisturize strip&lt;br /&gt;d) Slightly closer shave&lt;br /&gt;e) Less snag &amp; tug</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, who has only one had, the left one, and she&#x27;s always complaining about everything from cameras to razors, not to mention cutting the life out of herself all the time.  She doesn&#x27;t like electric razors!  Anyway, she&#x27;s just beaming now, and hasn&#x27;t cut herself but once, and not as bad as usual.  They don&#x27;t advertise it for lefty&#x27;s, but based on a review by someone else, who complained he couldn&#x27;t get used to the abnormal placement of the handle, I felt it may work well for Kathy, and wallah, it does!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor with a coupon for a few bucks, and I must say I only used it for a few days. It is very bulky in your hand, and the Schick blades tend to cause more irritation than their competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the comfort of a smooth and painless shave, don&#x27;t bother with this item.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a Christmas gift for my son and he loves them. His beard is pretty heavy and these do a nice job.</li>
    <li> Just want to start off saying that I have to use an electric razor to prevent razor burn, but I got a coupon in the mail to try the razor for free so I decided to give it a go.  To put it in the simplest terms... That was a horrible idea.  This razor provided the most painful shave I have ever experienced (literally brought tears to my eyes).  It essentially felt like it was just ripping each of the hairs out of my face.  It&#x27;s usually just minor/slightly uncomfortable pulling when I shave with disposable razors or the mach 3/quatro/etc, but this experience was an entirely different story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline... if you have thick/course facial hair (talking about the individual hairs, not trying to shave a full blown man-beard) don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, you&#x27;ll definitely regret it.  Just stick with a cheaper razor or go with electric.  I suggest the Wahl Li-ion series for my fellow man-beardians.</li>
    <li> Previously the choice between straight razor, electric razor and safety razor was on the basis of the closeness of shave, the difficulty of manipulation of the razor, and the likelihood of cutting yourself.  The addition of a vibration to the razor by both Schick and Gillette has changed the balance of choice.  I am reviewing the Schick, because I have found the Schick blades to cut better, but the rationale applies to power safety razors from both companies.&lt;br /&gt;Whereas the cut of a safety razor depended on the speed of pulling the razor across your face, and the angle of cut with respect to the lie of the hair, the addition of vibration has been such as to remove the speed from being significant.  Instead, the vibration makes the cut, and so it is possible to manipulate the razor direction of cut independently of speed, and so to get a better shave without re-soaping your face and shaving again, and risking irritating your skin in the process.&lt;br /&gt;I gave up electric razors because I did not like the quality of shave.  I have not risked a straight razor because I am too much of a klutz.  But I was unhappy with safety razors until this new wrinkle to them came along.  I find that it has dealt with that one issue I had.  It has taken me a while to learn how to shave again.  Those unnecessary fast motions have gone, and I have the freedom to think how the hair lies, and to re-orient the blade.&lt;br /&gt;In switching to this razor, do not think that this is just a minor modification.  If you want to really benefit from it, you will have to rethink and change how you shave.  I found that really worthwhile.</li>
    <li> Was in drug store on day looking to buy new blades.&lt;br /&gt;Saw the new powerglide 5 it was cheaper and purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;Was happy with the price.&lt;br /&gt;I like the different speeds.&lt;br /&gt;Any new razor takes a few shaves to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the blades are cheaper than proglide replacements&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Gillete&#x27;s shaving gel better still</li>
    <li> This razor is not worth the money it does not give a very close shave at all I would not suggest the purchase.</li>
    <li> I originally had the Gillette Fuzion Proglide and it worked great.  However the price for the replacement blades are ridiculous.  I decided to purchase this instead as the replacement blades are cheap and a family member swears by this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cheaper cost to purchase replacement blades&lt;br /&gt;-Can choose different speeds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-In my opinion, it does not shave smoother than the Fuzion.&lt;br /&gt;-The highest speed on the pulse button is still lower than the one on the Fuzion.  The speed on the Fuzion seems to be &amp;#34;perfect,&amp;#34; which is why I&#x27;m assuming they only have one speed on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, I felt that the Fuzion was better.  But the Schick has a better price point on the replacement blades.  Also, my brother personally prefers the Schick over the Fuzion.  I&#x27;m pretty much at a crossroad because I&#x27;m not sure if I should fork up a lot of cash for some replacement blades on the Fuzion or if I should stick with Schick Hydro simply because it&#x27;s overall cheaper.  I guess I&#x27;m still on a quest to look for something that shaves equally if not better than the Fuzion and has fairly cheap replacement blades.  If anyone has suggestions, feel free to comment on my review.</li>
    <li> I chose this particular razor primarily because of it&#x27;s shape and thicker handle. The standard razor has always felt a little to thin for my large hands to hold. I thought the battery operated function sounded a little gimmicky, but I&#x27;m here to tell you it really produces less drag and a smoother shave. The blades for this razor last much longer than Gillette blades, and are significantly lower cost. Put it all together and you have one sweet razor....</li>
    <li> i wanted to try this out, after seeing a simple commercial and noticing that &amp;#34;hey look its cheeper than Gillette&amp;#34; SO WTH LETS TRY IT. its cheap for the price and i had the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you are coming from Gillette then you will be happy with this. i love it so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why:&lt;br /&gt;1. the blades are amazing and smooth and cut through your hair easily.&lt;br /&gt;2. after my first pass WITH the grain of my hair, i do a second pass AGAINST the grain. and it was still smooth and nice.&lt;br /&gt;3. unlike the gillette strip, the gel on the top of the blade actually DOES work as they say. you WILL feel it the first time you use it. and you will like the feeling much more. its like magic really.&lt;br /&gt;4. the blades also last ALOT longer than i thought they would. thats mostly thanks to the gel. it lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what i didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;1. well the strength of the vibration even on max level isn&#x27;t as strong as the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;2. the color isn&#x27;t as MANLY as the other cool expensive brands. i know I&#x27;m being picky now but hey i had to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thats all really, I&#x27;m not switching back i like this much more. its cheaper, lasts longer, smoother, and feels better. so why would i ever go back?</li>
    <li> To my surprise, it turns out that this Schick gives me a better shave than does Gillette. I  guess I&#x27;ve been using Gillettes all my shaving life, and I guess I thought that you got what you paid for. But this Schick is a better product and at a lower price. No more getting held-up by Gillette&#x27;s exorbitant price for refill cartridges for me.</li>
    <li> i put it on high and slowly slide it along my face. It kinda cuts the whiskers by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is my second one. i fried the first one with lithium ion batteries.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor ever.  They used to make battery operated razors for women but you can&#x27;t find them anymore.  So I bought a men&#x27;s and it works just the same.  Imagine.......Seriously, I haven&#x27;t nicked myself even once using this razor and get the smoothest shaves with no bumps afterward.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. The vibrate is not all that evn w new batteries. But does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Hydro 5 (non-powered) for quite a while now and figured I&#x27;d try out this powered one. Maybe it&#x27;s me, but I notice no difference with comfort while it&#x27;s buzzing vs. off. That being said, I like extra weight from the battery and would probably pick this one up again even if I don&#x27;t intend to use the powered function as the (somewhat gimmicky) Hydro 5 does seem to be the best disposable I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> Thought it was time to upgrade after reading a snipit in a Men&#x27;s Mag.  They even recommended Amazon.  I found the product and read the reviews....Decided to make the purchase.  I have waited a little over a month to report back.  I thought it only fair since I use these reviews to post my findings as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think almost all the reviews were great.....this one won&#x27;t be any different.  I could not be happier with the purchase and the performance of this product.  I upgraded from an old (ancient) 2-blade gillett sensor razor. I had tried multi-blade razors in the past, and did not like how they worked or felt.  Tore up my face a bit.  But after reading the previous reviews decided it was time to give this one a try. The reviews actually helped enhance my experience.  The trick to this razor with the five blades is very light pressure.  Let all those blades do the work.  Total comfort.  I have used it on all four settings including OFF.  I will agree with the guy who said he couldn&#x27;t tell the difference with the settings or off with the closeness of the shave but the weight an balance is great.  My findings exactly, except one addition. Where I found the vibration helps most is if you don&#x27;t shave for a few days, it helps cut through the longer tougher beard more comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a very sensitive face....to the point I have a prescription med to use daily.  The first day I used the razor was one I was not going to shave because of irritation I had from a few previous days.  I used the razor with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.  To the point I let my wife use it to shave her legs and she loved it.  I have since bought one for her as well as my father who has reported back that he loves it.  Says it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side it trimming around the nose and goatee because of the bulk or the blades and the lubristrip and beard puller.  I have been able to manage and get better with each shave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To take the shave to the next level, I tried the line of products from The Art of Shaving.  Badger bristle brush, lemon oil face/beard conditioner and shave cream.  The old school shave stuff with a tricked out razor.  Your face will never be so smooth.  It&#x27;s high end stuff not very cheap but worth the money for special events.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I only bought this because I was in a hurry and it \\&quot;looked cool\\&quot;. The angle DISTANCE between the blades and the lubrication strip is the real issue...Its terrible. I have a pretty \\&quot;normal\\&quot; face but this razor won&#x27;t cut around the corners of my mouth or under my nose, unless I make ridiculous faces and stretch and pull my mouth and nose. I&#x27;ve been shaving for 30 years and have NEVER felt so stupid shaving my face. HORRIBLE DESIGN but I bet it shave legs beautifully.</li>
    <li> I use this when I go to the gym and it works great to have a second razor instead of bringing the one from my house.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. The result is good, and stay a long taime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I d&#x27;int regret to have purchased this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other multi-blade razors, but got tired of paying the outrageous prices for replacement blade cartridges.  Shick&#x27;s blades aren&#x27;t dirt cheap, but they do seem to last longer, and Amazon&#x27;s price (with free shipping) is much easier on the wallet.</li>
    <li> A nice improvement over Mach 3, each cartridge can easily last one month</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, just a little bit of hair over my upper lip and a little under the lower lip and on the chin.  I shave about 3-4 times a week and this is one of my favorite razors.  My face feels very clean and smooth after shaving with this razor and I highly recommend.  I can&#x27;t speak for others who have a a full grown beard or mustaches, but for someone like myself who do light shaving several times a week, this is a very good razor</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette since I started shaving. The last one I used was Fusion. I always felt something was wrong with their blades so I decided to try another brand. Now I&#x27;m using this and it&#x27;s amazing! I find it better than Gillette because it shaves much more smoothly. I don&#x27;t feel any pulls or stings. Maybe it depends on skin or beard type but this works much better for me. Totally recommended!</li>
