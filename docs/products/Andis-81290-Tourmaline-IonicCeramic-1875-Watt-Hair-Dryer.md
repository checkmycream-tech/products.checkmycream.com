### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>but it still works great!</li>
      <li>Great hair dryer!  </li>
      <li>It would be perfect if the handle folder after it retracted the cord.  </li>
      <li>This dryer is awesome.  </li>
      <li>And the retractable cord is great!</li>
      <li>The settings are wonderful and my hair did feel a lot softer after using!</li>
      <li>Great power!</li>
      <li>It was in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>It was also a good price!</li>
      <li>Great feature</li>
      <li>Great if you have shorter hair,</li>
      <li>The heat setting are great too...</li>
      <li>Great dryer and great value.</li>
      <li>Happy wife happy life.</li>
      <li>The dryer is very nice looking and has the retractable cable that works so well.</li>
      <li>and it was amazing!</li>
      <li>It worked so good</li>
      <li>I love this blow dryer, I love that there is a medium setting!!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>The retractable cord is nice but there are two flaws with it, which is why I give the Andis dryer a 4 star rating instead of 5.</li>
      <li>Really nice find.  </li>
      <li>but I imagine the weight would be kind of a pain if you had more to deal with.</li>
      <li>This was HUGE for me, as I like a good air flow.</li>
      <li>But so far, so very good.</li>
      <li>The unit has 2 blower speeds, although I wish it had 3 for more versatility.</li>
      <li>Glad I happened upon this model.</li>
      <li>Just okay.</li>
      <li>It hangs up when it retracts every once in a while, but it keeps the cord out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model has more settings than you can think up reasons for.  </li>
      <li>Another good design worth mentioning is the amount of air intake.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no way I could hold this thing for more than 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Love this hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>I love this hairdryer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because I also bought an Andis traveler blow dryer (RC-2) for the gym (w/ retractable cord and folding handle) that I like better;</li>
      <li>Works pretty good.  </li>
      <li>It lasted me just over 5 years, was super quiet, lightweight and wonderful.  </li>
      <li>The two settings it has for wattage didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference, but it&#x27;s a nice touch.</li>
      <li>the Andis model was 83db vs. 76db from the Conair model with the sound meter set at 8 inches from the side of the dryers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a reason for the option, but I can&#x27;t think of anything it&#x27;s useful for.</li>
      <li>The Andis is one of the better, useful, feature packed hair dryers out there</li>
      <li>I like the option of having cool, warm and hot...</li>
      <li>Since it is a full size blow dryer, I don&#x27;t expect it to be compact and the additional cord is a non-issue for me.</li>
      <li>With this separate switch, it allows the user to select 4 different heat settings (hot &amp; warm at 1200 watts or hot &amp; warm at 1875 watts)</li>
      <li>This hair dryer works super</li>
      <li>On the highest setting it gets very hot and blows a lot of air.  </li>
      <li>Saw this first at a prominent New York hotel and thought &#x27;if it&#x27;s good enough for them ...&#x27;  </li>
      <li>The retractable cord is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t reel the cord all the way in, leaving about 16in left dangling.</li>
      <li>own several Andis pet clipper products</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good retractable cord dryer!</li>
      <li>After looking high and low, I finally decided on the Andis, and I am very happy I did!  </li>
      <li>To add to this, the cool setting adds an additional 2 more heat settings for a total of 6 heat settings.</li>
      <li>Other than not working, when it does decide to work, its pretty good.</li>
      <li>She has only had this for about 3 weeks, but I love the cord storage feature.</li>
      <li>I had used this exact model at a hotel in Dallas and then again in Pensacola</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>I first used this brand of dryer at  Barona Casino hotel.</li>
      <li>(Out of curiosity I used a digital temperature probe set at 3 inches from the nozzel without the concentrator attached and the heat setting set on cool, I measured 110 degrees F. at 1875 watts and 103 degrees F. at 1200 watts and 87 degrees F. using the cool shot button ), unlike the Conair which measured at 92 degrees F. on the cool setting or using the cool shot button which is typical of most hair dryers.</li>
      <li>It blows a LOT of air and dries in a very efficient time.  </li>
      <li>This hair dryer really packs a punch.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Very sturdy and well made.  </li>
      <li>I probably could have gotten just as much bang for my buck with a less-heavy item.</li>
      <li>but it is a bit louder than the Conair model using a db digital sound meter</li>
      <li>The concentrater actually stays on the dryer, which is not what I have experienced in the past.</li>
      <li>You can feel this when you push the cool shot button which totally removes all heat</li>
      <li>Dries my hair fast and isn&#x27;t very loud.</li>
      <li>Cord does not completely retract as I originally thought; it still hangs out of the dryer by about a foot.</li>
      <li>I put it on the high setting and let it go.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to a little more power.</li>
      <li>My only issue is that the cable does not retract all the way, but I rarely travel with it so it doesn&#x27;t affect me often.  </li>
      <li>Live and learn.</li>
      <li>Overall this is a good hair dryer, but it doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as the Conair it replaced.</li>
      <li>it is solid &amp; somewhat heavier than your basic, cheap home brand.</li>
      <li>be it both models will dry your hair quickly and satisfactory.</li>
      <li>Just over another month passed and the dryer began to spark from the inside and was glowing for about 2 minutes, when all of a sudden it stoped glowing and would not blow any hot air.  </li>
      <li>the dryer is super powerful and definitely cut down on drying time.</li>
      <li>The cool setting gives a small, slight amount of heat at 1200 watts and slighly more at 1875 watts.</li>
      <li>It is a professional hairdryer so keep in mind</li>
      <li>Then, just when I&#x27;m ready to toss it in the rubbish, it all of a sudden starts working again??</li>
      <li>However, it does not seems as powerful as other dryers, even at the advertised 1875 watts.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a minor complaint for such a good dryer though.</li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t buy this again or recommend it, but if you don&#x27;t mind a slightly weaker air flow, the ionic silkiness is worth it.</li>
      <li>It shows in the products that they make for the general consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The velocity of airflow without the concentrators attached is nearly the same for both models.</li>
      <li>Andis apparently makes products for beauty salons and barbershops.  </li>
      <li>Weird, but it&#x27;s like it has a mind of its own.</li>
      <li>Both the Conair and the Andis models weigh nearly the same and the ergonomics are virtually the same.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and it does its job and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  </li>
      <li>Space is limited and I needed the cord to retact into handle completely.</li>
      <li>It takes longer for my wife to dry her hair because of it, so we went back to our old brand.</li>
      <li>Takes longer to dry long, thick hair as the air current isn&#x27;t as strong</li>

<li> This is longer than other retractable dryers which are typically 5 feet, however, the first flaw is that the last 15 inches is not designed to retract into the handle because of the non-adjustable rubber stop built onto the cord.</li>
<li> Also, the cord retraction is not perfect; it sometimes  leaves an extra 6 inches out, but I actually find it better than other cord retraction models.</li>
<li> How long it&#x27;ll last?  </li>
<li> This thing is so loud that I have been asked by a family member to find somewhere else to blowdry my hair because it wakes them up in the next room over (and trust me, they are not light sleepers)!  </li>
<li> Too heavy and the cable doesn&#x27;t retract completely.</li>
<li> It is not too loud and not too heavy.</li>
<li> I was so dissapointed to find out how loud and heavy this thing was.  </li>

    <li> Really nice find.  Saw this first at a prominent New York hotel and thought &#x27;if it&#x27;s good enough for them ...&#x27;  We&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  How long it&#x27;ll last?  Who knows.  But so far, so very good.</li>
    <li> The dryer is very nice looking and has the retractable cable that works so well. However, it does not seems as powerful as other dryers, even at the advertised 1875 watts. I&#x27;m used to a little more power.</li>
    <li> Only one advise: Avoid buying this horrible product!&lt;br /&gt;I own several Andis pet clipper products so I trusted the brand. I was wrong!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think Andis manufactured this product. It&#x27;s just a generic, low quality dryer disguised as an Andis.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works super well. I don&#x27;t find the sound level much different from other hair dryers as some have complained. I appreciate all of the different settings (3 heat settings, Hi/Med/Low power, and teh different Wattage rankings). The concentrater actually stays on the dryer, which is not what I have experienced in the past. Also, the cord retraction is not perfect; it sometimes  leaves an extra 6 inches out, but I actually find it better than other cord retraction models. Since it is a full size blow dryer, I don&#x27;t expect it to be compact and the additional cord is a non-issue for me. Glad I happened upon this model.</li>
    <li> Great power! I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the cord return doesn&#x27;t work every time.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer, I love that there is a medium setting!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in September.  When I got it I was so dissapointed to find out how loud and heavy this thing was.  This thing is so loud that I have been asked by a family member to find somewhere else to blowdry my hair because it wakes them up in the next room over (and trust me, they are not light sleepers)!  After a few weeks of use, the dryer cut out while I was half way done drying my hair and would not turn back on for roughly 10 minutes.  I thought perhaps it was a fluke thing.  Nope!  Just over another month passed and the dryer began to spark from the inside and was glowing for about 2 minutes, when all of a sudden it stoped glowing and would not blow any hot air.  This dryer overheats like nothing I have ever seen.  This thing is awful.  I am so dissapointed because the last hairdryer I owned was an Andis as well and it was amazing! It lasted me just over 5 years, was super quiet, lightweight and wonderful.  Do not buy this item!</li>
    <li> Great dryer and great value.</li>
    <li> Wife loves is! Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t retract 100 percent but it&#x27;s no biggie. Happy wife happy life. It was also a good price!</li>
    <li> Sometimes this dryer just refuses to turn on. I&#x27;ve tried it in other electrical outlets in my apartment and it still refuses to work. Then, just when I&#x27;m ready to toss it in the rubbish, it all of a sudden starts working again??? Weird, but it&#x27;s like it has a mind of its own. Other than not working, when it does decide to work, its pretty good.</li>
    <li> This dryer is awesome.  Very sturdy and well made.  Gives my thin hairs lots of volume.  It would be perfect if the handle folder after it retracted the cord.  It&#x27;s a minor complaint for such a good dryer though.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer. It has a lot of power and I like that it has three heat settings as well as two fan settings .  It is not too loud and not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer!  The heating element in my last one finally burned out so I had to look for another.  After looking high and low, I finally decided on the Andis, and I am very happy I did!  On the highest setting it gets very hot and blows a lot of air.  My only issue is that the cable does not retract all the way, but I rarely travel with it so it doesn&#x27;t affect me often.  If you travel a lot, this may be an issue for you.  Otherwise, I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Cord does not completely retract as I originally thought; it still hangs out of the dryer by about a foot. but it still works great!</li>
    <li> Andis apparently makes products for beauty salons and barbershops.  It shows in the products that they make for the general consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this model because of the retractable cord.  Great feature if you don&#x27;t leave your blow dryer on the counter all day and are sick and tired of wrapping five feet of cord around the handle every time you&#x27;re done.  It hangs up when it retracts every once in a while, but it keeps the cord out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model has more settings than you can think up reasons for.  Two power settigs - 1875W and a second lower setting I never use.  Three heat settings and three blower settings.  And then add a cold blower setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because I also bought an Andis traveler blow dryer (RC-2) for the gym (w/ retractable cord and folding handle) that I like better;</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter that is going to college and storage is a big concern.  She has only had this for about 3 weeks, but I love the cord storage feature.</li>
    <li> Wanted same brand and wattage they have on the wall at our Y.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect.  Just what my spouse was looking for.</li>
    <li> Just okay. I probably could have gotten just as much bang for my buck with a less-heavy item. Live and learn.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this product.This blower dryer arbitrarily cuts out during blow drying. It does come back on after a couple of minutes, but I&#x27;ve never had a blow dryer do that before.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer really packs a punch.  I had used this exact model at a hotel in Dallas and then again in Pensacola and I had to buy it.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and it does its job and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  It blows a LOT of air and dries in a very efficient time.  I have long, thick, wavy hair and it usually takes me about 15 minutes to dry.  With this dryer I&#x27;m down to 8 and mid way through I switch to warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent dryer for this price!</li>
    <li> I first used this brand of dryer at  Barona Casino hotel. It worked so good I ordered one as soon as I arrived home. I thought it would be really expensive but it is not.</li>
    <li> This dryer stopped working after six weeks.  Since the 30 day return window was closed, I guess I am stuck with it.  The manufacturer shows a five year warranty but I can not find anywhere to return under warranty.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s louder than I&#x27;m used to but my hair seems smoother.</li>
    <li> I have purchased both, this Andis model 81290 hair dryer and the Conair model 223NP hair dryer for comparison. They both have retractable cords. The Andis is one of the better, useful, feature packed hair dryers out there but it is a bit louder than the Conair model using a db digital sound meter the Andis model was 83db vs. 76db from the Conair model with the sound meter set at 8 inches from the side of the dryers. One of the features not clarified in all of the other reviews of the Andis model is the \\&quot;selectable\\&quot; switch of 1875 watts and 1200 watts which is located on the back of the handle near the bottom. It is mentioned in the features but is not pictured anywhere on the box or amazons photos. With this separate switch, it allows the user to select 4 different heat settings (hot &amp; warm at 1200 watts or hot &amp; warm at 1875 watts) something I have not seen on any other hair dryers. To add to this, the cool setting adds an additional 2 more heat settings for a total of 6 heat settings. The cool setting gives a small, slight amount of heat at 1200 watts and slighly more at 1875 watts. You can feel this when you push the cool shot button which totally removes all heat (Out of curiosity I used a digital temperature probe set at 3 inches from the nozzel without the concentrator attached and the heat setting set on cool, I measured 110 degrees F. at 1875 watts and 103 degrees F. at 1200 watts and 87 degrees F. using the cool shot button ), unlike the Conair which measured at 92 degrees F. on the cool setting or using the cool shot button which is typical of most hair dryers. Another good design worth mentioning is the amount of air intake. There are vents on the sides as well as the back which should prolong the life of the motor from overheating; one of the prone problems of all hair dryers. The back of the air intake is a 2-3/8 inch round opening covered by a removable lint screen. The unit has 2 blower speeds, although I wish it had 3 for more versatility. The velocity of airflow without the concentrators attached is nearly the same for both models. Air temperature at maximum is 198 degrees on the Andis and 162 degrees on the Conair with my digital temperature probe set at 3 inches from the nozzel without the concentrator attached all be it both models will dry your hair quickly and satisfactory. The retractable cord is nice but there are two flaws with it, which is why I give the Andis dryer a 4 star rating instead of 5. The cord length is a geneous 6 feet + 3 inches. This is longer than other retractable dryers which are typically 5 feet, however, the first flaw is that the last 15 inches is not designed to retract into the handle because of the non-adjustable rubber stop built onto the cord. The 2nd flaw is the retracter is not very strong which will require you to help feed the cord all the way to its non-adjustable stop. The Conair model also has the retractable cord which requires some help but has a bit stronger retracter than the Andis model and is less troublesome. The dryer does come with a generous 5 year warranty compared to the Conair model 223NP hair dryer which is only 3 years. Both the Conair and the Andis models weigh nearly the same and the ergonomics are virtually the same. My favorate between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design &amp; feature advantages it has over the Conair which I gave 3.5 stars (see my separate review of the Conair).</li>
    <li> Too heavy and the cable doesn&#x27;t retract completely. Otherwise it works well.</li>
    <li> Solid, albeit heavy. Great if you have shorter hair, but I imagine the weight would be kind of a pain if you had more to deal with. My wife loves it, though! It&#x27;s hard to find a good retractable cord dryer!</li>
    <li> The settings are wonderful and my hair did feel a lot softer after using! The heat setting are great too... I like the option of having cool, warm and hot... the dryer is super powerful and definitely cut down on drying time. And the retractable cord is great! I would definitely recommend this blow dryer to a friend!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a damaged box item. It was in perfect condition. It is a professional hairdryer so keep in mind it is solid &amp; somewhat heavier than your basic, cheap home brand.</li>
    <li> The cord doesn&#x27;t wind all the way up about a foot of cord is left dangling.  Also, the cord sticks while winding which makes it a pain and very annoying.  I would have purchased the same blower I had before if I knew all the issues I would have.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good.  I just wish it was a little hotter.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product for its retractable cord and this did not work. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> Dries my hair fast and isn&#x27;t very loud. Absolutely love it! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even plug in the hairdryer and try it because it was WAY too heavy. There&#x27;s no way I could hold this thing for more than 1 minute.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my &amp;#34;Conair Infinity Pro&amp;#34; hairdryer. What attracted me to this Andis was the &amp;#34;salon grade&amp;#34; and the ionic/ceramic attributes. Overall this is a good hair dryer, but it doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as the Conair it replaced. This was HUGE for me, as I like a good air flow. It takes longer for my wife to dry her hair because of it, so we went back to our old brand. It does, however, leave your hair &amp;#34;silkier&amp;#34; which was a surprise to me. I didn&#x27;t think an ionic dryer could do that, but it does. The two settings it has for wattage didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference, but it&#x27;s a nice touch. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a reason for the option, but I can&#x27;t think of anything it&#x27;s useful for. I put it on the high setting and let it go. The retractable cord is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t reel the cord all the way in, leaving about 16in left dangling. After a few weeks of use, it reels in even less, now leaving about 20 or so inches hanging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Silky hair, somewhat retractable cord, two wattage settings (that I&#x27;ll prob never use).&lt;br /&gt;Con: Takes longer to dry long, thick hair as the air current isn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again or recommend it, but if you don&#x27;t mind a slightly weaker air flow, the ionic silkiness is worth it.</li>
    <li> Cord has unmovable stop on it. Space is limited and I needed the cord to retact into handle completely.</li>
