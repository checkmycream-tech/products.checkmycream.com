<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this product for $1.89 her on amazon. It was okay.... for one dollar.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! Works perfect for me. My only complaint is I wish more of each concealer came in the palette or you could order only the colors you use and needed.</li>
    <li> super cheap and works well!</li>
    <li> I work as a makeup artist doing makeup for bridal events and photo shoots....I usually use CAO cosmetics, but thought I would give this a shot. The Concealer/foundation is a cream foundation, it has the same texture and coverage as CAO.  As with any cream foundation/concealer pallet, tools are VERY important.....I ALWAYS use a makeup brush......it worked perfectly.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this for full face coverage, since it is very heavy,  all cream foundation is.  My only complaint is that I wish the pallet contained at least 1 darker foundation/concealer in order to use on a wider variety of skin tones, and for contouring.  I give this 5 stars due to the price and the coverage.  I would definately recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great product with a great price</li>
    <li> I chose this contour pallet because of the large selection of colors, which are true to photo and apply true to their color in the pots. However, the texture of the cream is very solid, making it time-consuming and challenging to apply and blend. I wish I could give this 3.5 stars, as I am mostly satisfied with the product, however the application difficulties mean I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Just really big that&#x27;s the only bad thing i can say however it arrived in perfect condition and arrived on time i use it a lot and it seems like its going to last a very long time and that&#x27;s coming from someone who uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> This item is ok on my skin covers dark circles and scars. But after a little while it goes dry and makes my skin look dry and as if its pealing. I do moist my skin before applying. Just maybe I need a different makeup moist ..</li>
    <li> the color pigments are good &amp; go on creamy. I bought the 4 quads (in 3 different shades) from coastal scents but having all the colors on one palate looks a lot more professional.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It shipped SUPER fast and I was very impressed on what I received. The colors are plenty and vibrant. I can create any look I want which is great for an up and coming make-up artist like me. Although It does cake up a little in certain areas, if not careful, this is still a great product, in which I would order again.</li>
    <li> I finally found a product that matches my skin type almond color but dark marks on face the concealer is perfect thank you</li>
    <li> My granddaughter found a bargin. This set is too good to be true. Can&#x27;t find this value and quality anywhere.</li>
    <li> Love this Shany cream foundations.  Lots of colors so I get a great match with my skin or go darker to contour or lighter to highlight.  I apply with my finger to my face.  goes on smooth.  I apply powder onto of the foundation with a stippling brush to apply all over my face and even out.  I&#x27;d purchase this product gain. My skin is normal and fair.  I do have an occasional blemish and foundation does excellent job of covering.</li>
    <li> A bit much for daily use, but would be fine for a night out.  Quality is better than expected.</li>
    <li> Nice product but I got a concealer from here for less than $5 and it had all of these colors plus darkers one. The dark shades appear to be dark but they&#x27;re not light when applying. I wish I would have stayed with my first mind and ordered the cheaper one. The only difference is the shipping,  purchasing that product was a two-three week wait whereas this one was a week</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Was delivered in only a few days. I&#x27;m very happy with my item.</li>
    <li> Great for contouring and highlighting</li>
    <li> This is another Shany product I purchased. I use 3-4 of the colors and I have light to medium skin. I am Shany&#x27;s newest fan!!!</li>
    <li> product is a bit thick...but I love the variety...nice pallet</li>
    <li> Love it totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very creamy great for contouring.very large</li>
    <li> It is exactly what it says it is.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter. She was thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for contouring, shany makesgood products. I like the finish and its easy on the pocket book. Product arrived fast.</li>
    <li> The person who received the gift really enjoys it.  She loves the colors and the amount of products in the box. Happy I bought as gift.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially for the price. A full palette, you can mix your own if you still can&#x27;t find a match. It&#x27;s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;If you can GET to the product. The case they&#x27;re in is absolutely murder on my hands every single time I open it. I&#x27;ve considered breaking the latch on it just so that I can open it without cutting up the tips of my fingers every time. I would say leave it open but the product would dry out. All in all great foundation and concealer, HORRIBLE time trying to get it open. If you can find something else around the same price I&#x27;d suggest you get it instead. Doesn&#x27;t matter how great the inside is if you can&#x27;t get to it.</li>
    <li> Awful product don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Very good product! I was expecting it to have a heavier consistency considering it says camouflage concealer, but overall it&#x27;s a good quality product.  Blends very well!!</li>
    <li> I Was looking for a concealer palette to use for contouring &amp; to cover dark circles. These reviews must be fake this product is terrible. Check out my video review [...]</li>
    <li> Was going to try until realized reviews were fake! Now i will not ever buy this brand! Makes me wonder how cheap these items are????</li>
    <li> Wife speaking. This is the best makeup !! you can get as much coverage as you want and it stays looking the same way all day long. I use a sponge and dab a little water on it and then I use two colors to match my skin tones and it looks great !! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> These worked well for a cosplay project with a bald cap~</li>
    <li> I love it ..I love it. after a long search and days of  reading of reviews I believe SHANY  is the one. I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday and i don&#x27;t like foundation because I hate the feeling that I have something heavy on my face.  SHANY cream Foundations are easy to apply and hold up beautifully under the most extreme conditions.  You can find the  perfect match and use it alone, or blend colors like the pros to achieve a specific skin tone</li>
    <li> I love this! Just received this in the post. Beautiful, speedy delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I opened it and it was just as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Filipina living in Australia with olive skin, I instantly opened the tray saw that I could easily mix to get my perfect shade.&lt;br /&gt;The last 5 creams on the bottom row, have an ashy undertone which is perfect to achieve that contour shadow!&lt;br /&gt;Easy application also smooth to buff out.</li>
    <li> its very light. and by that I mean it doesn&#x27;t feel like there is a mound of clay on your face. it also feels like a powder because of this. its very smooth and silky. you can layer it and a little goes a long way. I use it for concealing and contouring because i feel there isn&#x27;t enough to be a foundation. would buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this, I will look into some of their other products</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot like the Coastal Scents concealer camouflage palette, same size wise, you get more colors with this one though and it&#x27;s cheaper. I like it ;)</li>
    <li> nice and creamy... love the choices of color. i dont use the blue because i dont have a problem with redness or color correction i dont use this product by itself i always use a setting powder...but i wld use a setting powder with any concealer or foundation. ur suppose to ...</li>
    <li> I bought this because of I was desperate for a concealor but no lie outta all the colors that were provided, none worked for me. I mean I&#x27;m a brown skin woman with dark spots on my face but Imma try to make the best of of it I guess.</li>
    <li> the darker shades aren&#x27;t that dark at all.</li>
    <li> Good coverage. It works good enough and long lasting for the price</li>
    <li> I like the colors offered, but the product is far to greasy. It applies to streaky.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few months ago, and LOVE it!!  I am a makeup artist, and I needed a pallet of foundation colors for multiple skin tones.  I apply it with a wet sponge (over a primer, of course) and it goes on beautifully!!  I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a wide variety of foundation colors!</li>
    <li> PERFECT. seriously, amazing. SO worth the purchase. a must for blemishes. i use this under my foundation and it makes my makeup last all day and my face doesnt get greasy.. it really is worth the money.. awesome product.</li>
    <li> I love the coverage that I get from using this pallet. It covers blemishes, lines, and dark circles flawlessly. It doesn&#x27;t peel crack or build up in creases. As always excellent price and quality.</li>
    <li> This product is great for any makeup user as well as any makeup professional. Everything you need in one handy little case! The quality is above industry norm and the end results are fantastic!</li>
    <li> Found this palette on here. It came very quickly. Very nice makeup for the price. Nice and big amounts of the foundation I am very pleased and will be ordering some of their other products</li>
    <li> I bought this palette for basic concealing and a bit of contouring.  It arrived promptly and securely.  I am by no means a make-up artist, but it&#x27;s not of the best quality.  The color seems to wear off rather quickly (even after setting it with powder).  The colors also dry out very fast.  I mean, if you don&#x27;t plan on being out all day and have time for constant touch ups, this palette is probably fine for you.  But it definitely doesn&#x27;t hold up through a day of work.</li>
    <li> this is just what I am looking for, if you want a more camera ready contouring and highlighting palette then this one might not be for you, but if your just looking for something simple to get the flawless face then this one is for you. It is great for a night out or even just everyday use. I absolutely love this. It is small amounts of the product but a little goes a long when especially when you are blending.  I hope this helps! 😃</li>
    <li> Shany Cosmetics Professional Palette - Love it! Great palette for those that don&#x27;t want to spend alot of money, great colours that blend well (use a stippling brush for flawless application)</li>
    <li> For the price I paid, this is definitely a nice deal. It contour my face so nicely, I only started to learn how to contour and thought to get a cheaper palette and surprisingly this one works well. A must-buy.</li>
    <li> I love this product! They are beautiful and very soft. Very good quality and the colors are very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I recomended it.</li>
    <li> The shades are great for me. I can blend the shades as I need. I am light to med brown african-american woman with re yellow than red under tones. It cover nice but even me using a little, is seems heavy. I don&#x27;t like wearing a lot of makeup day-to-day. I only wear it under my eyes and very little and it seems thick. For the money it is GREAT but, the formula is basic.</li>
    <li> it gives you all options for the different skin colors or different effects you want to create, contouring, coverage etc</li>
    <li> Really loved! Especially for the price.... purchased as an addition to my freelance kit.  Great colors, wonderful pigment and nice creamy coverage.  I wouldn&#x27;t use for everyday makeup for myself as I am particular about ingredients that go onto my skin, especially oils, talcs and waxes.  However, great for makeup application for short-term wear. Looks good on all my clients.</li>
    <li> This is amazing.. works really good ...with all these different shades it can blend to any skin tone easily and it is so cheap! This is something I plan on , ordering again in the future.</li>
    <li> I love makeup and having the ability to manipulate the appearance of my face. This pallet is smooth and creamy with a multitude of colors to highlight, couture, and conceal anything. The colors are perfect for most skin colors and while you really don’t need to use a lot of product, they are build-able. I can’t wait to try more products from Shany, hopefully they are all as awesome as this one is.</li>
    <li> When I got the cream foundation it was exactly how it shows in the picture. The concealer is good and i feel very comfortable on my face.</li>
    <li> I started taking a chance with this line and it&#x27;s excellent! The colors is so vibrant! The price right as you get your moneys worth once you make an investment.</li>
    <li> I recently used this while doing makeup on a play and it was the first time I got to use it. the product is so great! great to have when you just don&#x27;t have any more room to hold other foundations like me. its a flexible and easily blendable  product. what a great pick!</li>
    <li> woooow ths was ridiculous, so oily and hard to blend. totally not even worth the $19 dollars going to try an actual credible brand next time.</li>
    <li> I realy love my foundation by Shany I have bought from them before so I knew what i was getting.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister. And she has a lot of blemishes, covered them all up and looked natural.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer! It allows me to do conturing perfectly and I&#x27;m no pro MUA I just enjoy doing my makeup</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my clients It&#x27;s just concealer I&#x27;m a Makeup Artist and I&#x27;m a medium brown girl I used it but I was not impressed with it on ME, but it might work well for someone else. I am not saying it&#x27;s bad it serves it purpose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times but it&#x27;s great when placed on the face and last for long , plus you do not look greasy face</li>
    <li> The color options are great, but it&#x27;s not a great base ... very oily-like and does not blend correctly.</li>
    <li> I love it! this product blends in so good, it covers the dark circles around my eyes so perfectly, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just received this product after almost two months of waiting. I was a little hesitant to try it considering the bad reviews, but I LOVE IT! It goes on creamy, blends well, and looks lovely. For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> I Order for my wife, She is happy &amp;  Use as a Profession Makeup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product a little really does go along way with this. Very creamy but I wouldn&#x27;t use it if you have dry skin.</li>
    <li> This company are insulting peoples intelligence by creating all these fake reviews. They also claim to be &amp;#34;Proud Peta Members&amp;#34;...I wouldn&#x27;t brag about that since Peta have been exposed for being equally dishonest and kill 98% of the pets they receive at their shelters.</li>
    <li> I cant afford MAX ...this is a creamy cover up gos on smooth, a little goes a long way. very nice!!</li>
    <li> I really wish I could return this. I tried the foundation on my hand first (thank goodness) and it immediately started to sting/burn. I don&#x27;t consider myself to be sensitive and don&#x27;t normally have issues with makeup. But this is going in the garbage. Lesson learned: never buy makeup you can&#x27;t test out first.</li>
    <li> good concealer just take time a apply depending on amount of coverage your looking for</li>
    <li> I HAD THIS  FOR ABOUT 3 YEARS. AND ITS AMAZING! I HAVE A CONER OF EACH COLOR LEFT. IT STRETCHES!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great concealer/foundation palette for beginning makeup artists and it lasts for a very long time. The pigmentation is great and it&#x27;s easy to blend. Great for contouring and highlighting~</li>
    <li> My girl friend loved it!</li>
    <li> Loved it! Perfect shades and it stays on . Great I have oily skin.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Other cosmetic stores have these but they all are expensive unlike this. There&#x27;s shades to conceal for any skin color. I would like to buy it and try it out sometime soon.</li>
    <li> i love using this palette! the concealers are creamy, and have great coverage and lasting power. i recommend this to all of my friends, and recommend it to you as well!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS NOT THE BEST, BUT DOES THE JOB. IT IS GOOD FOR ALL COMPLEXIONS. IT IS IN THE FORM OF A CREAMY FOUNDATION SO IF YOU DO NOT LIKE CREAM BASE PRODUCTS, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. OVERALL, GOOD FOR THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> Love it great  better that what I thought I was scared to purchase it but i&lt;br /&gt;The colors are great</li>
    <li> IVE HAD SOME BAD CONCEALERS....BUT THIS STUFF IS PERFECT I LOVE EVERY SHADE...ITS CREAMY AND SMOOTH AND APPLIES JUST RIGHT.TRUE TO ITS COLOR AND NOT GREASY OR SHEER...NOT MUCH NEEDED TO APPLY! IN LOVE LOVE LOVE! SHIPS IN A JIFFFY!!!!</li>
    <li> OMG OMG!!! I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS PALETTE!! GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE!!! VERY CREAMY AND BLENDABLE!!! GREAT COVERAGE ALSO!! COVERS ALL MY FLAWS!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve found for covering my dark circles! The creamy consistency of the foundations make for easy and gentle application especially for the delicate under eye area! I don&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> i like how you get a great range of colors so that if you wanted to branch out and do other peoples makeup, you could without having to spend a bunch of money in start up costs.</li>
    <li> I have the worst luck when it comes to purchasing drugstore concealers. Either I purchase a concealer that is too light or too dark. So I gave this concealer palette a shot and I am happy I did! I tried a color but it didn&#x27;t fit my skin tone so I mixed it with another and sure enough it was perfect!!! I let my mom and sister use it too since we have different skin tones and it also matches them. I also highlight with the lighter colors and I get a flawless look. The concealers are smooth and creamy and I do not cake up as much unless you use powder on top. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love that this palette has such a variety in colors. It makes it perfect for mixing and matching to make a perfect match for your skin. I think it&#x27;s an amazing deal, and won&#x27;t let you down.</li>
    <li> Love these products, great for contouring</li>
    <li> This is a really really really great product. You can also use it on clients who I think this is such a good deal compared to getting one concealer....and another good thing is that this is so creamy...its just right for the undereye circles and many more. It is worth it would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> It does the job just fine. It cakes up very easily and dries out after about a week, but It&#x27;s not unusable. I would not recommend this for dry skin. It&#x27;s awesome if you want to experiment with contouring though!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t ever describe how much i love this palette, not only were there so many different shade i an mix and match to get my own color, but the texture is so creamy and really easy to blend i just love it. it was so affordable and i use this palette everyday not only on myself but when im doing other peoples makeup too (: JUST IN LOVE (:</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of money on makeup and when I ordered this I wasn&#x27;t sure because of how cheap it was but when I received it I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I loved if</li>
    <li> I have light combo skin with dark circles under my eyes, liver spots, and tons of freckles.  Given I have liver spots, I have a large assortment of concealers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Rather inexpensive, good coverage, light and not caking, ability to blend, arrived on time and unbroken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Migrates into the skin creases no matter what I&#x27;ve tried to stop this.  Several times a day, I must smudge it back out just to avoid looking like I&#x27;m highlighting the wrinkles around my eyes.  I do use a primer and finishing powder which has stopped this with every other productive I&#x27;ve used but this one.  Perhaps, I need to learn a new technique for this product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice:  If they would make two or three sets based on light-mid-darker skin tones so that you could have larger quantities of the colors you need and none of the ones you don&#x27;t.  I will never need the darker tones and I&#x27;d rather have more of what I will use and less wastefulness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  For the price this is a very good product.  Because it does settle in the creases of my skin more than any other product I&#x27;ve used I&#x27;m taking one star off.  However, most of the products I&#x27;ve tried at this price range do not cover as well without some caking or settling in creases and/or do not blend as well.  There is no 5 star concealer for me at this price level.</li>
    <li> Nice alternative to the powder sculpting</li>
    <li> Beautiful packaging , great size and quality ,&lt;br /&gt;and all the necessary camouflage colors are included .&lt;br /&gt;Creamy and easy to work with I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Made me break out horribly.  Get what yo uh pay for I suppose</li>
    <li> I used it to contour my face, very light and easily applies. I am excited to share this with my friends.</li>
    <li> I do not understand the bad reviews for this product at all. The green color is actually green in certain light, but in natural light looks white. It isn&#x27;t photoshop manipulation. The concealers have not dried up, and I&#x27;ve had this for weeks. The box isn&#x27;t impossible to open if you have decently sized nails. I use a wet blender sponge to apply the concealer, using the whitest shade for highlights and a darker shade for contouring. It blends great. The quality is superb, and you get a lot of options for the price. It is now a staple of my makeup routine. I full heatedly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I picked this palette up as a quick replacement when i ran out of my usual and I&#x27;ve read some crappy reviews on it but since it was the only one that had 2 day shipping i tried it out (reluctantly). TO MY SURPRISE it is awesome! tested it out on my face before my clients, because i read some reviews on it being &amp;#34;too oily&#x27; or &amp;#34;too transparent&amp;#34; &amp;#34;wont stick to my brush&amp;#34; etc. the concealer covered acne well, as well as my bright blue eye bags lol and by the way the foundation is really creamy and almost has a maybelline dream matte mousse feel. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Bulk buying is a great way to save money and this is an awesome brand and product. I  will definitly buy again for our school!</li>
    <li> The colors were not as true to what are shown.  I will stick with the other I have consistently used.</li>
    <li> I can deff say that this product is a great buy! The packaging is beautiful and the product itself is a wonderful buy for those who may be new to concealer (such as myself) or isn&#x27;t sure of their concealer color. It isn&#x27;t cakey no mater how much you slop on, very natural looking, very blendable. The only pitfalls to it that iv&#x27;e noticed is it settles into wrinkles and fine lines greatly,it kind of makes my pores more visible and it doesn&#x27;t cover as heavy for a camouflage concealer. Other than that it is a GREAT buy and I can see myself repurchasing this over and over again. It is a makeup kit essential.</li>
    <li> I wear makeup like everyday and this palette has lasted me a lifetime is very good quality and really easy to use</li>
    <li> Hello everyone. This palette is amazing. I was shocked when I first used the concealer it went on so smoothly that even my other brand concealer didn&#x27;t go this smoothly which is much more expensive. Wow I love shany cosmetics affordable and good quality cosmetics. The concealer blended very well using concealer brush and even with finger tips it blends pretty good. I am very happy with my purchase. I will be buying lot more products from shany again.</li>
    <li> I had  return this product I was not impressed and after three days, had to return I cannot support this product. The shades of brown  colors were great, but the coverage were not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I bought mine DIRECTLY THROUGH SHANY&#x27;s website.  The foundation is VERY THICK and hard to apply if you don&#x27;t have the right tools.  One trick I do, is I apply lotion to mine so it makes it thinner and easier to apply.  The color is great though and it is full coverage.  The concealer is amazing as well.  A little goes a long way too!! Seriously, only a dot under the eye with lotion and it gives me good concealer.  For the price, it is worth it.  Especially if you a new to the make up world or contouring!</li>
    <li> I bought this because they discontinued my favorite camouflage concealer with the green color concealer. And I love, the concealer is very smooth and creamy, and blends in amazingly well with my foundation!</li>
    <li> i love the concealer colors and they have a great consistency! they are very blendable and is a great product!</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation palette I have come across yet. I love the variety of colors and for professions, this makes the travel so much lighter as they are beautifully cased in this palette. Very high quality and a must have!!!</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! I will keep buying it my favorite I love how I cn do my contouring and it has amazing converage</li>
    <li> Great product!! I was skeptical about this product because of the previous reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is there a  variety of colors available. The concealers are creamy, blends easily and gives great coverage without looking or feeling too heavy. I would recommend this product! I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products and yes I am an actual customer with skin that needs a little help. The amount of concealers and the size of them in this compartment are a steal for the price.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous product. Nicely packed and so organized. Love that the product is cruelty free. Works great too.</li>
    <li> These foundations are easy to apply and look amazing, and you can&#x27;t beat the price! That is how it is with pretty much all of Shany&#x27;s products. The prices are so affordable and the quality is amazing considering the prices. Just because they are cheap, they don&#x27;t make cheap quality stuff, that is my kind of company! I am so grateful for Shany, for making cosmetics, a poor unemployed mother, can afford, since cheap brands like Wet and Wild, Elf, and dollar store make up, makes me break out. Cheap usually means cheap quality. Not with Shany!! You get salon brand quality makeup for cheap!</li>
    <li> I love my concealer by Shany, Like the price too. Covers very well any spot, leave your face looking younger. I&#x27;m happy with this product, and the price too.&lt;br /&gt;You should try it.</li>
    <li> This makeup is crap. The concealers don&#x27;t blend we&#x27;ll with anything and it makes me breakout. If you have oily skin, please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Bad quality creams. I was not expecting this .</li>
    <li> I have been using these to contour and they are creamy and blend well.  Thank you for a great transaction !~</li>
    <li> Very cakie and very tough to blend, I&#x27;m a beginner at the hole contouring thing but I think from here on I&#x27;ll use powder kinds.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom. she got one Shany cosmetics eye shade product and loved it so much she asked me to order a bunch more. same goes for my wife. this product is no different. My mom said its comparable to many much higher price products in quality. this should last a long time and if not its still a great value so using a lot is not a big problem.</li>
    <li> this product is one of many that I like .just wish the palette had more lighter colors.. worth the price!</li>
    <li> I use this pad for contouring as well. It&#x27;s ok but I can find a better brand that doesn&#x27;t leave the skin ashy after application</li>
    <li> I usually use a certain name brand tattoo concealer to cover dark spots but it runs out quickly because it&#x27;s such a small tube and it&#x27;s rather pricey. This color palette allows you to mix so that it is true to your complexion and it covers beautifully. Affordable and effective. I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> OK - bought, tested, and for 18 it is well well worth it. Had slight issues blending the first applications - but added more and it dod go. Remember, this is $18 and for the fee it gets a five star as if you are looking here - you are looking to save money and build supplies economically. That is what you are getting. And - must be happy with that. It was not dry like other reviews had claimed -  but that does not mean their shipment was not dry. Mine was nice and creamy, a bit heavy, but a great range for the price.</li>
    <li> The product is okay.. It gets the job done but it is not as creamy as i thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like these colors they are really dry and are very hard to blend</li>
    <li> Great shades, good for contouring.</li>
    <li> If you enjoy contouring and using different Cover up this is a great inexpensive pallet for you. I love it</li>
    <li> Not sure why some people got knock offs because mine is real but, I have a MILLION concealers and these are my every day go to&#x27;s. The colors are beautiful and are very creamy. They go on your skin with ease and cover well. You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of product to do great things! I also use this kit for conturing and it works great! The colors blend very well together when conturing. I am sooooo happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical trying concealer from Shany at such a low price. I should have trusted my intuituition. My face was cakey and the make up was hard to use. Right after I put it on, I looked at my boyfriend. He looked at me with a very uneasy and unimpressed stare and asked, &amp;#34;Why do you look like that?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it. Go get some Maybeline if you&#x27;re looking for decent concealer at a decent price.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this because the Coastal scents was the only pallet i had ever used and I didnt want to risk getting a horrible product but this is just as good, if not better then the coastal scents pallet.</li>
    <li> Some of the concealers are not that creamer but I it&#x27;s a great deal being that you get all theses concealers for this bargain price!</li>
    <li> I do makeup for our local theatre and this is perfect for all the different skin colors we have in our company! Arrived quickly and in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> This make-up was easy to blend and had great coverage. I purchased this set to do my own makeup for a wedding I was in and I didn&#x27;t want to pay a professional. I followed some Kim K. like youtube videos to create the contoured look. It is a good idea to purchase some new makeup blending brushes to use with this set.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loving this product! It&#x27;s a very good coverage. And it doesn&#x27;t look too heavy or caky. Thank you for the amazing product.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency and it does conceal, great for multi use purposes such as highlighting and contouring also. I only wish it had more color correcting shades vs just the one it contains. Other than that it&#x27;s a good pick for a beginner MUA</li>
    <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and noticed that powder foundation wasn&#x27;t working for me anymore.  It looked caked on my face.  After researching and discovering a cream foundation would be better i stumbled across Shany cosmetics.  I&#x27;ve never used any other brand but i&#x27;m in love with Shany so i can&#x27;t imagine i will.  The price is good also.  I&#x27;ve been using this palette for about 3 months and i can see where i&#x27;m starting to run low.  If i can get another 2-3 months out of the palette then i will def feel like it is a good deal for the money.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a really good buy. I would recommend it for personal and professional use. Love the variety of shades and the ease of applying them</li>
    <li> At first they were soooo oily AND NOW (a couple months after having them) they have dried out. I kept the plastic cover on them too! Nothing to rave about.....that&#x27;s for sure! I have to mix with a moisturizer if I want to wear because it&#x27;s so hard to spread out, it is so dried up....uuugghhh!</li>
    <li> Who would have thought you could get such high quality without spending an arm and a leg?! These concealers are great for under the eyes or covering spots. You can find your perfect shade by mixing and matching colors. Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> I am Native American &amp; Mexican I tan really well in the summer and lighten up fast in fall/winter. My skin color is hard to match and it gets expensive throughout the year. This worked great for my needs the makeup feels great on your skin but you 100% need moisturizer first or your skin will look dry.</li>
    <li> I think the colors for foundation and concealers as nice warm colors for your skin tone. Great price and very compact.</li>
    <li> Shanys professional cream foundation and camouflage concealer palette is great comes in a lot of colors and I just love palettes!</li>
    <li> I found two of the colours match the closest. I initally bought this to use to hide a few spider veins on my calf, and I have used it for that and it looks good, but will rub off pretty easily too. But it works for that as long as I&#x27;m careful. I am also using it to camoflage some discolouration on my face from melasma, and it works really well for that. Seems a shame to waste all the other pots of coverup, but for the price it is worth it if you only use one or two.</li>
    <li> I work as a makeup artist and bought this product to have a wider variety of skin tones available for my clients. Prior to buying this palette I was using only Ben Nye cream foundation. When I first opened the package I was confused as to how hard the pigments were. I went back and read a review that said the reviewer loved to use these with a damp sponge. I dampened applicators in an attempt to use the product, but it does not go on smoothly. There is no way I am able to use these as spot treatment either which is what I do with my liquid concealers. Using a damp brush only dampens the skin, the makeup has no coverage. I threw my $25 out the door on this one. Not sure what you can really use this palette for. &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> For starters this is great!</li>
    <li> I order under boyfriend&#x27;s account since he has prime.  That being said, this item is not that good. I would not by again but want to finish product... found ways to work with it the best I can. Does not provide the flawless look I wanted to achieve. This product really disappointed me because I was so excited and returning seems more of a hassle.  I love the idea of it. I wanted something that I could customize and blend to match my skin perfectly.  I do not mind cream foundations/concealers.  I like the colors.  Good selection...broad range offered. However, even though it appears to be creamy, it is really cakey when applied (esp when using the lighter colors) ...even settles into creases (and I have used damp sponge and setting powder and no luck).  First off, it is packed hard in the individual pans so if you use your brush to get product, very little if none comes on the brush. I used a lollipop stick to mix it in the pan.  Secondly, it does not glide easily or blend that seamlessly.  You will end up looking cakey esp if you use colors lighter than your skin tone even though while you are doing your makeup, you think everything is blending well. (I agree with another reviewer. My boyfriend saw my face after I used this product and did my usual makeup routine and he said it looked terrible.)  I wish it was more butter-like or had the consistency of gel-like products.  I really do like the idea and colors offered. I was so frustrated with this item because I really wanted to like it and be able to use it.  I Hate to waste money and hate to waste product. I have resorted to mixing it with other concealers that come in a tube to get that consistency that I like.  This works OK. Recently, I came across this tip that I hope works. I read to add a drop or 2 of 100% oil such as almond oil to the concealer and mix it to get the consistency you like. I have done this and it definitely has helped!!!!  Made a difference.  Still not 100% perfect but OK/workable/not that bad....so I will use item until finished but I would not order this item again. In terms of makeup routine, I thoroughly moisturize face, apply primer, and even tried using setting spray before applying makeup. It also helps to take a bit of liquid foundation (either lighter or darker than skin-tone depending on where you applied this cream foundation/concealer) and ever so slightly apply to face in a stippling motion to reduce the cakiness....this is particular helpful after having applied the lighter colors.  I have medium complexion/tanned skin with warm undertones.  This does provide good coverage and is thick in consistency.      That being said, this works best if you apply colors that is very close match to your skin-tone.  That way it won&#x27;t stand out too much.  I bought to contour and highlight. Therefore, I went 2 shades below my skin-tone to highlight.  Contouring with darker colors was not so bad since it showed up darker on face.  Just blend really, really well and if you look like a ghost, go over lightly with your foundation to reduce the cakiness and the ghost look.</li>
    <li> But there was no color match for me :-( The colors are very nice but to light for me. I wear Estee Lauder&#x27;s Mocha 22 shade in foundation and none of the colors were close enough. I also did not like that it was a kinda clumped and hard to spread. All in all a bad purchase...never again. BTW... who wears Blue concealer or Foundation? Blue could have been replaced with a darker shade.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product! It blends perfectly onto the color of my skin! I feel like this product was worth investing in!</li>
    <li> Wow its amazing! Mix and match to find your perfect foundation for you skin, and it comes with concealer which is a total plus!! I&#x27;m in love with this thingg!!!  I HIGHLY recommend! don&#x27;t miss out on this!</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a Christmas Gift. I love it.  I have , with practice, been able to mix shades and come up with the concealer perfect for my skin tone. All women know that our skin tones vary season to season sometimes day to day. This kit is a life saver.  Especially when the boss has you work over time Monday through Thursday, and then tells you Thursday evening you are giving a presentation bright and early Friday morniing to NEW clients.  Women know men expect us to always look fresh and well rested. Can&#x27;t have dark cicles and bags.  This kit is a life saver.  It works for the new mom who is a working mother too.  Shany Cosmetics has the kits we need and we can afford them.  I certainly recommend this kit to everyone. LindaW.</li>
    <li> A perfect palette for highlighting and contouring.</li>
    <li> Oily and thick. Having hard time blending it and cleaning it! Didn&#x27;t like it and not using it after first attempt</li>
    <li> This is definitely a really inexpensive alternative palette than purchasing a contouring kit at Sephora or Nordstrom&#x27;s. Although, if you&#x27;re considering Shany&#x27;s blush palette I would urge you to skip it!!</li>
    <li> I love this set! The creams easily glide on with no fuss. I will definitely recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> I used Shany to contour my face and it blends well and loved it.  I think it was a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Old age make-up just became so much easier. When you have an entire compact at your finger tips, the world better watch it.</li>
    <li> I love this palette. It is amazing. It has plenty of shades, for all skin tones. The only thing I dislike is that it is a little difficult to get out of the pan. I have to press super hard to get any out. Other than that, I give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have, because having the right foundation for the face is the foundation for a pretty, and perfectly made up face.  Having used makeup for 20 years, I know that the right look is not attainable without foundation, because this is what helps the powder, and blush stick to the face better, and have a more natural look.  Also, the product specifications are clear.  There is no doubt as to the product benefits for the purchaser.</li>
    <li> I use this on my Clients. I have had no complaints and they all looked great. I personally do not wear make up so I cannot give a personal opinion other than what my Clients tll me. I like the Product enought to continue buying from SHANY Cosmetics.</li>
    <li> small quantity of each color, not for longwear</li>
    <li> Tried this stuff twice just to make sure it was as bad as I thought it was.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is cakey and horrible. I know they say it&#x27;s not the makeup it&#x27;s how you apply it, but this stuff is junk.&lt;br /&gt;Just splurge and get the Ben Nye foundation kits.</li>
    <li> Product is really nice and came really fast! I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Just like description and arrived before expected</li>
    <li> Good for the price. The texture is pretty dry, not super creamy. I like it though because it doesn&#x27;t settle into my lines. Great coverage. I have a medium to tan skin tone and it works great. Would work on make different skin tones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a REAL amazon customer and I love this palette. I use a little water to thin out the cream but it is good for all skin types. I am a pro makeup artist and my clients love the look and it last all day.</li>
    <li> I order this sort of set from this company and it never disappoints. True match ability, and it stays put. The case it self is much bigger than I am used to so it doesnt fit in my makeup bag. Great concealer otherwise.</li>
    <li> I receive this palette today and i must say, i loved it on the first application..  It gives great coverage and is very creamy for smoother application :) good job Shany</li>
    <li> I purchased these concealers and couldn&#x27;t even use them they were so hard wouldn&#x27;t even stick to my brush or face</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been highlighting and contouring for some time now but I&#x27;ve been using a powder bronzer and highlighter. This product has revolutionized the highlighting and contouring technique for me. The creams create a much more dramatic look and with all of the colors in the pallette, it can be used as foundation too. I think that&#x27;s what most people use it for anyway. When used with setting spray or high def. powder it will absolutely last all day. This pallette eliminates the need to buy foundation, highlighter and bronzer all separately and it ends up being cheaper this way too. Great product for a makeup enthusiast or anyone who wants to improve their everyday look! I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Make up always makes a good gift for the daughters. They like to try new things, it is good to find things that don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> Love the colors will work on most skin tones it is light and smooth when applied.</li>
    <li> I have one thing to say....So much BANG for your BUCK! OMG! The pallette is impressive.  I am a darkskinned black woman and I love the pallette.  Its so smooth.  My daughter is a lighter complexion and she has her own personal pallette as well!  This concealer/foundation is wonderful.  I have skin allergies and was concerned about a break out but this product loves my face!  I love it too! It leaves such a natural look.  This pallette would cost you MAJOR bucks at MAC or others, You can&#x27;t beat the price no where!!!</li>
    <li> Good for people who just want to practice but I wouldn&#x27;t put this on everyday</li>
    <li> Great product, they work perfectly for my wife. She has 0% complaints an as the husban, I must agree with the results :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever doesn&#x27;t understand the turqoise color shouldn&#x27;t be giving negative reviews in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product came exactly as shown, the amount of the foundations is actually quite impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall This is one of the first SHANY proucts I bought, and there will be more SHANY in the future!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for the price.</li>
    <li> I wanted to order a concealer palette so that I could practice contouring. This was perfect! The coverage was good. The foundation/ concealers were not too heavy, but not too light. I don&#x27;t use this every day but I do use it on special occasions because I don&#x27;t want my product to run out. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great as concealer. Ok, but not terrible for foundations</li>
    <li> Great products with exceelent consistensy couldnt believe how well it works for such a low price. everyone should try this companys products out there good!</li>
    <li> The package came in perfect shape:)</li>
    <li> I only use about 3 or 4 of the colors in this palette but I love them!! I have since tried similar products that I did not care for at all. This is a great inexpensive concealer that doubles as a highlighter.</li>
    <li> Great product, I am a makeup artist and I love a great concealer palette, this is great add to my makeup kit. It is a great size and the foundation/concealer is very creamy making it easy to blend.</li>
    <li> There is a solution for all of you who said they are too hard - leave them on the sun! After they melt and cool down again, teksture will be great but anything else won&#x27;t change (chemically). It happened to me once by accident and it turned out great. These are not the best for under eyes, but I love them as a contour and foundation mixed with eather liquid foundation or Kryolans makeup blend liquid.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this to black people for full coverage foundation application. The tones are quite light and very creamy, maybe just for highlights in contouring.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend works nights so I am on a nocturnal schedule. Anyone that stays up late or has had a long night knows what your eyes look like the next morning. I have been testing out a lot of different types of concealer and so far this is one of my favorites. This is perfect if you&#x27;re a professional, tan a lot but not consistently, or if you like to share your makeup with your friends because of the variety. If you don&#x27;t do any of those things I&#x27;d go for a smaller set. The concealer and foundation is light and creamy which I adore. I will not at all wear foundation that feels heavy.</li>
    <li> This palette is perfect for every blemish I&#x27;ve ever had and I love the green for my red cheeks! This is the perfect size, perfect color choices!</li>
    <li> This concealer palette is awesome! I love that it has many different shades! For me, in the summer I get super dark and so I hate buying an extra concealer for that shade! It&#x27;s all right here!</li>
    <li> This is probably one of my favorite products from SHANY. You get so much product and the size of the pans are much bigger than I expected! About the size of a 50 cent piece. I have not had any breakouts or skin irritations from this (I was scared I would since I have super sensitive skin and everything gives me acne) and my skin looks so incredibly smooth and flawless once this is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using a powder/stipple/ some fluffy brush to apply this to really blend and so you get a lighter application. I think if not used properly, It might look cakey. I also don&#x27;t know if I would recommend this for people with super dry skin. You definitely need a good moisturizer with this so it doesn&#x27;t create any texture on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great coverage!!! It covered all my scars with little product AND it even stayed all night while I danced and sweat at the club! I was super excited about that since everything else I use seems to run off when I sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this for contouring and highlighting and also to bronze my face. It looks super natural and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my skin since using this.I want another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a green color corrector in this so I don&#x27;t know what people who got a white one are talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a freelance makeup artist so I&#x27;m definitely going to be getting another one to use on my clients. You can mix and match to create your own skin tone so it can match anybody! So much more convenient than carrying about 13 different foundations. I can&#x27;t say I love this enough!</li>
    <li> I was on the fence about buying a palette that had concealers in them seeing how my skin color is difficult (acne scars, discoloration and such). But when I finally opened it and put some on it seemed to cover my acne scars etc. easily. The concealers are a little hard but I used my finger to warm the concealer and applied it like you would a normal liquid concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it!</li>
    <li> It had all the colors I was looking for and was easy to apply. I use it almotr every day</li>
