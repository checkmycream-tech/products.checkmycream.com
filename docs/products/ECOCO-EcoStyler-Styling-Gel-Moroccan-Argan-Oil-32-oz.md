      <li>I love the original eco styler, but this one holds just as well.</li>
      <li>This was easy to use and inexpensive.</li>
      <li>it also didn&#x27;t seem to hold as strongly as the Olive Oil version.</li>
      <li>Good hold, good for your hair, with absolutely no flacking</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it or checking the mirror to make sure that I&#x27;m remembering it right.  </li>
      <li>The gel is fine</li>
      <li>Makes my hair smooth  </li>
      <li>There was a bottle cap still attached to the gel I&#x27;m assuming was to the free item.</li>
      <li>It made my hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
      <li>for the price, I am sure I could have gotten it cheaper, but for the convenience of not having to drive 45 minutes to the nearest town, it was worth it.</li>
      <li>I would put like 20 more exclamations to show you how much my super huge super full, variegated, curly, kinky, frizzy, ultra-thick hair likes it...</li>
      <li>I was pleased that I came across this product on a you tube video and it works like a dream, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the way it works with my hair and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
      <li>(and I am usually sensitive to fragrance and always to perfumes) but some might still have problem with this smell, I don&#x27;t and have gotten many compliments and my hair and the smell :)</li>
      <li>My only problem is I think more argan oil should be added for a better shine.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite product.</li>
      <li>I love it; it keeps my hair very soft</li>
      <li>and I love the way it defines my natural curl pattern and  enables me to wear my hair in styles I thought were off</li>
      <li>So,now I have a thing of gel I rarely use...</li>
      <li>But if course t have very fine soft hair and probably used too much.</li>
      <li>Once my hair air dried it looked amazing!  </li>
      <li>and then there was the joy of straining it, then after a few days/week it got stinky ;P  Bleh!  </li>
      <li>good to lay baby hairs down.</li>
      <li>I love the nice big container, which I am sure will last a long time.</li>
      <li>Use for styling but if used daily, be sure to rinse out.</li>
      <li>I love it, it&#x27;s the only  </li>
      <li>there is a lot of product, but I would not use consistently.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It came fast too!</li>
      <li>I love this hair gel its the only hair gel to work on my 4c hair texture</li>
      <li>Very nice smell too at least for me</li>
      <li>My hair is coarse so it does not smooth my edges straight, but that&#x27;s OK because overall it is still a great product.  </li>
      <li>I have 3c hair more on the loose curly side</li>
      <li>It keeps my curls nice and tight and does not flake at all.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really use it or like it</li>
      <li>My only concern was why was the free product removed.</li>
      <li>No one anywhere close to me has hair like me and no one really knew what to do with my hair,  Fast forward to now-</li>
      <li>Really have no idea</li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t really do for my hair what I thought it would.</li>
      <li>The gel when used alone can make my hair crunchy, but I just add a little coconut oil or extra olive oil first to make the style extra soft with excellent hold.</li>
      <li>The only thing is you really do have to apply it right after you show!  </li>
      <li>hehehe, yucky ;P  If you are busy as we all seem to be now a days and you aren&#x27;t ready for flax gel then settle for this!  </li>
      <li>I like the green economic much better</li>
      <li>and I finally find a product that pretty much keeps</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what else I can do with my new movie star hair product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used their protein black for years and was told by several of my natural friends to try this kind instead.</li>
      <li>German, Italian (part Sicilian), Irish and more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This gel is great for retwisting my locs. Incredible hold, plus it&#x27;s the only product that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.</li>
    <li> Great! Love this product...</li>
    <li> This!  This product is da bomb!!!  I would put like 20 more exclamations to show you how much my super huge super full, variegated, curly, kinky, frizzy, ultra-thick hair likes it...If that would help others hat can benefit see how great it is :D  Is it healthy?  I bet not (by those ingredients).  hey, it&#x27;s gel people, hehe.  I tried the frugal homemade flax seed hair gel recipe; which I was OH SO SURE that I was gonna love and use it forever :P  WRONG!  I accidentally cooked it a little too long and then there was the joy of straining it, then after a few days/week it got stinky ;P  Bleh!  hehehe, yucky ;P  If you are busy as we all seem to be now a days and you aren&#x27;t ready for flax gel then settle for this!  I took modeling classes at 12 but never learned how to style my hair.  No one anywhere close to me has hair like me and no one really knew what to do with my hair,  Fast forward to now- I&#x27;m 36 and I finally find a product that pretty much keeps it&#x27;s promise.  Now watch them go and change it.  If you try it and they do change it then you will be crying with me.  The only thing is you really do have to apply it right after you show!  I have tried to cheat and it don&#x27;t work.  BTW, I am Caucasian.  German, Italian (part Sicilian), Irish and more. Really have no idea how/where I got all my hair.  Maybe some day I will post a pic with the product applied and you can see how it works for my hair and maybe that will help yo decide if it fits for yours?  Oh!  Very nice smell too at least for me (and I am usually sensitive to fragrance and always to perfumes) but some might still have problem with this smell, I don&#x27;t and have gotten many compliments and my hair and the smell :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite gel! I&#x27;ve been using this specific gel for almost 2 years now. I bought a 2 or 5 gallon container of this about 2 years ago and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. The boss of all gels for natural hair</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this one since I LOVE the olive oil version. But this reacted strangely with the products I was using giving my hair a weird feel and looking dull. it also didn&#x27;t seem to hold as strongly as the Olive Oil version. I only give it three stars because it could have just been the reaction with the product I was using.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eco Styler Gel for years now.It smooths out my hair without leaving any harsh residue. I use this mostly when i am doing up-dos. I have to use a hard brush to slick my hair down and then tie it down with a scarf. I don&#x27;t use alot to avoid residue and hardness. I do like this one alot better than the Olive Oil Gel.</li>
    <li> Used this product on my twist out and it produced marvelous results. My hair had definition, shine and hold galore! I had no issues with flaking ,  it paired well with my SheaMoisture leave in and it did not dry my hair out. My only problem is with the seller. They did not package this item with bubble wrap or bubble protection so the lid cracked into pieces and product was all in the package. I have to keep a 32 ounce tub of gel in a plastic grocery store bag to keep from drying out.</li>
    <li> My styling gel arrived with a cracked container spilled all over the place, I don&#x27;t know if someone dropped it or the heat exploded it.,</li>
    <li> I was looking for a different type of this brand and stumbled across this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, good brand and product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came fast too!</li>
    <li> Good stuff at the right price.</li>
    <li> Wow. I can&#x27;t believe this product cost so much when you can go to Sally&#x27;s or the Asian Beaty Supply Store for less then half the cost on here. But anyway this is a great product when used in conjunction with Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie. Using these two products together worked better then Miss Jesses, Design Essentials or Kinky Curly. It gave me perfect curl definition and I do not have a curl pattern but instead I finger style my hair to manipulate curl pattern. No flaking and with Shea moisture and Eco Style combined I get the perfect moisture and shine.I live in a very humid climate and its difficult to maintain hair without frizz or dryness in this type climate. I am heavy handed also but this combination really didn&#x27;t matter.This was easy to use and inexpensive. Spritz with water if need to reactivate.</li>
    <li> I love the original eco styler, but this one holds just as well. This is excellent for defining my natural curl pattern, it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t flake!  You do have to be careful about what you use with this gel to keep white residue from forming in the hair.  The gel when used alone can make my hair crunchy, but I just add a little coconut oil or extra olive oil first to make the style extra soft with excellent hold.</li>
    <li> I love this gel. I have 3c hair more on the loose curly side and this gel really makes my hair look perfect with out flakes, and stiffness.</li>
    <li> Great product and good delivery time</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really use it or like it But don&#x27;t feel like returning it 😕</li>
    <li> Product arrived and the container was cracked in half. Gel was oozing out so I just threw it in the garbage. I saw other reviews complaining about the same thing, but I thought the company would have enough common sense to fix the issue. Guess not, complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> good to lay baby hairs down. not good on any pressed hair because it does contain water. I love it tho</li>
    <li> ECO Styler works wonders on my natural hair.  Makes my hair smooth  and it holds without a sticky or hard feel. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great for natural African-American hair! I use daily, and it never drys my hair or flakes. Seems to seal in the moisture as well.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite product. I&#x27;ve used their protein black for years and was told by several of my natural friends to try this kind instead. I am glad I did. The Eco Styler Moroccan Argan Oil Styling Gel doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy on my hair and I love the way it defines my natural curl pattern and  enables me to wear my hair in styles I thought were off limits.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviews where people were disappointed in shipping, but mine arrived shrink wrapped in a box full of bubble wrap and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;As for the price, I am sure I could have gotten it cheaper, but for the convenience of not having to drive 45 minutes to the nearest town, it was worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product, but Amazon is charging WAY too much. A 32 oz. container should only $3-5.00 max. I gave this 1 star for the pricing.</li>
    <li> I use this gel for my bantu knots for the most of my hair styling.  It keeps my curls nice and tight and does not flake at all.  My hair still feels soft when using it, but that may be because I also use other products with it.  My hair is coarse so it does not smooth my edges straight, but that&#x27;s OK because overall it is still a great product.  I love the nice big container, which I am sure will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s the only  I&#x27;ll ever use.. It&#x27;s the best on the market. And I will order again, and again</li>
    <li> This gel will definitely lay down those edges, The only problem I have with this gel is that it hardens your hair once it is dry. But  I&#x27;ve found that using a leave-in conditioner in your hair before applying will not leave you with hard hair. Overall I would recommend it and I plan on trying the other eco-styler gels.</li>
    <li> √√√√√Excellent Product and Service</li>
    <li> my wife and I have curly and wavy hair. We both use it.&lt;br /&gt;Great.&lt;br /&gt;Works well for hold and not too stiff. We both love it. I&#x27;d buy again. Clear too.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT! It is all the hype I heard it was. Perfect for fine, naturally curly hair when styling with Bantu knots or spiral rollers. No flaking (yet) and not sticky when it gets wet a second time.</li>
    <li> Love it. No flakes where others fail me</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Eco gel. I like it better than the olive oil as it keeps my hair in place without making it stiff or flaking!</li>
    <li> I love this hair gel its the only hair gel to work on my 4c hair texture&lt;br /&gt;When I recieved my package though there was a plastic seal on my gel that said &amp;#34;Super deal Buy 1 Get 1 Free&amp;#34; and there was no free product. There was a bottle cap still attached to the gel I&#x27;m assuming was to the free item. My only concern was why was the free product removed.</li>
    <li> Best gel ever ever ever for natural hair. I actually apply a little leave in conditioner in my hair and then seal it w a little blue magic, apply gel over and twist. Turns kinky hair in to perfect curls</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it to slick down my edges and my wash and go styles.</li>
    <li> Came as described and has great hold!!!! No complaints here!!!</li>
    <li> I have curly, thick hair and this is the only gel that can keep my hair neat.  Also I have no flaking or dandruff, stuff is amazing! I also recommend the olive oil version.</li>
    <li> Would like to get in a larger size. This size and price more than buying 2 small at store</li>
    <li> Good hold, good for your hair, with absolutely no flacking</li>
    <li> The gel is fine but I was a bit upset that I recieved a busted container.</li>
    <li> I love this gel. The 32 oz. is huge and will last a long time.  It made my hair smooth and frizz free. My only problem is I think more argan oil should be added for a better shine.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t really do for my hair what I thought it would. It flakes,and makes my hair hard. So,now I have a thing of gel I rarely use...it smells nice,and it lays your edges down...glues them down lbs. Not for me.</li>
    <li> works great, no flakes, no odor comes off easy. Received package and cibtainer was broken and spilling out.</li>
    <li> I have only used this gel once. It made my hair dry. But if course t have very fine soft hair and probably used too much. I will give another try in the future</li>
    <li> I like the green economic much better but this is second choice.</li>
    <li> moistens my hair well and defines my curls....great product. No flakes either. Don&#x27;t leave in hair for more than two days as there&#x27;s a chance that your hair would become firm and dry. Use for styling but if used daily, be sure to rinse out.</li>
    <li> It was as just what I was expecting! Pleased with my order! Will order again!!!</li>
    <li> I was pleased that I came across this product on a you tube video and it works like a dream, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the way it works with my hair and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> Will never buy again! The gel broke and half the contain of gel I paid for was in my box.</li>
    <li> This is ok, but my hair became dull and lackluster.  I would use it again,  there is a lot of product, but I would not use consistently.</li>
    <li> LOVE  THE  PRODUCT  WAS  NOT  HAPPY  WITH  THE  WAY  IT  WAS  SHIPPED  TO  ME  CARDINE  L.  JORDAN</li>
    <li> I  love this gel. It gives my hair a shiny great hold without flaking or gumminess. Great product! : D</li>
    <li> Love this product in my hair. Argan oil works great in my hair, I have curly hair. Def recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love it; it keeps my hair very soft</li>
    <li> As I thought wonderfully packaged and for the size and price perfect.</li>
    <li> I received this gel today and applied it immediately to my wet,  freshly washed hair and combed it in.  I&#x27;m not a big hair product user,  but I do dye my hair regularly,  so it is normally pretty dry with lots of &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34;.  Once my hair air dried it looked amazing!  Soft,  shiny and smoother than I&#x27;ve seen it in years.  Not stiff or sticky. I can&#x27;t stop touching it or checking the mirror to make sure that I&#x27;m remembering it right.  It looks fabulous! I would recommend this in a heartbeat. I can&#x27;t wait to see what else I can do with my new movie star hair product.  Maybe I&#x27;ll even attempt to use a curling iron.  Lol</li>
