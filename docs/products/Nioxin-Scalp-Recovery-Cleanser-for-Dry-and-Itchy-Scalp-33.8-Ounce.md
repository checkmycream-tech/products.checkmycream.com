      <li>I&#x27;ll be able to find it when I need more.</li>

      <li>Together they provide a flake free scalp.</li>

      <li>Fortunately Fragrance.</li>
      <li>I like it a lot and scalp free.</li>
      <li>Nothing has worked as good as this so far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also been applying a special cream to my son&#x27;s rash, so that might be it too.</li>
      <li>Still not a bad value product - just not what he had anticipated.</li>
      <li>I love that it does not stink like other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried and it is effective in dealing with my dermatitis.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is great for people with oily scalps that ever get that funky smell if not washed everyday.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>The shampoo smells nice, lathers well and definitely calms my irritated scalp!  </li>
      <li>The conditioner is nice to because it has that same tingling affect on my scalp as the shampoo does.</li>
      <li>well worth it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It took three days to get full relief as my scalp was very inflamed.</li>
      <li>After using steroid shampoos for 3 months to clear up dry itchy scalp, this product works very well and leaves the hair in great condition.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve continued purchasing it since I first got wind of it years ago.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more in the future I just home</li>
      <li>But oh, the relief, to finally have periods when I&#x27;m itch free!</li>
      <li>So much better than T-Gel or Selsun Blue.</li>
      <li>The bottle is also massive, so should last a good while.</li>
      <li>gave results as fast as this shampoo on the first wash.&lt;br /&gt;Attached are pictures from today, March 28th 2015</li>
      <li>my scalp started to get really itchy/flaky.</li>
      <li>or if I&#x27;m somewhere that&#x27;s very humid.</li>
      <li>The Nioxin Scalp Recovery Cleanser added a yellow cast to my light gray hair after using it 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend buying Nioxin Scalp Recovery Medicating Cleanser!</li>
      <li>It made my scalp really really oily in the beginning though.  </li>
      <li>but there must be something in it that I&#x27;m allergic to as it makes me very itchy again, no matter</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t believe how fast this shampoo worked!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nioxin has proven to be soothing, gentle and has helped with the itching.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other products found at salons for dandruff or itchy scalp and nothing has worked as well as this.</li>
      <li>Usually my hair doesn&#x27;t look very oily on the second day but after using this shampoo for a week my hair was fairly oily at the end of the first day.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for people with seborrhea dermatitis.  </li>
      <li>It was normal to wash my relaxed hair once a week but now with locs</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s normal to freshen them up once a month depending on how sweat-active you are.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the shampoo it is part of the new line, or</li>
      <li>New</li>
      <li>After using this product I was able to eliminate that funky smell that usually developes if I don&#x27;t wash it twice a day.  </li>
      <li>This should be made clear in the description.  </li>
      <li>and her hair stays soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>It is the only one that has really worked for the flakes that drop on my husbands suit</li>
      <li>I do use the leave-in therapy solution as needed between washes, but only tiny dabs right at the scalp on my &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I had dry scalp and dandruff, I was trying a very differents products and nothing working.</li>
      <li>(second picture husband&#x27;s hair is still wet from washing)&lt;br /&gt;You can see in the before picture he has clusters of white flakes that are gone after the first wash!</li>
      <li>Depending on your scalp situation, though, it might take 2-3 washes initially to feel complete relief as it did for me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a cure-all as I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, but it has been positive so far.</li>
      <li>By purchasing this item online, the cost can be as much as 50% less than buying at a retail store.</li>
      <li>Finally a shampoo that manages my scalp dermatitis, relieves the nearly unbearable itching, and makes my long silver-and-gray hair look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Long story short</li>
<li> This is the only shampoo that has helped my dry scalp.</li>
<li> This is the only shampoo that works for my dry, flaky scalp.</li>
<li> We were not aware they offered two different strengths of the same product?  </li>
<li> However it is a big improvement from other treatments claiming to do the same.  </li>
<li> Ordered for my husband who has been using this product for a long time.  </li>
<li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
<li> My daughter has always had issues with dry, itchy scalp.</li>
<li> I was looking for a shampoo that would work with my dry hair.</li>
<li> Nothing has worked on my stubborn dry scalp except for this shampoo.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had a dry, itchy scalp this winter &amp; bought the Scalp Recovery Cleanser.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a few weeks, but I already notice a big difference in my scalp health.</li>
<li> I use this when ever my dry scalp acts up &amp; my scalp loves loves it!  </li>
<li> Was very surprised when this bottle was received that it has HALF the active ingredient as the smaller size bottle that had been purchased in the past.  </li>
<li> It did not work the way I expected</li>
<li> I often have to use it after my hair has dried from a shampooing, within a specific time window, then all itching stops.</li>
<li> found hidden away in my bathroom cabinet, so I gave it a try on what I call my &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34; and there was some relief from the itching plus the bumps on those spots started to shrink.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, after they were bought out and changed all their formulas a couple of years ago, none of the new formulas worked for me.</li>
<li> It does help a lot with the itching and burning of my scalp and does seem to cut down on the flakes, but unfortunately does not eliminate them completely.</li>
<li> I discovered I&#x27;d kept a little bottle of the leave-in scalp therapy,</li>
<li> I usually use this every other hair wash and it seems to do the trick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing shampoo!  So much better than T-Gel or Selsun Blue.</li>
    <li> product as described. No issue with delivery!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great.  I have been using it for years. I never have a flakey, itchy scalp with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo to hopefully help with my dry, itchy, flaky scalp that can be so bad that I get sores on my scalp.  The shampoo smells nice, lathers well and definitely calms my irritated scalp!  It does help a lot with the itching and burning of my scalp and does seem to cut down on the flakes, but unfortunately does not eliminate them completely. However it is a big improvement from other treatments claiming to do the same.  I use this shampoo in conjunction with a scalp brush I also purchased here off of Amazon and the Nioxin Scalp recovery Conditioner.  Even though I am not 100% flake free I will continue to use this treatment as it is the best I have found.  Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> I swear by Nioxin!  This product has been a God send for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my husband who has been using this product for a long time.  Was very surprised when this bottle was received that it has HALF the active ingredient as the smaller size bottle that had been purchased in the past.

    <li> It did not work the way I expected</li>
    <li> Did not work as promised for itchy  scalp, with no dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;I now have a lifetime supply of a worthless product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Joe</li>
    <li> I had itchy and flaky and oily scalp.  Tried a lot of different shampoos and this one got rid of the itch and flakes.  It made my scalp really really oily in the beginning though.  Usually my hair doesn&#x27;t look very oily on the second day but after using this shampoo for a week my hair was fairly oily at the end of the first day.  However after using it for a month it seemed to have gotten better.  Hopefully it&#x27;ll continue to improve.</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin for over 2 years. If you have flakes and nothing else has worked this is your Shampoo. It is not cheap but well worth it. You need to use the conditioner as well. Together they provide a flake free scalp.</li>
    <li> I use this when ever my dry scalp acts up &amp; my scalp loves loves it!  I also use the scalp recovery moisturizing conditioner along with it!  Highly recommended!! Thanks for the quick shipment ♥</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin before and liked it. I&#x27;ve had a dry, itchy scalp this winter &amp; bought the Scalp Recovery Cleanser. It&#x27;s done the trick! After only 2 shampoos my scalp itch is gone. Love this product!</li>
    <li> New just like they said thank u</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this for people with seborrhea dermatitis.  This is the only over-the-counter shampoo that has worked for my seborrhea.  Because of this, I don&#x27;t have to use the prescription treatments my dermatologist recommended.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now and you&#x27;d never know I had a scalp issue.  It doesn&#x27;t smell offensive like many scalp treatment shampoos do.  It has a light menthol-type fragrance.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  Depending on your scalp situation, though, it might take 2-3 washes initially to feel complete relief as it did for me.  Have had no problems since!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo that would work with my dry hair. Nioxin has proven to be soothing, gentle and has helped with the itching.

    <li> This shampoo is great for people with oily scalps that ever get that funky smell if not washed everyday.  After using this product I was able to eliminate that funky smell that usually developes if I don&#x27;t wash it twice a day.  Now I can go longer with no worries.  Great product.</li>
    <li> The reason I rated the product 5 stars is because the formula has changed from 2% to 1% and the ad did not state that fact.  Vendor service met expectations.</li>
    <li> This product works great!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic, better manageable hair</li>
    <li> Best product on the market for scalp problem./</li>
    <li> The Nioxin Scalp Recovery Cleanser added a yellow cast to my light gray hair after using it 2 weeks. Fortunately Fragrance.Net has an excellent return policy.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product several times online.  It is the best for dry-itchy scalp.  By purchasing this item online, the cost can be as much as 50% less than buying at a retail store.</li>
    <li> After using steroid shampoos for 3 months to clear up dry itchy scalp, this product works very well and leaves the hair in great condition.  I will use this forever!</li>
    <li> Nothing has worked on my stubborn dry scalp except for this shampoo. It&#x27;s excellent and is good for my hair too. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I had dry scalp and dandruff, I was trying a very differents products and nothing working. NioxiN scalp recovery, shampoo and conditioner , was my miracle solution. F</li>
    <li> I like it a lot and scalp free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a few weeks, but I already notice a big difference in my scalp health. I still have flakies, but not as bad. I don&#x27;t itch at all (I don&#x27;t think so anyway). My brother suggested I use this since the scalp problem runs in the family. I&#x27;ve tried all the medicated shampoos on the shelf at stores like Target and Fred Meyer. Nothing has worked as good as this so far. The only thing that&#x27;s bothering me, and I hope this isn&#x27;t a side affect from using the shampoo, is why my eczema is flaring up so badly on my hands. I&#x27;ve also been applying a special cream to my son&#x27;s rash, so that might be it too.</li>
    <li> My daughter has always had issues with dry, itchy scalp. This shampoo does the trick! and her hair stays soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> the only shampoo that works for my scalp. Too bad, the hair gets used to it and it becomes somewhat greasy.  Outstanding product!</li>
    <li> I have been use befor for 3year.&lt;br /&gt;But this is diffrent . My feel...and my hair...scalp is not working. Itch&amp;oily..</li>
    <li> It works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Works great w/out making my hair fall out.  I&#x27;ve continued purchasing it since I first got wind of it years ago.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this for months now and it is the best i have ever tried for treating dandruff nothing even comes close.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that works for my dry, flaky scalp. I won&#x27;t buy anything else in the future!</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that has helped my dry scalp. Will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> Great seller, awesome product, great package!! Recommend!</li>
    <li> AMAZING! Can&#x27;t believe how fast this shampoo worked!&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been battling flakes caused by Psoriasis for years and we have tried everything: from medication, tar based shampoos, to lotions and nothing gave results as fast as this shampoo on the first wash.&lt;br /&gt;Attached are pictures from today, March 28th 2015 (second picture husband&#x27;s hair is still wet from washing)&lt;br /&gt;You can see in the before picture he has clusters of white flakes that are gone after the first wash! The redness is still there, but the flakes are gone. Highly recommend buying Nioxin Scalp Recovery Medicating Cleanser!</li>
    <li> Life saver!&lt;br /&gt;The only time I can do without it is during the summer or if I&#x27;m somewhere that&#x27;s very humid.</li>
    <li> After I had my son my scalp started to get really itchy/flaky. Used the over the counter stuff but it never seemed to work and made my hair smell weird. Not sure if it&#x27;s dermatitis or what but I know it goes hand in hand with the oily skin. This shampoo is the only thing that works. I only put it on my scalp and use my salon shampoo for the rest of my hair. It works for me. I realized how well it&#x27;s been working once I ran out and the oily/itchy symptoms came back almost instantly. I usually use this every other hair wash and it seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> Finally a shampoo that manages my scalp dermatitis, relieves the nearly unbearable itching, and makes my long silver-and-gray hair look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many years I used Nioxin&#x27;s System 1 to keep my scalp and hair healthy. Unfortunately, after they were bought out and changed all their formulas a couple of years ago, none of the new formulas worked for me. Since then I&#x27;ve struggled with a scalp so itchy and painful that I&#x27;ve had whole-body allergic reactions at their worst. The condition also has impacted my sleep quality as I&#x27;d wake up itching and unable to go back to sleep!  I tried every OTC dandruff treatment I could find, vinegar rinses, etc. Apple cider vinegar worked the best but didn&#x27;t completely control the itching, plus I didn&#x27;t like smelling like salad dressing all the time! I also tried prescription ketoconizole shampoo, but that just burned my scalp. Plus lots of antihistamines to relieve the itching, but that didn&#x27;t get to the root cause, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my last foray into NIOXIN I discovered I&#x27;d kept a little bottle of the leave-in scalp therapy, found hidden away in my bathroom cabinet, so I gave it a try on what I call my &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34; and there was some relief from the itching plus the bumps on those spots started to shrink. So I decided to check the Nioxin website a month ago and discovered this shampoo. I don&#x27;t know if the shampoo it is part of the new line, or if I&#x27;d just missed it before, but I was thrilled to find it. I started by buying a kit with the shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took three days to get full relief as my scalp was very inflamed. But oh, the relief, to finally have periods when I&#x27;m itch free! Now, after using the shampoo for a month, I only get bad itching if I wait too long to shampoo (max 3 days), so I try to shampoo at least every-other day. Since I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of things and also have rosacea  there are times when I must shampoo every day as my reactivity can vary. I also wash in and around my ears when shampooing (rinsing thoroughly), so my ears no longer itch, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the conditioner but there must be something in it that I&#x27;m allergic to as it makes me very itchy again, no matter how well I rinse. I do use the leave-in therapy solution as needed between washes, but only tiny dabs right at the scalp on my &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34;. I often have to use it after my hair has dried from a shampooing, within a specific time window, then all itching stops. Don&#x27;t know why this is so, but it works so I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I have my life back. Anyone who&#x27;s struggled with seborrheaic dermatitis knows how good that feels.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it if you have scalp buildup issues. I gave it to my husband and he seems to like it.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using Nioxin Scalp Recovery I have not had any dandruff!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It is the only one that actually helps with my itchy scalp and dandruff. I usually have these issues in the change of weather or especially when it is very cold outside and this product is a must in my beauty line. I&#x27;ve tried so many other products found at salons for dandruff or itchy scalp and nothing has worked as well as this.</li>
    <li> I have (dread) locs almost to my butt and I&#x27;m from The Bahamas. It was normal to wash my relaxed hair once a week but now with locs it&#x27;s normal to freshen them up once a month depending on how sweat-active you are. Long story short I wash my locs once a month. I love the shampoo already and I&#x27;ve only used it once. The conditioner is nice to because it has that same tingling affect on my scalp as the shampoo does. I love that it does not stink like other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried and it is effective in dealing with my dermatitis. I will be purchasing more in the future I just home I&#x27;ll be able to find it when I need more.</li>
    <li> best dandruff shampoo out there.</li>
    <li> This Shampoo is awesome. It is the only one that has really worked for the flakes that drop on my husbands suit jackets.&lt;br /&gt;No more flakes!</li>
