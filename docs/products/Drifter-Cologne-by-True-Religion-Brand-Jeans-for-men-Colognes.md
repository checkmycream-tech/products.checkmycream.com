<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this.  Great smelling and great price</li>
    <li> it smell like alcohol, not much fragance</li>
    <li> Pleasant men&#x27;s cologne.  Satisfied.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted to get this for her boyfriend for his birthday.  We first saw it in a department store, but we didn&#x27;t buy it because it was very expensive.  I decided to check on Amazon.com and it was almost 1/2 the price!  We ordered it and her boyfriend absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> My grandson loves this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice smell but Not really that different.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. I am very pleased with it! I have bought other colognes and perfumes online before. This one seems to have been the most efficient and smells exactly like if you were to buy it in the store!</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne for my husband by far. Box came a little worn and looked used but the bottle feels full and looks new. For the price I definitely couldn&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> smells good and good quality and good price</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this Cologne. Got it for my son and I know he will love it. Not a strong cheap scent/not over powering. Great for fall/winter.The container is absolutely wonderful. Looks like a  vintage flask made w/ leather. The stitching is perfect. Very HANDSOME product. Whoever came up with the bottle design deserves an award. It could even become a collectors item someday. I cant say enough about it. Love the name the logo! Thank you for a wonderful item!</li>
    <li> The Brand is good but the smell is very normal. Nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;Even a cheap cologne will be better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it !</li>
    <li> Extra satisfied with my order!  Will definitely shop with this seller again for this product</li>
    <li> Love this cologne, however doesnt seem to last as long as the last one I had that came from macys</li>
    <li> I wear this colone daily. Its not to musky and not to light. At the end of the day the colone is still detecable on skin. GREAT PRICE, I have not found this anywhere cheaper, and its exactly the same as what is sold in pricey department stores. Very generous size...will probably never completly use it.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and arrived when promised</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments on this which is sometimes frustrating because I usually purchase high end stuff for $150 and up and DON&#x27;T get compliments on those lol! I bought 4 bottles of this and gave em to my buddies last Christmas. This sells for $80 at my local True Religion store in Columbia MD.</li>
    <li> I love it...  Can&#x27;t keep the women off me! Even the older ones 75 yrs and older. ...have a great day</li>
    <li> I brought it for my boyfriend and he loves it.. he wears it all the time n I like the bottle very expensive looking</li>
    <li> I must say rarely ever do I buy cologne let alone like the smell. This cologne smell so good and its not overpowering at all but in the same respect is not dull like you can&#x27;t smell it either its perfect.And its last pretty long to. Even overnight it was faintly there. Its great for anything and smell manly. My package arrived on time as prediced. Got lots of compliment on. A must buy for anyone who wants good cologne at a good price.</li>
    <li> Love it, found it at Kohls a few years ago, tried it then and liked it and my wife likes it too - the important thing. Glad to find it on Amazon, now I can order without shopping.</li>
    <li> smells good. all the ladies love it! haha but seriously in my professional opinion this stuff smells good and seems to stick around for a while too.</li>
    <li> Bottle was leaking when it arrived. Lost nearly half the cologne.</li>
    <li> This is the cologne that my son wears. This cologne is very expensive and this was a great price. This is a Christmas gift for him.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is perfect for the fall and winter. I purchased it last year and I really like it alot. Got a ton of compliments on it. Even my homeboys that spend $100-$150 bucks on high-end cologne wanted to know what was the name of this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Not over powering</li>
    <li> People cant wait to undress you when you wear this.</li>
    <li> Would use it here and there...</li>
    <li> Great smell !! Strangers tell me all the time lol.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne. Not a heavy smell. Very pleasant aroma...not over powering or offensive. You feel and smell great.</li>
    <li> Overall, the product smells amazing! Everyone loves it I bought it for my fiancé and he loves it! Great price also!</li>
    <li> I was Very pleased with the product! It was a gift for my father and he loved it as well! Thanks :)</li>
    <li> one of the only places I could find this product. good price, quick shipping, great product</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to order a cologne I&#x27;d never smelled, but there were a lot of positive reviews from people who gave this as a gift.  It&#x27;s a good masculine smell, and it&#x27;s not too strong to wear during the day.  My boyfriend loves it. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband. He came to visit me at work and all of my coworkers loved it. They kept asking me what my husband was wearing. It has a nice manly scent. Not fruity like some cologne.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the delivery time and the basic quality of this product.  The problem is that it was promoted as a cologne rather than an eau de toilette.  One would expect a higher concentration and higher price with a cologne and conversely a lower price with e.d.t.  The seller contacted me to explain that eau de toilette is the only form this product comes in and that Amazon is responsible for the title. Other sellers advertised their product as eau de toilette and some had a lower price!  I see the title has since been revised to &amp;#34;eau de toilette&amp;#34; and the price reduced $8, however, I did not receive a price adjustment.</li>
    <li> Smells great and isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
    <li> Preface:  Decided to give the Drifter a shot, since I love the original True Religion cologne soo much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  Not a huge fan.  It was alright, the scent just wasn&#x27;t for me.  I ended up getting (2) 1.7 oz bottles instead of the (1) 3.4oz bottle as ordered.  Seeing as how the original is a bit cheaper, and I&#x27;ve been happy with it for years, I plan to stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like its counterpart, a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ll continue to keep this in the rotation until its entirely used up.  I don&#x27;t plan to reorder.</li>
    <li> Nice easy going everyday wear, not long lasting.</li>
    <li> Smells great on my husband. Everyone that walks by him takes a double smell lol I will be ordering more very soon.</li>
    <li> I like it,....not bad at all. It faces stiff competition with my other colognes and its not a true standout but great for the price!</li>
    <li> Has a unique scent, nice but a bit faint, for casual wear, it was a present and the recipient liked the scent, definitely not overbearing</li>
    <li> Smells really good and would suggest anyone to try it out my fiancé loved it and I want to get more</li>
    <li> it is just what he wanted. it smelled very very good. I will look for more, and tell others too.</li>
    <li> now, that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m talking about!! this is good, I brought the other one also.. I wish True Religion made more!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son-in-law as he had worn it previously and was on his Christmas list.  I liked the smell of it and the fact that it isn&#x27;t too strong and doesn&#x27;t wear off too quickly.</li>
    <li> It smells great!! And the price was the best! My grandson thought this was the best thing since apple pie!!</li>
    <li> almost empty and the box was wet by spend perfume.</li>
    <li> Smells good, came sealed and the price was good much better than paying for it at buckle. I love it</li>
    <li> Smells just like the stuff I buy in the store locally but for half the price!</li>
    <li> has a great smell! and its a large bottle so I imagine it will last a long time. plan to get another when i do run out</li>
    <li> its awesome its one of my best</li>
    <li> The item was exactly what I wanted, it was brand new and came very quickly. I am more than happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Ladies love it but this one is a little weak. Just a little bit or maybe you just get used to it you don&#x27;t notice. I splashed this on and an hour later I could not smell it. But a lady did ask what it was bc she thought I smelled great.</li>
    <li> Great cologne, great value.  Good everyday fragrance.  Multiple uses.  Smells more like a more expensive cologne.  Try it today yourself.</li>
    <li> it is a good product for the money. I have received complements and i have had it a few months and i am not tired of the scent. i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> very nice purchase fits great.</li>
    <li> It Smells just as good as the 60 dollar bottle you can buy at the buckle or order. Just saved money :)</li>
    <li> It is great and I received it the best two days or so, and the price was perfect for it.</li>
    <li> This cologne is nice and smells good, however the tip gets stuck and must be pried back up to allow for the next spray. I end up having to spend about 5 minutes trying to rip the cap back open every time I use it. It is quite annoying.</li>
    <li> My husband wears this and ALWAYS gets compliments from random women, young and old, about how good he smells.  I love this fragrance and highly recommend it; it&#x27;s a slightly earthy, spicy but also clean and fresh scent, which is hard to find.  In my experience, men&#x27;s fragrance is usually one or the other.  This is a perfect combo of both! Just strong enough to make you notice, but doesn&#x27;t burn your nostrils.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> Great cologne! Love the smell.</li>
    <li> The item that I purchased was exactly what I want when I ordered it. It smells great and the person I gave it to love it too.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Boyfriend and it smells amazing and lasts long</li>
    <li> It was what we were looking for in Cologne for my husband! I bought it for him when it first came out in the Belks store! And that&#x27;s all he wants !!!😀 he loves True Religion (Drifted) .</li>
    <li> the smell is awesome , great product and was  the real thing. recomend  to all my friends and  family! k</li>
    <li> I got this for my wedding, and it came on time, and nothing was wrong with the bottle or the packaging at all.</li>
    <li> i smelled this on some dude and said &amp;#34;uh so whats that stink you got on ya&amp;#34; and he said this stuff so i ordered it. its good but maybe just not for me or maybe its smells better to other people but not one girl has tried to rape me in public since I&#x27;ve started to use it so thats why i gave it 4 stars but if you&#x27;ve smelt it True Religion dealt it</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.....and, I love the smell of it on him too!!!!!  This was a great value!!!!</li>
    <li> I was blown away at its price (only $28.15/3.4 ounce when I bought it). This is a bargain compared to many other colognes at this volume (3.4 ounces is your typical larger bottle volume for cologne brands).    It smells great to put on right after a shower. It&#x27;s the most manly, non-too flowery or cool water smelling (like Nautica or Cool Water cologne types) without being a real musky kind like your grandfather or father wore. I&#x27;m often getting compliments, even when my straight guy buddies get a whiff of it. Don&#x27;t worry if you&#x27;re targeting only the ladies, I&#x27;ve had plenty of compliments from them, too. The pleather (at least I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s real) and brass looking metal bottle is a great design, feel, and added touch to keep on the bathroom counter or your dresser. It does tend to fade off a little quicker than other colognes, but fading strength in general is normal with many colognes. I could be just over thinking it since I read this complaint in other reviews on here prior to purchasing it.    I think it&#x27;s a good medium strength scent that can go with any season, winter to summer, although I only have experience with wearing it in the summer so far. Try it out in a store if you haven&#x27;t yet, I tried it from a sample at Kohl&#x27;s, and if you like the scent then I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.    UPDATE: This 3.4 ounce bottle last me from June through January (7 months), with daily use. It works for the winter as well. I decided to purchase their original scent and it&#x27;s just as amazing. It has a similar smell to it, just a little more mellow? I received a compliment on the first day. I suggest you purchase a 1.7 ounce of both unless you really know you want just one of them, although it&#x27;s not cost effective. There&#x27;s nothing you can do wrong if you purchase the large bottle, it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m truly a big fan of these two True Religion colognes. They are amazing.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Common guys don&#x27;t miss it.</li>
    <li> Amazing price for this product. It smells so great, my husband keeps looking for excuses to wear it. I would definitely smell it at a department store first and test it with your body. While it smells one way on the display, it will smell different with different body chemistry. Fortunately it smelled great and was a great value for the price!</li>
    <li> Perfect just what I needed.</li>
    <li> This is a truly amazing deal for this cologne..have priced it in stores and this was best price by far..received item much quicker than anticipated also..</li>
    <li> Awesome cologne the only fragrance I wear</li>
    <li> The smell is legit (you can find a tester at a local Target) and the price for it is a bargain&lt;br /&gt;when compared to prices outside of cyberworld.&lt;br /&gt;Love the name and the compliments received from women&lt;br /&gt;whenever I wear this.&lt;br /&gt;Fresh yet strong enough to only require one spray for more than a few hours of&lt;br /&gt;scent.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks True Religion(!).</li>
    <li> I received this pretty Quick!! wasn&#x27;t sure how it would smell (buying online) But it is really nice.  It is a little strong when you first spray it on but it calms down and leaves a very nice scent!!</li>
    <li> Think one of my friends will purchase one luvs the smell. But i wish the bottle was clear so i could see when its about to finish to buy another.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cologne and I couldnt ask for a better price!</li>
    <li> True Religion is simply awesome</li>
    <li> Found this cologne at Macy&#x27;s and they wanted $45 for the same size bottle, found it on here for a lot cheaper. Smells great all day.</li>
    <li> Smell&#x27;s Fabulous!  Should have ordered more! I worry sometimes that it&#x27;s old and doesn&#x27;t have the smell as a newer bottle. What a great price Love it!</li>
    <li> It smells like bug spray, thank god it doesn&#x27;t last very long otherwise i&#x27;d have to wash it off myself</li>
    <li> Always the best purchase I make!</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my husband and he has loved it.  It is much better than the other brand he was using.</li>
    <li> Saw the reviews for this cologne so I bought it because I was looking for something new to try.  I enjoy a variety of colognes.  But, this cologne smells awful.  Smells like cheap cologne, and it is overpowering.  It gives me a headache.  Will stick to reputable design houses in the future.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells great, awesome price, will buy again</li>
    <li> Smell wears off fast...too fast..but for when it&#x27;s there it smells good.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 16 yr old grandson.  He says it smells great and really likes it alot.  I opened it when it was delivered (which was also fast) and I like it too.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty good. I don&#x27;t really know what to say about cologne.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed plenty of compliments I would purchase</li>
    <li> I love this scent. I had never smelled this before until I got it through Amazon. Will be a regular purchased scent.</li>
    <li> From the amount you buy, to the price you pay, to the way it draws attention it&#x27;s a pretty good deal. You will find better smelling colognes no doubt but not everyone, especially a college student, has $60 to spend on 2.5oz worth of Hollister. If you want to find a decent casual cologne at a great price this one is the one I would go for.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and came three days early</li>
    <li> Great purchase love the fragrance super price fast delivery highly recommend</li>
    <li> I CANT TELL HOW GREAT THIS SCENT IS AND THE COST ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY</li>
    <li> Met all of my expectations.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance! Luv the scent! Is it the best quality cologne? No but for the price and to have as an everyday work or weekend casual this one is a keeper. I read some say the smell doesn&#x27;t last? Remember guys, guys tend to over spray way to heavy, cologne should be subtle. The ladies can smell you a mile a way...no one likes over kill. If your a sweat hog, disco Dan, yes the scent may not last.&lt;br /&gt;Spray True Religion on and you too can howl at the moon while the ladies purr!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here, smells original and full strength.  I&#x27;ve never been disappointed</li>
    <li> My favorite scent, Been using it for years</li>
    <li> It smells great, it&#x27;s just a bummer that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other colognes</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne so far, I first smelled it in Kohls and I was about to buy it, but it was very expensive (50 dls for 1.7 Oz) so I waited to see if I could find it online and I got a very good deal from Amazon on the 3.4 oz, so I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I bought it for my husband for Christmas and it smells amazing. Great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> This got to me quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Would love to get some this year, also.</li>
    <li> It smells like ladies&#x27; perfume and THEY DON&#x27;T ACCEPTED RETURNS!!!</li>
    <li> Very impressed I got it in 2 days after I ordered and I got it for $28 and not $80</li>
    <li> Great buy. Great fragrance.</li>
    <li> I got a bigger bottle for more than $20 less than the store price! Great value and smells great too!</li>
    <li> He also really loved that it cost much less than we priced in the department store!  He smells wonderful, and it was at a fraction of the big store price!</li>
    <li> Both my young adult sons wear this cologne.  Bought two bottles for Christmas gifts.  Good price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love true religion but this stuff stinks and is unwearable...terrible smell - reminds me of cheap toilet bowl cleaner or some nasty cheap kitchen soap cleaner...i am stuck with it as i am not sure if I can send it back opened ....so I just wasted 40 bucks on something I will throw away and never use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;zero stars and would recommend not buying</li>
    <li> Quickest shipment I&#x27;ve ever received. Great experience all around and an awesome product!  I would recommend to anyone looking to buy online.</li>
    <li> Good product the smell is strong at first but doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as a few of the other colognes i&#x27;ve been testing out.</li>
    <li> It smelled really good and my hoes love it doe thank u amazon</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne. My boyfriend wanted it for his birthday and it was such a great price. The only problem was that it was delivered in a fragrance.net labeled box so it was very obvious what was inside.</li>
    <li> I smelled it in a store once, and I was happy to find it at a better price on here.  If you&#x27;re looking for a very clean scent with a hit of muskiness, I highly recommend this cologne.</li>
    <li> Nice smelling cologne</li>
    <li> Smells good great price</li>
    <li> I like it.  My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Usually $60 for the 1.7 so $27 for the 3.2 is a great price.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this smell but I am not as crazy about it. It has a strong pepper like smell.</li>
    <li> smells so good and lasts all day</li>
    <li> The scent of this cologne just cannot be beaten!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, and the cologne arrived earlier than anticipated.  The price is less than purchasing at local department stores, and is authentic.  In the past I have had issues with cologne being &amp;#34;watered-down&amp;#34;; however, this is the exact product that offers a clean and professional for those who prefer a &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; cologne.</li>
    <li> I brought this as a gift for my husband. It was fir christmas. I really love the way it smells on him.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells on my husband.</li>
    <li> Ladies love it don&#x27;t listen to the haters this stuff is this bomb</li>
    <li> Great man smell recommend it</li>
    <li> The smell is great and long lasting! It isn&#x27;t as strong as I might have hoped, however, it definitely gets the job done. I would recommend this if you are trying to find a new scent.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Lots of compliments and will order again!</li>
    <li> I saw this cologne in Sams wholesale club at over twice this amount. This was a great deal! I loved the smell from the beginning</li>
    <li> This is just a mediocre scent to me. I do enjoy the dry down so I will likely work it into my rotation</li>
    <li> I was shopping at a local department store and they had a bottle half this size for the same price. Smells awesome and the price is right!</li>
    <li> Nice smell! I&#x27;m a woman but love men&#x27;s cologne at all times. The smell is subtle and not strong, I usually spritz this at my ears and neck that includes my scarf. Boy, it smells trully good. Will purchase more in future.</li>
    <li> The reason I gave this cologne 3 stars is because it does NOT last long, but it smells heavenly and I love it, only wish it did not disappear so quick. I guess one could keep a bottle near by and give a little squirt when needed that would solve that problem.</li>
    <li> Dig this product! Reminds me of my favorite Ruehl calogne.</li>
    <li> My babe loves it!!! Plus a Great price, will order again</li>
    <li> Great long lasting smell for the younger generations. I never, and I quite literally mean never, wear cologne or other disgusting, overpowering scents and I actually like this stuff. Smells great, but not over-potent and lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
    <li> nice scent but less stronger than the EDT the cologne smells different but still good</li>
    <li> Not as long lasting as promised</li>
    <li> Ordered Nov 2nd &amp; rec&#x27;d Nov 6th. My husband loves this cologne and it&#x27;s cheaper than buying it at the mall.  We don&#x27;t notice any difference in the scent.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. It&#x27;s one of my favorites, other than the original True Religion cologne. The biggest plus is that my wife loves it on me. Great price, can&#x27;t be beat for $28. Department stores ask approximately $58 for a bottle this size. I would advise anyone to go to a store and test this product first, of course.</li>
    <li> it smells ok.. not what I was expecting.. it smells like everything else out there. will not but any more cologne with out smelling it first.</li>
    <li> smells great and for the price u cant go wrong with it. First time trying it and if u looking for something different then here it is. Im a college student so i got to smell  expensive for a reasonable price. get urself one</li>
    <li> Great value for the price.  Got my bf a sample a while back and he loved the smell. I was happy to find a great deal on the size</li>
    <li> Great Great Smell!!!!! will buy more in the near future to come! True Religion is overall great i love it ひ</li>
    <li> The cologne goes on very strong. However, after about 20 minutes it is a manly, and strong scent that I have gotten many compliments on.</li>
    <li> great! smells great! arrived fast!</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne thinking it would last all day, but it did not. It smells nice but the scent doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I smelled this in the department store and a big box store, the price was twice the amount so it is a great deal. awesome!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good cologne but not great. I&#x27;ve gotten better compliments from other stuff. I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to colognes. I like it when my cologne smells like I just got out of the shower and I just happen to naturally smell fresh and manly. This screams cologne. Which is what I didn&#x27;t want. Anyone knows you&#x27;re wearing it, which they will think it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for going out occasions. Like going to the club and meeting girls. Going out. But not great if you want to wear it all the time. Regardless of where you&#x27;re going. Work, the mall, a date, even just to chill at a friends or lady&#x27;s place or even for going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cologne for that cali et would be one of my other bottles I&#x27;ve used... It&#x27;s called Nautica Voyage. This one is the real deal if you want to wear something without people knowing you&#x27;re even wearing a cologne. I&#x27;m actually going to make a review on this particular one because I miss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually going to buy it again but decided to give others a try. I don&#x27;t regret it one bit though, because Drifter by True Religion is still a very great cologne. Just not for me. :)</li>
    <li> Currently my Number 2 on my top 5 favorite perfumes/ colognes, it smells really good. the scent stays on for  a couple days if you spray it on clothing. I wear it on my work shirt and it smells great after each use. great product for the great price. I compared prices with other retailers like Kohl&#x27;s and they have it for twice as much. I would recommend this product with no doubt. Girls like a guy who smells good, so this will definitely do the job.</li>
    <li> Does not tell you in the description that it&#x27;s eau de toiletté based .... Waited until the cologne was in my presence and it says it on the bottle and that&#x27;s not the kind I was looking for</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!!!! Smells amazing! Bought it for my boyfriend and I love the way it smells on him I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> items shipped fast and got it in time..was cool for the money and would recommend to all if you need something cool and affordable this the item for you</li>
    <li> I originally bought this because I liked the branding / the way the bottle looked. When it arrived I gave it a try and it smells really good. Cant go wrong with the price either.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne to wear in the summer and in the early fall. In the summer the smell goes well together with a good summer-beachy outfit at the beach! This cologne reminds me so much of the beach.</li>
    <li> Got 1st bottle as a gift, bought a second bottle, smells great get complemented on it all the time. Would recommend</li>
    <li> Very strong, musky, lasts a long time if you spray enough.  Remember, never rub, always press.  It&#x27;ll make the cologne last longer instead of rubbing it away.  Gave it 3 stars because when breathed in you&#x27;ll feel light headed, even if it&#x27;s a couple sprays, and so it&#x27;s probably super bad fo yo lungs if breathed in.  Plus the original cologne is a lot better.  But if you&#x27;re going out and you swear off stuff quick use it cuz da b***** luv it n they&#x27;ll tell you u smell fine!</li>
    <li> Smells great, does not last more than an hour.</li>
    <li> its a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buyits a good buy i like it ok</li>
    <li> Thanks to the weather the bottle was cold at touch. It has a leather top and metal bottom. Arrived when expected and smells sexy.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son and he loves it. Amazon had the best price by far too. He likes it, I like it and would recommend it to anyone. Plus, the flask like bottle is neat!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my brother-in-law and he loved it. I too thought that it was fabulous. I usually buy the Armani perfume for myself but I am going to get a bottle of this fragrance for myself too. The price is excellent!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it! Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I buy all my cologne from Amazon wouldn&#x27;t buy it anywhere else 30 ish for a bottle great deal great smell</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling cologne, I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> not as good as the earlier version of True Religion for men but still not bad.</li>
    <li> Distinctive. Smooth like worn in leather, spice, and a calm end note. Doesn&#x27;t smell like a lot of the stuff other guys are wearing so if you want to stand out from the crowd, get this. You just have to spray it more than me throughout the day or night. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Recommended!</li>
    <li> My wife loves the fragrance and I get compliments from many other people. Mostly women.Do yourself a favor and try some for yourself.</li>
    <li> Great item, Great Seller</li>
    <li> Love the smell...a smooth scent...bought it for Hubby for Christmas...he loves it too.</li>
    <li> Okay this thing i got was A STEAL. i mean really i went to ulta saw the same thing same smell for the like 80$.  At first it smells generic but when after the cologne evaporates and the fumes of it goes it that&#x27;s why its so different. It&#x27;s more like a 80$ version of axe label wise considering it&#x27;s made by true religion.</li>
    <li> Ladies love this scent.  It wears off a little quickly but still a great.  It also arrived earlier than stated.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, not over powering, my wife and daughter liked the smell. First time to try it and will order again.</li>
    <li> The fragrence is amazing</li>
    <li> this was also a buy for the holidays.  the price was good,as I had shopped around,  I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Shipping: was fast and accurate Product: Was Exactly what I was looking for. Every last one of my orders went exactly the same and I&#x27;ve had several KEEP IT UP!!!!</li>
    <li> Was a gift for a family member, he loves it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great cologne. My boyfriend wears it every time we go out.</li>
    <li> Omg it smell sooo good,and it&#x27;s long lasting</li>
    <li> My 6th time getting this, last really long and really a Chick Magnet!.. love it</li>
    <li> Amazon is one of the only places left that I can find this cologne.  Several local retailers used to sell it, but I can&#x27;t find it in my city any more.  I stocked up since I think it may be on it&#x27;s way to being discontinued (just a guess).  It&#x27;s the only cologne I wear now days.  It&#x27;s perfect for every occasion, every season, and it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son for his birthday and he loves it and he get alot of compliments....</li>
    <li> Much better price than Macy&#x27;s or Dillards, etc.  Was a gift for my son for Christmas!  He was very happy with it!</li>
    <li> True experience from true religion!</li>
    <li> Listen guys. Trust me on this 1. Price is great and it smells AMAZING. I&#x27;m always getting complements</li>
    <li> This smells yummy on my man!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and a great price!</li>
    <li> Love this cologne.  I&#x27;ve had several compliments on it so I decided to buy me another before I ran out of the one I bought about a year ago.</li>
    <li> Pump mechanism was crushed, but I managed.</li>
    <li> ...........Trust me. Buy it</li>
    <li> Seriously great buy! I usually buy &amp;#34;Pleasures&amp;#34; or some of the more pricey colognes, was pleasantly surprised with the bang for my buck!</li>
    <li> So I received this cologne last year for my birthday (Sept 2011). its an excellent fall/winter fragrance. I work in an office environment, I got complimented all the time on the Fragrance.. but It wears off a little bit after lunch. For the price I love the fragrance enough to buy it.. but if you are looking for alternatives that will last a bit longer I&#x27;d Really recommend [[ASIN:B001M9KX78 Ed Hardy Love Luck By Christian Audigier for Men Eau De Toilette Spray, 3.4-Ounce]] I KNOW IKNOW I kinda dislike all things ED Hardy But trust me this cologne will last all day and smells wonderful..</li>
    <li> Wear it with a nice leather jacket and a better hair cut on a first date. She&#x27;ll invite you up for &amp;#34;coffee&amp;#34; when you drop her off.</li>
    <li> Very very light smelling. Other than that is a nice product and my boyfriend loved it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son!! He&#x27;s into cologne the same way his mom is into perfume!! We love to smell as good as we feel!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, lasts a longer period than most</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and in the original box.  The cologne smells awesome.  My husband loved it.</li>
    <li> I Have always been a really big fan of TR I also have the womans perfume and I love it. I have recently perchased this cologne for my boyfriend it smells so yummy but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long at all give it 30 min to a hour and you have to spray it again. something you have to keep with you all day not worth the money, it wont last long. love the smell but no bueno that the smell doesn&#x27;t last!!.</li>
</ol>
