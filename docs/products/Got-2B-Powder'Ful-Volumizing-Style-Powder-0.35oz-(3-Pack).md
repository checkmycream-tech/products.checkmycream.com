    <li> works just as advertised.  You can use it in dry or slightly wet hair.  Doesn&#x27;t work well with wet hair.  My hair is on the thin to medium fullness before use and feels and looks on the thick side with great volume.</li>
    <li> Last year I went through chemo and lost all of my hair.  A year later it feels like it is taking forever to finally grow back in.  It&#x27;s thinner on top now as a result of the type of chemo that I was on.  This product helps your hair have more volume instantly.  I was expecting something similar to the keratin hair fibers I&#x27;ve used before but this is more of a thicker consistency.  A little goes a long way so be sure you don&#x27;t go overboard until you are familiar with how much it takes to achieve the volume you want.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing when used sparingly.</li>
    <li> Absolute BEST volumizing hair product ever!!! Where has this stuff been all my life? I tried this product by a different brand on the advice of my hair stylist and was very skeptical. But, it creates volume like nothing else. This brand is the same at less than half the price. I don&#x27;t understand any of the bad reviews. It is a powder, and when put into the hair, it does make my hair feel different. BUT, people don&#x27;t go around touching my hair all day. But they do look at it. And I can finally get my hair to do what I want it to. And, it cuts my styling time way down. You must try this!!!</li>
    <li> Best hair hold product I have used. Gives a natural look and solid hold!</li>
    <li> and not alot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need this stuff! I can&#x27;t leave the house without it! put a little on your roots, and dry! Voila! I look almost normal!</li>
    <li> surprisingly... found out by accident, this hair powder help with my scalp psoriasis! Takes away the itch!</li>
    <li> This product is a great alternative to teasing your hair and definitely provides you with more volume that lasts throughout the day. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> So sorry this is out of production.  Grabbing up all I can afford. Have been using about a year and it really helps thinning hair hold its shape.</li>
    <li> First time using this product - great for fine hair!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like magic! lol Gives my hair instant volume, great product!</li>
    <li> Great powder that is light and awesome for short pixie cuts!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Just a small amount provides just enough body without looking or feeling like chemicals have been added. I&#x27;ll not be without this. It probably works as well for long hair, but I know it&#x27;s perfect for short cuts.</li>
    <li> Love the stuff!!! Can&#x27;t get it in the drugstore anymore.</li>
    <li> Very convenient even for traveling</li>
    <li> I think this product does everything it claims to.  This is probably a third or fourth repeat order on 2B Powder Volumizing Style Powder.  I always pack it in my makeup bag when traveling.  I is especially good if I am going to be in a high humidity area.  Also, I frequently use it during the week if I have a number of commitments and little time to devote to my hair.  A real winner.</li>
    <li> It works well for my fine hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This makes my thin hair look fuller. It also changed the texture of my curly hair to manageable.</li>
