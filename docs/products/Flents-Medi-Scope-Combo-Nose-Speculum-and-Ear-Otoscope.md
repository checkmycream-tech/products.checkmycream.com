### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>very happy with seller and product</li>
      <li>It has great attachments, to check their eyes, ears, nose and throat!</li>
      <li>Great product for in home use.</li>
      <li>then you better look elsewhere!</li>
      <li>As it turned out, mine was defective, but I was glad it was because the whole thing didn&#x27;t feel like it was very good quality.</li>
      <li>no matter what your children&#x27;s ages are, it&#x27;s a huge help!</li>
      <li>I just wished the attachments would stay on better.</li>
      <li>Much better quality</li>
      <li>I think one of these from the toy department at a grocery store would be of better quality.  </li>
      <li>The product is okay.</li>
      <li>Though it was cheaper in cost, it was of a better quality.</li>
      <li>I had my husband try just to be sure</li>
      <li>This light has more features than I realized.</li>
      <li>It felt more like a fisher price toy you would buy for your child to play doctor than a functional light to see inside the ear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest investing in something better and went with the Dr. Mom scope with the LED light.</li>
      <li>This is so cheaply made and it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing but a penlight with a piece of mylar foil to reflect the light.</li>
      <li>For the price, I knew/assumed it would be cheaply made, but hoped it would be adequate for the job.</li>
      <li>and it looks more professional.</li>
      <li>I bought this at CVS because we needed one immediately, to figure out if we should take our 3 year old to urgent care or wait and see if she was better in the morning.</li>
      <li>This could be useful to check the throat or to check for earWAX</li>
      <li>Returned it for a refund, and am now looking for a better unit to have for next time.</li>
      <li>I am sure it is the same kit because it looked exactly like this</li>
      <li>i have used it multiple times since getting it mostly for sore throats but will use it if there is ear pain too.    </li>
      <li>Of two brands of scopes I have recently purchased, this one was the better product.</li>
      <li>I plan on buying several more for a clinic overseas.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The light was also somewhat dim.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t see inside the ear, which is the whole point.</li>
      <li>However, the product gives enough light to see.</li>
      <li>The price was very inexpensive, the shipping was prompt, and the product as desribed.</li>
      <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this product for any mother,</li>
      <li>this will be my presents to new parents for now on</li>
      <li>I do wish I had spent the extra to get a better one.</li>
      <li>Absolutely a huge waste of money.</li>
      <li>I bought the Third Generation Dr Mom Slimline Stainless LED Pocket Otoscope.  </li>
      <li>Never did see how my daughter&#x27;s ear looked until we took her to the doctor and looked through his professional W/A</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>Light and magnifying glass are too weak.</li>

<li> It was exactly what I expected.</li>
<li> Light and magnifying glass are too weak.</li>
<li> Could not get the ear in focus at all, and it was difficult to keep turned on since you have to press and hold the pocket clip into the side of the light to turn it on.</li>
<li> also tried it on our 5 year old and my wife&#x27;s ear, but had no better luck there.</li>
<li> I purchased this same exact otoscope set at Walgreens a couple months ago for around $10 and was not impressed.</li>
<li> and it came with the same little attachments and mirror.</li>
<li> The proportions were wonky, and it felt like it would come apart frequently.</li>
<li> I ended up taking it back for a refund since I felt it was a waste of my money.</li>
<li> This works as expected.</li>
<li> You had to push down on the pocket clip to get it to turn on.</li>
<li> Has paid for itself by all the doctor offices visits I have not had to make due to the fact that I can just take a peek in their ears or throat or nose, and can see for myself if they need to go to the Doctor!!</li>
<li> What a waste of money.  </li>
<li> The magnifying glass is not strong enough to see the eardrum, and even with suggestions from my pediatrician I could barely make anything out (making it impossible to check for redness).  </li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t terrible but it is what you pay for.</li>
<li> This thing is the worst!  </li>

    <li> It was exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> As it turned out, mine was defective, but I was glad it was because the whole thing didn&#x27;t feel like it was very good quality. The proportions were wonky, and it felt like it would come apart frequently.</li>

    <li> This could be useful to check the throat or to check for earWAX but I got it to check my son&#x27;s ear for earaches and it just didn&#x27;t work.  The magnifying glass is not strong enough to see the eardrum, and even with suggestions from my pediatrician I could barely make anything out (making it impossible to check for redness).  I returned the item because it just wouldn&#x27;t do.  I&#x27;d suggest investing in something better and went with the Dr. Mom scope with the LED light.</li>
    <li> I purchased this same exact otoscope set at Walgreens a couple months ago for around $10 and was not impressed. I am sure it is the same kit because it looked exactly like this and it came with the same little attachments and mirror. It was all plastic and had a flimsy feel. It felt more like a fisher price toy you would buy for your child to play doctor than a functional light to see inside the ear. You had to push down on the pocket clip to get it to turn on. You could see inside the ear but the view was somewhat distorted. The light was also somewhat dim. I ended up taking it back for a refund since I felt it was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> The price was very inexpensive, the shipping was prompt, and the product as desribed. This light has more features than I realized. I would order from tjhis seller again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a child&#x27;s toy</li>
    <li> I bought this at CVS because we needed one immediately, to figure out if we should take our 3 year old to urgent care or wait and see if she was better in the morning. For the price, I knew/assumed it would be cheaply made, but hoped it would be adequate for the job. It was anything but. It&#x27;s nothing but a penlight with a piece of mylar foil to reflect the light. Could not get the ear in focus at all, and it was difficult to keep turned on since you have to press and hold the pocket clip into the side of the light to turn it on. Never did see how my daughter&#x27;s ear looked until we took her to the doctor and looked through his professional W/A unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on our 5 year old and my wife&#x27;s ear, but had no better luck there.

    <li> I have recently purchased the Ezy-Care Medi-Scope and can&#x27;t imagine how I lived without it before!! It has made such a difference instead of having to just guess! Now I KNOW when to take my kids to the Doctor for an ear infection! I use mine ALL the time! It has great attachments, to check their eyes, ears, nose and throat! It comes with two size tongue depressors, one for the kids and one I use for myself!! I would HIGHLY recommend this product for any mother, no matter what your children&#x27;s ages are, it&#x27;s a huge help! Has paid for itself by all the doctor offices visits I have not had to make due to the fact that I can just take a peek in their ears or throat or nose, and can see for myself if they need to go to the Doctor!! Five stars for this product!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I do wish I had spent the extra to get a better one. It isn&#x27;t terrible but it is what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is so cheaply made and it doesn&#x27;t work.  I think one of these from the toy department at a grocery store would be of better quality.  It is plastic and I can&#x27;t even get it to work,  I threw away the packaging so I couldn&#x27;t return it.  What a waste of money.  I bought the Third Generation Dr Mom Slimline Stainless LED Pocket Otoscope.  Much better quality and it looks more professional.</li>
    <li> Great product for in home use.</li>
    <li> Light and magnifying glass are too weak. Can&#x27;t see inside the ear, which is the whole point.</li>
    <li> a must for parents.  ask a doctor to help you learn what to look for when using it if you don&#x27;t know how.  i am a nurse and couldn&#x27;t find one for this price until now and wish i got it years ago.  i have used it multiple times since getting it mostly for sore throats but will use it if there is ear pain too.    this will be my presents to new parents for now on</li>
    <li> If I could give it no stars, I would.  I happen to be an audiologist and am used to looking in people&#x27;s ears and this was unusable.  You can&#x27;t see anything with it.  I had my husband try just to be sure and he agreed.  It was like trying to look in an ear using a funhouse mirror.  Absolutely a huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> This thing is the worst!  If you are getting it for looking at an eardrum then you better look elsewhere!</li>
    <li> This works as expected.</li>
    <li> very happy with seller and product</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work.  We replaced the batteries twice and never did get it to work. We threw it out and are trying to decide on another brand to buy.</li>
    <li> The product is okay. I just wished the attachments would stay on better. However, the product gives enough light to see.</li>
