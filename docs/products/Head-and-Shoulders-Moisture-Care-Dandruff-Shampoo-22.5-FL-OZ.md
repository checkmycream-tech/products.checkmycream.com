      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many H&amp;S formulas and they all work</li>

      <li>This is used in many anti-dandruff products.</li>

      <li>don&#x27;t have a problem with dandruff, but I will continue to use this Head and Shoulders shampoo because it is fairly priced and works well to keep my hair clean and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Stick with good brands that work; very much like Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo.</li>
      <li>Great new scent--</li>
      <li>Easily, this is my favorite variety of Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
      <li>H&amp;S is the old standby for dandruff shampoos, and it still works great.</li>
      <li>mentioned on the label, so perhaps this aspect would be more important for those who do.</li>
      <li>Nice scent not overpowering but leaves a fresh smell.  </li>
      <li>The generously sized 22.5 ounce bottle is easy to handle in the shower.</li>
      <li>It has a very mild coconut/almond scent.</li>
      <li>The shampoo itself comes out in a sort of lotion texture which is easy to dispense and control.</li>
      <li>This product is pretty effective in removing dandruff but it does not \\&quot;deliver enriched moisture\\&quot; as it claims in the description.</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant, lather is robust, and hair comes out clean and soft.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasantly light tropical scent.</li>
      <li>The bottle is a great size for families and should last a while.</li>
      <li>I received this product free from Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It still delivers the Head &amp; Shoulders quality that leaves my scalp dandruff and flake free with softer hair.</li>
      <li>I tried this product for free as a Bzzz Agent.</li>
      <li>B002LMNJDA Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Conditioner with Peppermint and Eucalyptus - Cruelty Free (16 oz)]]&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also use coconut oil almost every day and this does a good job of washing it out and leaving my hair soft.</li>
      <li>Best of all it doesn&#x27;t have that  familiar harsh  head &amp; shoulders</li>
      <li>Apparently they&#x27;re revamped the brand so it prevents dandruff while changing the formula to make the smell pleasant.</li>
      <li>what an improvement over the original.</li>
      <li>After using it, my scalp does feel clean.</li>
      <li>This particular one adds a mild coconut scent which is nice.</li>
      <li>The way my hair feels after I&#x27;m done---it feels clean and doesn&#x27;t itch.  </li>
      <li>This version of Head &amp; Shoulders lathers up nicely, rinses cleanly and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>Five stars is the right rating for this fine product.</li>
      <li>Great lathering, not much is needed.  </li>
      <li>I am a regular user of Head &amp; Shoulders&#x27; anti-dandruff shampoo products with good results.</li>
      <li>Good solid product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is important to note that they recommend leaving the shampoo on for several minutes in order for it to be effective.</li>
      <li>I got this particular version because it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;textured hair&amp;#34; and most of my family has curly hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a mild coconut--</li>
      <li>think this product would be the best for someone with really short hair who works and/or plays outside a lot.</li>
      <li>This helped relieve my itchy flaking scalp, and left my hair feeling soft, flake free, and smelling great.</li>
      <li>This plastic bottle has convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out</li>
      <li>Head and Shoulder Moisture Care is my new favorite product.  </li>
      <li>and I can really feel this working!!</li>
      <li>but I do like returning to the old reliable healthy clean scent of H&amp;S and this time there is a hint of nut, coconut to be exact.</li>
      <li>IT ACTUALLY MOISTURIZES AND LEAVES IT SMELLING GREAT AND FEELING SOFT.</li>
      <li>and this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>but otherwise this is a reasonably priced product that works as advertised and, while I can&#x27;t vouch for the dandruff issue, does leave my hair feeling soft and smelling nice.</li>
      <li>So, don&#x27;t lather and rinse right away.</li>
      <li>This does a good job as a shampoo that  leaves your hair soft and not dry.</li>
      <li>Its active ingredient is Pyrithione Zinc, which is a mild and effective treatment for dandruff.</li>
      <li>It works really well at controlling the flaking and itchy scalp while keeping our hair clean, smooth, and soft.</li>
      <li>The new coconut scent is an improvement over the somewhat medicine like scent of original Head &amp;Shoulders Shampoo.</li>
      <li>coconut and Vitamin E formula doesn&#x27;t offer anything more than a different fragrance: clean, fresh and soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It would be great for sports lockers because it would last a long time.</li>
      <li>This is the standard product with a more subdued scent.</li>
      <li>All I am saying is I&#x27;m glad to be back on Head &amp; Shoulders, and this shampoo works for me.</li>
      <li>The coconut smell is not overpowering, it&#x27;s just soft and light.  </li>
      <li>from missing the connection between what&#x27;s on the bottle and what&#x27;s in the bottle, the shampoo does a good job at getting my hair</li>
      <li>Happily, unlike other products in their line, this new one actually has a pleasant smell which leaves your head smelling more like regular shampoo and less like a chemical factory.  </li>
      <li>it leaves my hair feeling clean but soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so good, in fact, that I&#x27;ve managed to cut down on the amount of conditioner I normally use after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I took off one star because, although my long hair felt soft and clean, I noticed some of it &amp;#34;fuzzed up&amp;#34; on the top and sides.</li>
      <li>Just plain works to clean your hair, fight dandruff, leaves your head smelling much better than when you first got in the shower, and even seems to add some softness to my hair.</li>
      <li>Though I&#x27;m not sure what the definition of &amp;#34;textured hair&amp;#34; is, this is certainly a good Head &amp; Shoulders product.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how nice and soft this shampoo made my naturally curly/wavy/frizzy would make my hair feel.</li>
      <li>For me, that means it&#x27;s good but not great, so I also use Nizoral for more complete control.</li>
      <li>which is what I normally buy, but I think I prefer that because I can solve my dandruff problem and then use a better conditioner on my hair at the same time.</li>
      <li>This is a smart buy for both performance and the pocketbook.</li>
      <li>I like the large 22.5 oz sized bottle too.</li>
      <li>The bottle is large with a generous 22 oz of shampoo.</li>
      <li>Both my husband and son use Head and Shoulders products and they by and large</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a big problem with dandruff, though my scalp itches from time to time, but most importantly, my hair tends to be on the dry side after years of highlighting, perms, and the like.</li>
      <li>This shampoo rinses easily out of the hair and after toweling dry, hair feels soft and clean.  </li>
      <li>Very highly recommended.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the smell. This helped relieve my itchy flaking scalp, and left my hair feeling soft, flake free, and smelling great. I received this free from as a bzzagent from head and shoulders! Will buy.</li>
    <li> Struggling with flaking on my scalp and I can really feel this working!! Got ftee from buzzagent but this will definitely be a part of my regimen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given this to my son to try and report on for me.  He has dandruff, a dry scalp and extremely dry hair.  We had hoped the coconut oil formulation would have helped.  He&#x27;s been using it regularly for a few weeks now, and while it is helping his dandruff, hasn&#x27;t really helped with scalp or hair dryness.  Humidity has been particularly low in our house this year because of the extremely cold weather and central heating, so maybe when the weather improves (keep your fingers crossed), the state of his hair will, too.  Both my husband and son use Head and Shoulders products and they by and large do what they say they will:  control dandruff, so we will continue to purchase H&amp;S.</li>
    <li> Good solid product. Nothing fancy. Just plain works to clean your hair, fight dandruff, leaves your head smelling much better than when you first got in the shower, and even seems to add some softness to my hair. I prefer getting the hair cleaning products that don&#x27;t combine the shampoo and conditioner. Simply, I don&#x27;t feel like I need it so I don&#x27;t want it. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I received this product free from Head &amp; Shoulders. Although I am not generally a fan of Head &amp; Shoulders products, I figured to give it a try since it&#x27;s made for textured hair types. Well, It does what it says and my hair felt clean yet not dry and brittle. It does moisturize and it smells nice to boot. While I don&#x27;t have huge problems with dandruff, product build up on my scalp can cause occasional flaking. I must admit, this product remedied the problem. I do recommend and plan to incorporate into my regular hair care routine as needed.</li>
    <li> For the longest time, I have been praying for a product that addresses the needs of my dry, dull and flaky hair.  Well, here it is Head and Shoulder Moisture Care is my new favorite product.  It comes with a 2 in 1 formula that I received to test from BzzAgent.  I love the way it smells.  It&#x27;s like a tropical paradise with the hint of coconut.  The coconut smell is not overpowering, it&#x27;s just soft and light.  It&#x27;s really meant for folks who have extremely dry hair.  The way my hair feels after I&#x27;m done---it feels clean and doesn&#x27;t itch.  This is the first time in a long time that I can say that.  Thanks Head and Shoulders.  Well done.</li>
    <li> The ingredients in Head &amp; Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo are similar to those of other Head and Shoulders Shampoos. The active ingredient is pyrithione zinc. This is used in many anti-dandruff products. This plastic bottle has convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is a thick milky blue/green cream which emerges readily from the container. It is not oily or greasy and appears not to leave residues. The shampoo does not seem to be irritating if you get it in your eyes. The odor is pleasant  but not overpowering. After using it, my scalp does feel clean. My hair tends to curl. However, this conditioner seems to flatten my curls, but does leave my hair feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used and loved Head &amp; Shoulders products for a while with great results. I was surprised at how nice and soft this shampoo made my naturally curly/wavy/frizzy would make my hair feel. My hair didn&#x27;t make my dry-ish hair feel stripped. It felt nice and smooth to the touch and rinsed well without residue. This shampoo even cut through the load of hair products I use without making my dry hair even drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still delivers the Head &amp; Shoulders quality that leaves my scalp dandruff and flake free with softer hair.</li>
    <li> Chemical processing and heat styling have taken a toll on my hair and scalp. This version of Head &amp; Shoulders lathers up nicely, rinses cleanly and leaves my hair soft and manageable. It has a pleasantly light tropical scent. The generously sized 22.5 ounce bottle is easy to handle in the shower. Although I don&#x27;t have flakes, my scalp does get dry and itchy and this shampoo seems to sooth it. This is a smart buy for both performance and the pocketbook.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have really dry scalp and this product has made my hair the softest, shiniest, and most healthy it has ever been.  Trust me, if your hair texture is like mine, this is the shampoo and conditioner for you.  It is a must have for your hair&#x27;s health.  It has taken my hair confidence to a new level!</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo for Textured Hair is an improved version of the original Head and Shoulders that I have used in the past. The shampoo has always been effective for me when my scalp becomes dried out in the Ohio winter months. I am a runner and wear acrylic knit beanies during cold weather distance runs. Even the high tech hats cause my head to sweat and this causes a drying out and salty deposits on the scalp after the run. Like the earlier versions of H &amp; S, the Textured Hair shampoo cleans the hair and scalp preventing itching and flaking. The word “Textured” means hair of varied thicknesses. My hair is fine in texture, and the shampoo works great. The implication is that it would work well with hair of any thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has “moisture care” with almond oil and coconut essence. It has a very mild coconut/almond scent. This shampoo has continued to be a very good product for Proctor and Gamble over the years.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free as a Bzzz Agent. I must say it really helped the severe itching I was having daily. I have dry curly mixed hair and using the co-wash with this 2 in 1 really kept my curls shiny and flake free!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Head &amp; Shoulders&#x27; Shampoos for years, and they&#x27;ve all always worked well with my minor dandruff. Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Shampoo is no exception. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks, and haven&#x27;t had any sign of flakes. The new coconut scent is an improvement over the somewhat medicine like scent of original Head &amp;Shoulders Shampoo. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering either. It&#x27;s just very pleasant. The shampoo also does a good job of cleaning my hair without drying it out. I haven&#x27;t had a need to use conditioner with it. I like the large 22.5 oz sized bottle too. It&#x27;s not too small, and not that big that it takes up an entire shelf in my shower.  All in all, Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Shampoo is just an excellent dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> I guess I can have my cake and eat it too: A dandruff shampoo that also moisturizes. I tried it and it works as advertised. Not only does it control dandruff, it doesn&#x27;t leave my scalp dried out. Nor does it leave any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a very appealing tactile quality thanks to the coconut oil and smells good. Easily, this is my favorite variety of Head &amp; Shoulders. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Another great H&amp;S product. I was a little surprised to not have a stronger coconut smell, especially given the coconut on the cover. It actually smells quite a bit like the other conditioning H&amp;S Shampoos that I have seen lately. This is not a know on the shampoo, but I do wonder how different each of the new conditioning shampoos are. I have used this and others and can not tell a difference. My advice would be to buy which ever conditioning H&amp;S product was cheapest ... they appear to be very much similar.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty effective in removing dandruff but it does not \\&quot;deliver enriched moisture\\&quot; as it claims in the description. To enrich moisture, I recommend the following conditioner: [[ASIN:B002LMNJDA Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Conditioner with Peppermint and Eucalyptus - Cruelty Free (16 oz)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The almond oil and coconut essence are marketing. They have no effect in enriching the moisture.</li>
    <li> As someone who suffers from dandruff, I have tried many products to solve the issue. To date, nothing compares to Head and Shoulders dandruff shampoo. This one is not a 2-in-1 which is what I normally buy, but I think I prefer that because I can solve my dandruff problem and then use a better conditioner on my hair at the same time. This one has the added benefit of being deeply moisturizing which I like because my hair gets really dry in he winter. Great product!</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders has made this shampoo for everyone, not just those folks with a dandruff problem.  It has a light coconut smell as it goes into the hair and then lathers up well and cleans effectively.  This shampoo rinses easily out of the hair and after toweling dry, hair feels soft and clean.  The next day hair is just as soft with no itching or discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a problem with dandruff, but I will continue to use this Head and Shoulders shampoo because it is fairly priced and works well to keep my hair clean and comfortable.  Five stars is the right rating for this fine product.</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of Head &amp; Shoulders&#x27; anti-dandruff shampoo products with good results. This variety is no exception. Its active ingredient is Pyrithione Zinc, which is a mild and effective treatment for dandruff. With daily shampooing I basically have no visible dandruff. If I stop using it for a few days (like on longer business trips), sometimes I can find dandruff on the shoulder of my dark jackets. This particular one adds a mild coconut scent which is nice.</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders is still the gold standard for dandruff control shampoos.  Happily, unlike other products in their line, this new one actually has a pleasant smell which leaves your head smelling more like regular shampoo and less like a chemical factory.  Also as a huge positive is the current price, which is less than 3.50 for a 22.5 oz container, which is quite large and should last you a good long time.  Many people avoid H and S because of the cost and smell, there are no more excuses.</li>
    <li> When I use this, I find I don&#x27;t even need to apply conditioner. That&#x27;s both time and money saved. Some Head and Shoulder varieties or scents are sensitive to my scalp and literally make me feel like they scrub a layer of skin off. Not this one. I&#x27;ve used different Head and Shoulder shampoos since I was a child and this is by far my favorite. I&#x27;ve also tried the generic brands and this new one is my preference, even if I have to shell out a few more pennies. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many H&amp;S formulas and they all work wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This coconut and Vitamin E formula doesn&#x27;t offer anything more than a different fragrance: clean, fresh and soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula isn&#x27;t extraordinary but there still isn&#x27;t any dandruff shampoo out there that can rival H&amp;S, except maybe Selsun Blue.</li>
    <li> For less than $5 (the current Amazon price), you get a generous 22.5 fluid ounce bottle of Head and Shoulders Moisture Care. I don&#x27;t have a big problem with dandruff, though my scalp itches from time to time, but most importantly, my hair tends to be on the dry side after years of highlighting, perms, and the like. Does this work on making my hair feel much softer and smoother? Yes. It&#x27;s so good, in fact, that I&#x27;ve managed to cut down on the amount of conditioner I normally use after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of coconut, but strangely enough the scent reminds me of Herbal Essences, not the medicinal quality I used to associate with Head and Shoulders. Apparently they&#x27;re revamped the brand so it prevents dandruff while changing the formula to make the smell pleasant. The Vitamin E additive is relatively meaningless - you can&#x27;t absorb vitamins through your hair - but otherwise this is a reasonably priced product that works as advertised and, while I can&#x27;t vouch for the dandruff issue, does leave my hair feeling soft and smelling nice.</li>
    <li> All of the Dandruff shampoos contain the same active ingredient to treat dandruff, specifically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They vary in the rest of their ingredients, respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;essence of coconut?&amp;#34; There is no coconut in this shampoo. I have no idea why this bottle shows a coconut on the front label. Maybe someone at Head &amp; Shoulders was thinking about coconuts when they made the shampoo? Or designed the label?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from missing the connection between what&#x27;s on the bottle and what&#x27;s in the bottle, the shampoo does a good job at getting my hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note that they recommend leaving the shampoo on for several minutes in order for it to be effective. So, don&#x27;t lather and rinse right away. Let it sit up there and work for a while before washing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my bottle showed up with shampoo on the outside of it before I ever opened it. No vine bar code sticker was attached to the bottle either. Weird.</li>
    <li> H&amp;S is the old standby for dandruff shampoos, and it still works great. I got this particular version because it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;textured hair&amp;#34; and most of my family has curly hair. It works really well at controlling the flaking and itchy scalp while keeping our hair clean, smooth, and soft. The addition of coconut and vitamin E oils really helps to keep my frizzes under control and helps my curls feel moisturized.</li>
    <li> The bottle is large with a generous 22 oz of shampoo. The scent is pleasant, lather is robust, and hair comes out clean and soft. I took off one star because, although my long hair felt soft and clean, I noticed some of it &amp;#34;fuzzed up&amp;#34; on the top and sides. Perhaps it gives my hair a little too much texture. After the first three times using it, it was fuzzing up worse, so I re-introduced a conditioner to smooth things down.&lt;br /&gt;I think this product would be the best for someone with really short hair who works and/or plays outside a lot. They wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about the fuzzing, and the pyrithine zinc would help keep bugs off their scalps. It would be great for sports lockers because it would last a long time. The aroma is pleasant for everyone.</li>
    <li> Great lathering, not much is needed.  Nice scent not overpowering but leaves a fresh smell.  Really like this during the winter months when frequent showers can leave your scalp dried out, the extra moisturizers kept my scalp from drying out and no associated flaking.  Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great new scent-- what an improvement over the original. It&#x27;s a mild coconut-- nothing overpowering or cloying. Gender neutral. The shampoo is thick and moisturizing, so go easy on conditioner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredient is pyrithione zinc 1%. Would be nice if it didn&#x27;t have SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate), but alas, it does. On the plus side, it&#x27;s a really big bottle that&#x27;s inexpensive and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I dislike most dandruff shampoos and have definitely never liked this brand-until now. While this is advertised for &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34; hair it works well for my slightly dry long straight hair. It is moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t seem too harsh for dyed hair. It definitely reduces flakes. Best of all it doesn&#x27;t have that  familiar harsh  head &amp; shoulders scent - this has a mild actually pleasant coconut scent. Maybe not as good for oilier hair /scalps but it sure works for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling Head &amp; Shoulders I have tried yet. It&#x27;s fairly thick, you one doesn&#x27;t need too much. The bottle is a great size for families and should last a while. I wash my hair daily. I also use coconut oil almost every day and this does a good job of washing it out and leaving my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Head &amp; Shoulders dandruff shampoo was a staple for my head for years. As the hair thinned, and retirement took me out of the public on most days, I seemed to abandon what I relied on for so long in favor of less expensive, dollar store cheap hair soap. Recently the old flaking and itch returned with a vengeance. I&#x27;m not vain, but I do want to look nice and feel good about my hair (what&#x27;s left) most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m been testing and trying several brands of hair/body wash, shampoo/conditioner/moisturizer/everything combo soaps, and even some expensive brands that tend to offer hype and perfume in place of suds, cleaning, and healthy hair. I even tried using the Head &amp; Shoulders knock-offs where even the plastic bottle mimics but can&#x27;t reproduce the H&amp;Ss results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then comes a sample of Head &amp; Shoulders. It was like a breath of nostalgia mixed with years of intelligence about what works for my hair. Now I will NOT claim this is a cure all for every man, woman and child. All I am saying is I&#x27;m glad to be back on Head &amp; Shoulders, and this shampoo works for me. This variety has moisture care added. Too early to judge that part but I do like returning to the old reliable healthy clean scent of H&amp;S and this time there is a hint of nut, coconut to be exact. Not too much, just a wisp, not at all like the other coconut soap I tried that made me smell all day like a Beach Boy&#x27;s surfin&#x27; groupie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting old. Why can&#x27;t I learn and keep it learned? Stick with good brands that work; very much like Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have used an anti-dandruff shampoo for decades. When I started it was all the tar-based smelly stuff  - with no real choice except  for the &amp;#34;crazy expensive in super tiny bottles&amp;#34; types and good ol&#x27; Head and Shoulders. Now, the shelves are filled with a wide variety of great-working and great-smelling shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can add this version of Head and Shoulders to the wide variety great-working and great-smelling choices. I was worried about the coconut smell when I read the label, fearing that I would smell like I had just slathered myself in sun block. But, it is a subtle smell and not overpowering in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes. No itchy head, no flakes. Exactly what I expected with a Heads and Shoulders shampoo.</li>
    <li> The shampoo itself comes out in a sort of lotion texture which is easy to dispense and control. A small amount goes a long way. It does have a coconut scent even though there is no “coconut” on the list of ingredients. I have a dry scalp and hair and though I would give this a try for its moisturizer claim. This does a good job as a shampoo that  leaves your hair soft and not dry. I did not use a conditioner with this product and was pleased with the results. I do not think they should advertise coconut essence, maybe the word fragrance is that ingredient, unless it is listed in the ingredients and present.</li>
    <li> NOT LIKE OTHER SHAMPOOS THAT LEAVE YOUR HAIR DRY. IT ACTUALLY MOISTURIZES AND LEAVES IT SMELLING GREAT AND FEELING SOFT. ACTUALLY HELPS WITH ITCHING AND FLAKES. GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> The type and amount of active ingredient in the Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo is the same as in their other shampoos, so its effectiveness against dandruff would be the same. For me, that means it&#x27;s good but not great, so I also use Nizoral for more complete control. More interesting is the &amp;#34;Moisture Care&amp;#34; aspect with the built-in conditioners. I do like this in the Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo - it leaves my hair feeling clean but soft and manageable. I don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;textured hair&amp;#34; mentioned on the label, so perhaps this aspect would be more important for those who do. The smell is faintly of coconut and not at all objectionable</li>
    <li> This is good shampoo. I&#x27;ve noticed a definite drop-off in dandruff since I started using it, as well as a more comfortable, less dry scalp. It gets my hair clean in other ways, and has a pleasant, faint coconut scent. Really nothing to complain about here.</li>
    <li> Though I&#x27;m not sure what the definition of &amp;#34;textured hair&amp;#34; is, this is certainly a good Head &amp; Shoulders product. I have had bad dandruff for years. If it gets very bad, H&amp;S will no longer cut it and I must go stronger, but I try to use the least potent option that works. H&amp;S is often the answer. This is the standard product with a more subdued scent. Overall worth a shot if you suffer from mild to moderate dandruff and don&#x27;t want to smell like a medicine cabinet!</li>
