      <li>I love rosehip oil.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite things about this oil is how easily it absorbs into my skin.</li>
      <li>The application on my abdominal scar absorbs much quicker after just 1-2 mins rub, and the application on my face stays oily for a good amount of time even after 3-4 min rub.  </li>
      <li>I was fortunate to be able to get the first bottle at a reduced promotional price in exchange for my honest opinion of the product.</li>
      <li>I also like to rub some between my fingers and run them through my hair in the mornings to condition it and give it shine and manageability - (and massaging the remaining oil into my cuticles seems to be strengthening my nails as well because they aren&#x27;t breaking as easily as they used to).  </li>

      <li>For skin application, it is lightweight and quickly absorbed.</li>

      <li>The oil is a clear color, lightweight, odorless, spreads smoothly and really does absorb completely and fairly</li>
      <li>The opinions that I have expressed are my own from my personal experience with this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this on my skin. Great product that virtually leaves no trace. I hate having that oily residue on my hands afterward. It also has no smell, which is similar to other rosehip oils that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. The icing on the cake is that it is organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a true lover of oils and this did not disappoint!!!  This is light weight, absorbed very well into my skin and hair, did not leave a residue, nor was it greasy!!!  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!  Oh, great for scalp massages as well!!! Enjoy!!!!</li>
    <li> Happy happy about this oil.  I had never heard of it before but I&#x27;m glad I know about it now.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This Botanic Touch Rosehip Oil is a welcomed new addition to my skin care products. It came in a 4-ounce amber glass bottle with screw-on cap plus a screw-on dropper cap. I am using it on my hands and elbows for dry scaly itchy skin that was not responding to my usual &amp;#34;intensive treatment&amp;#34;  lotions and creams. It didn&#x27;t take long after the first application for this product to start having a noticeable​ positive effect on my skin. It just takes a few drops for each elbow and hand. A little goes a long way. The absorption is rapid and does not leave an oily or sticky residue. The skin feels softened and the itching relieved shortly after application. This product is stable with a shelf life of 3 to 4 years. I was fortunate to be able to get the first bottle at a reduced promotional price in exchange for my honest opinion of the product. The opinions that I have expressed are my own from my personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> the oil comes with great smell and pureness . I use it to message my body and face , and my skin tone is brighter</li>
    <li> I really love this product. My son and husband have eczema and this really helped with it. I have also used it to make a wrinkle cream for my mom with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to Rosehip oil, and I bought this product to see if it does help with my dark spots on face, wrinkles, and my abdominal scar from a previous surgery. When I open this bottle, I&#x27;m SOOOO glad it has no smell at all, very neutral smell. This oil comes in 4 OZ bottle.  With just a tiny drop, it covers 1/6 of my face easily.  The absorption rate varies among different areas of skin.  The application on my abdominal scar absorbs much quicker after just 1-2 mins rub, and the application on my face stays oily for a good amount of time even after 3-4 min rub.  Since it&#x27;s only a couple of days I use this product, I&#x27;m seeing any effect yet, but I&#x27;ll come back with another review when I&#x27;m able to give a true update.</li>
    <li> I love rosehip oil. It has helped my skin issues tremendously. I was very happy when I was offered this oil so I could write a review on it. It is organic and 100% pure. Rosehip oil is high in vitamin E which can help with wrinkles, scars, combination skin issues, varicose veins and stretch marks. This product has no smell, just like rosehip oil should be. I was using jojoba oil before and the smell of it was horrible so I am very happy that this oil does not. It means that I can use it as a carrier oil for essential oils and add whatever scent I like  to it, such as lavender before going to bed or a citrusy scent such as lemon before driving to work in the morning. It is packed with Omega 3 &amp; 6, numerous vitamins and minerals and contrary to popular belief, applying rosehip oil to an already oily skin or combination skin won&#x27;t make it worse. If you are like me, it will solve almost all your skin problems. What really worked for me is to first wash my face with a tea tree oil based soap, apply bentonite clay as a face mask twice a week, apply pure tea tree oil to specific problems such as pimples and moisturize twice a day (morning &amp; before bed) with rosehip oil. Try it, your skin will thank you.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin really soft and i love it!!!</li>
    <li> Results within first week. Was using neosporin with little results. I immediately saw my scar diminished on day 2. I applied it to a surgical scar twice a day. Would highly reccomend.</li>
    <li> This stuff came within two days and I&#x27;ve been using it since on my daughter. She has really bad dry patches on her skin and I get a cotter ball after she showers and it&#x27;s making them disappear!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product at a great value. It comes with an eye dropper which makes it easy to use and control the amount you want. I have  t-zone skin type and I am able to use this all over my face and it just soaks it all in even the oily part of my skin, no oily feeling left. I have used the oil to mix my essential oils with again the dropper really help with controlling the amount. The product is 100% organic so I have peace about using it on my skin or if needed with my children too. There are so many uses for this oil, I am sure I will be purchasing this one again, I am that happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love it. I got a high discount code buying it. it is amazing. after the first use, I see my wrinkle around eyes, less than before.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price in exchange for my review and my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless. I jumped on this opportunity. I researched about the benefits of Rosehip oil. If you&#x27;re on this page, you most likely already know the benefits and uses/. It is great to treat skin condition, as well as a great facial and body oil.&lt;br /&gt;I have already tried other oils like Tamanu and Argan. I can not say anything bad about them. The same with Rosehip oil. I like that it goes on the skin smooth, absorbs quickly. Has no scent at all!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy that I can apply it around my eyes and it does not burn/sting my eyes. I do not see the huge difference, but I like how my skin looks overall - glowy and pure. I will continue using it. The bottle is very large (4oz) and if you&#x27;re heavy oil user like me, it should last you 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing - on the bottle and in description it says wording &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; but no certification on the bottle is found. I have read that if the product is 100% organic and uses 1 ingredient (which is the case) it MUST have a USDA seal shown. Especially if it&#x27;s bottled in USA. No other certification were found. I&#x27;m not an organic certification expert, you can research on your own.</li>
    <li> I like using Rosehip Seed Oil to moisturize my face, neck, arms, and legs every morning and evening. It&#x27;s super moisturizing yet it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and it absorbs quickly without being greasy or oily, so my makeup can go on over it without a problem. I also like to rub some between my fingers and run them through my hair in the mornings to condition it and give it shine and manageability - (and massaging the remaining oil into my cuticles seems to be strengthening my nails as well because they aren&#x27;t breaking as easily as they used to).  I absolutely adore how soft and smooth my skin feels after using Rosehip Seed Oil, and its replenishing much needed Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Omega-3, and Omega-6 every time I apply it. I can&#x27;t think of a safer or more gentle anti-aging routine than using all natural and organic Rosehip Seed Oil for my skin, hair, and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Botanic Touch&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil is 100% pure, certified organic, cold pressed, extra virgin and unrefined with no additives or other ingredients. It&#x27;s sustainable, eco-friendly, and hand harvested from wild Chilean rose bushes which also provides much needed extra seasonal income for the picker&#x27;s families. The oil comes in a generous 4 Fl. Oz. size dark amber glass bottle to protect it from light degradation, and it comes with a cap, but the package also contains a glass medicine dropper which you can use to dispense exactly the amount of drops you want without wasting any.  The oil is a clear color, lightweight, odorless, spreads smoothly and really does absorb completely and fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see any mention on the bottle of where it was bottled so I went to the manufacturer&#x27;s web site and they state it was bottled in the USA.  Although I don&#x27;t see a date of manufacture on the bottle itself it was listed on the box it comes packed in, mine was bottled on 5/04/15 (so it&#x27;s very fresh which is good to know).  It also says it has a 3 year shelf life, but on a personal note I know that Rosehip Seed Oil can go rancid, so be sure to store yours in a cool dark place (like the fridge) to keep it fresh as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item at a discounted price in exchange for my evaluation of the product. My review is based entirely upon my examination of the product itself and my assessment of the pros and cons of this particular product. My opinion may differ from yours, but I hope that my review helps you decide whether this is the right product for your needs or not.can go rancid, so be sure to store yours in a cool dark place (like the fridge) to keep it fresh as long as possible.

    <li> This Botanic Touch Rosehip Oil is a welcomed new addition to my skin care products. It came in a 4-ounce amber glass bottle with screw-on cap plus a screw-on dropper cap. I am using it on my hands and elbows for dry scaly itchy skin that was not responding to my usual &amp;#34;intensive treatment&amp;#34; lotions and creams. It didn&#x27;t take long after the first application for this product to start having a noticeable​ positive effect on my skin. It just takes a few drops for each elbow and hand. A little goes a long way. The absorption is rapid and does not leave an oily or sticky residue. The skin feels softened and the itching relieved shortly after application. This product is stable with a shelf life of 3 to 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son was out yesterday and got a sunburn on his arms and back of his neck. Used some on his neck and while yes, he still has a sunburn, he says it feels better. It was looking dry and rough, you could see it moisturizing his skin making it look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review but this will be a permanent product in my medicine cabinet!!</li>
    <li> When I saw this on sale I had to grab it. I have major skin issues and have been using this and its helping! Helping old scars heal wuickly and smells great!</li>
    <li> This is a great oil that has so many uses.  One of my favorite things about this oil is how easily it absorbs into my skin. There was no oily residue left on my skin which is pretty amazing considering it is an oil.  I also like that fact that it comes with the dropper top in addition to the regular top.  This allowed me to have the option of using the dropper or just opening it up and pouring some into a cotton pad.  I have been using this oil on some dry patches of skin I have on my arm and in my ear lobes.  Out of all the oils that I have tried the rosehip oil has provided the most relief.  I look forward to using it more.  Triple bonus for it being organic.  Also I just read an article online about how Rosehip oil may become the next coconut oil.  They say it is good for so many skin conditions and great at reducing fine skin lines and wrinkles.  And apparently it has been used for thousands of years.  I am just wondering why am I only just hearing about it now.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Organic rosehip oil has quickly become a must have in my beauty routine. It&#x27;s benefits are endless! It is by far my favorite oil! This specific oil is organic which makes it so much more healthier than others. It is rich in vitamins and antioxidants such as omega 3, omega 6, Vitamin C, and Vitamin A. It is great for helping to improve your skin&#x27;s elasticity. I love the soft light feeling! It is so light that you can apply it in the morning before you go about your day without giving you the greasy, oily look. I use it as a moisturizer! Every morning and night I put 5-6 drops onto my hands, rub them together, then pat all over my face. It gives me such a refreshing feeling!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have been a fan of rosehip oil for years.  It is wonderful for your skin. It is great for Eczema, Wrinkles, Age-Fighting Antioxidants, Heals Without Scaring, and Skin Cell Regeneration.  you can use it as a skin moisturizer or in your moisturizer.  I add it to my lotion for added  healing strength.  I have very dry skin living here in Ohio.  It takes a few drops by itself for all day coverage.  If you work with your hands alot this is great.  It will heal your cracks and smooth your skin. You can use it on babies with skin disorders. it is very gentle.  I used it on my grand daughter when she was at her worst.  I have used this type of oil for years I hope you try it.  I don&#x27;t think you will ever sop using it.  I received a discount on this product for an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil! Great product and very reasonably priced. I use it on both my hair and skin. For skin application, it is lightweight and quickly absorbed. I have sensitive skin and I get red spots on my face a lot - it worked wonders and gave me a nice glow. For hair, it kept my hair shiny, soft, and moisturized for days. The event was very light and refreshing, not overpowering like a lot of other oils like this one. I would definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I was honestly surprised with the product. I have a lot of red scaring from me being a bit OCD with scabs. I out the oil on and it helped with the redness. It had gone down a bit the next day. I love using oils to nourish the skin and I am truly in love with this. I hope old scars will fade away soon as well.</li>
    <li> Lately I have been learning to take better care of my skin and am learning a lot about what it needs and what helps. I love being out in the sun and it is very hard on your skin. I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and can already see a difference in my skin tone and texture. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how it does after a period of time. This is an organic product and you can use it pretty much anywhere, I love it around my eyes to keep them looking healthy. It won&#x27;t clog pores so you can use it on your face. I&#x27;ve been putting it on my hands as they have been looking pretty dry this summer and it is helping a great deal. I am happy to come across this product and happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The Rosehip oil was obtained at a reduced price for reviewing.  It is an excellent quality oil which is being used on an inflammatory area of skin on my leg.  I feel less itching and burning than I did before applying the oil.  I thank you for an excellent Amazon experience.</li>
    <li> Have extremely dry skin. Uses this twice and can see a difference for the good. I would definitely continue buying this product. Delivered on time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the chance to use this oil three times and so far I really like it. I&#x27;m looking forward to improvement to my skin over time.</li>
