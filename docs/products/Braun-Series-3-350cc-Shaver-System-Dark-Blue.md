      <li>I ordered this for my husband &amp; was very happy with how quickly I got it in the mail and how great the product looks!</li>
      <li>I was good to go with a great shave, but it is way to time consuming.  </li>
      <li>The shave is not as good as a blade razor</li>
      <li>I knew it wouldnt be AS GOOD as a blade</li>
      <li>and I expect that it will eventually be just as good in the coming weeks.     </li>
      <li>Out of the box it was maybe 1-2 minutes, now its 5-6 minutes and not doing as good a job.</li>
      <li>so all together with its Cleaning and renew sistem makes it good for people with sensetive skin, just like me.</li>
      <li>I received the Braun Shaver on time and in good shape.</li>
      <li>Oh, and I had been using Braun shavers for 34 years - 32 as a very satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Nice sleek features and a good cleaning system.</li>
      <li>It takes a couple times over each area to get it all, and the neck is not always perfect the first time but it is getting it all with just a bit of work.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice to not have to take off the head and brush it out every day.  </li>
      <li>and im loving it.</li>
      <li>The shaver is good and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It did have a smooth glide and the cleaning system seemed to work fairly well, but was still unimpressed.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and use.  </li>
      <li>Luckily braun sent me a cheap battery operated razor, great...</li>
      <li>I have not been pleased to find that there is no pouch comming with the shaver.</li>
      <li>I am the one that has to be the communication between CS and service, and g) that I have to jump through so many hoops just to get it taken care</li>
      <li>and I find the results better than the rotary system.</li>
      <li>Love it to this day, cuts my shaving time in the morning by 9/10ths.</li>
      <li>Were it not for scarcity of replacement parts, I would use it more often.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I felt the foil followed more the way i shaved with a razor than the rotary did.</li>
      <li>The replacement wasn&#x27;t any better.  </li>
      <li>I am extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>I was not as satisfied with this brand of razor that I bought.  </li>
      <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I figured, &#x27;more money, better shave.&#x27;</li>
      <li>Now, with this shaver, I can enjoy a clean shave with a multi talented razor that has Braun quality written all over it (no pun intended).</li>
      <li>Ok great... so what am i supposed to do for 2-3 weeks while it is being fixed?</li>
      <li>This razor provided a very close shave and came at a good price.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my opinion that the Clean &amp; Renew system may be designed more to help generate additional income for the company.  </li>
      <li>I find the best results shaving about 10 minutes after I&#x27;m out of the shower once my face is dry but clean.  </li>
      <li>My husband loves this electric razor that came highly recomended by a good friend who has had one for a while as well.</li>
      <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave is average at best.</li>
      <li>If you have a lighter beard then the 350 should work fine</li>
      <li>But luckily amazon prices are FARRRRRRRRRR more cheaper than any brick and mortar.</li>
      <li>The best thing is the automatic cleaner, however the refills are not cheap.</li>
      <li>The cheap rotary shavers I had would like about 5-7 shaves with out</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple to use, and gives a great shave.</li>
      <li>I purchased mine when someone told me how great their Braun worked for them--it must have been a different model.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost as good as my old Remington</li>
      <li>Naturally given that good experience</li>
      <li>In these highly overpriced times, it is nice to have a quality product that performs as stated and will keep me clean shaven whenever I want without all the crazyness of using safety razors.</li>
      <li>He likes to run the clean mode as it is cool.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I need to use a mirror and hit some places 2-3 times to ensure clean</li>
      <li>also have noted the routine problem of wetness of the razor head when I remove it from the Clean &amp; Renew unit.  </li>
      <li>I will grant that this braun was more comfortable to shave with but that doesn&#x27;t help much when it doesn&#x27;t grab all the hair well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In order to save some money, I try not to charge mine on the Clean &amp; Renew unit after every use.  </li>
      <li>The razor cuts far superior to my old 7000 series and just blows the doors off the 350cc razor and feels more substantial with a quality feel lacking in the 3 series.  </li>
      <li>others I find myself having to run the razor over my face multiple times in order to get a fairly close shave.  </li>
      <li>This one is only good for maybe 4 shaves</li>
      <li>This is true....</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go for the next shave.  </li>
      <li>I am getting great shaves from it so far, closer than what I was getting with even a new blade on the Fusion.  </li>
      <li>Like the clean and shave feature, it leaves your shaver clean, and fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>Over all a winning selection, good close shave in little time.</li>
      <li>What I liked most about this unit is that it is rechargeable powered, has a self-cleaning system and a much lower cost than many other rechargeable powered units.</li>
      <li>That should pay off quickly compared to the cleaning refills.      </li>
      <li>I have owned many different brands, and Braun has always been my favorite.</li>
      <li>Thank you soo much!!</li>
      <li>The wet-dry feature was supposed to make shaving and showering more convienant but it turned out to be a major gimmick that didn&#x27;t improve the performance of the shaver, just made it easier to clean.</li>
      <li>The product is very good for a person who shaves more than twice a week, but the packing was not right and the Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refill was damaged(was empty).</li>
      <li>But I am totally satisfied so far with my purchase.</li>
      <li>So far I am about a week into owning it and love it.  </li>
      <li>Item arrived quickly and exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>just right, it is now useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was it a) cost more than the 5000 series and b) didn&#x27;t shave anywhere near as close.</li>
      <li>This particular  model (3-350cc) is especially gentle as it has a broader surface area contacting the skin.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with the shave it provides and love the fact that it is a lot quieter than the remington shavers that I used previously.  </li>
      <li>The shaver is very light, much lighter than my old Remington.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had the shaver a couple of days, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>Ok so up to this point while i am mad the unit broke they are taking good care of me (the one they sent me is as good as could be expected for a free unit).</li>
      <li>but I still have the first - a dual-voltage unit from 1983 - and use it when traveling.</li>
      <li>It is my first electric shaver</li>
      <li>There is a magnet inside the cutter that activates the cleaner once the button on the top of it is pressed, but without it attached it does not trigger properly.     </li>
      <li>This is my first Braun razor and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another.</li>
      <li>After the norelco, I used several disposable razor brands and was extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>The razor falls short most when shaving the hairs on the bottom side of the chin and neck.  </li>
      <li>I agree that is the case when you first start using it.</li>
      <li>My first time using it, it also took a while to get fully shaved.  </li>
      <li>but I have to pay it first then</li>
      <li>On first use razor seemed underpowered.  </li>
      <li>Braun used to make a good razor at a reasonable price, but this one is definitely not worth the money.</li>
      <li>I bought this shaver in july from a big box store because I wanted something faster and easier than blades since I started a new job that required me to shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device seemed nice and ran well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>far I am happy with the product, I just wish it was slightly cheaper</li>
      <li>I do use a bracing tonic to make sure by beard stands straight as possible but others may be able to get away without such fluids.</li>
      <li>The movement in the shaving heads hugs the face nicely, the middle cutter gets the longer hairs well, the trimmer works, and so far no irritation at all from this.  </li>

    <li> I have been using foil razors for years and decided to purchase this one to replace a Panasonic that was ready for new batteries and blades.  Boy, what a mistake.  On first use razor seemed underpowered.  Charged and discharged the unit over a few weeks as instructed, but never could get enough power to get a good shave in a reasonable amount of time.  Finally, exchanged it for a replacement.  The replacement wasn&#x27;t any better.  I used it for about 6 months before it finally quit working altogether.  I sent it in for warranty service hoping that it would come back working properly.  After 3 weeks I got the razor back and it was no better than when new.  Motor sounds like batteries are low and need to be recharged even after a full charge.  Manual says should get a week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of a charge, but I can never get more than one or two because it takes so long to get a decent shave.  Braun used to make a good razor at a reasonable price, but this one is definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace my 5-year-old Remington.  The shaver is very light, much lighter than my old Remington.  It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and use.  Some of the other review I&#x27;ve read elsewhere of this product state that they are not getting a close shave.  I agree that is the case when you first start using it. The instructions state that it may take up to three weeks for your beard to adjust to the new shaver.  This is definitely the case as I am now on week two with it and the shave I am getting is much closer than when I first started using it.  It&#x27;s almost as good as my old Remington and I expect that it will eventually be just as good in the coming weeks.     The cleaning system is awesome.  It&#x27;s so nice to not have to take off the head and brush it out every day.  Put it in the cleaner, push down on the button on top and you&#x27;re good to go for the next shave.  The cleaning cycle takes two minutes of the shaver running and rinsing with the cleaning solution and a 4-hour drying time once the cleaning cycle is done.    I would definitely recommend this shaver for someone who is looking to replace their current shaver.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband &amp; was very happy with how quickly I got it in the mail and how great the product looks! Thank you soo much!!</li>
    <li> Years ago I had a Panasonic Wet Dry razor that you could recharge and rinse under the tap to clean it out. It never really cut hair well and the ungainly charger meant that it had to be charged on the charging base to be used. Simply unplugging a cord from the base was not possible so, corded shaving was&#x27;nt possible. The wet-dry feature was supposed to make shaving and showering more convienant but it turned out to be a major gimmick that didn&#x27;t improve the performance of the shaver, just made it easier to clean. Now, with this shaver, I can enjoy a clean shave with a multi talented razor that has Braun quality written all over it (no pun intended). The razor itself is smooth and easily grippable with wet or dry hands. The foil cutting surface is comfortable on my face and I have yet to get razor burn. I do use a bracing tonic to make sure by beard stands straight as possible but others may be able to get away without such fluids. The trimmer is excellent, cutting through the coarsest of hairs with ease. The razor caddy has the clean and clear system built in so charging and cleaining is a breeze but if used while travelling the cord can be detached from the base and plugged into the razor directly to recharge in a travel situation and the wet dry system allows for easy rinsing under the tap for a thorough cleaning. In these highly overpriced times, it is nice to have a quality product that performs as stated and will keep me clean shaven whenever I want without all the crazyness of using safety razors.</li>
    <li> Over all a winning selection, good close shave in little time. Like the clean and shave feature, it leaves your shaver clean, and fresh smelling. Would recomend to all</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver at the beginning of October after my previous Braun shaver finally just died after almost 10 years of use.  Naturally given that good experience I chose another Braun product - I certainly wished that I had not.  After less than three months of use the plastic molding on both sides of the shaver, just below where the foil head sits, cracked in almost exactly the same place and fell off.  The shaver had not been mishandled in any way so this is simply poor design/shoddy production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted Braun about this, if I hear back from them I will post an update, but I don&#x27;t expect much from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I received my Braun 3-series shaver plus cleaning kit as a Christmas gift last year. It replaced an old 5000-series Braun, which I used daily since buying it circa 2003. My first impressions on the 3-series was that it did not give anywhere near as close of a shave as the older 5000-series (which cost half as much) did. It did have a smooth glide and the cleaning system seemed to work fairly well, but was still unimpressed.    Fast forward to March 2011. The cutter attachment started coming a little loose, which surprised me as I didn&#x27;t use it very frequently. By the time June rolled around, the cutter fall completely off. Not only can it not be re-attached, but I can no longer use the cleaning system either. There is a magnet inside the cutter that activates the cleaner once the button on the top of it is pressed, but without it attached it does not trigger properly.     Another thing that annoys me is the instruction manual claims the 3-series charges when stored upright in the cleaning machine (plugged into the wall), however that is not the case for mine. I always have to unplug the cleaning machine and plug directly into the shaver itself instead.    The only advantage of the 3-series over my older 5000 is that it is much quieter. Aside from this, I have gone back to my 8-year-old 5000, and am donating the 3-series to Goodwill.    For a $150 shaving system, I am highly disappointed with how poorly it was built.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. It is my first electric shaver so I don&#x27;t know a lot about any others except the Norelco, which wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to cut my thick whiskers. This one seems to have plenty of power and it also comes with a cord so you can plug it in and shave without charging it up. Nice sleek features and a good cleaning system. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I recently got this Braun razor from Amazon after years of using various Remington electric shavers.  I am pleased with the shave it provides and love the fact that it is a lot quieter than the remington shavers that I used previously.  This is my first Braun razor and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun series self cleaning rechargable razor before and was very happy with it.  So, I naturally went with a Braun for my next choice.  I was not as satisfied with this brand of razor that I bought.  It gives me what I consider about 80% of a full, close shave, when compared with the previous Braun model I had had.  I forget what it was.  The razor motor doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s powerful enough to be doing the job it should be doing.  It&#x27;s definitely not as powerful a motor as was in my other Braun.  The razor falls short most when shaving the hairs on the bottom side of the chin and neck.  This is where I say the 20% is lost.  It&#x27;s an okay razor, but definitely wasn&#x27;t up to my previous standard I had come to expect from my last Braun razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason to pass on this model.  I got mine on 5-26-2011.  Just a little over a year later, 07-11-2012, it needs replacing.  It no longer cleans properly.  It went through an entire 30 day Clean And Renew cartridge in 12 days!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003YJ8ZX8 Braun Series 3-350cc Shaver System, Dark Blue]] I received the Braun Shaver on time and in good shape. This shaver is replacing a much older shaver of the same kind and is working as well as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the shaver a couple of days, but so far so good. It&#x27;s simple to use, and gives a great shave. We&#x27;ll see what happens when I need to purchase the cleaning solution refills.</li>
    <li> A solid product. The only gripe I have had with these were the stupid clean and renew cartridges. If I didn&#x27;t use them, then why would I buy this one. But luckily amazon prices are FARRRRRRRRRR more cheaper than any brick and mortar. Love it to this day, cuts my shaving time in the morning by 9/10ths.</li>
    <li> The shaver was returned, I tried it for three weeeks and was dissatisfied.  It took twice as long to shave with poor results.  Called company because of the warranty and it was sent back at MY cost.  Bought a Norelco and very happy!!!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with electric exclusively for over 30 years. I have owned many different brands, and Braun has always been my favorite. They are incredibly durable and give a great shave. My last Braun died in a car accident, and my wife bought me this Braun as a replacement. Wow, does it stink. It takes literally twice the time to shave with this versus my previous Braun, and I can never get a close shave no matter how long I shave with it.    My beard is very stiff and wiry, and I have very sensitive skin. Electric is the only way for me to get a shave without bleeding or razor burn. I am disappointed in this Braun model, as it no longer works with my beard type.</li>
    <li> Alcohol cartridge leaked and shaver pulled out hair.  This was a gift for my son-in-law and he was very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Have owned it three weeks and already the cleaner unit does not work.  I have used Braun for years and been very pleased until this bad experience.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.  Try a different brand.</li>
    <li> When my Norelco razor needed new blades recently I decided to make the switch and fork out $60 for a Braun. I figured, &#x27;more money, better shave.&#x27; Wrong. After using this Braun for 15 days I am extremely disappointed. It takes twice as long to shave now. I have to go over parts of my face 5-6 times to do what the Norelco would do in 2. And even then it stills misses whiskers. I could go on but this is enough. I&#x27;m returning this piece of junk back. \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot; definitely doesn&#x27;t apply here. I&#x27;ll stick with the $25 Norelco.</li>
    <li> I just bought this shaver yesterday and LOVE IT!!! I was more of a blade guy until recently and was sick of constantly cutting my self. This shaver is closer than any of the blades I have used in the past!!!</li>
    <li> The product is very good for a person who shaves more than twice a week, but the packing was not right and the Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refill was damaged(was empty).</li>
    <li> I think I know why it is suggested that it takes a couple of weeks or so for your face to adjust to their razor.  It&#x27;s psychological; they are hoping that you forget how well your rotary razor performed (my previous razor was a Norelco).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others I find myself having to run the razor over my face multiple times in order to get a fairly close shave.  I purchased mine when someone told me how great their Braun worked for them--it must have been a different model. I am disappointed as my old rotary did a better job and it was quite old--I never did replace the heads on it. Alas, it finally died after many years of service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have noted the routine problem of wetness of the razor head when I remove it from the Clean &amp; Renew unit.  The instructions tell you not to use the razor when wet, but if you&#x27;ve left it on the cleaning unit over night, one would expect it to be dry.  I think there is a flaw in the detaching process of the razor from the cleaning unit.  By having to depress the button to remove the razor, I think that somehow  the cleaning solution is allowed to get back onto the razor head--perhaps it begins the \\&quot;renew\\&quot; cycle again.  Sometimes if I&#x27;m quick enough with pushing the button and at the same time pulling the razor away from the unit the razor head will be dry, but it&#x27;s difficult to try to make it work that way.  Usually, I end up getting some tissue or a paper towel to dry it some before actually using it on my face again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to save some money, I try not to charge mine on the Clean &amp; Renew unit after every use.  I will unplug the cord from the unit and charge it only by the cord, using some light oil occasionally on the head (per the manual instructions).  This will make a Clean &amp; Renew cartridge last about twice as long (8 weeks instead of 4 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, having to replace the cartridge every month, a person will end up spending as much for cleaning as was paid for the razor in a relativelyshort while.  It&#x27;s my opinion that the Clean &amp; Renew system may be designed more to help generate additional income for the company.  Also, I notice from the manual that in 18 months, or so, I&#x27;ll likely have to replace the foil razor head, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use it for awhile, simply to try to get some worth out of the purchase--I really don&#x27;t like to waste money.</li>
    <li> I got this for my dad, and he loves it!</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver in several years after switching to a Gillette Fusion for the past decade or so.  I had a small Braun travel shaver that I would use on occasion that would actually give me a closer shave than the blades I was using.  I also got tired of purchasing the refills for the Fusion system and decided to make a change.  After considering the price point of the various Braun series shavers, I decided on series 3 and then went shopping.  I was actually looking for one of the 3-series without the big cleansing systems.  Frankly, I don&#x27;t want to give up a big hunk of counter space for a razor and I have read that you can suck a lot of money into the cleaner refills if you use it regularly.  As fate would have it, the only series 3 I could find locally was the 350, so I went ahead.      So far I am about a week into owning it and love it.  I took it out of the package, put the cleaning system back in the box and plugged it in directly with the cord.  I am getting great shaves from it so far, closer than what I was getting with even a new blade on the Fusion.  I find the best results shaving about 10 minutes after I&#x27;m out of the shower once my face is dry but clean.  It takes a couple times over each area to get it all, and the neck is not always perfect the first time but it is getting it all with just a bit of work.  I prefer a couple extra passes from different directions with good results to what I was getting before.      The movement in the shaving heads hugs the face nicely, the middle cutter gets the longer hairs well, the trimmer works, and so far no irritation at all from this.  The included travel case is great for storing it in the drawer.  As for cleaning it, I haven&#x27;t yet used the cleaning base, but taking the top off and quickly knocking out the hair collected, followed by a quick puff of air has been enough to clean it out and get the cleaning light to turn off.  I&#x27;ll probably look for a small bottle of sewing machine lubricant tokeep it working well.  That should pay off quickly compared to the cleaning refills.      I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard or a real sensitive face, so your mileage may vary.  But I am totally satisfied so far with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This razor provided a very close shave and came at a good price.  The downside was like another reviewer wrote is that it took forever to get the close shave.  I have thick facial hair and it took nearly 20 minutes to shave and get everything off.  Once it was off I was good to go with a great shave, but it is way to time consuming.  Second bad thing about this razor is that the cleaning system base leaves the shaver full of cleaning solution once it is done cleaning.  I always took the razor out of the cleaning base and would have to fling the water out of it a couple of times in the sink to get rid of the cleaning solution that was left in the razor.  After doing this and putting it back in the cleaning unit and letting it dry I could shave.</li>
    <li> Very close shave, I like the self cleaning aspect of the device. Compared to a traditional razor the Braum razor isn&#x27;t quite as close, it also leaves some very stubble on the neck.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for a Christmas present for my son.  Item arrived quickly and exactly as described.  As far as I know, my son is pleased with it since he had requested it for a present and hasn&#x27;t mentioned otherwise.</li>
    <li> A few things I dont like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the weight, I would have expected a longer lasting battery. This one is only good for maybe 4 shaves then it&#x27;s wont turn on again. The battery indicator isnt accurate, it will light up the middle one (half charge) but then the next time it will flash low and wont turn on. The cheap rotary shavers I had would like about 5-7 shaves with out recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only 2 months the foil on the shaver head has a hole in it seems to becoming dull (they claim 18 months life for the head) but it&#x27;s taking much longer to shave then when new. Out of the box it was maybe 1-2 minutes, now its 5-6 minutes and not doing as good a job. Ive been cleaning it with the included cleaning/oil mixture it comes with but seems to make no difference.</li>
    <li> I was running an old version of this shaver for almost 3 years but it no longer holds charge or self cleans. So I updated it and bought this thing. To my surprise it is horrible.  Not only does it not shave all the effectively the head is poorly designed.  I have had it for two weeks, shaved maybe 5 times with it and the head keeps popping off and flying across my bathroom.  The most recent time this happened one of the pieces of plastic that holds the head onto the base popped off too and lost a spring. I cannot recommend this thing to anyone. The product design is horrible.   Sorry Braun but you failed on this one. :/</li>
    <li> I bought this product to replace a broken 5000-series Braun which I had owned for a couple years. The 5000 shaved well, but the beard trimmer broke off and eventually parts holding the cutting foil to the shaver head also broke off, rendering the unit unusable.   So I replaced it with this series 3. The first thing I noticed was it a) cost more than the 5000 series and b) didn&#x27;t shave anywhere near as close. Then after a few months, the beard trimmer broke off on this model just like it did on the 5000 series. This made it so that the shaver wouldn&#x27;t fit properly into the cleaning unit. Then a few months after that, just like the 5000 series, parts of the shaver head broke off.   I&#x27;ve struck out with Braun 2 times in a row now, and this will be the last time I ever purchase a Braun product. They&#x27;re simply just not well-designed or well-made.</li>
    <li> Not the best razor.  A plastic piece broke off and doesn&#x27;t give the best shave.  The best thing is the automatic cleaner, however the refills are not cheap.</li>
    <li> The shaver is good and easy to use. It shaves close to the skin. I am very pleased with it. Tender touch to the skin so all together with its Cleaning and renew sistem makes it good for people with sensetive skin, just like me. The down side of it is that you have to buy periodically new &#x27;Clean and Renew&#x27; liquid and every 18 months you have to change the cutting foil. I have not been pleased to find that there is no pouch comming with the shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been fighting with this thing for two years now.  As others have mentioned it takes FOREVER to get a somewhat close shave.  I have to cover the same area over and over again.  If I let my beard grow for a day or two this thing will yank and snag hairs.  The unit has been difficult to use from day one.  At first I thought I just needed to get used to their new system and cutting head design.  But after a few short weeks it was obvious the shaver was garbage.  Hard to justify buying another new shaver especially a Braun after this experience.  Oh, and I had been using Braun shavers for 34 years - 32 as a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this electric razor that came highly recomended by a good friend who has had one for a while as well.</li>
    <li> Husband loves his new shaver but only takes issue with the battery life. He wishes he could bring it without the cleaning/charging station on business trips. So I am not sure if there are accessories for that but I will have to look!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric shavers pretty much since I started shaving.  My last one was purchased several years ago.  AFter many many uses, and several set of cutting heads, the motor/battery are giving out.  I went shopping for a new one, and decided to try something different. The main reason is that the norelcos worked, but i found myself having to shave a long time, and in the end, the closeness of the shave was average, even with new heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this a try.  Wow, very different method of shaving.  My first time using it, it also took a while to get fully shaved.  However, I immediately noticed that the shave was closer...a lot closer.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it several times, it seems to go faster.  I have no idea why. The manual tells you it may take a little while if your shifting from norelco types systems, I just didn&#x27;t believe it at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other here have noted that the cleaning solution leaves the head of the razor wet when you pull it out to use.  This is true....and so what.  I like that it cleans it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am happy with the product, I just wish it was slightly cheaper (I paid $85).</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with my purchase. The shave is not as good as a blade razor but it is close. It takes about one-half the time to shave with this unit compared to a regular bladed razor. What I liked most about this unit is that it is rechargeable powered, has a self-cleaning system and a much lower cost than many other rechargeable powered units. Of course, the possibility exists that the high priced units may shave closer.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. The male who received it still used the disposable to get to those other hard to shave spots on his face. Not sure what the big complaint is but guess there is no real perfect shaver out there. He likes to run the clean mode as it is cool.&lt;br /&gt;Ok product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in july from a big box store because I wanted something faster and easier than blades since I started a new job that required me to shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device seemed nice and ran well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality- ehh, not amazing. I knew it wouldnt be AS GOOD as a blade but it just did not seem to pick up the hair as well as my old rotary shaver I have had for a long time but never really used a lot. I will grant that this braun was more comfortable to shave with but that doesn&#x27;t help much when it doesn&#x27;t grab all the hair well. So it lost some of its score here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning system- I thought this was going to be the best thing ever... yeahNO. The cleaning fluid smells like rancid lemoncello and it costs $5-8 a month... plus if you spill it anywhere it will take a long time to clean up since it has a mix of oils in it. Functionally it works well but for the cost, smell, and potential mess it is not worth it IMHO. Again some of the score came off from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the main issues that have caused me to rank this so low and put it in the backup/travel pile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just over three months (and by just over I mean a day or 2) the bezel/head cassette holder/what ever you wish to call it that holds all the foils and blades in cracked vertically on one of the long sides. I never dropped the unit and i only lightly tapped it out like you are supposed to do. I called customer service and after a round about discussion I was in formed that it would be covered under warranty as per the manufacturer date code (I had lost the original receipt in a move). Ok great... so what am i supposed to do for 2-3 weeks while it is being fixed? Luckily braun sent me a cheap battery operated razor, great... then they told me it would take 2-3 weeks to get it... really? Luckily it came in just a few days. Ok so up to this point while i am mad the unit broke they are taking good care of me (the one they sent me is as good as could be expected for a free unit). So I ship off the broken unit on my dime (insured) and wait, then I get a call from their service center telling me I owe them 36 bucks, 26 for parts and 10 for shipping... I told the lady customer service said it was covered under warranty, she replied that the parts that broke are not covered under warranty regardless of how new the unit is. So its back to customer service. I call and spend the last 20 mins of my lunch break fighting with a CS rep to get them to cover the repair they told me 10 days ago would be covered. I finally get her to cover it... but they will only cover the parts not the shipping (and I have to contact the service center and give them a code for this instead of them taking care of it in the back end). My lunch break ends before I can resolve it any more and have to call back the next day. The next call takes me 40 mins, I fight back and forth with the rep and finally get them to cover the shipping too... but I have to pay it first then fax them the invoice and wait 2-3 weeks to get the money refunded to my card. I ask for a supervisor which gives me no more help and frankly just seems like he doesn&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly I am rather disappointed with a)that the razor was not as good as was expected in the first place, b)that the maintenance cost of just the cleaning fluid is as much if not more than blades would be, c)that it doesnt save me any time, d)that the unit broke so quickly, e)that customer service doesnt seem to have any ability to agree with itself, f)that I am the one that has to be the communication between CS and service, and g) that I have to jump through so many hoops just to get it taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest you avoid this product and maybe even braun as a whole after seeing how bad CS is there. Stick to blades.</li>
    <li> Pros: Easy to grip, can be used in the shower, self-cleaning, integral cleaner/charger base, indicator light that tells when to clean/charge&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Alcohol-based cleaning solution, poor design/quality, poor shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line Up Front: Don&#x27;t purchase this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently retired from the military.  At that time this was purchased I still required a close shave daily.  This is the third Braun I have owned.  The second gave up after 20 years of daily use but I still have the first - a dual-voltage unit from 1983 - and use it when traveling. Were it not for scarcity of replacement parts, I would use it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Series 3 350cc prior to reading online reviews - a mistake.  Most reviews on this page echoing the negative issues below, as well as others, are spot-on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning/charging unit takes up a bit of countertop space but isn&#x27;t overly invasive.  It does however, use an alcohol-based cleaning solution that evaporates down to the \\&quot;minimum cleaning solution\\&quot; indicator line rather quickly. Considering the shaver requires cleaning and recharging once a week, the standard user gets 4-8 cleanings per tank. I can get up to nine months out of a tank by removing and recapping after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave is average at best. Despite having a relatively light beard (grows for 2-3 days before really noticeable) it still takes me roughly double the time of previous shavers to get everything.  I need to use a mirror and hit some places 2-3 times to ensure clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I frequently use the trimmer attachment to mow down the occasional rogue hairs or those I&#x27;ve missed for more than 3-4 days (see above) - which the shaver cannot then cut.  I got maybe three years&#x27; use from the trimmer attachment before it began to come apart inside.  Although I could get it to work for awhile by holding it just right, it is now useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO - regarding this purchase - I paid roughly 150% cost of a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shaver.  In return I recieved approximately four years of poor shaves (this includes the post-retirement year I was trying to grow a beard) and a trip to the store to purchase a Wahl trimmer.  Up side is that I have only replaced the cleaning solution four times.  I will continue to use this until it wears out.  It should not take much longer.0% cost of a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shaver.

    <li> This electric shaver is exceptional! I have tried many different brands of shavers and this one is just right for my sensitive skin.  This particular  model (3-350cc) is especially gentle as it has a broader surface area contacting the skin.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Several years ago I had a Norelco. After that one died, I was skeptical about buying another one. The shave was never very close. After the norelco, I used several disposable razor brands and was extremely satisfied with the results. I grew tired of paying over $20 for the \\&quot;refills\\&quot;. After a long time, I started looking into electric shaving again, but decided to give the foil a chance vs. the rotary. I felt the foil followed more the way i shaved with a razor than the rotary did. I am extremely satisfied with the results. It does take a while, but it feels like a very close shaved and I find the results better than the rotary system. Ive been using it for about two months and im loving it. I wish the cleaning solution will last longer. If you are trying to decide between foil or rotary, i hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> I have used one braun shavers for over 7 years i purchased here from Amazon a 7000 series.  Great razor no issue but the replacement heads for the specific razor are not being sold anymore just a more general head that covers all these older razors so it did not work correctly imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, i decided to get a new razor and chose the 3-350cc shaver system and purchased from Walmart as it was on sale.  I quickly found that it took twice as long to shave than my original 7000 series razor. The trimmer feature worked great, the cleaning system was nice but just got tired of reshaving the same area several times to get a close shave and I will say i have a heavy beard.  I took it back to Walmart after 3 weeks of use and Picked up the 7-760cc razor and cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7 series is like night and day compared to the 3 series. The razor cuts far superior to my old 7000 series and just blows the doors off the 350cc razor and feels more substantial with a quality feel lacking in the 3 series.  If you have a lighter beard then the 350 should work fine but if you have a little extra to spend i highly recommend jumping to the 7 series its amazing the difference in quality and cutting speed.</li>
