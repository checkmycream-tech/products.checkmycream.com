      <li>and it still works great!</li>
      <li>compared to competitive products out there it isn&#x27;t best in class.</li>

      <li>my hair the best.  </li>
      <li>It curls great too and can make incredible waves!!  </li>
      <li>i had the 2\\&quot; version of this straightener for 4 years and absolutely loved it!</li>
      <li>however, i dont regret buying it because it works great.</li>
      <li>but besides that it&#x27;s not that great at what it does.</li>
      <li>Price is great as well.</li>
      <li>Great buy</li>
      <li>It has a great DVD with it.</li>
      <li>It did a great job.</li>
      <li>A VERY nice feature, not always found on</li>
      <li>Of course, this is a very nice feature.</li>
      <li>Price is fair, very nice design, very light and works perfect.</li>
      <li>it does a good job straightening and curling</li>
      <li>The recessed plate would be a good idea, but there are grooves between the casing and the plate that always catch my hair.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I really loved the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The straightener also kept snagging my hair at the edge of the heating plates and pulled out a surprising amount of hair during 30 minutes of use.</li>
      <li>It is designed not to twist or kink and it does a good job of doing neither.      </li>
      <li>For people with shorter, thinner hair, this is a good straightener.</li>
      <li>It is designed not to twist or kink and it does a good job of doing neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, I think this is a really good deal. ^_^</li>
      <li>The one criticism I have of this hair straightener is that it takes a good while to heat up-- here</li>
      <li>works as described, good quality</li>
      <li>All in all, it was good if they move the on/off switch.  </li>
      <li>Works so wonderfully and is so quick and easy to use!!</li>
      <li>It is definitely a great deal for the price as it&#x27;s much better than the revlon analogue which is selling for around 40$.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the performance of the Remington, I found the iron worked great for both straightening and curling.</li>
      <li>A great product for cheap!</li>
      <li>but I did not want to spend much, and this one has a perfect price, perfect design, and on top of everything it does a super job!!</li>
      <li>I love that!  </li>
      <li>and i ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>but I love the shiny hair benefit from this one!  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>The product heats up really fast is an excellent iron.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>nothing spectacular at all.</li>
      <li>and it has a nice design.</li>
      <li>so I knew this would come handy.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a really great product!</li>
      <li>The plates are slim which is nice</li>
      <li>when your iron is on (I have used some that you can&#x27;t tell without looking at the read-out OR putting a hand close to the iron, but you can with this one, and it&#x27;s a nice feature to have!)&lt;br /&gt;Directions</li>
      <li>It has temperature controls which are a really good feature to make sure hair gets the temperature that straightens/curls without hurting it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked this product.  </li>
      <li>and it was not even warm.  </li>
      <li>I would have known that there is a handy dandy lock feature which closes the appliance for storage.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to store, works great, I love it!</li>
      <li>give it a very high recommendation good purchase happy about it.</li>
      <li>This was brand new - perfect condition - came in record time!  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
      <li>Love love love this!</li>
      <li>While the pros are great, Remington still has some work to do to make this a stellar</li>
      <li>DVD menu is a bit strained and could be done better, although the content on how to straighten, curl, do an easy but beautiful up-do, look like a spiral perm, and backcombing that with fingers for a softer look are some really kewl salon tricks that you&#x27;ll love!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had much time to get really experienced with curling/straightening irons, but this one is extremely easy to use!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know, but this is a nice iron that deserves a good look, and the price is certainly right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>More frizzy than curly.  </li>
      <li>but I think many would agree with me.</li>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s an okay iron, but</li>
      <li>Better than the one I had purchased in the store for more money.</li>
      <li>Then it eventually broke, as most of these &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; ones do,</li>
      <li>i love to use and this one is one of the 2.</li>
      <li>The DVD was interesting to view as well but seems rather gimicky to me.</li>
      <li>I need more practice in order to create the curls per the DVD</li>
      <li>So, it straightens ok.  </li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite straightener.</li>
      <li>and I tend to take more care in the process with the Remington than I do with the Barbar.  </li>
      <li>, i think it&#x27;s what i love most.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I have traveled with it and that is where my love affair with my Barbar ends.  </li>
      <li>Like I said it&#x27;s just ok at what it does.</li>
      <li>and I tend to take more care in the process with the Remington than I do with the Barbar.  </li>
      <li>I love it and plan to buy another one for myself since I share the one i bought with my daughter.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed using this product MUCH more.  </li>
      <li>I was able to review these two products side by side and have to give the nod to the Wahl product.</li>
      <li>Loved the bonus CD which had many useful tips.</li>
      <li>sure what I&#x27;ll do at this point</li>
      <li>With some research I think you could find a better product.  </li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>It really seemed like a great product.</li>
      <li>This one rates somewhere in between my favorite ([[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite impressed by this flat</li>
      <li>This flat iron is amazing!!!!</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this one when it first came out, probably a good 4 years ago.</li>
      <li>This is a really good product that gets extremely HOT</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As another reviewer said, the Remington Shine Therapy is a better flat iron for just $10 more.   This iron works okay, but not as good as other flat irons I own. It does give you a DVD showing how to style your hair, but that was not a lot of help for me. I know how to use a flat iron. :)  It has an automatic shut-off feature that turns off after an hour. Of course, this is a very nice feature. It&#x27;s slim and compact. I did not find that it heats up extremely fast. I had to go over my hair a couple of times to get it straight like I like to wear it.  All in all, it&#x27;s an okay iron, but nothing spectacular at all.</li>
    <li> I was able to review these two products side by side and have to give the nod to the Wahl product. A larger surface area and faster heating makes styling less of a chore with that product. The Remington does work as advertised, it is just that compared to competitive products out there it isn&#x27;t best in class.</li>
    <li> I find that after using this flat iron that my hair does not remain straight.  I am not impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> I hate my hair because it is short but frizzy! This straightener really did tame it though.   The plates are narrow so that I can make waves sometimes. The heating temperature is adjustable.   The best thing is the safety feature-I always forget to turn off my straighteners and so I am also worried I will come home to the house burnt down! This one automatically turns off whenever I leave it on.   Very happy!</li>
    <li> The purchase of this item was a complete waste for me. It does not perform as advertised. I followed the instructions on the DVD to curl my hair (starting with clean dry hair, pinning hair out of the way, using small sections of hair, wrapping strand of hair around once, and rotating 180 degrees to get curl). I have relatively healthy, long, straight, fine, unprocessed hair and I started out with a lower heat setting of about 340 degrees. After getting no results, I eventually increased the heat setting up to 390 degrees. This left a few random bumps in my hair that the straightener could not even smooth out afterwards. The straightener also kept snagging my hair at the edge of the heating plates and pulled out a surprising amount of hair during 30 minutes of use. My hair would not stay wound around the straightener in a 180 degree turn to create the curl without holding on to the ends of the hair and eventually I had to let go to keep from burning my fingers. At the 390 degree heat setting my hair smelled burnt and looked frizzy. I have never been so disappointed in a purchase before. This straightener did not even come close to curling my hair and it performed poorly as a simple hair straightener.</li>
    <li> I had previously received the Remington S9950 a few months ago so I had that to compare this one to. Although they&#x27;re both from the same company, the Remington S9950 is a much better flat iron. The only plus to this one is that it comes with a DVD that guides you but besides that it&#x27;s not that great at what it does. This one tends to catch your hair and it doesn&#x27;t heat up as well as the other one does. Like I said it&#x27;s just ok at what it does. If you have the time to sit for a while to get your hair straight then this is for you. If you don&#x27;t then I would suggest getting something else.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the tourmaline in this - it&#x27;s certainly not the heat as I have a hair straightener (without tourmaline) but this one makes my hair shinier.  Both of course smooth my hair out since it is a heated hair straightener but I love the shiny hair benefit from this one!  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to store, works great, I love it! Two thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> I had my sister try it out and give me feedback on the product. Here&#x27;s what she had to say. It is fast heating, light, long cord and it has a nice design. She is more familiar with other hair straighteners and has used them, so I am giving this a 4.5 star based on what she told me.</li>
    <li> For everyday, I use a cordless Barbar 1900 flat iron.  I love it.  It heats up extraordinarily quickly, gets hot enough to handle my thick and stubborn mane, and as it is cord-free allows for unlimited movement.  I have traveled with it and that is where my love affair with my Barbar ends.  It&#x27;s a big pain in the booty-- clumsy and unwieldy.  I was very interested to see if I would like a corded unit and was open to the prospect of making it my everyday flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the Remington is how light and compact it is.  Compared to the Barbar (which is not listed on Amazon), it is like holding nothing at all.  I love that!  So, I plugged it in for its first use.  I had soooo many issues with this flat iron.  The heat settings kept getting screwed up because the placement of the controls is under my fingers and every time I pressed the plates together, I changed the setting.  Boy, was I frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was frustrated until my husband posed a question to me:  \\&quot;Have you read the manual?\\&quot; he asked.  Of course not.  Had I read the manual before I plugged in the straightener I would have known that there is a lock feature which prevents one from accidentally changing the heat setting during use.  I would have known that there is a turbo heat setting which speeds the time needed to get the iron up to temp.  I would have known that there is a handy dandy lock feature which closes the appliance for storage.  But, of course I hadn&#x27;t read the instructions before use, I was too excited to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the manual (which was NOT a time-consuming process) I enjoyed using this product MUCH more.  The one criticism I have of this hair straightener is that it takes a good while to heat up-- here&#x27;s the disclaimer though: I have super thick and stubborn hair and I use the flat iron at its highest setting.  I turn it on to heat up when I start blow drying my hair.  By the time I am ready for it, it is ready for me.  The narrow plates took some getting used to as I am used to a little wider.  I like the results-- my hair is sleek and polished.  For me, the smaller plates mean I can&#x27;t put a lot of hair between them at once and I tend to take more care in the process with the Remington than I do with the Barbar.  The cord is really a non-issue for me even though I am used to a cordless.  It is designed not to twist or kink and it does a good job of doing neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this item only 4 stars because it does take a while to heat up for me.  However, once it does heat up, the results one can achieve are easy to do and fabulous to behold!etting used to as I am used to a little wider.  I like the results-- my hair is sleek and polished.

    <li> I don&#x27;t like where the buttons are, they are placed right where your fingers go to press the iron together, changing the temperature while ironing...etc. Then, I had trouble getting the plates to meet.  They just wouldn&#x27;t close all the way.  I would have to use a large section of hair and then it was to large to be effective.</li>
    <li> I got rid of my CHI thinking I should give my hair a vacation from heat, but after deciding I could not live without straightened hair, I wanted to get another iron without spending a lot of money. I decided to buy this one, but it caught a few strands of hair during the first use and it did not get my hair very straight. It just looked like I used the blow dryer to straighten it. Since it made my hair silky I would rate it a 3 star. I ended up taking mine back.</li>
    <li> I think that this straightener manages to give the heat, consistency, and ceramic plates necessary for a quality hair straightener.  And at less than fifty dollars, it&#x27;s a good value too.  I do have concerns about the LED screen giving out though it hasn&#x27;t so far.  Personally, I still prefer my CHI, but for someone who is looking for a bargain, this is a good option.</li>
    <li> A few months ago I reviewed another Remington flat iron that totally blew my mind.  So, I really had high hopes for this one.  Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed.  This flat iron is okay for the price, but it is not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description is a little misleading.  It claims it has a \\&quot;Turbo Boost\\&quot; feature, which implies it heats up quickly.  This is not the case.  The so-called \\&quot;Turbo Boost\\&quot; just means that if you hold the button down a couple of seconds it sets it to the highest temperature.  But it still takes more than 10 minutes for it to actually reach that temperature.  I was really disappointed with this because the other Remington flat iron I tried heated up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plate design is flawed, as well.  The recessed plate would be a good idea, but there are grooves between the casing and the plate that always catch my hair.  I spend my time trying to free my hair without ripping it out.  My Sedu Revolution, which has a similar recessed plate design, has never done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the other Remington flat iron I reviewed, the button design is not good.  The buttons are right where you want your fingers to be when you are working with it.  The lock feature isn&#x27;t helpful because you lock and unlock it by holding down those same buttons.  So I find that I am constantly locking and unlocking the buttons, and changing the temperature setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested a lot of flat irons from different brands.  This one is just average for its price range.  With some research I think you could find a better product.  In fact, I really loved the [[ASIN:B001LF4I8I Remington S9950 Shine Therapy Straightener]] that I tried a few months ago.  And it is only $10 more.</li>
    <li> I really like the Remington S-1051. It has a great DVD with it. The cord moves around without tangling. It heats up pretty fast and after straightening a strand of hair you can do a little curl on the end. It left my hair feeling sleek and smooth after using it on a frizzy mess. I also like the size of it. For the price it is a superb product that you will find yourself using instead of your more expensive straighteners. Highly reccomended.</li>
    <li> This is a good little straightener for the price.  It has temperature controls which are a really good feature to make sure hair gets the temperature that straightens/curls without hurting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DVD is a good basic course but the way you have to keep going from bit to bit is a little irritating.  It goes back to the menu from every section and you have to scroll down to select the next one to see.  The little dance to show off the hair at the end of each one is weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The techniques demonstrated on the DVD show that having someone else do your hair is easier than trying to do it yourself.  This might be a good DVD and straightener for teens to use when experimenting on each other.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite impressed by this flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, just because you can lock the keys, doesn&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t unlock the keys. Because of the location of the buttons, my fingers are constantly hitting the keys and I did unknowingly unlock it and turn it off the second time I used it. That is very very annoying and by far the biggest drawback of this product. The other drawback is that the casing gets very very hot. This doesn&#x27;t make it impossible to touch the end for curling and other maneuvering purposes, it just means you have to be more careful. At least I do since I&#x27;m used to using something that doesn&#x27;t get hot on the end. The last thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this is that when I first went to turn it on, I thought it was broken because I kept pressing on the on/off button and nothing was happening. You have to hold the button down to get it to turn on. It&#x27;s not a deal breaker, but I thought I&#x27;d throw it out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the good parts: This can definitely hold it&#x27;s own in comparison to my Solia. I can honestly say that it straigtens my hair almost as good as my other way more expensive flat iron, it doesn&#x27;t pull or leave indentions in my hair, and the frizz control isn&#x27;t half bad either. I&#x27;m very happy with the results I get with it. I&#x27;m not ready to toss out my Solia as I think that one still performs a wee bit better, but this one will fit perfectly in the rotation. I get similiar results, and it&#x27;s very pretty as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very low maintenance with my hair so the DVD isn&#x27;t much use to me. But it was fun to watch and it seems easy enough to follow if I ever feel like doing something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I think this is a really good deal. ^_^</li>
    <li> I just got my hair cut short, and decided to give this straightener a try when on vacation in FL.  I haven&#x27;t owned one in years because I disliked the flat-ironed look my old one produced, but this little Remington is a wonder.  I have thick hair that curls nicely on a good day and waves uncontrollably on a bad day.  Nonetheless, I was able to achieve straight hair with one pass on the lowest temperature setting.  Best of all, my hair was straight but not flat, and it stayed straight all day despite the FL humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint come from the placement of the power and temperature buttons- I agree with other reviews that it is too easy to accidentally turn off the straightener or to change the temperature because of the location of the buttons.  Were it not for this design flaw, this straightener would definitely rate five stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m VERY picky. I decided to try this straightener because I got tired of my 2\\&quot; Conair Infiniti being so bulky. Finally deciding Remington was a well trusted brand I bought it.     Pros~  Left hair unbelievable shiny  Very soft texture  Heats up fast    Cons~  Snagged my hair so many times the first use that I stopped using it  Trying to clamp down on your hair is a PAIN because of the constant hitting the power button  Doesn&#x27;t do anything for frizz and left many flyaways strand in my hair    For people with shorter, thinner hair, this is a good straightener. If you have thick long, hard to style hair like I do, I recommend the Conair Infiniti 1\\&quot; Tourmaline Ceramic Straightener or a CHI.</li>
    <li> I have type 3b curly hair. According to my stylist that means that I have nice not very frizzy curls that are about an inch in diameter. For the last 6 years, my straightener has been my most needed friend. I straighten my hair every morning and I don&#x27;t leave my home unless my hair looks perfect.     I&#x27;ve been through about 4 straighteners during this period and have tried many of my friends&#x27; and I would rank this as an average product. It is definitely a great deal for the price as it&#x27;s much better than the revlon analogue which is selling for around 40$. I believe the plates are tourmaline.     The remington straightens my hair very effectively in a relatively short time. It only takes about 2 runs to get my hair to be sleek and straight. It&#x27;s also thin enough to get close to the roots and the curved shape prevents me from burning my scalp. However, while my hair looks perfectly straight it doesn&#x27;t look at all natural and 3 hours later i always find the ends of my hair curling. Also, if my hair is anything short of completely dry before I start working on it I cannot get this straightener to work at all. I never had these issue with my royale or chi straighteners. They seem to lock my hair into place and I never found a curl until I washed my hair. They were also a lot more gentle with my hair. Of course, they were both over a $100 each. I suppose I&#x27;ll be less upset when I part with this one.</li>
    <li> Bad, took it back. It catches your hairs in the grooves and pulls them out! I tried several times to give it a chance, it went back! DO  NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing!!!! It straightens my medium length hair in less than 5 minutes!!  It does an amazing job!!! It curls great too and can make incredible waves!!  I recommend this to all! And the iron itself is   Gorgeous with the chocolate brown handles and pink plates and buttons!!  It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the purchase. At first, I was not impressed and I bought based on people´s comments and the price. I was looking for a high quality hair straightner but I did not want to spend much, and this one has a perfect price, perfect design, and on top of everything it does a super job!! I love it and plan to buy another one for myself since I share the one i bought with my daughter. I truly recommend. Price is fair, very nice design, very light and works perfect.</li>
    <li> I wanted one tool that could straighten or do waves or curls--this one does.&lt;br /&gt;Something in the finish leaves my hair shinier than the old teflon surface iron I used before.</li>
    <li> So, i have 3 curling irons. 2 i love to use and this one is one of the 2. i haven&#x27;t relaxed my new growth since May so i&#x27;ve natural hair underneath. I&#x27;ve been using this iron to straighten  and all my hair looks the same. It really does an amazing job and the thick coarse hir i have. i only used the dvd twice but then i tend to style my hair the same way. It heats super fast, love how you can lock the temperature and it&#x27;s small enough for you to use to curl as well. I love the digital display, i think it&#x27;s what i love most. i really don&#x27;t plan on gettin any more flat irons. Price is great as well.</li>
    <li> I needed to get a flat iron that could heat up to over 400degrees to do a keratin treatment. Did not want to buy the keratin flat iron for lots lots more money. I also wanted a flat iron that could curl...this was a dream come true. Also heats up very very quickly and stays hot.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product that gets extremely HOT very fast- I mean within seconds this thing is steaming hot and ready for use. This is great to use on naturally tightly curled hair; however, I would not use it on chemically processed hair.  The directions say not to use this in one area for too long and I believe it too.  It does leave hair super soft and very straight. Since it gets so hot, it takes a very short time to straighten my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a used one when I ordered from Amazon- it had dandruff flakes on it that totally grossed me out. Anyway, I returned it and ordered mine directly from the manufacturer. Also it comes with a four year warranty and the Chi and FHI only comes with a one year warranty so I decided to go with the one that stands behind it&#x27;s product the longest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a DVD that does a great job showing how to create various striaght, curly, wavey, and runway hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This thing snags my hair, so I am discontinuing the use of it. If you want to pull your hair out then use this one, if not go with another flat iron.</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited when I got this straightener. It really seemed like a great product. I watched the little instruction DVD that came with it and was excited to try some new styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first problem I had was that it took a long time to heat up. Much much longer than my old straightener. Finally, it was hot and I began using it and it seemed to do a nice job until -OUCH! Some of my hair was caught between where the plate meets the plastic. I had to have my husband come try to get it out. We couldn&#x27;t so I just ripped it out. Really painful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shut it off and went back to my old straightener. Hey, at least I got some decent tips from the instructional DVD!</li>
    <li> This flat iron gets nice and hot very fast and does a nice job at a great price.  The DVD is very helpful.  The only concern is one has to be very careful as unlike a traditional flat iron the heating element is exposed so users have to be a bit more careful when using it.  Overall a nice product.</li>
    <li> This straightening iron does exactly what I expected it to do.  It warms up VERY quickly, works well, and leaves my hair pin straight.  The settings go up to very high heat, and I like the digital temperature reading.  The only thing that&#x27;s a bit of a pain is that the buttons are on the outside of the iron, right where I hold it.  At first I kept accidentally shutting it off when I was straightening my hair.  I have not used it for the curling feature, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.  Over all, it&#x27;s a solid product.  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> My brother has five girls so I knew this would come handy. And they all have different hair types and lengths ranging from short to extra long. My eldest neice has thick curly hair and I liked that it was able to straighten her hair, but sometimes the ends get a little hot. I gave it five stars because this was my only gripe and I enjoyed the instructional DVD which was helpful when they needed different hairstyles for their social events.</li>
    <li> This ceramic hair straightener is decent. You get what you pay for, basically. It works fine but if you really want to straighten your hair properly on a daily basis without damaging it, you should get one in the $100-$150 range.  Just my opinion but I think many would agree with me. That said, the Remington S-1051 is not a bad product at all. The build quality is decent and it works fine. The temperature control is fine and it does what it says. I can&#x27;t complain but then again everyone&#x27;s hair is different and if you have extremely curly locks, you should probably invest in a better quality straightener that will last for many years to come. I don&#x27;t know how long this unit will last but I would say it isn&#x27;t going to break down any time soon as long as it&#x27;s not abused.</li>
    <li> We used this a few weeks to test and found it pretty good with accurate heating going on. It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side for a female with tiny arms but otherwise excellent. Love the digital heat indicator that makes a huge difference over the older dial types that aren&#x27;t accurate at all.  The DVD was interesting to view as well but seems rather gimicky to me.</li>
    <li> I really like how this product leaves my hair straight and soft ALL DAY. This is the first straighter that has done this. This is my forth straighter in a year, I know that&#x27;s crazy but i need one and i needed one that worked. I can finally stop looking!! My hair with out product is full, frizzy and has odd random waves. After using this straighter my hair is pretty all day! I prefer to slightly curl the end of my hair under and it works great for this. Also I have not had any problems with it pulling my hair like other people have so hopefully this is a problem Remington fixed. IT didn&#x27;t take long at all for it to heat up for me and the lock feature is great because you will hit the buttons when doing your hair. A great product for cheap!</li>
    <li> I have owned a number of flat irons and use it daily. This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve bought. My roommate owns the same one and I was using hers so much that I bought my own. I love it!</li>
    <li> This thing is great! I have used a handful of other, cheaper straighteners, and they leave crimp-lines in my hair, or even pull hair out of my head as I use them. I thought I had to get a really expensive straightener to avoid those problems. But this straightener is almost perfect! It heats up really fast and it has really smooth surfaces that let my hair slide through easily. The sides stay cool enough that I can hold the straightener near the top if I need to (although, to be honest, I don&#x27;t have to keep it on very long or get very hot because my hair is short and fine). The only problem I&#x27;ve seen (and it is enough of a problem that I&#x27;m taking away a whole star) is that, no matter how I hold the straightener, the sides of my fingers or thumb press the buttons as I straighten. I have really fine hair, so the temperature needs to be really low, but my fingers turn the heat up as I use the straightener, and I have to keep turning it back down again.</li>
    <li> I had bought this same kind of flat iron from Target about three years ago and it still worked like it was brand new. I recently broke it by stepping on it, so I bought this one, thinking it&#x27;d be the same flat iron that I loved. Not the case. It is an updated version of the same one, but the plates feel ENTIRELY different. The first one had SMOOTH plates, these ones feel almost slightly gritty. I avoid using it as much as possible bc I&#x27;m afraid the texture will damage my hair even more. I&#x27;m going to get a different one as soon as possible. So unhappy with this.</li>
    <li> works as described, good quality</li>
    <li> This is my third Vine review of a straightening iron and by now I finally have things to compare. This one is okay, but truthfully the other two I have are better. The plates are slim which is nice but they catch hair like some other reviewers mentioned, so one should be extra vigilant about this, considering the product gets very hot, accidents aren&#x27;t worth good hair. Also it takes a really long time to heat up, almost to the point of me forgetting that it&#x27;s on! That kind of sucks...I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I had to get it for a friend, simply because there are other strengtheners out there that do the job with less work.    So yes, basically it works but with few cons, not the best hair tool if you have many to pick from.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. It straightens my short hair beautifully and leaves it with a healthy shine and it lasts all day. There is no bad smell or any indication that it is damaging my hair. It also never pulls. I dont even need product after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates are a pretty pink, while the body is a complementary wine color, making it feminine and a little fun. The controls are digital and default to 300 degrees, which I usually turn down a bit. I have traveled with it twice and it is so thin and streamlined it takes up no room at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature is that the cord can swivel 360 degrees, so you dont end up with a tightly wound cord. The cord is nice and long too, giving me more freedom to move around when Im doing my hair.</li>
    <li> This straightener is alright. it does a good job straightening and curling but my hair will catch on the inside edges of the irons and break. The ends do get very warm, so be careful if you tend to grab up there. I would suggest this product if you are looking for a decent straightener/curler to use on semi-fine hair. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I liked this product.  I have used several flat irons over the past 10 years and this one is adequate.  I have thick, medium length, curly hair, and I flat iron it daily.  It has adjustable temperature settings that allow me to get it hot enough to straighten my hair.  The two things I didn&#x27;t like about this iron are 1. the narrow plates and 2. the locations of the buttons.  Narrow plates mean that it takes longer to straighten my hair and it doesn&#x27;t seem to look as smooth.  Poorly placed, and easily pushed buttons cause me to change the temperature inadvertently or turn it off completely.  Not a bad product, but this isn&#x27;t the right iron for my type of hair or the frequency that I use it.</li>
    <li> I did my homework and read all the reviews before purchasing this product. There were so many positive comments I decided they outweighed the negative, but have since changed my mind.    I bought this iron to replace an older flat iron, so I have at least one other iron to compare. The only positive things I can say are:  - Lightweight  - Easy to use  - Temperature controls were not a problem for me as in other reviews (perhaps the product has been redesigned)    Drawbacks:  - My hair caught in the seams of the plates very badly  - I needed a much higher temperature (100 degrees more!!) than my old flat iron to get my hair straightened  - Left my hair dry and frizzy  - It took me much longer to straighten my hair than with my old iron, requiring a dozen or more passes (and I have soft, easy to straighten hair)  - Personally, I found the video rather cheesy, but that&#x27;s just me    Overall I am very disappointed and will be returning this flat iron.</li>
    <li> So i was having a hard time choosing which straightener to get. I picked this one because it said how smooth it made your hair. It actually does the opposite. It pulls your hair when you straighten your hair. Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> Although UPS claims to have delivered this item, it was never received by my daughter to whom I sent it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had much time to get really experienced with curling/straightening irons, but this one is extremely easy to use!  I have thick, stubborn, Asian hair, but I have no problem getting a style to stay with this iron.  And because I don&#x27;t have much experience, I tend to get my hair stuck in the bolts and kinks of other irons, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with this simple, sleek, and light iron.  It heats up and cools really fast, and gets the job done fast.  Many styles possible, no complaints!</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time in very well condition. Product is similar to description mentioned on this page.&lt;br /&gt; I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> And as I expected cause of the reviews, my Remington works perfectly, shiny hair, solf, and gets super hot in seconds. Very happy with my purchase!!!</li>
    <li> This is my experience as an African American woman who has extremely thick relaxed hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  *I originally purchased this product in July of 2010, and it is still going strong&lt;br /&gt;  *The past three years with this straightener have been amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;  *I no longer have to repeatedly go over sections 3-4 times, as with my previous straightener&lt;br /&gt;  *It can be used to create both loose and tight curls&lt;br /&gt;  *The instructional DVD teaches you new ways to use the flat iron&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  *Because of the awkward placement of the power button, I sometimes accidentally turn it off while using it&lt;br /&gt;  * I have gotten my hair caught in the plates a few times.</li>
    <li> There is no flat iron that straightens AND curls my hair like this one! I have very course curly hair and with about 2 passes, my hair is silky straight. I haven&#x27;t been to the beauty parlor in about a year because this flat iron does the job better than anyone could do my hair. When I curl my hair the curls last all day and I think it creates better curls then a regular curling iron. I just bought my second one if these because I had the first one for 5 years and it finally burned out after everyday usage. I hope they make a larger one of these to create bigger curls too. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Love love love this! Works so wonderfully and is so quick and easy to use!! Works good on my short hair....would never use rollers or curling iron again</li>
    <li> I tried this product and I was not happy with the turnout. I have a more expensive iron that does the job and this one did not compare to it. My hair didn&#x27;t feel silky and additionally the problem that I have with this product is the location of the control buttons. They&#x27;re located on the outside and as I held the iron, many times my fingers would accidentally change the settings. The old saying is true, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this one.  In spite of what the packaging said, it takes forever to heat up.  I also couldn&#x27;t get the safety lock to work on it.  I am not happy with it.  The only plus I can give it: it is very smooth and glides down my hair very well.  So, it straightens ok.  I will probably use a different one though, I don&#x27;t want my kids to get burnt.</li>
    <li> The hair straightener heated up and cooled down quickly, which was very convienent.  It did not snag any of the hair and straightened well, even at the lowest setting.  I did not like the placement of the on/off switch.  I kept turning the iron off accidently.  Holding my hand higher on the shaft was too hot, holding my hand lower, was too awkard.  All in all, it was good if they move the on/off switch.  It did a great job.</li>
    <li> This was brand new - perfect condition - came in record time!  Better than the one I had purchased in the store for more money. Thanks for a really great product!</li>
    <li> i had the 2\\&quot; version of this straightener for 4 years and absolutely loved it! but this new, 1\\&quot; version was completly different.  this straightener is way too hot (300 degrees Fahrenheit MINIMUM). absolutely FRIES your hair; and your hands. i took it back after just one day.    also, the placing of the buttons is terrible. and if you are trying to hold the straightener anywhere near the plates to turn it for the rotating curl, GOOD LUCK. there is no where to hold it without burning yourself besides the 2-3 inches between the plates and the on/off button.    overall not a very well designed straightener.    I ended up getting the Remington 1\\&quot; Damage Therapy Straightener with teflon fiber weave plates and i ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I recommend it to anyone looking for a new Remington.</li>
    <li> This advanced styling tool is unique in that it lets you straighten or curl your hair without the need for separate devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straighter heats up rather quickly and will safety heat up to 430°F. It comes with a small booklet that lets you know which temperatures to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a key pad lock so you don&#x27;t change the temperature while curling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for straightening:. To get my daughter&#x27;s hair perfectly straight I did have go over each section 2-3 times, but she has naturally curly hair. I have found most straighteners require that I go over her hair a few times. My daughter also commented that it pulled her a hair a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the performance of the Remington, I found the iron worked great for both straightening and curling.</li>
    <li> i moved to north america few months back and i needed a new straightener because my previous babyliss straightener was from UK, and it does not work here for 110 V. So I ended up buying this at The Bay...at a higher price :( CAD$50. I was desperate to get one coz i cant stay without a straightener, it&#x27;s a must for me. however, i dont regret buying it because it works great. just one problem, sometimes it pulls out strands of hair (that&#x27;s the reason i give it a 4). if u be careful, then it&#x27;s perfect to buy. u can both straighten n curl ur hair with the same tool :)</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite straightener. I fell in love with this one when it first came out, probably a good 4 years ago. Then it eventually broke, as most of these &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; ones do, well I went out and bought a new one. When that one didn&#x27;t agree with my hair I bought another one, and another and another (I bought all the expensive ones, chi, hot tools). Finally I ended up back at this one. Since then, every time they break, about every year, I purchase another one. They aren&#x27;t overly expensive and it is excellent on my hair. I don&#x27;t get split ends or any kinkage with it. I will continue to buy this straightener for as long as they sell it!</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this Iron, I got it at Target on sale for about $50 a little over a year ago.  I loved it, never had such an easy time straightening my hair.  I have very thick (both in size of hair strand and quantity) course hair.  More frizzy than curly.  I got to where I could do my hair within about 20-30 minutes pretty well by taking small chunks of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I was stumped because my hair just was not straightening.  It was not damp, had been dry for over 24 hours and it was just getting frizzier.  Finally touched my hair and it was not even warm.  The bottom part of my iron quit working.  Sadly, I had a blonde moment and decided to check the top, it was at its full 420 degrees and I burned my fingers :(.  Oh well, live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;m a cheapskate and do not want to spend $50 a year on an iron, I will not purchase this iron again.  I also had the hair pulling issue, but had that with previous cheapo metal irons so didn&#x27;t know you shouldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what I&#x27;ll do at this point, I need an iron, but again, I&#x27;m a cheapskate and don&#x27;t really want to spend much... LOL!</li>
    <li> This is my 4th hair straightener.  It&#x27;s also my favorite and least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Here are a list of pros and cons.  While the pros are great, Remington still has some work to do to make this a stellar product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;*Lightweight - this is the lightest one I have used and I really appreciate that aspect of it.&lt;br /&gt;*Styles my hair the best.  Though I straighten my hair, I like to add a bit of flair to it with some flips at the end.  The smaller plates really allow me to do this.  Plus, that also allows me to get closer to my scalp.  My hair used to be straight as a child but has grown wavy over the years.  Getting the waves close to my scalp are much easier with this straightener.&lt;br /&gt;*Tourmaline offers ionic protection&lt;br /&gt;*Swivel cord really helps with less tangles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;*The position of the on/off switch results in me inadvertently turning the straightener off several times for each session.  Annoying.&lt;br /&gt;*This is the biggest con - my hair gets pulled out by the seam in the plates.  While I have tons of hair, I am not willing to have several pieces ripped out every morning.  This is why I replaced straightener #2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  I am still looking for a light weight straightener with slim plates, a swivel cord, and those tourmaline plates that won&#x27;t pull out my hair or get shut off constantly while I am trying to style my hair.</li>
    <li> Over the last year I have tested out several straighteners. This one rates somewhere in between my favorite ([[ASIN:B001E6ILDM Healthy Infusions by Wahl Pro Straightener, 1 1/4\\&quot;]]) and my least ([[ASIN:B001LF4I8I Remington S9950  Shine Therapy Straightener, 1\\&quot;]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;~ Left my hair smooth and straight using the highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;~ Outside where you hold the plates closed stayed cool to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;~ The included DVD is great! Both my daughter and I learned several new ways to use our flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;~ To get my hair smooth and straight I had to go over each section 2-3 times.&lt;br /&gt;~ Took too long to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;~ The temperature lock worked, but because of the button placement I did end up turning it off a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of my natural curl, I have found some straighteners work very well and others aren&#x27;t worth my time. This one did do a good job, but the time it took get that result was far too much. I&#x27;d recommend the [[ASIN:B001LF4G4E Remington S-1051 Sleek n Curl Tstudio Collection Titanium Straightner with Tourmaline 1\\&quot; Slim Plates]] to someone with a slight wave or curl looking to replace or purchase a new straightener and who might benefit from the informative, easy to follow DVD that it comes with.</li>
    <li> Still trying to figure out the curling with it, but I think it&#x27;s just user error! Love how fast it heats up and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron but should&#x27;ve came with a glove because it can get very HOT! But overall good product..</li>
    <li> The Remington S-1051 Sleek n Curl Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener is a great product. I use it on short and long hair. It is a very versatile product. The only problem is, is that if you put to much or a wide selection of hair and it falls into the crease it will snag and pull your hair. I have only experienced it a couple of times but other than that I love my flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It works well and is the perfect size!</li>
    <li> Great buy I love this that I bought two to have one as a back up my first one lasted me for 3 years and it gets super hot and does a great job on my hair!</li>
    <li> The product heats up really fast is an excellent iron.&lt;br /&gt;I give it a very high recommendation good purchase happy about it.</li>
    <li> Variable temperature (default seems to be the highest at 430 degrees)&lt;br /&gt;Has a lock that keeps the temperature the same so you can&#x27;t accidentally change temperatures&lt;br /&gt;Digital temperature read-out&lt;br /&gt;On/Off light lets you know when your iron is on (I have used some that you can&#x27;t tell without looking at the read-out OR putting a hand close to the iron, but you can with this one, and it&#x27;s a nice feature to have!)&lt;br /&gt;Directions say it shuts off in one hour of non-use, although I think this is a bit long to have a hot iron around, especially if you have kids, although some irons don&#x27;t have ANY automatic shut-off, so it&#x27;s better than some but could use some improvement in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a swivel cord that is supposed to help keep tangles out, but I usually put my electrical stuff away in my bathroom, so I&#x27;ve never had a problem with tangled cords, although time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The edges of many less expensive irons are flat and thus make it harder to curl. Not with this iron! This iron has rounded edges that make curling with a flat iron easy! A VERY nice feature, not always found on even the more expensive irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iron seems to have VERY even heat across the board, and my hair seems to stay straighter longer with this iron, which might have something to do with the tourmaline? I don&#x27;t know, but this is a nice iron that deserves a good look, and the price is certainly right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this and another iron that are both under $70, and using some that were well over the $100 mark, I&#x27;d simply buy this iron instead of the $100+ one. The features are the same essentially (this one has a couple that some nearly $200 irons do not have!), and with everyone on a budget, this is a great value for the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DVD menu is a bit strained and could be done better, although the content on how to straighten, curl, do an easy but beautiful up-do, look like a spiral perm, and backcombing that with fingers for a softer look are some really kewl salon tricks that you&#x27;ll love! The DVD content alone is worth a look.DVD content alone is worth a look.</li>
    <li> This is an ultra sleek product from Remington. Works like a a charm in a little amount of time. It heats up fast and its smaller size makes it very easy to carry during travel. Loved the bonus CD which had many useful tips. Thanks Remington.</li>
    <li> I have rather low maintenance hair. I use this to style my bangs or to curl my hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling fried and hard after using which makes the styles look more natural. It&#x27;s a durable device, I&#x27;ve had it for years and it still works great!</li>
    <li> This is the first straightener I&#x27;ve had that has actually worked. I got it when I was in highschool (6 years ago now) and I&#x27;ve had it ever since with no need for a new one. The one I purchased got up to 430 degrees, which appears to vary slightly from the advertised on amazon, but it is the same model of Remington straightener. The problem comes from the material it&#x27;s made out of. In the DVD, the stylist shows how to use the iron to produce different types of curls... With the shape my straightener is in, it would stick to and pull my hair before it would glide easily through my hair. What ever they coated the majority of the exterior of the straightener with has become tacky over the years, and there&#x27;s no way to remove the gunk. It is not from product residue. My guess is that it&#x27;s some sort of coated plastic that feels really soft in prime condition, but after years of use and heat from the core it has broken down to become this gummy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I have loved this straightener, but I need to replace it and I will not replace it with the same one. Hopefully my next Remington straightener will be made out of a more durable material.</li>
    <li> I have owned and used this straightener for about 18 months now. I found the instructional video helpful, and I like the fact that you can use this as a curling iron and a straightener all in one. However I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;From my point of view, the design has a few flaws: the buttons to turn it off and adjust the temps are located right where your hand grasps the iron, so I end up accidentally turning it off while styling my hair. It seems as though wherever my hands land on the tool, I end up either burning myself or accidentally pushing the buttons. After 18 months of use 2-3 times per week, the ceramic plates no longer touch when closed together, and they are no longer capable of grasping my hair for straightening or styling. Plus, strands of hair occasionally get caught on the edges of the plates--ouch! My hair is thick, long and wavy, can be frizzy, so I always needed to use the maximum temperature for decent results. I think the diameter is also a little too small. Time to purchase another straightener!</li>
    <li> love it shipped fast but i am going natural and have a one heat free challege goin on. I will say this iron doesn&#x27;t damage you hair at all.</li>
    <li> I need more practice in order to create the curls per the DVD but I do like the straightner. Heats up fast and easy to use!</li>
