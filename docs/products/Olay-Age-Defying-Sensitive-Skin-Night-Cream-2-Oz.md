### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent!!</li>
      <li>My wife tried this product and is very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Perfect weight for a night cream.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say my skin felt the best it has ever felt, but improvement was noticeable.</li>
      <li>and I loved it!</li>
      <li>This lotion is great either by itself or under makeup.)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for over a year now and must say I&#x27;m extremely happy with it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
      <li>But it isn&#x27;t great for the night before those \\&quot;get up and go!\\&quot; mornings.  </li>
      <li>great oil of olay product</li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>It did indeed make her skin feel firmer, it had a very nice smell, and a very nice texture.</li>
      <li>There is a smell to it, which is actually pleasant</li>
      <li>and I look pleasantly glow-y in the morning.</li>
      <li>The cream is not greasy, applies easily and best of all, it is competitively priced.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t a miracle product but for the price and the results, a good value for those of us who don&#x27;t want to go the botox route or buy fancy products that cost $200+ for 2 ounces</li>
      <li>The jury is still out, but for a good moisturizing night cream I would recommend it.</li>
      <li>This product has always been good for the skin.</li>
      <li>She is very pleased that she got it, and will probably continue to use it even after the samply product is gone.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with that.</li>
      <li>My favorite!</li>
      <li>Unlike many night creams, it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy, it absorbs beautifully and isn&#x27;t greasy, and my skin looks and feels great!</li>
      <li>Keeps my face nicely moisturised.</li>
      <li>I liked it , but I have always felt that the lotion is a lil greasy on my face.</li>
      <li>I liked that this cream was both fragrance-free and effective.</li>
      <li>And I liked this one as well.  </li>
      <li>Best night cream for sensitive skin!!!</li>
      <li>It feels great going on, nice and silky, and seems to absorb quickly.  </li>
      <li>It applied easily and felt good on my skin.</li>
      <li>It is very light, non comedogenic, and seems to produce visible results.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smoothly and in the morning</li>
      <li>It has a very light fragrance which I also like.</li>
      <li>Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>So many products these days say they are but are not.</li>
      <li>According to Consumer Reports Lab, the Olay products were rated as the most effective  over the counter skin care product available.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now, and while I don&#x27;t think the people at La Mer are in a corner smoking nervously, this is a great bargain cream that hydrates really well without feeling too greasy or clogging pores.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re hoping to avoid sunscreen in your facial  moisturizer, this is an excellent alternative.</li>
      <li>This cream is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love olay products.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be fragrances that cause most problems with my skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for about 3 weeks and love the way it makes me skin feel.</li>
      <li>My skin does not tolerate many moisturizers and I do not tolerate smelly ones.  </li>
      <li>even many hours</li>
      <li>The Olay actually came out as the best.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite face cream.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice texture and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>The whole deal with Olay products is that they are advertised as being as good as the high-end products that cost hundreds more.</li>
      <li>Okay... I&#x27;m not a vain person, but I don&#x27;t like the fine lines around my mouth.</li>
      <li>There is no residual sticky or oily feeling, and no problem putting foundation on over it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve successfully used other Olay products and find this one to be another Olay successful product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for my sensitive</li>
      <li>The application of this cream then leaves your skin smoother and with a clean-feel to it, in part because it absorbs easily into your skin.</li>
      <li>I have been wanting to purchase this product for a long time and now that I  will purchase it again, because it is very good.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see huge improvements on the fine lines on my face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to use a night cream that has something in it but doesn&#x27;t sting sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face, but it moisturizes beautifully!  </li>
      <li>This is a light, fragrance free night cream that glides over one skin.</li>
      <li>This is a light cream that goes on smoothly without dragging on skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The cream was smooth when it went on</li>
      <li>So, I am happy with the results provided by this moisturizing cream and would definitely keep using it.</li>
      <li>I did so in case my skin reacted (red marks on my face wouldn&#x27;t be a great way to begin the day).</li>
      <li>my 50+ skin feels silky smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;d say it is a good night cream that keeps my skin moist and does not reduce wrinkles.</li>
      <li>It is rich and smooth, yet absorbs into your face without leaving it feeling greasy.  </li>
      <li>In lieu of spending much more for fancy-named cosmetics, give this a try first.</li>
      <li>This seems to go on well and get absorbed without making me feel too oily, and I didn&#x27;t break out or develop hives or anything, so -- so far so good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While it worked great on my dry skin</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s nothing special.  </li>
      <li>It has an extremely light fragrance that wears off right away</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t tell you, but my skin always feels super hydrated</li>
      <li>He has combo skin and tends to flake when it isn&#x27;t adequately moisturized.</li>
      <li>This is my second jar of this miraculous cream, and I love it!</li>
      <li>it is lightweight, not heavy greasy like many age defying products</li>
      <li>This product works effectively at putting the moisture back in.</li>
      <li>I had not been able to find olay for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>discontinued and wonder if fresh</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, I am allergic to many things.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other night creams and this is the best for my combination/oily/sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to remember the reality that even these creams only decrease \\&quot;the appearance\\&quot; of fine lines.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and an aversion to strong frangrance.</li>
      <li>I have incredibly dry, flaky skin that no amount or brand of moisturizer has been able to adequately cure.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s completely scent free, which I appreciate.</li>
      <li>A stranger came up to me and said &#x27;You have such lovely skin&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>moisturizer delivers exactly what it claims.  </li>
      <li>I use this cream at night in conjunction with the Olay Total Effects daytime cream, and my skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>This night cream is a bit lighter than most \\&quot;creams\\&quot;, but thicker than a regular lotion.  </li>
      <li>I have used Olay products for almost ten years, and I usually love all of them.</li>
      <li>So the benefits seem to be more of how my skin feels then how it actually looks.</li>
      <li>This product works really well and no frangrance!</li>
      <li>The first jar was sent complimentary for review purposes, but I have continued to buy it and maintain a high recommendation.recommendation.</li>
      <li>(In other words, she liked it so much she will purchase it.)</li>
      <li>This cream feels good, provokes no allergic responses, seems to soften my skin, but I am not sure about being age defying.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about three months and my skin has never looked better, as it no longer feels dry.</li>
      <li>The Age Defying Sensitive Skin Night Cream seems to go on nice and light, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face looking and feeling like an oil slick when I wake up.</li>
      <li>I tried an Avon product -- a costly mistake that kept me from spending money on \\&quot;possible fine line cures.\\&quot; --</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost 60 and no one would ever guess by my face, thanks to Olay.  </li>
      <li>I never broken out or a sticky feeling.</li>
      <li>The thing that really turned me off was that it doesn&#x27;t really permeate the skin.</li>
      <li>I really like how it goes on</li>
      <li>I really like this cream and will order again.</li>
      <li>it is reasonably priced&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have to note, however, that I don&#x27;t use this for the \\&quot;age defying\\&quot; effects, so I can&#x27;t really comment on that.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my skin feel soft, don&#x27;t see any improvement on lines but you can&#x27;t work a miracle!!</li>
    <li> This product has always been good for the skin. I have been wanting to purchase this product for a long time and now that I  will purchase it again, because it is very good.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find something to use on my face and chest that doesn&#x27;t break me out. This stuff works wonders. it doesn&#x27;t leave my chest looking nasty and zitty. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I use the Olay sensitive day cream with SPF so assumed this would be the same just without the SPF.  My skin does not tolerate many moisturizers and I do not tolerate smelly ones.  This one had a smell to it that I did not like.  It wasn&#x27;t unscented like my Olay day cream.  I won&#x27;t order again. If for sensitive skin it should be unscented!</li>
    <li> discontinued and wonder if fresh</li>
    <li> great oil of olay product</li>
    <li> Most lines of cosmetic brands have been irritating to my skin. This is not. Perfect weight for a night cream.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and an aversion to strong frangrance. This product works really well and no frangrance!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin once.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to use a night cream that has something in it but doesn&#x27;t sting sensitive skin.  Is it age defying?  Couldn&#x27;t tell you, but my skin always feels super hydrated and I look pleasantly glow-y in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have used the Olay sensitive skin night cream before, but could not find it  in stores by me.  All the stores carried only the regular night cream which I tried, but it irritated my skin, because of the added fragrance.  This is why I ended up ordering it online.  I would recommend it for anyone who has sensitive skin problems.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay products for almost ten years, and I usually love all of them. I have quite sensitive skin, so I figured I would appreciate this nighttime lotion, but it has dried out my skin in less than a week, leaving my face feeling almost sunburnt (no real sun exposure) and very dry each morning. I am sad to say that I consider my money wasted, and had to order another variety of Olay nighttime lotion. Not recommended!</li>
    <li> I once went into a frozen yogurt shop one evening. Picture this - glaring overhead flourescent lights. I had been using this night cream for about 1 month. A stranger came up to me and said &#x27;You have such lovely skin&amp;#34;. Enough said!.  Also, I am allergic to just about everything, and I have no problems with the Oil of Olay unscented night cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other night creams and this is the best for my combination/oily/sensitive skin. This doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out at all. It has improved my complexion significantly, way above any other cream I&#x27;ve tried. (fyi, I use this cream at night. I wash my face with Olay sensitive skin face wash. And during the day, I use Olay Age defying sensitive skin lotion spf 15. This lotion is great either by itself or under makeup.)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perhaps a little heavy if you have sensitive skin, but on my dry 50 something skin it works very well and leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed.  Seems to relieve some of the wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I had not been able to find olay for sensitive skin.  I was serching for something elseand luckly I found this.</li>
    <li> This cream feels good, provokes no allergic responses, seems to soften my skin, but I am not sure about being age defying. I&#x27;ll have to wait and see, and then update this review in a few years. So far, I&#x27;d say it is a good night cream that keeps my skin moist and does not reduce wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this any stores!  My favorite!</li>
    <li> Best night cream for sensitive skin!!!</li>
    <li> I have been applying this cream every night for the past month.  I really like how it goes on, it is not greasy but has enough moisture.  I have sensitive skin, I am allergic to many things.  I have had no reaction to this.  As far as seeing any age lines becoming less visible, that is hard to tell, other than the fact my whole face feels smoother and looks softer and that gives me a more healthy, youthful look.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face cream.  I use it year round for night-time moisturizing.  In the winter (when my face is especially dry) I also use it as my daytime moisturizer.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face, but it moisturizes beautifully!  It is the only facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried that can deal with winter dry patches on my face.  If you&#x27;re hoping to avoid sunscreen in your facial  moisturizer, this is an excellent alternative.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Age Defying\\&quot; creams generally take 3-4 weeks of consistent use before you see results.  This cream was the same in that way - for two weeks I didn&#x27;t see any results but the 4th week my skin finally felt softer and smoother, at least on my cheeks and in my \\&quot;smile area\\&quot; around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked:&lt;br /&gt;that it is lightweight, not heavy greasy like many age defying products&lt;br /&gt;that is unscented (at least as far as my nose can tell)&lt;br /&gt;that it is designed for sensitive skin (some brands make me turn ruddy)&lt;br /&gt;that it is reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;eventually my skin felt softer and smoother&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;that the packaging did not warn the user to keep it away from the eye area. I think most age defying creams are bad for the very delicate skin around your eyes&lt;br /&gt;that it takes 3 weeks+ to see results&lt;br /&gt;there were no visible results on the more deeply wrinkled area above my eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a miracle product but for the price and the results, a good value for those of us who don&#x27;t want to go the botox route or buy fancy products that cost $200+ for 2 ounces</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay products on my  skin for years now, starting with the face cleansers, serum&#x27;s and moistures for around my eyes and face, day or night.  I&#x27;m almost 60 and no one would ever guess by my face, thanks to Olay.  I used to spend a fortune on the other skin care brands, till I saw an add, where tests were done with an Olay moisturizer VS. very expensive  brands.  The Olay actually came out as the best. I wouldn&#x27;t think of using any other Brand now.&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer delivers exactly what it claims.  I would highly recommend this night time moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly dry, flaky skin that no amount or brand of moisturizer has been able to adequately cure. This Olay night cream doesn&#x27;t quite do the trick either, but the results are notably better than other creams I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has become quite sensitive recently, reacting poorly to any new products I apply to it, so I&#x27;m glad to have tried this cream for sensitive skin. It&#x27;s completely scent free, which I appreciate. It&#x27;s also surprisingly not that heavy for a cream that is so effective for moisturizing. I have been applying it every night for the past two weeks, and when I wake up in the morning I notice that I don&#x27;t have to use as much of my daytime moisturizer as I used to. I have to note, however, that I don&#x27;t use this for the \\&quot;age defying\\&quot; effects, so I can&#x27;t really comment on that. However, it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores - no breakouts yet! - so this product is a winner in my book.</li>
    <li> I use this cream at night in conjunction with the Olay Total Effects daytime cream, and my skin has never looked better. The one-two punch has really helped my dry, sensitive, early-40s skin this winter! I do like the Total Effects night cream a little more than this one, though. The Total Effects one seems a little thicker, a little more moisturizing. I would probably recommend Total Effects slightly over this one, but either one is a winner.</li>
    <li> This is a light, fragrance free night cream that glides over one skin. It is non-greasy and hydrates the skin well. I have relatively dry skin, and it has kept my skin feeling soft and supple. I have been using it for about three months and my skin has never looked better, as it no longer feels dry. While I have noticed no change in my existing wrinkles, I did take note that I have not developed any new ones, and existing fine lines seem to be less discernible. So, I am happy with the results provided by this moisturizing cream and would definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> I liked how smooth this made my skin feel, and it definitely wasn&#x27;t oily and didn&#x27;t cause any negative reactions (so 5 stars for sensitive skin customers) but there really was some kind of scent to this that made it impossible for me to wear. It wasn&#x27;t perfumey, which was a plus, but it sort of had a smell like, the only thing I can compare it to, is ashes. I really wanted to like this, and maybe I just got a bad jar. The cream itself worked really well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for about 3 weeks and love the way it makes me skin feel. As a baby boomer my skin tends to be very dry, and this product really makes my face feel so much softer and smoother when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination but I think I may see a slight difference in the line between my eyebrows, and the way it makes my skin glow and feel.  Definitely plan to keep using this product at bedtime.</li>
    <li> My wife tried this product and is very happy with the results. It did indeed make her skin feel firmer, it had a very nice smell, and a very nice texture. She is very pleased that she got it, and will probably continue to use it even after the samply product is gone. (In other words, she liked it so much she will purchase it.)</li>
    <li> Excellent!! Keeps my face nicely moisturised. It feels so soothing when I apply it.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I only used a few times, but I can feel the different in my skin.</li>
    <li> Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> As someone who breaks out in hives, I am always worried about what I put on my skin. Because I have used Olay products in the past I decided to give this new night cream a try.  While I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any major \\&quot;age defying\\&quot; results, I do like it. It is rich and smooth, yet absorbs into your face without leaving it feeling greasy.  It has a very light fragrance which I also like. Will it take a few years off my face?  The jury is still out, but for a good moisturizing night cream I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Night cream for about three weeks now.  It has a nice texture and absorbs quickly.  Not heavily scented which I prefer and not greasy at the least.  However, in terms of the \\&quot;age defying\\&quot; label -- it moistures reasonably well but other than that I haven&#x27;t seen any change in my skin texture or lines.  Kiehl&#x27;s products, which are pricey, tend to do that sort of thing  -- at least for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of a recommendation -- this is a nice light product which will moisturize -- a plus if you live in a very dry climate as I do.  But it&#x27;s nothing special.  Reasonably priced however -- so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, extremely sensitive skin and I&#x27;m allergic to synthetic fragrances. This face cream is a homerun as far I&#x27;m concerned. It has very little smell and no perfume smell, at all. Hydrates the skin VERY well for all night hydration and does not become greasy. The skin really soaks all of this up. As for the age-defying properties, my skin did feel a bit plumper and tighter after several nights of continuous use and I&#x27;ve not experienced those results with other face creams for sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m at that unfortunate age where I need a moisturizer (and wrinkle prevention) but still need to stick to something non-greasy enough that it won&#x27;t give me breakouts. The Age Defying Sensitive Skin Night Cream seems to go on nice and light, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face looking and feeling like an oil slick when I wake up.</li>
    <li> I am normally a high-end beauty buyer. I used to work at Sephora, so I&#x27;ve tried and bought countless brands such as Dior, Lancome, Boscia, Clarins, Shiseido, etc. I had high hopes for this cream since Paula&#x27;s Choice rated it well. I have combination, acne-prone skin that tends to get dry because I use Benzoyl Peroxide (acne medication). Unfortunately, this cream didn&#x27;t work out for me. My skin would still feel dry and tight after I used it. I even tried applying two layers to see if it would help -- it didn&#x27;t! I gave up on it and passed it on to my husband instead. He&#x27;s very low maintenance. He&#x27;s the type that washes his face with water day and night. He has combo skin and tends to flake when it isn&#x27;t adequately moisturized. But unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t helped his dryness either. He still experiences flaking.&lt;br /&gt;If you have extremely oily skin, I would recommend this to you. It&#x27;s actually very lightweight and non-greasy. It&#x27;s for sensitive skin and non-comodogenic, so it shouldn&#x27;t exacerbate or cause acne.</li>
    <li> This is my second jar of this miraculous cream, and I love it! Unlike many night creams, it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy, it absorbs beautifully and isn&#x27;t greasy, and my skin looks and feels great! I have really dry skin in the winter so I use this in the morning as well as at night and it helps to prevent that tight, dry winter-skin feeling throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I liked that this cream was both fragrance-free and effective. So many products these days say they are but are not. What  I didn&#x27;t like about it was that the cream had a slightly sticky feel I have encountered before in some lotions and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the cream isn&#x27;t sticky when applied the feel of it bothers me enough that I&#x27;ll use another cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Olay sensitive-skin moisturizing lotion for 4 years. I liked it , but I have always felt that the lotion is a lil greasy on my face. I tried this product 6 months ago and I loved it! Glides on smoothly, no greasy after feel. I never broken out or a sticky feeling. Hope Olay keeps on making this product because I am hooked!</li>
    <li> This cream is fantastic! and it was delivered on due time.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin. Pretty much anything will make me breakout in either black heads or white heads. This cream is very gentle and hydrating, and I very rarely get the occasional pinpoint white head from wearing this. But it&#x27;s still ten times better than the other products I&#x27;ve tried that leave my skin angry and irritated with huge blemishes. I recommend this to anyone who has found it hard to find a night cream for sensitive skin. I just wish it had a little more it did than just moisturize. It has an extremely light fragrance that wears off right away and it goes on smoothly, not too oily or heavy and quickly absorbs but doesn&#x27;t disappear like some other stuff might. When I shower or wash my face hours later. I can feel its protective and hydrating layer wash off. I like this night cream!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this cream and really likes it. I, too, can see the difference. Her skin has a nicer glow to it. The jury is still out on the wrinkles though. The cream is not greasy, applies easily and best of all, it is competitively priced. The winter season and its dry air always seems to suck the moisture out of the skin. This product works effectively at putting the moisture back in. In lieu of spending much more for fancy-named cosmetics, give this a try first. You may be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> This night cream works for me and is a price I can afford.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> The whole deal with Olay products is that they are advertised as being as good as the high-end products that cost hundreds more. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now, and while I don&#x27;t think the people at La Mer are in a corner smoking nervously, this is a great bargain cream that hydrates really well without feeling too greasy or clogging pores. It&#x27;s a bargain that I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a daytime use moisturizer.  There is very little, if any, fragrance.  It seems to be fragrances that cause most problems with my skin.  This has been developed for sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no problems at all using it.  This is a light cream that goes on smoothly without dragging on skin.  There is no residual sticky or oily feeling, and no problem putting foundation on over it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve successfully used other Olay products and find this one to be another Olay successful product.  This is a product I will continue to use and recommend to friends, family, and ... anyone with &#x27;mature&#x27; sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This seems to go on well and get absorbed without making me feel too oily, and I didn&#x27;t break out or develop hives or anything, so -- so far so good. Now, whether it keeps me from aging or not, I will have to re-evaluate that situation when I get to the bottom of the jar. I have a bad feeling, though, that I am going to continue to get older.</li>
    <li> My skin has been quite dry this winter, so I need something to stop the irritation. Thing is, I have sensitive skin so I also need something that won&#x27;t cause even further irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it&#x27;s a \\&quot;night cream,\\&quot; I put this cream on a few inconspicuous areas before going to bed. I did so in case my skin reacted (red marks on my face wouldn&#x27;t be a great way to begin the day). The next morning my skin felt pretty fresh and wasn&#x27;t too dry - and no reactions thankfully. I can&#x27;t say my skin felt the best it has ever felt, but improvement was noticeable. A few more nights of application will be helpful I think. I don&#x27;t see why you couldn&#x27;t use this during the day, though. Lather up.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Olay products. Have used them as long as I can remember. So I was anxious to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 2 weeks and decided to go back to my regular Olay moisturizer. This is a heavier cream, which I expected as it is a night cream. It applied easily and felt good on my skin. But later it felt gummy and I could use my fingers and roll pieces of it off my face. Didn&#x27;t seem to me like that was I wanted to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face didn&#x27;t like this product. But will continue to use Olay products.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even say how this product would have worked out because I couldn&#x27;t stand to use it long enough to find out. There is a smell to it, which is actually pleasant but then it got to me after having it on my face a while. The thing that really turned me off was that it doesn&#x27;t really permeate the skin. As a result almost 2 hours later I looked in a mirror and saw some white flaky stuff on my face. When I touched it, it was the cream. It sort off rolls off your face. That continued to happen for the rest of the week. After that I gave up.</li>
    <li> This night cream is a bit lighter than most \\&quot;creams\\&quot;, but thicker than a regular lotion.  It feels great going on, nice and silky, and seems to absorb quickly.  And it does hydrate well.  My skin definitely is softer and moister with it than without it, even many hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does leave a bit of residue.  Not a huge deal since it washes away very easily.  But it isn&#x27;t great for the night before those \\&quot;get up and go!\\&quot; mornings.  And I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for day time use.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream and will order again.</li>
    <li> According to Consumer Reports Lab, the Olay products were rated as the most effective  over the counter skin care product available. It&#x27;s important to remember the reality that even these creams only decrease \\&quot;the appearance\\&quot; of fine lines. This is often done by incorporating ingredients that plump the skin by retaining surface moisture.  It is very light, non comedogenic, and seems to produce visible results. Highly recommended over much more expensive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:24July2014- I&#x27;ve used this for over a year now and must say I&#x27;m extremely happy with it&#x27;s effectiveness. It goes on very smoothly and in the morning my 50+ skin feels silky smooth and hydrated. The first jar was sent complimentary for review purposes, but I have continued to buy it and maintain a high recommendation.recommendation.</li>
    <li> Okay... I&#x27;m not a vain person, but I don&#x27;t like the fine lines around my mouth. I tried an Avon product -- a costly mistake that kept me from spending money on \\&quot;possible fine line cures.\\&quot; -- Well, thank goodness for the Vine Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this product for review I thought I&#x27;d use Olay Age Defying Sensitive Skin Night Cream until it was used up then decided if it worked. Well within a week I was sold. I even skipped a night (here &amp; there) to see and feel the difference. Well, I did each time I woke up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this Olay Night Cream is no burning. It&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love soft skin and less noticeable lines. I will continue using Olay Night cream at bedtime.</li>
    <li> I love olay products.  And I liked this one as well.  The one thing I noticed is that it wasn&#x27;t filled with perfumes, which is great because I hate stinky creams. I used this cream during the night and day(there is no sun in Upstate NY these days) and it got rid of my dry skin. I was very pleased with that. I had used a few other creams but it wasn&#x27;t working very well.  And I had a spot on my cheek and forehead that wouldn&#x27;t go away, but after two days it was gone. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream was smooth when it went on and I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling or tightening of the skin. My skin did not have any altergic reations to the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it worked great on my dry skin I didn&#x27;t see huge improvements on the fine lines on my face. So while I like the product, and would buy it, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it to take care of my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> What I like about this cream is that it&#x27;s not super heavy and greasy. The application of this cream then leaves your skin smoother and with a clean-feel to it, in part because it absorbs easily into your skin. Some wrinkle creams are greasy and feel heavy on your skin: not this cream. I have noticed smoother skin on my face, but I can&#x27;t really say that I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the number of wrinkles on my face. So the benefits seem to be more of how my skin feels then how it actually looks.</li>
