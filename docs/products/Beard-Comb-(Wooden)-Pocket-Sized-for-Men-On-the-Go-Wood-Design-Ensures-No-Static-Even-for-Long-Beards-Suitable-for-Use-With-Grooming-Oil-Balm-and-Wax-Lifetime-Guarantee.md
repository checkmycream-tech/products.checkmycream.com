      <li>it&#x27;s perfect for putting it in your back pocket.</li>
      <li>Moves smoothly through the beard!</li>
      <li>But anyone looking at him would probably think that he is better without it.</li>
      <li>I sometimes keep it in my pocket and then toss my keys on top of it accidentally.</li>
      <li>This is a really high quality comb beard and feel great in your hands when you are using it.</li>
      <li>and it is one of my my most important grooming tools.</li>
      <li>This is a nicely made comb with fresh wood.</li>
      <li>Designed to last, tooth spacing on the comb is great, easy to hold!</li>
      <li>Fits easily inside the pouch.</li>
      <li>I use various beard oils and the comb becomes even more attractive over time as the oils give it a darker look.</li>
      <li>This company shipped this product very fast!!</li>
      <li>Gives it a smooth comb through.</li>
      <li>cause it&#x27;s light and compact and fits in any pocket.</li>
      <li>It will fit in the space of a pocket.  </li>
      <li>but I like to use it for my hair because I can fit it in my pocket</li>

      <li>My husband wanted a beard comb and I loved that this one was wooden.</li>
      <li>I have boughten beard combs before, but this one is by far better than the others because how well made the material is.</li>
      <li>He is able to put it in his pocket and barely notices it&#x27;s there.</li>
      <li>I love how simple this thing is.</li>
      <li>Well done guys and thanks!</li>
      <li>His beard is very important to him and is quite long and well groomed.</li>
      <li>and I did not receive any incentive to write a positive review or give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very sturdy so lets see our 3 year try and break this one on us.</li>
      <li>and I have to admit his beard looks very well cared for.</li>
      <li>He absolutely loves it</li>
      <li>Bought this for my son and he LOVES it, he wants another one to keep in his desk a work.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this beard comb from Beard Care Co.</li>
      <li>He puts it right in his back pocket and carries it with him everywhere!  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that it is wood because there is no static involved when I comb my beard.</li>
      <li>Besided it being cute and small</li>
      <li>This is my first beard comb ever and wood makes an entire world of difference.</li>
      <li>As a wife of a man who is proud of his beard, I was getting frustrated because he wouldn&#x27;t brush it down (which looks better)</li>
      <li>So my husband has a wild beard and he loves it.</li>
      <li>My husband absolutely loves this wooden comb!  </li>
      <li>His beard is getting pretty long so it does get knotty from time to time</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to order at least 1 more to keep at home or in my backpack, just in case.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a beard comb that will last.</li>
      <li>Given that the wooden teeth are bound to make contact with sensitive skin on a comb like this, I would have expected the tips to be a bit more carefully sanded.</li>
      <li>He especially loves that it&#x27;s made with real wood and should last a long time as it is made of high quality.</li>

<li> Combs his beard like any other comb, but he prefers his brush</li>
<li> simply because people were getting him these small plastic combs for it.  </li>
<li> the teeth are sharp on parts of the comb and looked unevenly cut.</li>
<li> Luckily, it&#x27;s not just sitting around collecting dust.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m using this my little pup to come his fur.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s nothing that a little bit of sandpaper can&#x27;t fix, though.</li>
<li> It took me a while to grow my beard and this little beauty helps me maintain it on the go.</li>
<li> Would work well for a substantial beard, but just a little to bulky for our needs.</li>
<li> The bristles are extremely sturdy and unless you&#x27;re Hercules,cannot be broken.</li>
<li> I got this for my fiance since the plastic ones just weren&#x27;t doing the job for his thick beard and kept breaking.</li>
<li> I have a very thick curly beard.</li>
<li> that he doesn&#x27;t look like a crazy mountain man.</li>

    <li> I received this at a discounted price for an honest review. I got this for my fiance since the plastic ones just weren&#x27;t doing the job for his thick beard and kept breaking. He is able to put it in his pocket and barely notices it&#x27;s there. His beard is getting pretty long so it does get knotty from time to time and this works great and doesn&#x27;t pull at his hair. It&#x27;s also very sturdy so lets see our 3 year try and break this one on us.</li>
    <li> I gave this to me husband and he lives it. He said he will never use anything else on his beard. His beard is very important to him and is quite long and well groomed. He said he definitely can notice a difference in the frizz especially raid the end of the day. I did recurve this at a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it. The size of it is perfect for a beard but he also uses it on his hair.  He especially loves that it&#x27;s made with real wood and should last a long time as it is made of high quality.</li>
    <li> Good for my beard AND hair.... Well made and sturdy!</li>
    <li> This comb is amazing. It took me a while to grow my beard and this little beauty helps me maintain it on the go. I take it everywhere with me cause it&#x27;s light and compact and fits in any pocket. The bristles are extremely sturdy and unless you&#x27;re Hercules,cannot be broken. I&#x27;m going to order at least 1 more to keep at home or in my backpack, just in case. Really great product!</li>

    <li> Great quality. Does the trick.</li>
    <li> This is a nicely made comb with fresh wood. The item arrived with no breaks or damages. You will get the exactly same item as the picture describes. The shipping was very fast, Great purchase overall.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband to maintain his brawny beard. He likes it. Nice, cute, pocket size. Combs his beard like any other comb, but he prefers his brush so I&#x27;m using this my little pup to come his fur. He seems to like it. I got it on discount to product review. Luckily, it&#x27;s not just sitting around collecting dust. I&#x27;ve found a use for it.</li>
    <li> This is a really high quality comb beard and feel great in your hands when you are using it. I love the fact that it is wood because there is no static involved when I comb my beard. It is also neatly compact. I carry all of my personal care items inside a travel pouch and I throw this comb inside my pouch once I am done using it. Fits easily inside the pouch. Highly recommend this beard comb from Beard Care Co.</li>
    <li> Great service and great beard comb!</li>
    <li> Really sturdy and well made brush, works perfectly for my husbands facial hair. He loves how nice he makes his beard look and feel and I like that he doesn&#x27;t look like a crazy mountain man. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This beard comb is quite simple. It&#x27;s made of wood and seems to be well made. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do! It combs your beard.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it.  Said he will never use anything but a wooden comb again.  Combs through his beard without pulling like a plastic comb sometimes does.</li>
    <li> Given that the wooden teeth are bound to make contact with sensitive skin on a comb like this, I would have expected the tips to be a bit more carefully sanded. It&#x27;s nothing that a little bit of sandpaper can&#x27;t fix, though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son-in-law.  He carries with him at all times now.  He absolutely loves it and I have to admit his beard looks very well cared for.</li>
    <li> I value the durability of this comb and appreciate its convenient size.  It will fit in the space of a pocket.  I would consider it a great gift for the bearded men in your life!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son and he LOVES it, he wants another one to keep in his desk a work.</li>
    <li> So my husband has a wild beard and he loves it. But anyone looking at him would probably think that he is better without it. I was offered a discounted price to test this product and I jumped at the chance. It made my husband look way more well-maintained and groomed and he always have the proud look on his face when he brushes his beard. Probably something that I will never understand.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my son and he loves it. This company shipped this product very fast!! I am very happy. Thank you</li>
    <li> Good quality comb. Nice size for travel.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this wooden comb!  He puts it right in his back pocket and carries it with him everywhere!  As a wife of a man who is proud of his beard, I was getting frustrated because he wouldn&#x27;t brush it down (which looks better) simply because people were getting him these small plastic combs for it.  I saw this on amazon and instantly bought it hoping it would work well and that he would like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What an understatement!  He uses it multiple times a day!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Excellent and sturdy product.  Designed to last, tooth spacing on the comb is great, easy to hold!</li>
    <li> Nice comb but the teeth are sharp on parts of the comb and looked unevenly cut.</li>
    <li> Kindof wished it was more of a hardwood as the teeth flex pretty easily; but, perhaps that is for the best.  Time will tell.  Works well for now.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product, made from high quality wood and perfect size. My husband wanted a beard comb and I loved that this one was wooden. He loves it!</li>
    <li> Best Beard comb ever used !!</li>
    <li> great beard comb, I like how close the bristles are together.  Gives it a smooth comb through.</li>
    <li> Husband loves! Great gift for our anniversary!</li>
    <li> This comb is excellent! I have had it for several months now. I have a very thick curly beard. It is well made and extremely durable. I have dropped mine on the counter during use and also on the floor with zero damage. I sometimes keep it in my pocket and then toss my keys on top of it accidentally. No breaks and no scratches. If you are using a plastic comb for your beard you need to stop now. This is my first beard comb ever and wood makes an entire world of difference. Zero snags, zero ripping out of hairs. It glides very smoothly and is not creating static that makes a beard look haggard and more dry. I use various beard oils and the comb becomes even more attractive over time as the oils give it a darker look. I am not affiliated with this company at all and I did not receive any incentive to write a positive review or give it 5 stars. I give it FIVE Stars because I use it daily and it is one of my my most important grooming tools. Well done guys and thanks!</li>
    <li> You need to really have s thick beard to use this comb. I don&#x27;t use it at all</li>
    <li> Nice comb.  My son likes the wooden comb and he likes the size</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t have a beard but I like to use it for my hair because I can fit it in my pocket</li>
    <li> Besided it being cute and small it&#x27;s perfect for putting it in your back pocket. Nice quality.  Grooms well.</li>
    <li> What a great beard comb. Hubby loves it. No pulling or tangles. Great product !</li>
    <li> Works great for my husband, much better than a comb.</li>
    <li> Quality is great. Would work well for a substantial beard, but just a little to bulky for our needs.</li>
