      <li>/&gt;Should the securing of the files in the handles be better designed, this is essentially a perfect product.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
      <li>And the handle is good size but not the blades.</li>
      <li>My feet feel so good.</li>

      <li>This is a powerful and effective tool, and it works efficiently and pleasantly.</li>
      <li>not as good as the original model.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the original.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure part of my problem is a penchant for Birkenstocks, but who cares:</li>
      <li>The Microplane is able to remove the calluses better than my pedicurist.</li>

      <li>I. LOVE.</li>
      <li>but glad I found this solution before purchasing it.</li>
      <li>I love the handle and the ease of use.</li>
      <li>LOVE.</li>
      <li>I love to use this every couple of weeks after I take a shower.  </li>

      <li>I liked the design...seemed like it would be easier to use and to clean.</li>
      <li>This thing all I can say is the best I have owned and won&#x27;t need to buy another for a long time.  </li>
      <li>This does a superb job on scrapping the dry skin off.  </li>
      <li>And much more comfortable than the Makita sander.</li>
      <li>This device, however, is completely brilliant, from the same folks who provide the kitchen utensils (and the woodworking files).</li>
      <li>I finally found some great supportive flops (love Terox or Oofo on Amazon), but nothing would work for the cracks on my heels &amp; balls of my feet.  </li>
      <li>The foot file worked REALLY well; I loved it....</li>
      <li>It is easy to hold and use.  </li>

      <li>The handle is strong</li>
      <li>so they feel nice and look pretty.</li>
      <li>This micro plane makes it easy to keep my feet sandal smooth</li>
      <li>It comes nicely packaged, with good instructions, but let&#x27;s be real: the main thing is, it gets rid of heel and toe calluses.</li>
      <li>That was a huge understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>(And it&#x27;s rather disgustingly amazing to see how much the plane</li>
      <li>I like smooth feet....</li>
      <li>But that wasn&#x27;t particularly comfortable.    </li>
      <li>easy to clean plastic like body</li>
      <li>The cover also helps to remove the file plate from the handle, which is nice for my older fingers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worth EVERY penny!</li>
      <li>I can also clean this by taking it apart, something I couldn&#x27;t do with</li>
      <li>Make sure you use a paper towel under your foot because it really takes it off.</li>
      <li>and I love this one just as much.</li>
      <li>I bought this microplane for removing the skin scales on my lower legs, and then applying a good moisturizer, such as Aveeno.  </li>
      <li>Will be a loyal customer.  </li>
      <li>This file does the job quickly and efficiently.  </li>
      <li>, so it works quickly and efficiently</li>
      <li>Great product; works very well with little effort; works much better than any abrasive (sandpaper)&lt;br /&gt;type file.</li>

      <li>now it has a buffer attachment that really works well to smooth out your feet.  </li>
      <li>No cutting, scraping, visit to the doctor.</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, it&#x27;s worth the money, and still cheaper than going to the podiatrist.</li>
      <li>Not as wonderful on my dry feet as the other reviews suggest.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but the unique concept (a grater?) grabbed me.</li>
      <li>, I have smooth &amp; comfortable feet at last.  </li>
      <li>My lower legs are now smooth and look pink and healthy.  </li>
      <li>I like that you can use it on dry skin and also like the receptacle for catching the filed skin.</li>
      <li>My feet were very smooth afterword but make sure you don&#x27;t file them down too much</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;- long and curved handle, makes it comfortable and easy to use</li>
      <li>It simply performs better.</li>
      <li>As with other reviewers, please control the urge to file your entire foot away because it&#x27;s that good!  </li>
      <li>I have tried a few products over the years to keep my feet smooth but this is the first one I have ever tried that was this quick, easy and painless to use.  </li>
      <li>Having used this brand&#x27;s kitchen tools, I was pretty certain I was buying a winner.</li>
      <li>Previous model did not have replaceable blade, so now it&#x27;s even better!  </li>

      <li>This microplane does work very well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If I do not trim my heels I will tip over this works great The best I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few products over the years to keep my feet smooth but this is the first one I have ever tried that was this quick, easy and painless to use.  The two \\&quot;graters\\&quot; both work equally well, with the one for filing and one for smoothing.  They only real complaint I have is that some of the dry skin will fall out of the grater holes when you are moving it around so you might want to use it over a towel.      My mother got this and told me how good it was and I decided pick up a ped egg when I was in bed bath and beyond instead.  The egg just plain didn&#x27;t work.  This is totally worth the cost, it comes in a nice storage case and after several uses it&#x27;s as sharp as ever.  Just be careful to do it a little bit at a time, so you don&#x27;t hurt yourself, being it is easy to over do it because of how quickly the dead skin comes off.      If you need something for callused feet I honestly couldn&#x27;t recommend anything other than one of these from microplane, I&#x27;ve had my microplane for the kitchen for years and love it and I love this one just as much.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my ped egg so was just wandering through Amazon when I saw this. I liked the design...seemed like it would be easier to use and to clean. I love it. It is versatile and very effective. I like smooth feet....no, not a fetish just a choice. This micro plane makes it easy to keep my feet sandal smooth so they feel nice and look pretty. The plates come out very easily for cleaning and there is something about that handle that is very elegant and efficient.</li>
    <li> The answer to my cracked heels! Makes shaving down dead skin simple, allowing for better foot maintenance. Having used this brand&#x27;s kitchen tools, I was pretty certain I was buying a winner.</li>
    <li> Wow, this removes all the cracked and peeling callus from your heels in no time.  I am very impressed with this foot file.</li>
    <li> The Microplane Foot File is simply amazing. I&#x27;ve finally found the foot file I can&#x27;t be without. I&#x27;ve tried the ped egg, the cvs version of the ped egg and the Diamancel buffer -- all of these might work for minor roughness but none come close to the Microplane. The Microplane takes seconds to remove tough, thick calluses without damage, leaving silky smooth feet. I regularly go for pedicures but unfortunately I tend to get thick calluses that build up on the bottoms of my feet very, very quickly and also on my heels. The Microplane is able to remove the calluses better than my pedicurist. I just rub it across my feet for a few seconds and I&#x27;m all done. I also find that it&#x27;s safer and easier to use than the callus shavers that work with razor blades. I&#x27;m tossing my ped eggs and callus shavers and returning the Diamancel. The Microplane is my tool for life.</li>
    <li> This file works wonders and is very durable. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I had a crack under my heel that broke away from my foot about 1/2\\&quot; square...and thick. It was really painful to walk on. Even touching it was painful, and if it caught on my shoe, I howled in pain.    I bought this thing based on other reviews (and after looking at my nutmeg microplane and thinking \\&quot;hmm\\&quot;) and did one badly cracked foot first by sawing the unit back and forth.    I couldn&#x27;t imagine how I was going to attack the other foot with the cracked flap.    So I did it the soft &#x27;chicken&#x27; way: just one direction in the direction of the flap so that I didn&#x27;t catch on it. Gently.    Gone. Perfect. I read somewhere in these comments not to get too crazy about getting everything off at once if the situation is really bad. Mine was. But this Microplane Foot XL Pro did it. It is the best thing I have ever used in my life. Bar none. I&#x27;ve bought every expensive cream, file, electric sander, German scrape blades, stuff for horse hoofs, half of Kiehl&#x27;s, you name it I&#x27;ve bought it.    Nothing holds a candle to this. Nothing.    Do it dry. And don&#x27;t forget to empty the well under the microplane blade...not readily apparent.    I have baby pink heels for the first time in years.</li>
    <li> The Microplane foot file works as advertised but you do have to be careful not to over do...I got a little carried away on my heel and it was very sore for a few days.</li>
    <li> New model. Not as good as the original. Removable piece always feels loose</li>
    <li> This foot file really takes the dead skin off!  Use right after your shower, and then dump the dead skin in the trash.  This is my second one!</li>
    <li> I have incredibly dry skin (ichthyosis), and very dry, cracked heels. For years I searched for a solution to this problem. Pumice stones barely made a dent, traditional foot files were worthless. No amount of cream would help. Then, after YEARS of searching, I found this file. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but the unique concept (a grater?) grabbed me. I rubbed it on my dry feet and was promptly AMAZED. It took all of the dead skin off in seconds. No cutting, scraping, visit to the doctor. My heel cracks disappeared. My feet felt and looked normal.   The only downside to this product is that the grater gets dull, and you have to buy new ones. I wish they could use a metal that would last longer. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s worth the money, and still cheaper than going to the podiatrist. They make two sizes, and I definitely recommend the larger (xl). It simply performs better.</li>
    <li> I bought this microplane for removing the skin scales on my lower legs, and then applying a good moisturizer, such as Aveeno.  My lower legs are now smooth and look pink and healthy.  I repeat this every week.  This is not a cure but is cosmetic.</li>
    <li> I decided to give it a try, and am SO HAPPY i did. This works amazingly well, and saves me lots of money on pedicures. Will be a loyal customer.  LOVE.</li>
    <li> After years of scrubbing with dull rasps in the shower, I discovered this miracle. Sit in a comfortable chair, and easily grind away thick, dead skin off of feet!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous products that are SUPPOSED to soften tough skin on feet, but this is the only one that has ever worked the way I&#x27;d hoped.  Previous model did not have replaceable blade, so now it&#x27;s even better!  I use mine about once/week and my feet are in the condition that regular pedicures never achieved.  My heels are soft and I no longer have the uncomfortable cracking I once did.  I wear heels 5-6 days/week, so my feet are always in need of some TLC.  Worth EVERY penny!</li>
    <li> tried and failed. The design is flawed. not as good as the original model. Need product engineer take a look at it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all &amp; spent tons of $$$.  The best by far!!!!!  Smooth at last &amp; cracks are gone!!!  I&#x27;m a Floridian &amp; a chronic flip-flop wearer.  The flops were killing my feet in every way.  I finally found some great supportive flops (love Terox or Oofo on Amazon), but nothing would work for the cracks on my heels &amp; balls of my feet.  Thanks to the Microplane XL plus Flexitol Heel Balm (in the foot care section at Wal Mart), I have smooth &amp; comfortable feet at last.  Thank you, Microplane.  You saved my poor, painful feet!!!</li>
    <li> This foot file is the best that I have found. I like that you can use it on dry skin and also like the receptacle for catching the filed skin. There was a little &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; for getting the plastic cover off because I did not want to scratch my fingers when removing it.</li>
    <li> One summer several years ago, I let my heels get callused to the point of cracking. Yowza was that painful.  I vowed never again. So for years I have religiously applied thick cream to my feet morning and night, and used a Dr Scholl&#x27;s foot file immediately after showering.  Unfortunately, the Dr Scholl&#x27;s handle is not very strong and I&#x27;ve broken many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this on Amazon, and since I&#x27;m a fan of Microplane&#x27;s culinary rasps, I thought this would probably be a step up from Dr. Scholl&#x27;s. That was a huge understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on dry, un moisturized skin per the packaging directions.  One use, and my heels are like baby heels. Dr Scholl&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t have accomplished that in a month.  I can also clean this by taking it apart, something I couldn&#x27;t do with he Scholl&#x27;s. (And it&#x27;s rather disgustingly amazing to see how much the plane removed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on other brands.</li>
    <li> The price was a ripp off because it is so difficult to replace the cartridge once you take it off the first time. And the handle is good size but not the blades. Don&#x27;t buy this product although the vendor has great service.</li>
    <li> I love the handle and the ease of use. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 star is the grater part doesn&#x27;t always snap all the way in and will fall off unexpectedly, dumping the skin particles at the same time.</li>
    <li> I love to use this every couple of weeks after I take a shower.  I sit down with my feet over paper towels and gently rub this on the heels and souls of my feet and dup the dead soft skin out.  My feet feel so good.</li>
    <li> This microplane is the one I&#x27;ve been using for a while now it has a buffer attachment that really works well to smooth out your feet.  I&#x27;ve had lots of compliments on the way my feet look and it is because of this item.</li>
    <li> This thing all I can say is the best I have owned and won&#x27;t need to buy another for a long time.  It works great and is very durable so it seems like it will last a lifetime.  Make sure you use a paper towel under your foot because it really takes it off.</li>
    <li> I tried everything for my cracked heals.  Cream made them softer but the cracks remained.  I tried one of those egg shaped planes \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; but was disappointed in the performance.    This thing actually works.  A couple of caveats.  It says to use on dry skin.  I prefer to use just out of the shower.  My wife gets better results with dry skin.  Go figure.    If your feet have deep cracks it will take several weeks of daily use to get rid of them.  DO NOT try and take them down in one use, the raw skin will make you regret that decision.  Don&#x27;t ask how I know.  :)    Depending on use the blade is best replaced annually.  My wife prefers the buffer blade now that her heals no longer tear her panty hose.    Well made product that does what it promises.  We own two.</li>
    <li> Coarse heels for 50 years. Calluses that I finally reasoned could be best be removed with mechanical power: 200 grit sandpaper and a random-orbit sander. But that wasn&#x27;t particularly comfortable.    This device, however, is completely brilliant, from the same folks who provide the kitchen utensils (and the woodworking files). So they understand how to do laser-etched, super-sharp files. And this works. It comes nicely packaged, with good instructions, but let&#x27;s be real: the main thing is, it gets rid of heel and toe calluses. My only admonition? Don&#x27;t go overboard -- it&#x27;s easy with a tool this efficient to \\&quot;quick\\&quot; yourself: Cut down so much that you risk bleeding, and then it takes a few days to recover.     I&#x27;m sure part of my problem is a penchant for Birkenstocks, but who cares: This is a powerful and effective tool, and it works efficiently and pleasantly. Granted, it falls outside of my usual realm of reviews. The handle is strong (I&#x27;ve broken other heel files before), and it&#x27;s way better than those cute little \\&quot;heel rasps\\&quot; that work off two \\&quot;C\\&quot; batteries but take two days to rasp off your heels. Use this; apply some heavy-duty (ideally, urea-based) skin creme on what remains, and enjoy good heel health. Also includes a \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; file that, once you&#x27;re done with the major removal, will probably due nicely for a few weeks of maintenance. Check it out ... And much more comfortable than the Makita sander.</li>
    <li> I wish the corners/edges of the file could be used. Hard to get certain parts of my foot to make contact with the file. Not as wonderful on my dry feet as the other reviews suggest. :/</li>
    <li> Great product; works very well with little effort; works much better than any abrasive (sandpaper)&lt;br /&gt;type file. Comes with a &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; (coarse) and &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; (fine) buffing insert.</li>
    <li> I have the most horrible dry feet.  This does a superb job on scrapping the dry skin off.  Start off slowly and do a bit each day.  You can really hurt your feet if you try to take too much off at a time.</li>
    <li> This microplane does work very well.  My feet were very smooth afterword but make sure you don&#x27;t file them down too much or you&#x27;ll have sore feet.</li>
    <li> This file does the job quickly and efficiently.  As with other reviewers, please control the urge to file your entire foot away because it&#x27;s that good!  Slow and gradual is better.  I gave this file to my mom, who has a problem with dry feet, and now need to buy another one for myself.  I was just about to drop some big bucks on the ANSR Callous Remover ($120) but glad I found this solution before purchasing it.</li>
    <li> This thing works GREAT!</li>
    <li> Works great no kidding! Just like what it says, it take big ugly classes away gone in just seconds!</li>
    <li> I have used several different types of foot callus removal agents.  Lotions, stones, files, cheese garters like planes, and I even tried to spell them away.  Nothing has worked until I tried this.  This is of the cheese grater family, the long handle makes it easy to use.  The&lt;br /&gt; pictures made it look like it might have larger openings than I would like.  In truth it is a &amp;#34;micro&amp;#34;plane just as the name implies.  It is also very very sharp.  It removed thick hard calluses in two minutes, without me having to apply a lot of pressure while filing.  I have broken handles off of planes and pumice stones in the past!  I do see that there&#x27;s a danger of filing to deep if I&#x27;m not careful.&lt;br /&gt;To sum up the nice features of this item:&lt;br /&gt;- very sharp, so it works quickly and efficiently&lt;br /&gt;- small or fine plane, so it leaves a smooth surface after removing calluses&lt;br /&gt;- long and curved handle, makes it comfortable and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- It has a clear cover to protect the plate of the file when stored and protects the other objects from the file.  The cover also helps to remove the file plate from the handle, which is nice for my older fingers.&lt;br /&gt;- reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean plastic like body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the second plate yet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only one that works.  It&#x27;s not perfect (can leave your skin roughed up and it&#x27;s hard to switch out the plates).  But it works.  And that&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t say about any other foot file.</li>
    <li> Very effective at its job.  Long handle makes use easy if flexibility/reach are issues.  Cleanup is a snap.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> While the seller was great and item arrived in great condition and in great time, this review is for the actual product. The foot file worked REALLY well; I loved it.... until the flimsy plastic locking tab broke, rendering the file plate completely useless. Now I have a plastic handle. That&#x27;s it, after maybe 5 uses.</li>
    <li> Works ok, not really better or worse than any other of these.  Long handle makes it easier to use than those with shorter handles.  The trick with these really, all of them, is to use them regularly and consistently, rather than just wait for things to get terrible and then try to make up for it.  Use this or similar a couple times a week for just a few minutes and the results will be better.</li>
    <li> I needed to remove callouses on my heels.  Every micro plane I&#x27;ve bought for the kitchen has worked very well so I bought this one.  It works vey well.  It is easy to hold and use.  It captures the removed skin.  If it ever gets dull I&#x27;ll buy another one.</li>
    <li> I had the smaller version of this -- the new one works as good as all previous versions and the added buffing pad is a big plus</li>
    <li> I. LOVE. THIS. FILE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE best foot file ever! It works wonders on hard calloused heels with very little effort. At under $10, this is the best price around.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve tried a good number of tools for this purpose, this is by far the most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is well thought out and well executed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that it ought to come with TWO handles so it would not necessitate the changing of the steel files in order to go from the stronger file to the lesser &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; file.  It is not easy to change the files and &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; them in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should the securing of the files in the handles be better designed, this is essentially a perfect product.</li>
    <li> Great start for horribly calloused feet.  Good, but not great on maintaince.  I graduated to creams.  That&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
