<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These razors were awful! This is my first neg review to ever write. Truly. But I don&#x27;t want anyone else wasting their money like I did. I have used these refills for well over a year and have loved them. However, the box I received with this shipment.... Not a SINGLE one was usable! They were horrible. Poorly poorly made. Makes me wonder if this company sent a knock-off of the true Gillette brand. Packing looked normal, but quality inside was nothing close to typical.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> One of the best female razors I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave! Love them.</li>
    <li> The usual stuff, great and expensive. However I think they are the top of these type of products. My wife uses them and I like the results! :-)</li>
    <li> Great experience and great product</li>
    <li> I think this is the best women&#x27;s shaving blade out there.  I recommend this blade for closeness of shave and no nicks.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t get razor burn using this razor and the price here is cheaper than walmart.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, razor cartridges are expensive.  Buy them in bulk on Amazon and you don&#x27;t have to worry about running out for a year.  By far a better price than I&#x27;ve seen in any store.</li>
    <li> I went to these after thinking the 5 blade Venus were so expensive. I understand why now. I went back to the 5 blade Venus. You get much closer shave with 5 blade.</li>
    <li> These are the best razors available!!!  I have used them for years and have tried several other venus razor cartridges along the way as they came out as well, thinking they might be better but these are simply the best.  The other \\&quot;improved\\&quot; versions that cost more and have the heavy moisture strip are bulky/gummy and that interferes with easily and quickly achieving a close shave. Also, the blade turns over if you shave too quickly.  The original venus cartridges are the perfect size to quickly and easily shave legs, underarms, bikini area, ...everywhere!  :)  No need for any \\&quot;improvements\\&quot;... can&#x27;t fix perfect!</li>
    <li> This razor is great to use for men. I use the razor to shave my arms and chest and it gives you a smooth shave with no cuts.</li>
    <li> Some of the blades last a long time, others last only a few times before needing replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife because.... well that&#x27;s what she uses and it was a goldbox deal for me. They work great.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I bought this on amazon than at walmart. It comes in 8 instead of 6 and it is about $6 less. Plus no shipping cost and under $25. What can be better than that?</li>
    <li> I could not believe how reasonable they were being sold for on Amazon! If you go in stores they are 20+ dollars so theses were a steal!!</li>
    <li> These are quite a bit cheaper than the price at retailers near me, and they are the same product. You can expect exactly what you get from this product when you buy it in the store. It didn&#x27;t seem any different.</li>
    <li> I had my husband buy this for me.I have sensitive skin and this is the only one that shaves without issues.</li>
    <li> A great price if you get the full amount off for subscribe and save. A good razor, lasts awhile, works well, doesn&#x27;t nick a lot.</li>
    <li> I got these to replace what turned out to be much wider cartridges on my original Venus.  Now my razor feels smaller.  Not a big deal - razor blade is the same but just takes longer.  Just wanted to warn anyone with one of those giant razor heads - this will not duplicate it.</li>
    <li> Great price for name brand items.</li>
    <li> Over 90 days have passed since I placed my order for these, and in this time I have switched between several different razors and only used two of the blades from this box.  At first I thought it was a fluke, but now I know: the blades I purchased from seller bsd sales are counterfeit.  These blades would not stay on either of my Venus razors - the friction from drawing it up my leg was enough to pop it off several times over the course of one shave.  They also did not fit correctly into the plastic they come in; I had to pull the blade out with my fingers instead of pulling it out by the handle like you&#x27;re supposed to be able to do.  Finally, they were so dull that they didn&#x27;t take hardly any hair off of my legs.  I&#x27;ve been using Venus razors for several years now, and I know how sharp they&#x27;re supposed to be out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, be careful what you buy.  I know this single one star rating won&#x27;t hurt the popularity of these razors, and it shouldn&#x27;t as they are great razors.  But do be careful who you&#x27;re buying from, because you never know what you&#x27;ll get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I was unable to give bsd sales a review due to it being more than 90 days since the purchase, but please steer clear of this seller!)</li>
    <li> I bought the Venus Embrace razor (the one with 5 blades) and LOVED it. I assumed it was the Venus razors (versus the Schick ones I had been using) that had made the difference, but the real difference turned out to be the number of blades. Going from a 5-blade razor to a 3-blade razor sucked! Though these ones are much, much less expensive, I find myself having to almost shave twice, going over spots the razor missed. Even after my shower I found spots the razor missed. I never had to worry about that with the Embrace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I feel like the blades dull quicker. With the Embrace, I only had to change the blade about every month or so (shaving about 2-3x week) but this cartridge dulls much quicker than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is nice that any Venus blade fits all styles of razor handles.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nothing like the one i bought before.  It got rusty fter the first day usage.  i will not buy this item again.</li>
    <li> Great price and I needed refill blades quickly</li>
    <li> Great price and work great on many different razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my fair share of cuts when shaving my legs until I came across Venus, it is much smoother and I have had much fewer cuts.</li>
    <li> These are the same razor cartridges that you would get in drug stores, grocery store...ect.  Just a whole lot less expensive on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and at a low price. I highly recommend it. I hardly ever cut myself even when I switch on a new blade.</li>
    <li> The first time I ordered this product, I had no problems.  But the second time, I received the item in different packaging.  The listing warns that this may happen, so I was not concerned and opened the package.  The problem is that the razors are clearly a different product from what I received in my first shipment.  I have never shaved with such a poor razor as these, even when buying cheap disposables for travel.  I cut myself several times and did not get a close shave.  I thought it was a fluke with one razor, but the same thing happened with a new razor the next time around.  I had to go out and buy new razors from the drugstore, and those worked without any issue.  These razors were so unexpectedly bad that it makes me question the authenticity of the product.  Either Gillette has really lowered their quality standards, or these are counterfeit products being sold as Gillettes.  Potential buyers, beware!</li>
    <li> Shaves my legs wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t claim that this is the most amazing razor out there, but it&#x27;s a very good one. I&#x27;ve never had any problems with Knicks or cuts with these cartridges, and they have a nice moisture strip. If you want soft, smooth legs, this is a great razor.</li>
    <li> I have used venus cartridges for some time now and find them to be a nice blade. No nicks, well maybe one or two, but that is it. Smooth shave on my legs and underarms. My hubby would not touch them with a ten foot pole just because they say for women. I don&#x27;t care as he has his own, but I love these.</li>
    <li> The last time I bought Venus razor blades, it was a combo pack of 3-blade and 5-blade and the only difference between the two was that the 5-blade was slightly taller to accommodate the 2 extra blades. This new version of the 3-blade is a joke. It&#x27;s much narrower than the old 3-blade, which makes it much more time-consuming and annoying to use.</li>
    <li> long story short; these blades are complete low quality. i have no idea how \\&quot;blades\\&quot; dont work or how an item as universal such as razor blades can be of bad quality, but you have been warned</li>
    <li> This must be a very old version of the Gillette Venus blades that the seller is trying to get rid of. They&#x27;re smaller, not as wide as the current blades are, with no aloe or other soothing strip, and definitely not the quality I&#x27;m used to from Gillette. Need multiple strokes to shave the same area, and skin felt rough after. And I even used my husband&#x27;s shaving gel for sensitive skin, rather than my usual. Still disappointed with the experience/result. Regrettable buy. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t be buying these anymore - I have a personal ethics problem with P&amp;G, the maker...they do work however</li>
    <li> My Daughter likes these alot.</li>
    <li> These are way overpriced, but I haven&#x27;t found any others as good. These give a smooth shave without cutting at the uneven boney places.</li>
    <li> Price was about half what it is in nationwide drugstore chains...What else can I say?</li>
    <li> I like the Gillette razors because many different styles of razor head can be used on the handle. I use these for every day and get the ones with built in shaving cream for vacation.</li>
    <li> I bought these for the sheer price, but I really regret it. They just don&#x27;t work that well. I had to go over the same area repeatedly to get a good shave and then ended up with razor burn (ouch!) I&#x27;m not a hairy person at all and these were just awful for me! Save yourself the agony and buy some good 5 blade refills for the Venus</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. It makes a nice, close shave. I rate it 4 stars just because its not as wonderful as some of the other venus razors, but thats why its a bit cheaper. I knew that before I bought it. There is not much of a difference in the closeness of the shave but more so in shaving; the venus embrace has these moisture strips so after the first time (it takes time for the water to soak in) you don&#x27;t even have to use shaving cream for the next several times till the moisture strips wears out. However, I am not sensitive when it comes to shaving and have no problem using shaving cream (hair conditioner) and the shave is almost as close as any other venus. If money were no problem, i would choose venus embrace though. I&#x27;ve also tried the divine and that is nice too.</li>
    <li> Love these razor blades and Amazon has a great price.  I like them better than the Divine blades, actually, because the razor head is too big.</li>
    <li> i only like the razors with blades. gets a better shave than only using 2. old stand by brand</li>
    <li> I bought this item because i needed razor i so got these to try them out and i haven&#x27;t went back since</li>
    <li> I like the smooth feeling of the Mach 3, even if it is a masculine color.  The Venus just doesn&#x27;t get as close.  Good on your knees, if you tend to nick yourself there.  I&#x27;m sticking to the Mach 3 for a longer-lasting shave.</li>
    <li> subscribe and save -- great offer.</li>
    <li> These just didn&#x27;t work for me - Too dry and gave me razor burn. There are much better blades on the market now.</li>
    <li> Great addition to your Gillette Venus Razor. The cartridges are really gentle on a woman&#x27;s skin and have a protective strip above the razor. I always shave in a hurry and ever since I switched to these, I have never cut my skin, and the shave is so smooth, I cant stop touching myself :)</li>
    <li> I love this razor and this is a great place to replenish the blades.  The price was right, they were delivered right on time.  Very good service.  Hooray Amazon, again.</li>
    <li> These razors dull very quickly compared to my Schick razors.  I used to be able to shave my legs 3 - 4 times with the Schick.  The Venus blade kind of dies after two shaves and if you use it in the armpit area after the leg, it is rather uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Wife has very smooth legs after using these cartridges! Well worth the price to sleep with silky smoothness! We will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I only use this brand and type now.  I always cut myself on others and my skin would feel irritated after shaving.  I also needed to use a shaving cream but with these, I just lather on soap and shave in the shower.  Quick, easy, no irritating and no cuts.</li>
    <li> very poor quality, i keep getting cuts from these blades, very unsatisfied  with this product. would never buy or recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item from Amazon for $15.29 in spring 2011.  I have been satisfied with this product.  The price was good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Venus girl since I was a teenager. I&#x27;ve tried other razors and blades, but nothing shaves as close as Venus with very few nicks. Combined with Gillette Satin Care shave gel, it&#x27;s the smoothest shave!</li>
    <li> My wife likes these plain ones over the ones with moisture bars and the such. The fancier ones not only cost more but they are mostly useless when the moisture bar runs out, even if the blades are still sharp. Just use decent shaving lotion and you should have no problems with this razor. Sometimes simpler is better.&lt;br /&gt;I normally buy these at the store, but they were cheaper on amazon so I now purchase them here.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it 4 stars, although it is better than the $18-22 price in stores, the $16 price on amazon is still way to high for the product. Although I can&#x27;t say how much Gillette charges for companies to buy these, I would say $10 is a fair price.</li>
    <li> Will always buy these.  So far I think these are the best and I buy many because you can always use razors!  ;-)</li>
    <li> Takes the &amp;#34;furs&amp;#34; out of the &amp;#34;venus&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Lou Reed just died and I&#x27;m still grieving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were a gift for my gf, but I kept one to use on my face. Makes me feel pretty.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a very timely fashion but, so far all the blades are dull.  Not sure if this is Gillette&#x27;s fault, bad batch or a reselling of B grade merchandise under the guise of A grade merchandise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for years and find that I&#x27;m always closely shaven and don&#x27;t have to worry too much about nicks or missed spots.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with how fast I received my product, and what a great price I got !</li>
    <li> got these because of good price with subscribe and save.  have used them for years.  like the way they shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will continue with subscribe and save as long as the price stays reasonable.</li>
    <li> Pros: They fit my Venus razor head just fine. They are significantly cheaper than other blades.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:they don&#x27;t give a particularly close shave. They also get dull quickly - I got a lot of nicks after using only a couple times. They are significantly cheaper than other blades.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> Just like at cvs, but cheaper.</li>
    <li> smooth shave.  shipped and arrived as advertised.</li>
    <li> I use this product for more than ten years, and I still buy it. I love how smooth my legs are after I shave .</li>
    <li> Girl is happy with it.  If she is happy, then I am happy.</li>
    <li> If you are somehow managing to cut yourself, no matter how carefully you think you are shaving... and you are fed up with it, then these are the razors you need to try.  Now, bear in mind this item is just the refill pack for the blades, but it is a good price.  So, just get your Venus at the Target center on Amazon.com &amp;amp; then stock up on these blade refills.  I actually do a great job with the Venus razor... no cuts at all!  And verrrry smooth! :)  And the color strip, also a moisturizer, tells exactly when it is time for a blade change.</li>
    <li> Not real Gillette razors-I received knock-offs. They work, but not what you expect</li>
    <li> Love, love this razor!!! The blades last several weeks for me and I can always find replacement cartridges anywhere I go.</li>
    <li> Like my title says, I&#x27;ve been using these razors for a long time now (8+ years). These give me the closest shave and are very comfortable. I have not cut myself w/ these razors once (expect for when it was completely my own fault.... slipped and jabbed my thigh w/ the hand w/ the razor in it as I was trying to regain balance.... BIG gash, lots of blood, not pretty!! Moral: be careful!). All in all, these are really good razors, easy to replace by popping out the old and putting in the new ones, gives a close shave, and doesn&#x27;t nick you (unless you&#x27;re clumsy like me).&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades for 15 years at least. I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet. I will never use another razor!</li>
    <li> ...anybody (and especially a male) who shares their home with one (or more) women over the age of 13 has probably made this mistake when working from a shopping list: you see a woman&#x27;s beauty product on your list, and then buy something close...but not *exactly* the listed item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big mistake. I did this once with Venus cartridges, and paid a major price. You&#x27;d have thought I tried to import smallpox into the house when I showed up with what was considered an inferior off-brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the only blades for women I&#x27;m allowed to bring home. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a new Venus on my face one time: very similar to the [[ASIN:B004B8AZH0 Fusion cartridges]] that are my own choice for shaving.</li>
    <li> I have tried to switch to less expensive brands.  But, it feels like trying to shave with the edge of a Rambo knife compared to using a Venus.  They are a bit pricey, but I seldom ever get razor-burn and almost never cut myself.  It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> These are the best razor blades on the market.  I&#x27;ve tried so many other brands, but Venus is the ultimate number 1.  It gives you a nice, clean shave without nicks or cuts.  Worth more than five stars.</li>
    <li> I bought the original razors since they are cheaper than the Venus Embrace razors, but it isn&#x27;t worth spending less money. My skin is very sensitive, and the original razors irritate my skin. If my skin weren&#x27;t so sensitive, perhaps these razors would have been a good purchase. So, for those of you with sensitive skin, try to spend a little more money for a better razor. However, if your skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated easily, these razors should be fine. And whether you have sensitive skin or not, always be sure to shave slowly! :) I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> My wife obviously uses these, so I should probably get her to write the review. Her legs are super smooth though. :)</li>
    <li> Sometimes you don&#x27;t need anything fancy like attached soap strips or gel strips etc. Plus, these are cheaper since it has no extra frills.</li>
    <li> Received quickly and received as listed, brand new and very satisfied with the venus refill cartridges.  Thank you will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I love the product but no matter where you go it&#x27;s still too expensive, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product, great value.  Delivered before date promised.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of hair - mission accomplished.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Venus razors for years, but this is my first time ordering them from Amazon and these gave me such awful razor burn. Somehow different than the same ones I buy at the grocery store. Not sure if they are defective or something but will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Simply Venus razor - and guessed that the blade refills for a Venus Original, would not fit.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered an extra Venus Original razor at the time I ordered these refills.</li>
    <li> I prefer to use shaving cream and these blades work well and don&#x27;t leave my legs feeling itchy or dry.</li>
    <li> Without question, this is the best razor and blades I&#x27;ve used.  It gives me the closest shave with the fewest nicks.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and I won&#x27;t give it up.  I do think that the replacement blades are overpriced, but I&#x27;m still buying them.  For me, who was chopping up my legs all over the place, this was a godsend.  Quite simly, Venus gives me the smoothest shave without nicks all over the place.</li>
    <li> Arrived safe and soucn and so quickly too!</li>
    <li> Wife prefers the blades with Oil of Olay.</li>
    <li> I am one leg shaving fanatic.  Even through the winter, I have always shaved everyday.  Even when I have been on my boat in the middle of the lake for several days, with not enough running water to afford a good shower-I have used body cream, and managed to shave every single day.  I cannot stand to feel the slightest nub of stubble on my legs.  I found a way to shave because of Venus&lt;br /&gt;brand even in the hospital-after knee replacement surgery, before I was allowed out of bed.  Thanks Venus for keeping me sane! Some say that the 5 blades work better for them--for me, as long as the shaver is Venus--then it works great.</li>
    <li> These razors are reliable and they get the job done. My personal secret for silky smooth legs... shave with olive oil. Just be sure to rinse the razor well.</li>
    <li> The original blades aren&#x27;t nearly as nice as any of the other Gillette razor refills.  They feel dull after only a few uses.  Gets dried out quickly. Not worth the cheaper price - I&#x27;ll stick to other refills in the future.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted at a great price!</li>
    <li> Wife likes them so that all there is to say here.</li>
    <li> I needed refills for my old Venus vibance and these work.  The Venus Vibrance is no longer available which is too bad because the vibrations feel great and help me not to nick my legs.  My only wish for these refills would be if they were to come in pink because that is the color of my razor and it looks weird to have a blue razor on a pink handle.</li>
    <li> Great product, now hard to find on the shelves at local stores as Gillette keeps coming out with more versions of the Venus,  Still the best overall shave.</li>
    <li> Not the real thing. Edge of razor isn&#x27;t safe. Cut myself shaving.</li>
    <li> Quality product and brand!</li>
    <li> I have used the Venus since it first came out many years ago. I use it not only for my face but also to shave my head and have never had a moments trouble.  Also it is almost impossible to cut yourself using one of these razors.</li>
    <li> Very convenient. Quick and safe to change. Never have had a nick. Have had the handle for two years and lasts for many replacement cartridges.</li>
    <li> Good choice, excellent price</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I wouldn&#x27;t want to go back to the single edged razors of my childhood, but the expense of shaving my legs has me want to go &#x27;au naturel&#x27;. These work well and last about a month for me (my hair doesn&#x27;t grow very quickly, so I only shave about once a week).</li>
    <li> Not very soft to the touch</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for a while but it seems the price just goes up on such a simple items.  Pretty much a rip off for price but I need them so it seemed to be the best price.</li>
    <li> So aggravating that it is getting harder and harder to find the refills for this wonderful razor! The &amp;#34;newer improved &amp;#34;ones are terrible. There is so much crap on the new ones (skin softener, aloe, blah, blah, blah) that they don&#x27;t shave your legs! Gilette: You have a great simple product here. STOP TRYING TO MAKE IT BETTER! It was already THE BEST!</li>
    <li> Same razor, but much less money. I only found that they seem to be a bit smaller than the ones I usually buy at the store.</li>
    <li> These razors are great. My boyfriend and I both use them and we both find that they provide a close shave and last longer than most. Good price too</li>
    <li> These are a great razors. My legs have never looked or felt so much nicer.</li>
    <li> Yup...they&#x27;re razor blades.  Not much else to say on this one other than they were cheaper here than anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I found these in my linen closet.  I have no memory of when I bought them.  I didn&#x27;t even have handles that worked with them.  So I went out and bought a Venus Embrace razor kit.  After I used up the cartridges that came with that one, I started using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good, but I like the Venus Embrace better.  These &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; Venus blades provide a decent shave and they fit on any Venus handle (including the one that came with my Embrace cartridges).  They also don&#x27;t have a moisture strip like the Venus Embrace, so if you forget and leave them face down on the side of the tub, they won&#x27;t stick to it (Venus Embrace will).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they&#x27;re not quite as easy to maneuver around the knees and ankles, and I think the shave with the Venus Embrace is slightly closer and/or longer-lasting.  I&#x27;m going to finish these off because I paid for them and they do work.  But I&#x27;m going to stick with Venus Embrace cartridges after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These would be a good choice for you if you&#x27;re looking to cut costs; they&#x27;re somewhat cheaper than the Venus Embrace.  If you don&#x27;t like moisture strips (especially ones that can stick to the tub), you may also be interested in these.  As I said, there&#x27;s nothing truly bad about these, it just so happens that I found another product I like slightly better.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as they usually are :(</li>
    <li> I love my venus razors</li>
    <li> Tried to order for auto shipment and got a notification that delivery was attempted but they were not able to deliver. Unfortunately they must have done something wrong because there is ALWAYS someone home. That said I am sure I will order again as it beats waiting 30 mins for a Wal-Mart clerk to come unlock the cabinet they store these in.</li>
    <li> I really love this razor! It&#x27;s a very close, comfortable shave! I would definatly recommend this product to anyone, anytime!;-&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Nothing amazing about these razors.  The price is a little much for 8 razors, I can get a pack of those pink, disposable razors at Walgreens/WalMart.  BUT, I use these razors to cut down on waste.  It is good to have refills on hand, though.  So I guess I&#x27;m saying that I buy these mostly out of necessity, not like.</li>
    <li> works great price is good than the out side but i wish  comes with little more count but is ok better than nothing.</li>
    <li> these are quite basic, but they fit the handle and they work.  I prefer some of the newer blades that provide more than just cutting power.  On the other hand, these are economical and work well, so if you prefer saving money, this is the one to buy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if these are kockoffs but they don&#x27;t stay sharp long.  I am not sure I want to buy Venus again, at least not online.  It seems to me that my old mach 3 razor blades lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Besides the cheap pricing for shaver refills, the delivery was fast- came practically the next week after I ordered it. The packaging was in good shape, no random dents and tears in the boxes.</li>
    <li> Cheap blades, will not order again.</li>
    <li> I love the Venus blades, and have a hard time finding the 8 count at stores.  Most of the options I find at stores have at least one Venus Embrace blade, which I hate.  So to find just the Venus value pack on Amazon was a great find.  The price was comparable to big box stores, and my frustration with finding the blades I want is over!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and am unable to find locally.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s a Gillette review without mentioning the price. Yes, the blades are great. Yes, the shave is great. But I feel huge jolts of pain every time I reorder these. The price just seems so high for what they are. We buy them on Amazon b/c they&#x27;re usually a bit cheaper, but seriously, a good shave should be a basic right - not reserved for those who can afford it.</li>
    <li> Wish I could find these at costco like I used to.  My favorite blades</li>
    <li> She loves these, and may I say the shave is smooth!!</li>
    <li> I have used these for years. They last a long time and provide a close shave. What more could be wanted of a razor blade.</li>
    <li> Its okay tho i had different blades that &#x27;shaves&#x27; much closer to skin, lot lesser stub hair. I am not going to get this again tho. I had better different type.</li>
    <li> This product was a really great price &amp; to have it sent to my door every month is a dream.  I just had to lock it in with subscribe &amp; save!</li>
    <li> Venus are definitely a little over priced, but they really are the best. This is a pretty good deal for this version.</li>
    <li> I have been using Venus razors for many years.  I generally buy the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; blade refills because they tend to be cheaper than the later/fancier versions and work just as well.  Even these cheaper ones are still quite overpriced, imho.</li>
    <li> I really like these razors/blades.  I wish they were a tad bit cheaper...but they are worth the money when compared to the other razors out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Venus Divine for years but the replacement blades were out of stock at my store of choice so I had to downgrade to the basic Venus blades (all Venus blades work on all handles). I figured it was a couple bucks cheaper and probably just as good. Maybe I&#x27;d save some money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be saving any money. Although both blades have the same shape and 3 blades, regular Venus blades cut me up without fail. Sometimes I wouldn&#x27;t even notice and I&#x27;d find blood on my white towels or sheets. I noticed a major increase in irritation and even had some bumps become infected. Even my lower legs, which have always been the easiest place for me to get a perfect shave felt rough after using these blades. I&#x27;d always find patches I missed later, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use a very high quality shaving cream to reduce irritation but even it can&#x27;t compete with the amateur performance of Venus blades and I can tell you exactly why. Regular Venus blades do not have the comfort coating, smoothing cushions or multiple moisture strips of the Divine. In my book, those features are definitely worth paying more.</li>
    <li> Great razor, but these things really should not cost this much!</li>
    <li> Yikes! Very rough after using the men&#x27;s Gillette fusion blades for the last 2 years.</li>
    <li> Great razors at a great price! These have been my go-to razors for years!</li>
    <li> legitimate gillette venus cartridges. bought in bulk through groupon and others and they were not the authentic product. this is.</li>
    <li> Razors are like computer printers, they rake you over the coals for the refills.  That said Amazon has the best price on these but at over $2.50 a piece they are way overpriced.</li>
    <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found, but razor refills for women are always expensive. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I dislike these very much compared to any other Gillette razor refill I&#x27;ve ever tried. They seem dull right out of the box, and by the second use, they&#x27;re ready for the trash.</li>
    <li> Venus is the only razor my girls and I will use. Wish the price would go down a little bit.</li>
    <li> An old standby:&lt;br /&gt;For some reason TSA has no issues with &#x27;female&#x27; vanity items! A great product from Gillette. Sometimes good products get replaced simply because of manufacturer&#x27;s declining profit margins.</li>
    <li> all the gals in our home like gillette venus better than any other razor product.  lots of blades have been manufactured under the venus sub-brand, and some of the newer ones are nutty.  we tried some with 5 blades and a huge &amp;#34;lubricant&amp;#34; strip that were so bulky and clumsy.  the original venus blades are cheaper and work beautifully.</li>
    <li> I have been using venus for years.  It works great and you don&#x27;t need the fancy blades to get a close shave.  I would recommend buying it here (or in your sams club or warehouse store) because it IS cheaper than buying it in your local target or even wal mart.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Great price and timeliness on shipping.</li>
    <li> My wife very much enjoys using these cartidges for all her shaving needs. She uses them in the shower regularly, and they last her a long time (at least three weeks usually). She has the power razor, but we opted for the cheaper non-power cartridges, which work just fine. There is still plenty of lubricant on them to provide a smooth shave. Definitely not cheap, but worth paying the extra money for a smooth shave and no nicks and cuts. Amazon pricing is WAAAY better than in most (if not all) stores.</li>
    <li> These are great, cheaper then my big box store and unlike other reviews the blades are great and real not messed up like some say. Ive ordered these a number of times and never get anything but the best!!</li>
    <li> I started with the Gilette Venus a few years ago -- over the years i have tried their newer razor inventions( Divine, Pro Skin, Breeze, Embrace). Even though they were fun to try -- they all had cons to them like the the gel/soap around the razor being slimy and lasting only a week, which meant spending a lot more $$$ on razors than i would have liked to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end i returned to the classic Gilette Venus. Not only is it the cheapest razor from the Gilette Venus line,  but it also leaves my legs silky smooth. In order to achieve the most silkiest feeling legs i rub body butter on my legs after the shave/shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is great. It is really hard to  cut yourself, unless you go up or down with the razor sideways-- this will result in a clean cut, but it will be deep and will bleed.  Leaving the razor in the shower/bath will make it rust/dull faster due to the moisture so make sure to wipe off the razor after your shower and store it away (even if it is in a drawer) it will prolong the cartridges life. Also when it dulls it will leave your legs not that smooth and with little stubble -- so don&#x27;t forge to change those cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This box does not come with a razor, it is just the cartridges and each cartridge is individually packed. It is simple to replace the cartridges on the razor, just pop off the old cartridge, open the new cartridge packet, and pop the razor into the new cartridge. Done.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I love that you can wash out the hair since it&#x27;s open on the back.  I have tired the more expensive ones and they don&#x27;t shave any better. Why pay more?</li>
    <li> Product exactly what was ordered and exactly what was needed.  I am happy with this product.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Horrifically expensive, but what can you do. These fit any of my venus handles and last around a month.</li>
    <li> Usually I purchase the 5 blade Venus cartridges, but I thought perhaps I could save a few bucks and use these instead. I regret going cheap on these. It&#x27;s so much easier to cut myself shaving with these. I have to be extra careful and extra slow. So shaving in a hurry in just not a possibility. My legs are nowhere near as smooth as when I use 5 blade cartridges. I won&#x27;t be purchase these anymore.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about other people, but I can talk myself out of a purchase like this at the store in just 5 seconds.  Generally I pick up the item, I see a line- then I put the item down and leave.  I just don&#x27;t want to deal with lines for something as boring as razors. I&#x27;d rather just be the hairiest woman on earth.&lt;br /&gt;So when I realized I could buy them on Amazon, with S&amp;S for the same price as at the store I immediately signed up.  It&#x27;s amazing. I always have refill cartridges now, and my boyfriend (bless his good natured heart) no longer has to travel through wookie land to get to my legs.</li>
    <li> JUST AS DESCRIBED PERFECT THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> They must be making these cheaper because they wear down in sharpness very quickly it seems.  I like them though because they never cut my legs even when dull.</li>
    <li> I like purchasing these now online due to new rules at our local store that has them locked up.  Much easier and similar price, if not a few dollars less, than going to the store.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find a good price on non-disposable razors these days, so I was happy to find that these were for sale on Amazon. I have been using these blades for years now and there was no compromise or difference from the ones I have bought at the store in the past. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Very sharp blades</li>
    <li> I love my Venus (I&#x27;m John&#x27;s wife btw, ;)) and didn&#x27;t like the newer models.  I like the original, but those blades are harder and harder to find.  Thank goodness Amazon has them!  WOO HOO!  Get to stick with the razor I love.</li>
    <li> With the Amazon subscription it&#x27;s really easy to replenish your razor stock every other month without having to fight parking lots to get into the drugstore to buy.  I love this feature.</li>
    <li> Love that I can buy these for the same price as Walmart, but home delivered.</li>
    <li> I have been using these razors for years.  I just bought this refill pack and holy cow, it not only hurt to shave, but my legs were bleeding for quite a while after I got out of the shower.  I now have little cuts and bumps all over my legs, and it&#x27;s very painful.  The shape of the refill blade looks a little different, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be that strip of aloe on the blade anymore that used to soften the skin during the shave.  Has this happened to anyone else?</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years!</li>
    <li> Good deal, I just wish razors were a little less expensive in general. Miss the big batches of these razors you could get at Costco, but an 8 pack for the price is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Very smooth, easy shave.  Also, much safer than those plastic disposables.</li>
    <li> These razor blades are painful.  I ended up with 4 cuts the first time I used them.  They don&#x27;t have any of the lubricating strips around the blade, and the blades are not as easy to use as the venus divine or embrace.  Not buying them ever again.</li>
    <li> I love Venus razors, I&#x27;ve had one for about 2 years now. I&#x27;ve tried the Venus Embrace cartridge before this one and I LOVED the Embrace but those can be a bit more pricey, so once I ran out of those I decided to buy these. These are nice... But they don&#x27;t have much, it&#x27;s the very generic. I&#x27;d suggest you spring the couple bucks and get another type of cartridge!</li>
    <li> I signed up for the subscription to receive a package of razors every 3 months.  The savings over buying these at the grocery store is pretty significant.  I really like the subscribe and save feature offered by Amazon.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift for a family member.  She has a Venus razor and asked for these refills.</li>
    <li> These are decent razors. I first tried the Venus line years ago and was completely hooked. They have since come out with other spinoffs of the original that I think are better, but these are still good. They provide a close, smooth shave and I very, very rarely ever get nicked by this razor. I tend to have a reaction with a lot of other razors (especially disposables-I&#x27;m assuming it is that &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; strip), but I have no problem with these.</li>
    <li> these seem to not hold their edge as long as ones I got at the store.  Could they be knockoffs?  I&#x27;m disappointed in how long they are lasting me.</li>
    <li> These fit onto every Venus razor I&#x27;ve tried and are so far my favorite as I don&#x27;t need the extra lathering agents so I don&#x27;t need to spend the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One shaving tip, if you have to shave a certain area before surgery that is prone to razor burn, rub a thin layer of mederma on it after shaving.</li>
    <li> While these razors are somewhat expensive they are the best for my needs and good for my skin</li>
    <li> Very good condtion.  thanks</li>
    <li> There are definitely better razors out there. No moisture strip. Doesn&#x27;t contour to your body. This is just your basic razor blade.</li>
    <li> i have an older razor that i find is harder to find the blades to go with it. i&#x27;m just not ready to get another razor yet.</li>
    <li> As with all of the Gillette cartridges I have used over the years, some of the cartridge blades are duds - by which I mean they aren&#x27;t very sharp when they are just out of the container.  Could be excess oxidation, could be manufacturing defects, hard to tell without putting some work in on them that I am not willing to do - Gillette should be doing that.  Fortunately, it is not a large percentage. That said, they are shaving cartridges - not an exciting product.</li>
    <li> I love Venus but hate the price, found these and was amazed at how cheap they were! Will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Up until I was about 19 I was able to shave with any old disposable razor (Bic, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Then something changed. My skin became more sensitive and easily irritated while my beard became tougher. I went to 3-bladed Men&#x27;s razors with replaceable cartridges. That worked for a while but I was disappointed with how much they were costing versus how long they lasted. I used a new cartridge for every shave and sometimes even that would be pushing it. I eventually went to 4-bladed Men&#x27;s razors. That seemed to help but it was costing me an arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day I saw a trial pack of Venus razors that had 1 handle and 2 cartridges. It was on sale for little or nothing so I decided just for a laugh I&#x27;d try it out on my face to see what would happen. I was stunned! The blades were incredibly sharp! Not only that, they just kept on cutting and they were easily flushed clean due to the wider spaces between each blade. As an experiment I left the cartridge on the handle to see how it would feel on the second shave. It was just as good as the first time! No Men&#x27;s razor I had ever used was able to make it through a complete second shave but this razor did the job like it was nothing! I kept using it and finally on the fourth shave I could feel the razor dulling. But I didn&#x27;t mind. Nearly four shaves off one cartridge. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now these are all I shave with. They can seem expensive but I just remind myself that each blade is worth at least three Men&#x27;s blades to me: A 4-pack is at least a dozen shaves on my face and an 8-pack is like 25. So I&#x27;m sticking with these permanently. Yes, they a little bit on the &#x27;pretty&#x27; side but I don&#x27;t care. My face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside and for my face that&#x27;s saying something. If the color really bothers you that much then paint the handle black and put a skull on it or something. (Hey, that might look awesome if done right. Hmm...)</li>
    <li> They do the job, but barely.  They don&#x27;t leave my legs feeling as smooth as I&#x27;d like. I also get nicked very easily. I remembering loving them when they first came out, but going back to them has been a terrible experience.</li>
    <li> I think these blades are old or something. I&#x27;ve tried them a few times and they more often than not, do not shave smoothly but seem to pull.</li>
    <li> THE WIFE RECIEVED A VERY CLEAN SHAVE WITH THESE VENUS BLADES THEY ARE NO.1 AS FAR AS SHE IS CONCERNED SHE LOVES THEM THANK YOU</li>
    <li> When you have 4 females in the household, you always need razor blades. This fit our needs and is what the girls prefer to use.</li>
    <li> Fast service, good price, I have been using these razors ever since they came out and this was the least expensive for 8 count shaving cartridges I could find.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Wifey, Loves it. Gillette shaves the best.</li>
    <li> I have been using Venus razors for at least 10 years now. They work really well with a nice close shave, minimal nicks, and no cuts, but I do wish they lasted longer between having to change the cartridges. It can become pricey to change them often. This was a great deal for a pack of 8 of them here on Amazon. Much cheaper than buying them at a store.</li>
    <li> Used these razors for years and am finally ordering off amazon prime subscribe and save for a nice savings.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the rest, this is the BEST!</li>
    <li> I love these razors. I have always loved Venus blades and I don&#x27;t want what all the newer versions come with. These do the job and my legs always feel so smooth. Nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Great.  reasonable price</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this Venus blade only had 3 blades.  Not exactly what I had hoped for.  Still, arrived in good condition and on time.</li>
    <li> I love the venus razors, it was nice to get a little bit of a discount!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately these razors are cheaper than the usual Venus razors I have gotten by Venus, and that has meant many cuts on my legs. I won&#x27;t be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> Three blades work just fine for me and i have yet to cut myself using these.&lt;br /&gt;check out my detailed review as to why i love this product at http://beautyreviewsnwhatnot.blogspot.com/</li>
    <li> This product is what it says it is, does what you expect it to do, and the price was better than at a retail store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because it&#x27;s not super moisturizing as you shave. These are my number 2 blades- I prefer the Venus Embrace which does have a moisturizing strip.</li>
    <li> I love these razors. They give a great, close shave and leave the skin soft. I prefer these over every brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The way this is designed is wonderful. It&#x27;s easy to hold, I always have a smooth finish, and I never nick myself. A little pricy, but the blades last longer than normal disposable razors, so I guess it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Gilette Shaving Cartridges / B00005AUIE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like no matter what I shave with, I get painful ingrown hairs afterwards, so I&#x27;ve pretty much given up on shaving unless I absolutely have to. However, for those times when I must, I feel that the Venus razors cause the fewest ingrown hairs, so I rely on these to minimize problems. These babies are sharp as can be - I&#x27;m not sure about the \\&quot;no nicks\\&quot; part, since they certainly can and do cut up my knees and ankles if I&#x27;m not super careful. Probably I&#x27;m just clumsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These refill cartriges work with the [[ASIN:B001F51QPC Gillette Venus Razor,]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Ana Mardoll</li>
    <li> This product works as expected.  It does a nice job without needing to change cartridges frequently which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great price for the package.</li>
    <li> Venus was always my go-to brand for razors, but the last three packages (2 from stores, 1 from Amazon) have been terrible quality.  The razors don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp as they used to be, I have to change the blade twice as much, they fall off the razor handle, and they just seem cheap now.  Hopefully they change it back to what they were, but for now I&#x27;m trying other razors.</li>
    <li> Venus razors are excellent.  Once in a while I get one that&#x27;s bad, but this pack was all good. Will purchase more.</li>
    <li> great price!  I have holder in shower that holds 4 cartridges, so it makes it easy to have a new razor while in shower, no more excuses cactus legs!</li>
    <li> These razors are nice, but I am aghast at how expensive the refill blades are. Similar to the exorbitant pricing of printer ink cartridges.  Surely these things cost pennies to make in China, so it&#x27;s hard to stop focusing on why Gillette must be so blatantly greedy in its pricing.  Alas, regular razors for me.</li>
    <li> Great thank you so much :) this should last me a while great close shave leaves my skin super soft and smooth &amp;#60;3 thank you</li>
    <li> These razors are bar none the best razors my wife will accept into her shower. They tend to stay sharp enough for her for up to 3 weeks worth of shaving. They also rarely if ever cut her. I would say that the biggest issue with these is that if you leave them in the shower where they are exposed to moisture they tend to get a little gummier than some other brands. You can&#x27;t beat the price on these though, which is spectacular. We pay about 15 percent less than we would at our local supermarket.</li>
    <li> Good bargain, great razor</li>
    <li> Gifted as a stocking stuffer. From what I can tell they seem to work okay. She&#x27;s bought them again so I guess they must be good.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite razors that i have been using the last 8 years or so. They last long &amp; do not leave any scuffs or rashs. Never have been cut either. My all time favorite!!</li>
    <li> Great price &amp; service Ill be back when these run out. My wife loves these blades&lt;br /&gt; and these are a great bargain</li>
    <li> these are not like the oriiginal ones i received.  they had lotion strips on both sides of blade and you just brushed over w/your hand.  i will use them but would prefer the other ones.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using these blades for more than 3 years. Surprisingly, she has begun experiencing a rash each time after she uses one of the blades from her last order, which she received on February 5. (My wife has not used any new products when shaving or changed the way she shaves her legs. Plus, we have a whole-house water filter, so it’s not a change in the water.) Apparently, Gillette decided to change the coating gel or other material it was using in these Venus blades from one that did not affect people with sensitive skin to one that now can cause someone with sensitive skin to develop a unexpected rash. Needless to say, my wife has tossed away these new blades.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
    <li> I have been using schick for years, until I finally decided to make this switch. I felt the difference immediately. My legs were as smooth as silk and the shave was twice as fast. I wondered why, because the schick one i was previously using had more blades, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter now.&lt;br /&gt;I always wondered if venus is worth the money. It is. Even though this is one of the cheapest venus blades available it still gives fantastic results.</li>
    <li> Works well! Doesn&#x27;t last very long though. Wish they could be sharpened.</li>
    <li> ...don&#x27;t fix. Don&#x27;t need all kinds of variations. Keep well to continue a great product well supplied, that&#x27;s more convenient than any other variations.</li>
    <li> I love the Venus Series of razors.  They shave close and make my legs smooth.  I love this basic model best for price- I don&#x27;t need the gel or extras the others offer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Venus 3 blades for years and do not foresee changing my habit. Having tried a few five blade samples I did not notice a huge difference expect in the price. I&#x27;m sticking with these.</li>
    <li> My wife hates paying for blades. As a man, this has been my life. She normally uses the cheap pink disposable safety razor, that leaves her stubbly. Yet, against her wishes, do to the cost, I purchased her a box of these. I would do it again, and again. Now her skin is smooth and supple. It feels so nice. I do not know what they shave like, all I know is that I enjoy the results.</li>
    <li> Feels like a knock-off, very dull, shaves the hair off with quite some effort, result - lots of small cuts.&lt;br /&gt;(My wife has been a Gillette user for well over a decade, so she knows how a good cartridge works).</li>
    <li> I really like both the razor and the blades (3 blade style, non-lubricated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used my razor to get a nice, smooth shave for many years and have yet to nick myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is much easier to hold and use than the narrow utiliarian handles of some brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to remove the used blade and attach a new one and it would be very hard to nick yourself if you follow directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heck, I even appreciate the color.</li>
    <li> Love these razors and the prices were great</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s all in my head, but these never seem to last as long as the ones purchased from retail outlets. They work fine, though.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just pricy. Good price compared to Publux or Target thought! Gives great shave! Try to dry and clean off immediate after use to have them last twice as long!</li>
    <li> Great razor, but geezz are they expensive.  I shave my whole body from the side burns down, on a daily basis.  I can usually get about 2-3 good shaves out of one razor head.  5 if I push it, but the stubble grows in quick.  The hydrating strip lasts to the third shaving, and I typically find that razor does better without shaving cream.  Typically the only time the razor works well with Cream is on the very first round, even then I find &amp;#34;missed&amp;#34; spots, almost like the razor &amp;#34;bridged&amp;#34; over the hairs.  I wager that if someone was to only shave there legs, you could probably get about 10 good close shaves out of one razor head.  I&#x27;m actually trying the Tria Beauty in hopes that I never have to buy razors again.  In the event that the Tria doesn&#x27;t work, I will continue to get these.  Here&#x27;s hoping the Tria works.</li>
    <li> I have been using Venus razors for my whole life.  I have started to notice that the razors get duller faster.  They are not as good quality as before.  Plus, the prices have hit the roof.  It is such a cheap product considering the price.  Hopefully Gillette stops ripping off their customers and starts delivering a better product at a more reasonable price.  I am not impressed.  I am never buying these razors again.  All they ever do is give razor burn.</li>
    <li> Same as you would buy in a store. Great quality</li>
    <li> these are the razors that my wife cannot live without and they&#x27;re so damned expensive at the grocery store.  I&#x27;m happy to have found such a great price on Amazon and my marriage is safe for now.</li>
    <li> These razors are so dull, they dont do anything.  I am very surprised.  I have been buying Venus razors for years and have never had this problem. I had to go out and buy a new box from the local drug store.</li>
    <li> Razor blades. They work. Fresh sheets + just shaved legs &#x3D; heaven. Seriously use Venus razor blades to shave your legs. That day change your sheets. You&#x27;ll have the best night of sleep. To make it even more perfect, apply lotion on freshly shaved legs!</li>
    <li> Loving the Venus razors. Had no idea that any Venus blade refill fits any Venus razor handle. How cool is that?&lt;br /&gt;So far, my favorite cartridge is the Olay refill - so smooth! The best part, is I got my razor free from Influenster. :)</li>
    <li> I ordered these through Amazon because they were cheaper than any price I could find in local stores by about $3. That being said, they are still ridiculously expensive. Come on! They&#x27;re razor blades..a chunk of plastic with a few tiny strips of steel embedded in it. But they do give a close, smooth shave without nicking up my shins, and they last a long time, so I pay the price and grumble. The 3 star rating is an attempt to temper my assessment of the product itself (more like 5 stars) with what appears to be overpricing (more like 1 star).</li>
    <li> I bought these until I found Venus Embrace which has 5 blades and even though those are more expensive than these, they last a whole lot longer therefore cheaper in the long run!</li>
    <li> Razors are a rip off no matter how you slice it, no pun intended. These blades are my favorites -</li>
    <li> These razors are great! Although they can be expensive to replace, I find that when I shave my legs will stay smooth for almost two days. They dull very slowly, but I do find the embrace to leave skin less dry.</li>
    <li> Works just like expected. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Gillette Turbo Mach III for years. A couple months back I noticed my sweetheart (wife) was using a chincy disposible razor on her legs so I went To Amazon for help. I bought her the Gillette Venus with many extra cartidges and she loves it. Sorry I took so long honey.</li>
    <li> Might as well buy the disposables instead of wasting money on these ones.  These don&#x27;t have any of the nice lotion, soap, anything that goes on your skin after or before you shave like the other much nicer Venus cartridges.</li>
    <li> These cartridges work just fine. I like my razor and these cartridges work well. I prefer to have them sent to me on a regular basis than having to buy them in a store where the alarm goes off if you try to take them off the shelf ;)</li>
    <li> As always these are the best!  I have used these for years and found them to give the closest shave possible.</li>
    <li> Great way to avoid going to the store. Plus when checking out there was a coupon available to use, which saved on cost!</li>
    <li> For a little bit more I could get the one I have always been using: Venus Embrace (5 Blades + Moisture)&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this one because of the price. I am disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work so well. I noticed I have to shave much more often and also the blades do not last as long as the other one.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying it again. I DO NOT recommned</li>
