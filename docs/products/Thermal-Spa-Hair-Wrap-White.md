      <li>&quot; (I said to myself LOL)!</li>
      <li>LOL- believe me, I know!  </li>
      <li>best thing is that you can move around, sleep or do any activity at home while wearing this wrap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>LOL- believe me, I know!  </li>
      <li>Happy conditioning!</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>This is great because you are not connected to an electrical outlet and can move around as you need.</li>
      <li>It works great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so awesome and easy to use!</li>
      <li>I read all the reviews and thought that it would be a good idea</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>It was amazing, I loved the service, and it is so nice to be able to move around the house as I do my hair.</li>
      <li>, it had been taken out of the hair cap and this was my own fault</li>
      <li>as someone once said - \\&quot;more hair, more problems...\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Although, someone with longer or thicker hair, they may need more heat time, for sure (as someone once said - \\&quot;more hair, more problems...\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I will use this method when my hair grows out a bit more.</li>
      <li>I want to love this cap, but I just don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I love to condition my hair hair now.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping that the battery powered one heats more evenly as well.</li>
      <li>(I love it).  </li>
      <li>I has worked excellently for my deep conditions.  </li>
      <li>As a matter of fact, I just changed my 4-stars to 5..., for sure (</li>
      <li>would have given it more stars if there was more disposable bags in the box, since the existing wear away in the microwave after 1 use.</li>
      <li>I was glad that I decided to purchase this wrap.</li>
      <li>Just make sure that you carefullyheat the gel packs and wear a processing cap this hair wrap.</li>
      <li>She is always on the move and needs more mobility while conditioning her hair, and I find this product to be great for the busy bee at home!</li>
      <li>It heats up pretty good.</li>
      <li>The cap doesn&#x27;t stay hot, or even warm for more than a couple of minutes and</li>
      <li>I know, sounds easy</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use and looks exactly as pictured.  </li>
      <li>But overall, a great product to have.  </li>
      <li>The warmth is relaxing, and the cap is a comfortable turban style.  </li>
      <li>But overall, a great product to have.  </li>
      <li>, I can do homework, the wrap is washable, this is fabulous.</li>
      <li>But for now, my hair is very short, and the product works great as instructed.</li>
      <li>This hair wrap is such a great invention.  </li>
      <li>This head wrap works pretty good --- while it&#x27;s hot.  </li>
      <li>By 20-30 minutes, it&#x27;s more like \\&quot;body heat\\&quot;-warm, which my hairdresser says is fine for a deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair is in great condition with this routine, shiny with healthy ends and less tangles.</li>
      <li>so I have to let it cool a bit before wearing</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good but only have it on the front and the sides,</li>
      <li>short -- good product, great for the deep conditioning woman on the go; but stick to the hot water method and skip the microwave.  </li>
      <li>but over all i like it, to deep condition my natural hair, and it better  than sitting under a hood-dryer, i can move around and do house work,  or whatever i choose, its a good product</li>
      <li>The heat actually moves around quickly and easily like that, anyway, so I really don&#x27;t mind the size to be honest.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve kept it on for as long as 40+ minutes, and found my hair was still warm to the touch under the cap, so it definitely does a good job of keeping the heat</li>
      <li>This is definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this less than a month ago and the first time I used it it worked great.  </li>
      <li>It cools pretty quickly -- I&#x27;d say in about 20 minutes</li>
      <li>this is something you want to invest your money other wise not.</li>
      <li>reviews said it doesn&#x27;t stay warm for very long.  </li>
      <li>When using this method, I even find that the wrap is often too hot to put on my head</li>
      <li>I love this hair wrap; it&#x27;s just what I needed for my weekly deep conditioning treatments</li>
      <li>first it&#x27;s pretty hot</li>
      <li>You pop it in the microwave for 1 minutes and it stays hot for 15-20 minutes.  </li>
      <li>My hair conditioned well after my first use of this product.  </li>
      <li>The first is that when you put the wrap on your head, part of your head will not come into contact with the heat.</li>
      <li>My entire head does warm up really well after removing the Wrap, and my tiny curls are so soft (can&#x27;t stop touching it).  </li>
      <li>The ear protecting pads on long hair does not go on top of ear.</li>
      <li>i wanted a steam dryer just didnt want to have to spend so much money, or use alot of space and time</li>
      <li>Then you fasten it on your head and you are free to go about your business for about 30 minutes of deep conditioning.</li>
      <li>I did have a problem with the old gel inserts bursting, but I was sent the newer replacement within days of emailing customer service (with a large sample of conditioner!).  </li>
      <li>It is a little large for me now, but in time, I&#x27;m sure my hair (TWA) will fill it out.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this is you need to be mobile, and want to do a quick (20 minute) deep conditioning.</li>
      <li>It does not stay warm for very long and is can not be kept in the microwave very long either.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m free to roam around and do other things.  </li>
      <li>After testing this method, it does last a little longer and the Wrap is rather warm inside</li>
      <li>Heats for at least 20 min, and is comfortable, the price was right</li>
      <li>At first glance, it looks simple...</li>
      <li>Not what I thought, it would do to microwave time vs being hot enough.</li>
      <li>I have decided to go back to my old method of just using a wet warm towel to deep condition my hair and am getting rid of the hair therapy cap.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t microwave it too long, because the plastic, liquid filled pouches in the cap will explode, so I pop it back in microwave every 25 minutes or so for about 1 1/2 minutes.  </li>
      <li>I have natural curly 4a dry hair, and this product has made deep conditioning easy.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this as a Christmas present the first week of Jan 2013 and so far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
      <li>It is probably large enough to accomodate those with a lot of hair and/or roller sets (but not sure this product may work for roller setting, may need more heat time)...  </li>
      <li>The second reason is because the material is really abrasive for your hair.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve gone through 3 so far and am going to try the battery</li>
      <li>I just have to be extra careful to make sure that my entire hairline is under the plastic cap when I use this hair</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because it was suggested on a natural hair blog and because, as a student, I didn&#x27;t have time to sit under a dryer all day.</li>
      <li>When you put the Wrap on your head, it&#x27;s not terribly hot, but it is so warm and cozy</li>
      <li>It gets really hot, so you have to be careful.  </li>
      <li>Even if it breaks down eventually, it will be worth the money.</li>
      <li>I took a star off because the whole process of getting the gel packs in and out of the wrap is kind of awkward.  </li>
      <li>Only 60 seconds in my microwave is hot enough especially around the sides.</li>
      <li>(Careful handling the hot packets when inserting them back into the Wrap- use kitchen mittens or something).  </li>
      <li>(the other colors were more expensive when I purchased mine), and the material doesn&#x27;t feel super durable to the touch, so I&#x27;m scared to put it through the washing machine, but some deep conditioner seeps onto the cap during the conditioning process, so I feel like it could benefit from a washing between uses.</li>

<li> By the time I was out, the water was at a soft boil, so as suggested (both by other posters and the included instructions guide), I turned the stove off, placed the gel pads in the pot and then used the five minutes needed for the gel pads to heat up to mix my deep conditioner and place it in my hair.&lt;br</li>
<li> This really helped deep conditioner absorb in my hair but if you leave it in the microwave just a few seconds too long it&#x27;s ruined.  </li>
<li> This product should mention it&#x27;s dimension because it does not work for long hair.</li>
<li> I prefer to boil water and place the gel packs in it for 5 minutes rather than using the microwave because I have heard that the inserts can burst if heated too long in the microwave.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe i spent $ on this thing.  </li>
<li> After that incident I continued to use it minus the pocket that burst.  </li>
<li> After a few minutes, I stuck my finger underneath to see if it was actually warming up</li>
<li> I do not like this product, it does not fit properly and can not adequately be adjusted.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Taking the advice of other posters, I put a pot of water on the stove before I got in the shower to wash my hair.  </li>
<li> and I really can not think of anything that is wrong with it.</li>
<li> It has microwavable gel packs all around inside (little inserts) that you must heat up with the Wrap.  </li>
<li> all the gel packs heat at uneven rates</li>
<li> It does what its suppose to do, except it is somewhat small for my head.  </li>
<li> I was very skeptical because of some of the reviews, but I believe it does the job that it&#x27;s required to do.</li>
<li> and that&#x27;s just annoying.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe i spent $ on this thing.  I read all the reviews and thought that it would be a good idea but HECK NO!  Its does nothing for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> best thing is that you can move around, sleep or do any activity at home while wearing this wrap.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it more stars if there was more disposable bags in the box, since the existing wear away in the microwave after 1 use.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product, it does not fit properly and can not adequately be adjusted.  It does not stay warm for very long and is can not be kept in the microwave very long either.  I would like to return it but I have used it.</li>
    <li> I bought this less than a month ago and the first time I used it it worked great.  A day later one of the silicone pockets popped in the microwave and it burst, it had been taken out of the hair cap and this was my own fault I should have followed instructions.  After that incident I continued to use it minus the pocket that burst.  I would microwave it for 1 minute and I had no problems with it.  Then another pocket burst while it was in the microwave and this time I had followed the instructions!  I have decided to go back to my old method of just using a wet warm towel to deep condition my hair and am getting rid of the hair therapy cap.</li>
    <li> This really helped deep conditioner absorb in my hair but if you leave it in the microwave just a few seconds too long it&#x27;s ruined.  You have to heat it at 15 second intervals with a maximum of 90 seconds.  I know, sounds easy but I&#x27;ve gone through 3 so far and am going to try the battery operated one instead.  I&#x27;m hoping that the battery powered one heats more evenly as well.</li>
    <li> I have natural curly 4a dry hair, and this product has made deep conditioning easy.  I use it to pre-treat before I wash: Slather on any conditioner (or a conditioner/oil mix), cover with a plastic cap, then use prior to shower.  This way I don&#x27;t have to jump in and out of the tub.  Also, I am not tied to a wall like with the electric caps.  The warmth is relaxing, and the cap is a comfortable turban style.  I did have a problem with the old gel inserts bursting, but I was sent the newer replacement within days of emailing customer service (with a large sample of conditioner!).  My hair is in great condition with this routine, shiny with healthy ends and less tangles.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and it shipped to Canada in about one week. It was amazing, I loved the service, and it is so nice to be able to move around the house as I do my hair. I can nap, I can do homework, the wrap is washable, this is fabulous. Even if it breaks down eventually, it will be worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this hair wrap; it&#x27;s just what I needed for my weekly deep conditioning treatments</li>
    <li> I like the hair wrap, the only thing is i want the heat to last longer  but over all i like it, to deep condition my natural hair, and it better  than sitting under a hood-dryer, i can move around and do house work,  or whatever i choose, its a good product, i give it a 5 because i dont  have to sit in one place for 30mins..lol</li>
    <li> This product should mention it&#x27;s dimension because it does not work for long hair. The heat level it&#x27;s good but only have it on the front and the sides, back part I did not feel it. The ear protecting pads on long hair does not go on top of ear. So if you have medium to short hair this is something you want to invest your money other wise not.</li>
    <li> For starters, I am an AA woman, and I purchased this item for deep conditioning my shoulder length hair. I read the reviews and was unsure what to expect, but overall I feel it delivers well on its premise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking the advice of other posters, I put a pot of water on the stove before I got in the shower to wash my hair.  By the time I was out, the water was at a soft boil, so as suggested (both by other posters and the included instructions guide), I turned the stove off, placed the gel pads in the pot and then used the five minutes needed for the gel pads to heat up to mix my deep conditioner and place it in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it&#x27;s pretty hot (I had to place rolled up facial tissue against my ears to protect my ears from the heat), but after 5-10 minutes, the heat is rather bearable. By 20-30 minutes, it&#x27;s more like \\&quot;body heat\\&quot;-warm, which my hairdresser says is fine for a deep conditioner. I&#x27;ve kept it on for as long as 40+ minutes, and found my hair was still warm to the touch under the cap, so it definitely does a good job of keeping the heat in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short -- good product, great for the deep conditioning woman on the go; but stick to the hot water method and skip the microwave.  I took a star off because the whole process of getting the gel packs in and out of the wrap is kind of awkward.  In addition, I got the white one (the other colors were more expensive when I purchased mine), and the material doesn&#x27;t feel super durable to the touch, so I&#x27;m scared to put it through the washing machine, but some deep conditioner seeps onto the cap during the conditioning process, so I feel like it could benefit from a washing between uses.</li>
    <li> This head wrap works pretty good --- while it&#x27;s hot.  It cools pretty quickly -- I&#x27;d say in about 20 minutes (I have A/C in my home set at about 69, so this could be an issue, too).  You can&#x27;t microwave it too long, because the plastic, liquid filled pouches in the cap will explode, so I pop it back in microwave every 25 minutes or so for about 1 1/2 minutes.  It is very easy to use and looks exactly as pictured.  I like that I can move around and am not tied to an electric cord.  I would recommend this is you need to be mobile, and want to do a quick (20 minute) deep conditioning.</li>
    <li> I want to love this cap, but I just don&#x27;t. The cap doesn&#x27;t stay hot, or even warm for more than a couple of minutes and all the gel packs heat at uneven rates</li>
    <li> I was glad that I decided to purchase this wrap. I was very skeptical because of some of the reviews, but I believe it does the job that it&#x27;s required to do. I do like that I can move around and not have to be confined to my hair dryer. It heats up pretty good. Only 60 seconds in my microwave is hot enough especially around the sides. I purchased this as a Christmas present the first week of Jan 2013 and so far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It works great.  Cordless!  At first glance, it looks simple... \\&quot;it&#x27;s a turban\\&quot; (I said to myself LOL)! But the simple design actually works.  It has microwavable gel packs all around inside (little inserts) that you must heat up with the Wrap.  It gets really hot, so you have to be careful.  When you put the Wrap on your head, it&#x27;s not terribly hot, but it is so warm and cozy (I love it).  After a few minutes, I stuck my finger underneath to see if it was actually warming up and it was. I&#x27;m free to roam around and do other things.  My hair conditioned well after my first use of this product.  My entire head does warm up really well after removing the Wrap, and my tiny curls are so soft (can&#x27;t stop touching it).  It is a little large for me now, but in time, I&#x27;m sure my hair (TWA) will fill it out.  The heat actually moves around quickly and easily like that, anyway, so I really don&#x27;t mind the size to be honest. It is probably large enough to accomodate those with a lot of hair and/or roller sets (but not sure this product may work for roller setting, may need more heat time)...  I love to condition my hair hair now.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it again.  I think I want to order another one as a gif for my mom.  She is always on the move and needs more mobility while conditioning her hair, and I find this product to be great for the busy bee at home! This is definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews said it doesn&#x27;t stay warm for very long.  I have to agree, but I think , as one of the reviewers mentioned you could try boiling the packets for about 5 minutes.  After testing this method, it does last a little longer and the Wrap is rather warm inside (Careful handling the hot packets when inserting them back into the Wrap- use kitchen mittens or something).  I will use this method when my hair grows out a bit more. But for now, my hair is very short, and the product works great as instructed. Although, someone with longer or thicker hair, they may need more heat time, for sure (as someone once said - \\&quot;more hair, more problems...\\&quot; LOL- believe me, I know!  But overall, a great product to have.  As a matter of fact, I just changed my 4-stars to 5..., for sure (as someone once said - \\&quot;more hair, more problems...\\&quot; LOL- believe me, I know!

    <li> This is great because you are not connected to an electrical outlet and can move around as you need.</li>
    <li> It does what its suppose to do, except it is somewhat small for my head.  Heats for at least 20 min, and is comfortable, the price was right and I really can not think of anything that is wrong with it.</li>
    <li> finally I can stop wearing lots of towels over my plastic cap when re-hydrating my hair... i wanted a steam dryer just didnt want to have to spend so much money, or use alot of space and time</li>
    <li> This hair wrap is such a great invention.  It&#x27;s basically a headscarf with compartments that provide a place for gel pack inserts so that you can deep condition your hair without being tied to a bulky hairdryer. I purchased this product because it was suggested on a natural hair blog and because, as a student, I didn&#x27;t have time to sit under a dryer all day. I had to study! This product was definitely the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this hair wrap, all you have to do is microwave the gel packs per the instructions written on each pack and then put them into the the wrap&#x27;s compartments. Then you fasten it on your head and you are free to go about your business for about 30 minutes of deep conditioning. After 30 minutes, the heat is gone. I prefer to boil water and place the gel packs in it for 5 minutes rather than using the microwave because I have heard that the inserts can burst if heated too long in the microwave. I have never had a problem with boiled water method. When using this method, I even find that the wrap is often too hot to put on my head so I have to let it cool a bit before wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two reasons for giving this product 4 stars instead of 5. The first is that when you put the wrap on your head, part of your head will not come into contact with the heat. You have to reheat the gel packs and then turn the wrap around to condition your entire head and that&#x27;s just annoying. The second reason is because the material is really abrasive for your hair. You definitely can&#x27;t just put the wrap on your hair without some sort of [[ASIN:B0001M3K4U Elastic Plastic Processing Cap]] to protect your hair. Even when just the edges of my hair touch the wrap, I notice some breakage. I just have to be extra careful to make sure that my entire hairline is under the plastic cap when I use this hair wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I would suggest this product because it has made my life easier and served its intended purpose. Just make sure that you carefullyheat the gel packs and wear a processing cap this hair wrap. Happy conditioning!</li>
    <li> I like it because when im doing deep conditioner i don&#x27;t have to sit under the dryer. I still can be moving around.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so awesome and easy to use!</li>
    <li> It is so convenient.  You pop it in the microwave for 1 minutes and it stays hot for 15-20 minutes.  I has worked excellently for my deep conditions.  In fact I&#x27;m using it again tonight.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought, it would do to microwave time vs being hot enough.</li>
</ol>
