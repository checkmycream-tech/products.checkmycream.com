      <li>Works great as the shaving bowl is the perfect size for the brush</li>
      <li>and it will travel great.</li>
      <li>Great deal if you are shaving on a budget.</li>

      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Good Store.</li>
      <li>Good for what it is.</li>
      <li>Result is a warm product and great shave.  </li>
      <li>great, cleans and dries easy.</li>
      <li>Though it&#x27;s written in a dated style, and could do with more illustrations, it makes a good primer for shaving techniques your daddy never taught</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a nice warm lather, buy a ceramic shave bowl.</li>
      <li>but whatever. also fits an iPhone 5 nicely for use as a speaker.</li>
      <li>However, what I&#x27;ve written here should constitute a good learning kit, as I&#x27;ve found it all, working together, conspires to give me a shave that&#x27;s a pleasure while it&#x27;s in process, and leaves my skin baby smooth afterward.</li>
      <li>I heat the bowl with the brush under hot water for 2 min, dump the water, add the cream and with in a minute I have a great lather.</li>
      <li>I read that it should be 20% bigger but for me it is a perfect size.</li>
      <li>It looked ok in the picture, and they&#x27;re not hiding the dimensions, but I can&#x27;t work up a lather without my brush crashing into the sides continuously.</li>
      <li>good-quality stuff is pricy, but I&#x27;ve found it worthwhile.</li>
      <li>I am not new to the hunt for the perfect shave</li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take very long to warm up under warm or hot water and looks great on the counter.</li>
      <li>Nice bowl that does exactly as described.</li>
      <li>The advantage here, besides light weight and easy grip, is the changeable single-edge blade.</li>
      <li>I use the Art of Shaving cream and their intermediate grade (Fine) shaving brush.  </li>
      <li>Evalley Men&#x27;s Stainless Steel Shaving Cup]], which, being metal, retains the heat of your hot-water shave quite nicely, and helps me work up a rich lather that&#x27;s both easy to use, and a pleasure to apply.</li>
      <li>and this fit what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>but overall I am happy with it</li>
      <li>I could barely fit my brush inside</li>
      <li>It is a nice addition to my shave kit, but it doesn&#x27;t really keep the heat.</li>
      <li>I can barely fit my soap in it let alone the brush.</li>
      <li>You really don&#x27;t even need a shaving bowl to be honest.</li>
      <li>you get a perfect small shave cup filled with your soap of choice.</li>
      <li>Nice material and holds a decent amount of shaving cream.</li>
      <li>I keep it shiny and clean using Bar Keepers Friend every once in awhile.</li>
      <li>Straight razors are more unique.</li>
      <li>Save water and look cool doing it.</li>
      <li>Saop fit ok, but it could be slightly larger for most shaving soaps</li>
      <li>I heat the bowl up with very hot water and then use either Cremo or Art of Shaving shaving cream with the Parker brush.  </li>
      <li>At my age, for the first time, I enjoy shaving.</li>
      <li>This cup is great, but needs slight change in contour.</li>
      <li>I use this to hold hot water and clean my blades.</li>
      <li>Great little shave cup.</li>
      <li>Result: warm lather for entire shave.  </li>
      <li>But wouldve been nice if it were larger.</li>
      <li>Turns out, having a beard is more work, not less.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rounded bottom fits the palm of his hand just right.</li>
      <li>Everyone else is right</li>
      <li>The book above makes good suggestions for choosing a razor, but I&#x27;ve found satisfaction with [[ASIN:B002ONHBBW Parker&#x27;s Stainless Steel Straight Razor]].</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for traveling and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but I will be purchasing something larger once I&#x27;m back home.</li>
      <li>Pretty small but looks great.....</li>
      <li>Works as expected allows for a nice warm and rich lather that I just couldn&#x27;t get with my previous technique.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t like to spend tons and tons of money on trying something out first.</li>
      <li>Shaving hasn&#x27;t been this slow-going since I first tried it as a kid; but it hasn&#x27;t been this pleasurable EVER.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>

      <li>If you really want to shave with a straight razor, may I suggest starting with the book [[ASIN:1475109849 The Art of Shaving, or, Shaving Made Easy]].</li>
      <li>I use mine every day with a little warm water.</li>
      <li>I knew that going in, so I got exactly what I expected, but just be aware that your shaving soap pucks won&#x27;t fit into this.</li>
      <li>In fact this bowl would fit inside my current shaving mug...</li>
      <li>Also, the multi-stage shaving regimen is a real sensual pleasure, in a way safety rasor shaving just isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>&quot; You can&#x27;t do that with a straight razor.</li>
      <li>great little insulate cup that makes it easy to create thick lather from bits of soap.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure for more die hard fans they would prefer a bigger bowl</li>
      <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t need stropping, it&#x27;s low maintenance, and you can graduate to authentic blue steel</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently using an​ HJM 21P8, but this might be better with a smaller travel brush.</li>
      <li>I place this in very hot water before I add my shave soap, but it loses the heat very quickly.  </li>
      <li>The narrow edge and tetchy qualities make for a more intensive process.</li>
      <li>Nice little shave cup that doesn&#x27;t tarnish when left in the shower</li>
      <li>Having all four is something of an indulgence, but especially if you want to look professional and trustworthy--or if you want to have your sweetheart touch your face plenty--the indulgence is worth it.</li>
      <li>small for most shave soap bars...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s durable and nice looking, I simply didn&#x27;t realize just how small it is.</li>
      <li>Its pretty cool looking but its too small for what you intend to use it for.</li>
      <li>First published in 1905, it offers step-by-step instructions in actually shaving without nicking yourself like a pincushion.</li>
      <li>A co-worker talked up the value of a single-edge straight razor to maintain a crisp, professional-looking edge on my facial hair, especially for men like me with wiry beard hair and copious neck beard.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this bowl and can&#x27;t believe it has lasted this long for an inexpensive stainless steel product.</li>
      <li>My only gripe is that since it is all stainless steel that when you are holding it and working a lather it can slip out of your hand.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Obviously, this isn&#x27;t a complete instruction on straight-razor shaving.</li>
      <li>Also, turns out, shaving with a straight razor isn&#x27;t essentially similar to shaving with a disposable safety</li>
      <li>At my age, I&#x27;m finally learning to shave with a straight razor.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy a complete shaving set persay, I chose my husbands piece by piece</li>
      <li>It is a nice tiny shaving bowl, though keep in mind, it is very small.  </li>
      <li>insulated: pre-heat and let stand with hot water and then drain and place brush inside with a little bit of shave cream; stainless:</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
      <li>Disposable safety razors are all more or less the same, and all equally annoying; you can get a good shave, but at the cost of tender, abraded skin.</li>
      <li>If you brish the cream directly onto your skin, it won&#x27;t foam up, and it&#x27;ll actually make shaving more difficult, not less.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This &amp;#34;shaving bowl&amp;#34; is so small that it is a joke! The dimensions stated in the write-up are OUTSIDE dimensions, figure at least a 1/4&amp;#34; smaller on the INSIDE. Unless you have a tiny shaving brush, a tiny piece of soap, and maybe a tiny face don&#x27;t waist your time with this. In fact this bowl would fit inside my current shaving mug...</li>
    <li> Nice little shave cup that doesn&#x27;t tarnish when left in the shower</li>
    <li> WHY OH WHY DIDN&amp;#34;T I READ THE REVIEWS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is well made but tiny.  sending it back.  sadly.</li>
    <li> It is a nice tiny shaving bowl, though keep in mind, it is very small.  I knew that going in, so I got exactly what I expected, but just be aware that your shaving soap pucks won&#x27;t fit into this.</li>
    <li> Small little shaving bowl. Perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> great, cleans and dries easy. wish it had a small handle but whatever. also fits an iPhone 5 nicely for use as a speaker.</li>
    <li> I am not new to the hunt for the perfect shave but I don&#x27;t like to spend tons and tons of money on trying something out first. I have been using the badger brush and soap for some time now and always just cupped one hand to start the lather. This worked until I started to put together a groomsman gift set and found this little bowl. Works as expected allows for a nice warm and rich lather that I just couldn&#x27;t get with my previous technique. My only gripe is that since it is all stainless steel that when you are holding it and working a lather it can slip out of your hand. Minor flaw that can be easily fixed by getting a thick rubber band and wrapping it around it for some added traction. For the low price of $6 that minor flaw isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me but does warrant a one star drop.</li>
    <li> Needs to be about 50% larger for a shave mug.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for to keep my shaving brush in. I keep it shiny and clean using Bar Keepers Friend every once in awhile.</li>
    <li> I thought the bowl is going to be a little bit bigger it to little disappointing to be so small</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the fine print, this is OK as a travel shave mug.  For home use, however, it is small, think a riny bit wider than the small Yankee Candle jars.</li>
    <li> Good for what it is. It&#x27;s durable and nice looking, I simply didn&#x27;t realize just how small it is. It looked ok in the picture, and they&#x27;re not hiding the dimensions, but I can&#x27;t work up a lather without my brush crashing into the sides continuously. I&#x27;m currently using an​ HJM 21P8, but this might be better with a smaller travel brush.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy! The dimensions are way off! It is in reality much smaller than advertised to be. I can barely fit my soap in it let alone the brush. Also if you look at the sample pictures there are two different cups.</li>
    <li> Everyone else is right it&#x27;s too small.  I ended up giving it away.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. The weight makes it feel likes it made from aluminum but it is a tiny bit smaller than expected. Great deal if you are shaving on a budget.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> This cup is great, but needs slight change in contour. A little slippery when wet, due to smoothness.</li>
    <li> Would be perfect except mine came with a ding. But it does its job</li>
    <li> Works well for making some foamy goodness. I have dropped it a few times and there are only a few small dings to the cup. It holds up well and does its job.</li>
    <li> Great little shave cup. small for most shave soap bars...but if you cut the bars up and put them in the cup in a toaster oven for 5 min you get a perfect small shave cup filled with your soap of choice.</li>
    <li> Well Done. Good product. Good Store.</li>
    <li> Nice bowl that does exactly as described. It doesn&#x27;t take very long to warm up under warm or hot water and looks great on the counter.</li>
    <li> Way too small, much smaller than it looks. I could barely fit my brush inside and then there&#x27;s no room to move the brush to mix the soap.</li>
    <li> Nice material and holds a decent amount of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Its pretty cool looking but its too small for what you intend to use it for. I just mix it in the container now, I don&#x27;t even use this. You really don&#x27;t even need a shaving bowl to be honest. But if you want one get one a little bigger than this.</li>
    <li> Came on time. But wouldve been nice if it were larger.</li>
    <li> I have had no problems with the bowl. It is a bit small but overall I am happy with it and it will travel great. I heat the bowl with the brush under hot water for 2 min, dump the water, add the cream and with in a minute I have a great lather. It holds enough cream for 2 swipes on the face and holds the heat well. I read that it should be 20% bigger but for me it is a perfect size. I&#x27;m sure for more die hard fans they would prefer a bigger bowl but for this price you cannot argue.</li>
    <li> Pretty small but looks great.....</li>
    <li> Save water and look cool doing it. I used to just let the water run while I shaved. But I am in California and  I use this to hold hot water and clean my blades. But I end up saving about 10 gallons of water a week.Also saves time cleaning the sink. Just dump it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is too small to lather up with.</li>
    <li> Not big enough for a standard 3&amp;#34; soap puck.</li>
    <li> This cup is small no doubt. It&#x27;s great for traveling and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but I will be purchasing something larger once I&#x27;m back home.</li>
    <li> No frills SS soap cup! Saop fit ok, but it could be slightly larger for most shaving soaps</li>
    <li> It is smaller than I anticipated.</li>
    <li> great little insulate cup that makes it easy to create thick lather from bits of soap.  I use mine every day with a little warm water.</li>
    <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a small bowl used to whip shaving cream.</li>
    <li> item exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> At my age, I&#x27;m finally learning to shave with a straight razor. A co-worker talked up the value of a single-edge straight razor to maintain a crisp, professional-looking edge on my facial hair, especially for men like me with wiry beard hair and copious neck beard. Turns out, having a beard is more work, not less. Also, turns out, shaving with a straight razor isn&#x27;t essentially similar to shaving with a disposable safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad shoved a Schick razor in my hand when I was 14, and said \\&quot;go for it.\\&quot; You can&#x27;t do that with a straight razor. The narrow edge and tetchy qualities make for a more intensive process. If you really want to shave with a straight razor, may I suggest starting with the book [[ASIN:1475109849 The Art of Shaving, or, Shaving Made Easy]]. First published in 1905, it offers step-by-step instructions in actually shaving without nicking yourself like a pincushion. Though it&#x27;s written in a dated style, and could do with more illustrations, it makes a good primer for shaving techniques your daddy never taught you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, you&#x27;ll need to pick a razor. Disposable safety razors are all more or less the same, and all equally annoying; you can get a good shave, but at the cost of tender, abraded skin. Straight razors are more unique. The book above makes good suggestions for choosing a razor, but I&#x27;ve found satisfaction with [[ASIN:B002ONHBBW Parker&#x27;s Stainless Steel Straight Razor]]. The advantage here, besides light weight and easy grip, is the changeable single-edge blade. Since it doesn&#x27;t need stropping, it&#x27;s low maintenance, and you can graduate to authentic blue steel later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first lesson with the straight razor: don&#x27;t overlook your foam. I got in the habit of dry-shaving several years ago, but especially if you have thick, wiry facial hair like me, you absolutely need a foam. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll cut yourself repeatedly, and scrape off layers of epidermis without cutting much hair. Safety razor foam won&#x27;t work, notwell anyway. I tried using [[ASIN:B00A0J09C0 Dove Men+Care Shave Gel]], as I&#x27;m a fan of Dove Men+Care overall; but this was a real disappointment. It was thick, heavy, and didn&#x27;t lather up much; \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; only served to remove the foam, leaving hair behind virtually intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good-quality stuff is pricy, but I&#x27;ve found it worthwhile. I sprung for [[ASIN:B00A6UKMM0 The Art of Shaving Kit]], which includes a pre-shave oil, thick shaving cream, a badger hair brush, and aftershave. Having all four is something of an indulgence, but especially if you want to look professional and trustworthy--or if you want to have your sweetheart touch your face plenty--the indulgence is worth it. Also, the multi-stage shaving regimen is a real sensual pleasure, in a way safety rasor shaving just isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning: the kit mentioned above doesn&#x27;t include a cup for your shaving cream. If you brish the cream directly onto your skin, it won&#x27;t foam up, and it&#x27;ll actually make shaving more difficult, not less. I got the [[ASIN:B00HV6L3DE Evalley Men&#x27;s Stainless Steel Shaving Cup]], which, being metal, retains the heat of your hot-water shave quite nicely, and helps me work up a rich lather that&#x27;s both easy to use, and a pleasure to apply. Several people have complained that the cup is too small, but I say: too small for what? If your brush fits in, and it holds all your foam, then it&#x27;s done what you bought it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, this isn&#x27;t a complete instruction on straight-razor shaving. That&#x27;s what the book is for. I only intend to recommend which products have worked for me. I&#x27;m still re-learning the science of shaving. However, what I&#x27;ve written here should constitute a good learning kit, as I&#x27;ve found it all, working together, conspires to give me a shave that&#x27;s a pleasure while it&#x27;s in process, and leaves my skin baby smooth afterward. Shaving hasn&#x27;t been this slow-going since I first tried it as a kid; but it hasn&#x27;t been this pleasurable EVER. At my age, for the first time, I enjoy shaving. And now, you can too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice shiny cup that holds shaving soaps perfectly. I didn&#x27;t buy a complete shaving set persay, I chose my husbands piece by piece and this fit what I was looking for. It&#x27;s rounded bottom fits the palm of his hand just right.</li>
    <li> Using for 3 months and holding up well.  Features I bought it for: size: perfect for shaving brush; insulated: pre-heat and let stand with hot water and then drain and place brush inside with a little bit of shave cream; stainless: although not a top quality stainless, it has held up well (leave it to air dry in between used with no tarnish)  Result: warm lather for entire shave.  Note: I use the Art of Shaving cream and their intermediate grade (Fine) shaving brush.  Works great as the shaving bowl is the perfect size for the brush, it maintains the heat and warms up the shaving cream and does not tarnish.  Update June 2016:  Bought this bowl in September 2014 and using it daily with a Parker Synthetic Bristle brush.  Bowl is holding up perfectly.  No stains or tarnish!  I heat the bowl up with very hot water and then use either Cremo or Art of Shaving shaving cream with the Parker brush.  Result is a warm product and great shave.  I highly recommend this bowl and can&#x27;t believe it has lasted this long for an inexpensive stainless steel product.</li>
    <li> It is a nice addition to my shave kit, but it doesn&#x27;t really keep the heat. I place this in very hot water before I add my shave soap, but it loses the heat very quickly.  If you&#x27;re looking for a nice warm lather, buy a ceramic shave bowl. With that being said, I like the look of this shave bowl.  3 stars because I like the look.</li>
