      <li>/&gt;UPDATE ON 07/03/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more than 2 months have passed, the original lower denture repair described in the above review is still going strong, no problems</li>
      <li>It will be interesting to see how long this repair lasts; I will provide an appropriate update.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It will be interesting to see how long this repair lasts; I will provide an appropriate update.</li>
      <li>Place the now repaired denture into “hot water” (not boiling!)</li>
      <li>The end result is that I was able to make the dentures sit in place better than ever, and at a material cost of less than $4.  </li>
      <li>We waited and his lower denture is now rock solid and perfectly aligned – as good if not better than new during daily use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>We waited and his lower denture is now rock solid and perfectly aligned – as good if not better than new during daily use.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use very much on both pieces.</li>
      <li>So far this material is working just fine.  </li>
      <li>This stuff will work if DIRECTIONS ARE FOLLOWED EXACTLY.</li>
      <li>and i don&#x27;t even need 1 thanks for nothing!</li>
      <li>cause this stuff is fast!</li>
      <li>Held my repair piece in place for 5 minutes placed in hot water for 10 minutes sanded and it worked.</li>
      <li>about one or more of the support clips, even with just pressing my tongue on different teeth of the denture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, this appears to be a good temporary solution, but it&#x27;s by no means a permanent repair for broken dentures.tly good to go.</li>
      <li>My partials never fit so good and lasted over a year before I had to redo them.</li>
      <li>) Remove any of the now congealed pink substance that has oozed/escaped out of the break during pressure application with the spatula or other available tool (e.g., a toothpick is a handy item to have available for this</li>
      <li>This product is as effective as the repairs made by the dentist at 20 times less cost at minimum.  </li>
      <li>I save time,money and energy to fix my own  denture in just less than 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>When my now elderly father accidentally dropped his lower denture on the tile floor in my kitchen splitting it completely in half (2 pieces) in such a way that none of the teeth were damaged and the break itself was clean and aligned perfectly without any missing pieces, this denture repair kit was what I turned to first in an attempt to fix his prosthetic teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>have found most of the time that if I want it done right, I have to do it yourself, or at least fix it right after someone else first does it.</li>
      <li>This five-star item is highly recommended for keeping some additional cash in your – and not you dentist’s – pocket!  </li>
      <li>It works really</li>
      <li>This kit is  real garbage.</li>
      <li>Another 2 months have elapsed and the original lower denture repair has finally come apart once again.</li>
      <li>easier to use and holds a lot better than other kinds of dental repair products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another 2 months have elapsed and the original lower denture repair has finally come apart once again.</li>
      <li>clear simple instructions.......best to chill before repair...and prep plate ahead of time...make sure to clean and have 100% dry</li>
      <li>After carefully reading the directions and trying, I&#x27;m just stuck going without my dentures until my new set is available--If someone can get this to work, they&#x27;re better than I am,</li>
      <li>I know that this is for broken dentures, but I used it as a re-liner to get a better fit</li>
      <li>I was glad that I had bought a second repair kit, only to find in that kit when I opened the liquid to mix in the powder</li>
      <li>While correctly aligning the break apply steady pressure to both sides of the break for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This five-star item is highly recommended for keeping some additional cash in your – and</li>
      <li>10 min after getting back home, had to wait till the Dentist got back, ugh, took them in, he fixed them and that lasted about a month, then I used this and 7 mo later still going good.</li>
      <li>The repairs blended in really nice and the repairs are as hard as the plate itself.  </li>
      <li>how fast it sets and get busy..</li>
      <li>Ordered it for my father and he can&#x27;t live without</li>
      <li>Ten minutes after completely finished I ate a steak dinner with no trouble, and haven&#x27;t had any trouble since then about two weeks so far so good.</li>
      <li>) Ensure that the damaged denture is clean and dry and that there are no missing pieces in the area of the break</li>
      <li>this product is just for a crack, it wasn&#x27;t very clear on the info.</li>
      <li>product is more closely related to what dentists use than any other product on the market.</li>
      <li>stuck in my gums,teeth &amp; lips when first applied.was supposed to last 1 year.didn&#x27;t  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Although not required, I personally recommend waiting an additional 24 hours before first use.</li>
      <li>Although not required, I personally recommend waiting an additional 24 hours before first use.</li>
      <li>So I got them fixed by a dentist</li>
      <li>Overall, this appears to be a good temporary solution, but it&#x27;s by no means a permanent repair for broken dentures.</li>
      <li>I had my bottom denture break in half awhile ago and tried super glue</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been patching up my upper overdenture for weeks  waiting for the new one.  </li>
      <li>Next is, it only mend denture cracks which I don&#x27;t have, I have chipped tooth filling which it didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
      <li>As a denture wearer, a person must have at least one denture repair kit available.</li>
      <li>I glued it back together when it broke completely.  </li>
      <li>The product will not work on soft dentures, only acrilic.</li>
      <li>and I was only eating soft foods till I could get to the dentist.</li>
      <li>Had a piece break off of side which let plate very loose in my mouth, mixed another kit applied to both sides and held together for 5 minutes and placed in hot water for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>the denture dentist finally said the only improvement would require paying thousands of dollars for a new denture, I ordered a 6-pack of the Denture Repair Kit.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use this junk for cracks,i did and now my dentures can not be fixed \\&quot;i half to get new ones\\</li>

    <li> Great product low price am very satisfied with it</li>
    <li> In reality dentures break cos they dont fit your gums anymore, your gums shrink with the passing of time, theres no way to avoid this except to reline or replace your dentures. The average life of a denture is 7 years it seems!&lt;br /&gt;The kit is good for an emergency repair but thats all</li>
    <li> I tried three times on three different days to fix my broken upper denture. It was completely broken in half, and maybe just cannot be fixed with a kit. But, I followed all the directions, holding it still for 5+ minutes each time, then letting it \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for up to 24 hours after before sanding it down and trying it. But, all three times all it took was one small peanut and it cracked again.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it would last if I never wanted to eat solid food again, but that is not what I want. I won&#x27;t say it never works, but not for a full upper that is broken in half.</li>

    <li> took forever to be delivered. Says replaces loose tooth but how? with the direction printed its hard to mold. There&#x27;s no molder. Next is, it only mend denture cracks which I don&#x27;t have, I have chipped tooth filling which it didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this junk for cracks,i did and now my dentures can not be fixed \\&quot;i half to get new ones\\&quot; just because i put this junk on them!Do what you half to until you can get to a Dentist to get your dentures fixed,but don&#x27;t put this on them !</li>
    <li> like a guy is going to use 9 kits to repair his dentures! i had no idea what i was ordering i thought it was denture reline not repair!&lt;br /&gt;now i have 9 kits and i don&#x27;t even need 1 thanks for nothing!</li>
    <li> As a denture wearer, a person must have at least one denture repair kit available. You never know when something bad might happen to your dentures. So buying this denture repair kit will be a great way to prevent long term damages. [...]</li>
    <li> simple repair in a box...clear simple instructions.......best to chill before repair...and prep plate ahead of time...make sure to clean and have 100% dry&lt;br /&gt;I found best to dampen finger tip and smooth out after applying mixture...no need to sand smooth ...</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical at first because I read the reviews on this product. I had my bottom denture break in half awhile ago and tried super glue (stupid don&#x27;t try this ) it worked for about a month and wore off and they broke at work how embarrassing. So I got them fixed by a dentist and it cost $120.00 not cheap! Well they broke in half again due to me shaking the water off them and hitting the sink. I was going to call the dentist but found this product online and went to walgreens to buy it. You definatly need two people to do this. Follow the directions except when mixing use about forty drops. Make VERY SURE you can line them up perfectly first cause this stuff is fast! I didn&#x27;t use very much on both pieces. I used the sand paper that came with it and they cleaned up nice. Ten minutes after completely finished I ate a steak dinner with no trouble, and haven&#x27;t had any trouble since then about two weeks so far so good. Great product!</li>
    <li> It was a big weekend coming up and my husband broke a tooth from his bridge.&lt;br /&gt;It was too late for a dental appointment and have to send it out to get repaired.&lt;br /&gt;So we tried this Repair Kit.  Unfortunately it did not hold at all.  We tried it several times but it would not stick.  We had to go to a lab for emergency repair which cost $$$$. Just Murphys Law....</li>
    <li> When my now elderly father accidentally dropped his lower denture on the tile floor in my kitchen splitting it completely in half (2 pieces) in such a way that none of the teeth were damaged and the break itself was clean and aligned perfectly without any missing pieces, this denture repair kit was what I turned to first in an attempt to fix his prosthetic teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this identical kit at my local Walgreens for about $8.00 and I must say that I was very impressed with how easy it was to successfully perform the needed repair and have the aforementioned old timer once again happily eating his fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough material is provided for three repairs and the instructions are simple and to the point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Ensure that the damaged denture is clean and dry and that there are no missing pieces in the area of the break itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Empty the contents of one packet resin (pink powder) into one of the three see-through plastic mixing cups provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Add about 22 drops of the clear denture repair liquid from the tube provided (looks like a small tube of glue) to the powder in the mixing cup. You will very likely only have enough liquid for 2 and not the stated 3 repairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Using the included plastic spatula mix the powder and liquid thoroughly until a smooth creamy consistency like syrup is achieved. You can add more denture repair liquid one drop at a time, if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) With the spatula quickly place enough of this mixture to thinly coat both surfaces of the break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) While correctly aligning the break apply steady pressure to both sides of the break for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) Remove any of the now congealed pink substance that has oozed/escaped out of the break during pressure application with the spatula or other available tool (e.g., a toothpick is a handy item to have available for this purpose)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) Place the now repaired denture into “hot water” (not boiling!) for 10 minutes. This likely helps set the bond via heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9) After this the repaired denture is apparently good to go.

We waited and his lower denture is now rock solid and perfectly aligned – as good if not better than new during daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be interesting to see how long this repair lasts; I will provide an appropriate update.

This five-star item is highly recommended for keeping some additional cash in your – and not you dentist’s – pocket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 07/03/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more than 2 months have passed, the original lower denture repair described in the above review is still going strong, no problems whatsoever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 09/07/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another 2 months have elapsed and the original lower denture repair has finally come apart once again. It&#x27;s time to process another repair (still plenty of materials left in the kit) and see how long it lasts the second time around. Overall, this appears to be a good temporary solution, but it&#x27;s by no means a permanent repair for broken dentures.tly good to go.

    <li> When a tooth falls out and you need a quick repair, you cannot beat this kit!  I always keep some in stock at my house.</li>
    <li> this product is just for a crack, it wasn&#x27;t very clear on the info. really not what i expected or maybe not what I needed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this repair kit. The liquid is in a tiny small soft plastic tube.  The powder is in flimsy paper envelopes.  This kit is  real garbage. You&#x27;ll get one use out of it. DON,T WASTE  YOUR MONEY!!! I cannot say enough to warn you. This Kit is NO GOOD!!!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely a big rip off. There are other repair kits, purchase one of those. Please, don,t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that it did much good .Its OK  but wil not buy again .</li>
    <li> I started using this product a few years back, got tired of going to the dentist and having my partials &amp;#34;Adjusted&amp;#34;  only to have them only fit for a short time before having to return and have the dentist shake me down with x-rays, and every other service charge they could get out of me. Then one day I found this product and decided to see what I could do. My partials never fit so good and lasted over a year before I had to redo them. I know that this is for broken dentures, but I used it as a re-liner to get a better fit and I ended up with the best fit that I&#x27;d ever had... in fact my dentist started calling wanting to know what happened I told him and never heard back from him. So if you&#x27;re looking at this wondering if maybe... it might be something that will help you, all I can say is read the instructions start with a small amount as a practice piece  just to get the feel of it how fast it sets and get busy..</li>
    <li> Not very good too messy to use.</li>
    <li> It works really good.i thought we have to see the dentist. But this product saved lot of money. I will recommend this product</li>
    <li> I bought 2 kits, just in case, for a crack in my upper denture. I mixed one of the 3 packs of adhesive according to directions and repaired the crack, it didn&#x27;t last at all. The repair itself was cracked in about a day and I was only eating soft foods till I could get to the dentist. When I tried to repair it again with a second pack of the powder, I found the liquid to use with the powder was all gone, and I only used one pack and mixed according to the directions. I was glad that I had bought a second repair kit, only to find in that kit when I opened the liquid to mix in the powder it was completely empty! So I was left with all this powder and no liquid stuff to mix in it. Complete waste of money. I&#x27;ll never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Broke my partial for about the 5th time.  Always used &amp;#34;super glue&amp;#34; to repair until I could get back to the dentist.  Here I am 1600 miles from home and it happens again.  I decided to try something different- found this kit at Walmart for less than 4 bucks.  The repair was flawless and it&#x27;s been 48 hours without any issues.  This product is as effective as the repairs made by the dentist at 20 times less cost at minimum.  IF you follow the instructions to the letter- you will be successful.</li>
    <li> easier to use and holds a lot better than other kinds of dental repair products.</li>
    <li> Barely does the job, not permanent and too expensive for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> 1st, my upper plate had a crack on the side and ran under several teeth. Mixed a kit exactly as per directions worked perfect. Had a piece break off of side which let plate very loose in my mouth, mixed another kit applied to both sides and held together for 5 minutes and placed in hot water for 10 minutes. Sanded smooth, worked perfect. Next, lost a broken piece and molded a piece as the kit hardened then placed it into the space that I lost the piece from. Held my repair piece in place for 5 minutes placed in hot water for 10 minutes sanded and it worked. The repairs blended in really nice and the repairs are as hard as the plate itself.  This stuff will work if DIRECTIONS ARE FOLLOWED EXACTLY. I&#x27;ve eaten everything from apples to peanuts. The product will not work on soft dentures, only acrilic.</li>
    <li> The first attempt at using this product to re-fix a denture tooth failed as the tooth became loose maybe 20 minutes after the denture was placed in mouth.  Second attempt seems to have worked, re-fixed yesterday, denture in mouth all day and again half this morning and no problem.</li>
    <li> Works well in every way. Ordered it for my father and he can&#x27;t live without it ans the price was very good also.</li>
    <li> If you have a crack or any imperfection in your denture this stuff will fix it easily.  I love this product it saved me hundreds of dollars</li>
    <li> stuck in my gums,teeth &amp; lips when first applied.was supposed to last 1 year.didn&#x27;t  last .would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So far this material is working just fine.  Prompt delievery</li>
    <li> Great quick temporary fix.  Easy to use</li>
    <li> I got my snap-in dentures nine years ago, and they always tended to rock (teeter-totter) about one or more of the support clips, even with just pressing my tongue on different teeth of the denture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the denture dentist finally said the only improvement would require paying thousands of dollars for a new denture, I ordered a 6-pack of the Denture Repair Kit.  The end result is that I was able to make the dentures sit in place better than ever, and at a material cost of less than $4.  Wish I had bought this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found most of the time that if I want it done right, I have to do it yourself, or at least fix it right after someone else first does it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get the job done :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been patching up my upper overdenture for weeks  waiting for the new one.  I glued it back together when it broke completely.  The fix works for a couple of weeks and then I have to do it again.  I would be lost without this stuff.</li>
    <li> purchased for someone. they were very pleased</li>
    <li> My dentures cracked last spring, dentist was on vac., someone there &amp;#34;fixed them&amp;#34; only to have them crack again 10 min after getting back home, had to wait till the Dentist got back, ugh, took them in, he fixed them and that lasted about a month, then I used this and 7 mo later still going good. I found putting the liquid in the freezer for the 1/2 hr works great.</li>
