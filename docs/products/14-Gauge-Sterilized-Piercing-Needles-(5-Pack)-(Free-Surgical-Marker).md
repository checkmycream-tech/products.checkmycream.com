    <li> Exactly what I was looking for in needles.  Clean, sterile sharp and a surgical marker.  It also came with a couple of sterilizing pads for the ear.  Can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>

    <li> These needles were fantastic! good price, quick shipping (product arrived in 2-3 days), new packaging. I used them to pierce my double lobe and left cartilage about a month ago and they turned out really well. As a first time self-piercer I was apprehensive about needles but these came individually wrapped in their own sterile package with plastic tips for safety. The marker was nice too to mark the hole. These needles are very sharp so they slid right through and made my piercing experience easy and mostly painless. They cut through like butter which is exactly what you want, it&#x27;s over so quickly. I highly highly highly recommend these needles to anyone thinking about piercing themselves or a friend - they are sterile and effective!! I would definitely buy again</li>

    <li> They are nice and sharp and each can in an individual steril packaging. They also came very quickly. I was pleased.</li>
