      <li>but they come in handy.  </li>

      <li>and I can do my own</li>
      <li>I purchased this product to do my own nails.  </li>
      <li>It over heats real quick and doesnt work good.</li>
      <li>Its speed is fast which I love and the perfect size for my hands because I have issues with them as well.</li>
      <li>Worked great in the beginning but broke fast!!</li>

      <li>love it still own it til</li>
      <li>Easy to use!</li>
      <li>When I first got this drill, I was extremely happy.</li>
      <li>This drill is very cheap made, it doesn&#x27;t spin correctly, keeps stopping.</li>
      <li>great product, saves time for at home manicures, compact, may need more instruction for the first time user.</li>
      <li>This product was actually nice, but it overheats easily and will automatically shut off.</li>
      <li>Injust wish it would comemeith a bit more files</li>
      <li>Glad I decided to order this.</li>
      <li>i got this for myself since i enjoy doing my own nails and</li>
      <li>i like the color its my favorite,</li>
      <li>I love this file.</li>
      <li>I will be shopping more of these machines.</li>
      <li>BUT...the attachments don&#x27;t fit!</li>
      <li>Hope I didn&#x27;t confuse anyone more...</li>
      <li>I have really enjoyed this product.</li>
      <li>then you push in the silver button below that; then you unscrew the silver top and take the part that is inside of</li>
      <li>You unscrew the thing that is just under the silver top part</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m glad I was able to purchase this&#x27;</li>
      <li>I wasnt sure how to put a bit in and</li>
      <li>but I would so reccomend this , the color is just so cute too</li>
      <li>I went to nail school many years ago when no one used drills.</li>
      <li>This has made my nail care a breeze, love it.</li>
      <li>Its cheap for a reason...its garbage!</li>
      <li>It gets the job done... better than filing.</li>
      <li>in the profession of beauty, every now and then I have a client that wants to try something by herself at home, like doing their own nails, I do tell them the precautions of doing their own nails and to do at their own risk.</li>
      <li>so it is ok.</li>
      <li>I was able to get through about seven of my nails before it started to overheat and shut off.</li>

      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good buy, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for like super professional use because there&#x27;s a lot nicer ones out there, but if you&#x27;re doing your own acrylic nails and whatever it&#x27;s nice to have instead of using a file!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This drill does not work!! As soon as I started to file down my acrylics, it overheated and turned off!!! So disappointed. Also, the plug that went into the drill was defected and in order for the machine to run I had to move the cord around. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> Horrible product, do not buy. I used it twice and it stopped working</li>
    <li> Switch broke after one week</li>
    <li> Works awesome I absolutely love it, I do my own nails and they look fantastic. Sometimes its hard to get the bit out tho.</li>
    <li> It was not a very expensive item, however was not worth what I paid for it. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I at first *thought* I had the problem some other people had with the part not fitting but there is a trick to it (read the instructions). It works decent for the price and I have ridiculously thick toenails that it just works instantly on. I would recommend it for personal use. I am not a professional so I can&#x27;t say about cosmetology purposes.</li>
    <li> I received my item in a matter of days...the downfall is that the attachments do not fit. Not one of the attachments are made to work with the drill they were packaged with. I am a little upset about this because a buyer expect to receive an item in proper working conditions along with its proper attachments when it arrive, vs having to return and/or receive the correct components at a later date...other than the fact that I can&#x27;t use this item at all due to incorrect attachments, the delivery time was speedy.</li>
    <li> I love this file. As soon as I received it, I used it. Works great. Just as good as the drills at the Nail Salons. I would recommend this item to any one who does their nails them self.</li>
    <li> I SPENT ABOUT 15 MINUTES TRYING TO \\&quot;SAND DOWN\\&quot; THE ACRYLIC ON ONE OF MY NAILS AND THEN THIS QUIT WORKING BECAUSE IT HAD OVERHEATED AND BURNED OUT - IF YOU WANT A MACHINE TO USE ON ACRYLIC NAIL BUY A HEAVIER DUTY THAT ROTATES FASTER -</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter as she&#x27;s just starting out in nail designs she liked the look of the drill so I purchased it. Lets just say she had a week and half worth of use out of it before its motor burned out and the sellers return policy is complete and utter crap. Never Again! Dont buy this drill.</li>
    <li> Not one of the attachments fit into the head of the drill. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item. Very aggrivated that I have to send it back.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS, if you are trying to get gel or acrylic nails off it does not take it off, i spent 15 minutes on 1 nail and it over heated and stopped working before i could even get all of the gel off!!! BAD!! Please don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It was made cheaply,so it didn&#x27;t last long,but when it did, it worked great.</li>
    <li> As women we all know how pricey it can be for manis and pedi, if you are ready to do it yoirself but are still u nsure this is t he filing system for you!!!!</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this product. I used it  for my acrylic nails and now on my gel nails.  It is a good deal for the price.  Very well packaged.</li>
    <li> This product was actually nice, but it overheats easily and will automatically shut off. I originally bought this to help remove gel overlay polish I had on my nails, but it still was a long process even with the electric nail file. For the price, I guess it did ok but I wish I would&#x27;ve spent more on a better product. Everything that came with the drill fit pretty well into the dremmel, you just need to adjust it. I probably only use this product about once every couple months, but I probably would&#x27;ve been more likely to use it more if it was a better product.</li>
    <li> When I first received it and plugged it to the outlet and turnd the drill on it worked great! But with uses it began to slow its speed down an then would just turn off? Other than that the results are good.</li>
    <li> Now it&#x27;s easy to have your very own nail salon at home with this handy tool.  It works great and is easy to use.  The instructions are simple to follow.</li>
    <li> I like it for this price ( $15 ) but will not give more, the visit to salon is more expensive , it have good speed also and is small , however I am not so impressed with the drills , they looks like will not last long and after one usage I see already not so sharp anymore , I will have to order better one and use with this machine . for this price , go for it if you use personal , as it is not professional tool .</li>
    <li> Bought this product online, since I can&#x27;t find it anywhere near my home.  It worked well for a few weeks and then the casing started to crack and fall apart....the material seems inferior.  I like how it works and will attempt to get another on, maybe another maker at a later date.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend this machine for anyone that needs to use it without making an additional purchase. None of the attachments fit the machine which makes it completely useless....sending it back.</li>
    <li> Good customer service, although my item was not correct i had no problem fixing the ordeal. I can&#x27;t say i would recomend the item because mine was unworkable, however; if anything you have a problem with occurs their fast, helpful customer service will help you along the way</li>
    <li> I recently put a bad review on this product, but after receiving a video on how to use it, I must correct myself.  They worked very hard to satisfy me.  Once I received the video and I understood how to properly use it, I became very satisifed with the product.  It works great!!!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews where more than one person said don&#x27;t buy it bc the attachments don\\&quot;t fit.  Bought it anyway and guess what...THE ATTACHMENTS DON&#x27;T FITG.  What kind of mess is this?  Why would they put together items that don&#x27;t match  Why wouldn&#x27;t they test it first.  uugghh!  I was so excited.</li>
    <li> This has made my nail care a breeze, love it. Affordable and functional.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon seriously remove the word count review on products, it makes one not want to review and so many items deserve a nice review</li>
    <li> Bought this drill hoping to start doing my nails at home and as soon as I got it tried putting it on. NEVER worked! The instructions (if u call it that) were vague and not helpful at all!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says! It&#x27;s a great but because these things  are usually 100$! So I&#x27;m glad I was able to purchase this&#x27;</li>
    <li> At first.. I thought the attachments didn&#x27;t work either but after messing with it for a while I figured it out.  You unscrew the thing that is just under the silver top part then you push in the silver button below that; then you unscrew the silver top and take the part that is inside of it push it more to the inside of the silver top while doing that insert the attachment in there and screw it all back in. Hope I didn&#x27;t confuse anyone more...now all I have to figure out is what attachments are used for what.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly..excited about getting it...BUT...the attachments don&#x27;t fit! Would be nice if they would send the correct size attachments but NO...have to return for a refund only...which is so aggravating. Now I have to look for another one or do I take a chance and order again hoping they send the correct size bits...I THINK NOT!!</li>
    <li> the worst no instructions pieces dont fit gotta jump thru hoops to return and get money back a total waste of my time n money</li>
    <li> Recieved my drill today and I haven&#x27;t used it yet but checked it out and it works! All of my bits fit, it came with instructions and also came in the detailed box! So far so good after I use it I will update my review the only thing was it shows that it came with nail nippers and I didn&#x27;t recieve any but that&#x27;s really not an issue for me UPDATE:It didn&#x27;t work well with acrylic nails tried for 20 min nothing happend works good for natural nails</li>
    <li> Great product and price.</li>
    <li> love it still own it til this days thanks guys you are amazing the best  thank you all so much</li>
    <li> ac adapter broke though</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s cheap and didn&#x27;t even work. waste of money. it only worked when it was plugged in which defeats te purpose of being \\&quot;portable\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I finally got my drill. I wasnt sure how to put a bit in and the instructions made me confused and I was frustrated but then I some how I finally figured it out. Im not sure on how exactly how to use this seeing as how I am a newbie but its great for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> When I first got this drill, I was extremely happy. It worked exactly how I expected. I rated this so low because it stopped working after about 3 uses.</li>
    <li> the bad news is the bits don&#x27;t fit, it&#x27;s very poorly constructed internally (i checked) and it&#x27;s a very thin plastic. On top of that,the on/off switch came unscrewed the second time I turned it on to test it.&lt;br /&gt;the good news is the bits are nice bits, which fit my old drill, so if you got it, the bits are pretty standard, and may fit most other drills.</li>
    <li> the bits did not lock in to the drill unable to use this item! useless,  i threw the box away and am unable to get a refund, i was so disapointed.</li>
    <li> It was only 10 bucks. So if I get 10 uses out of it I&#x27;ll be happy.  would I tell other people about this product? Yes, I&#x27;d tell the its cheaply made and it will stop working shortly after you start using it.</li>
    <li> it broke within a 2 weeks and they wouldnt replace it so purchased a whole new one.. i wish it was a little more stronger in power when i go to put more pressure on the nail im drilling it slows down a little .</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product!  In most cases you get what you pay for but this time I feel I received a decent product for a great price!  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t even get to use the thing and it broke&lt;br /&gt;the power cord wasn&#x27;t functioning at all this was a rip off..</li>
    <li> I have asked twice for instructions and have had no reply.  I have absolutely no idea what to do with this machine.  I certainly don&#x27;t want to carve, engrave, rout, grind, sharpen, sand or drill my nails!!!!!!!!!!!  I would appreciate some info</li>
    <li> Worked great in the beginning but broke fast!!</li>
    <li> Injust wish it would comemeith a bit more files but I would so reccomend this , the color is just so cute too</li>
    <li> we didn´t know how to use it. had to find on internet a video which showed the purpose af all the items that come with the drill Difficult to adjust the appliances but I guess it is becuase we don´t know how to use it properly-</li>
    <li> I bought this item and I was excited since I always look at the reviews, I gave it a chance and to my surprise it didn&#x27;t work!! i opened the box and figured out how to assemble the drills since there were no directions in the box. After that I plugged it in and smoke came out of the power box! It&#x27;s unsafe I was scared it mite explode because it was burning hot. Not to mention the drill never actually worked.  I spend like $20 for nothing! I&#x27;m very dissapointed in Amazon allowing this seller to continue selling un safe products that do not work.  please don&#x27;t buy this item or from this seller  MelodySusie Nail Art!!!! I don&#x27;t and will NEVER rebuy or recommend this To anyone!!!! Save yourself a headache....</li>
    <li> this is an overall good product but i thought it only had to be plugged into the wall to charge not to work, it comes with a few different heads to file with at different grits, i use it on myself and my cat works great and is quieter than i have seen others</li>
    <li> in the profession of beauty, every now and then I have a client that wants to try something by herself at home, like doing their own nails, I do tell them the precautions of doing their own nails and to do at their own risk. This little electric file is very user-friendly, will do the trick if people ask me the how-to&#x27;s,  its also got just enough punch for a beginner who hasn&#x27;t never touched one of these, and also its a good product for me, because its affordable to use, and its nice that I can tell them a few things without giving it all away, they know to come back when they need me to do some real professional work.</li>
    <li> Very nice gift, she loved it and if she gets tired of it didn&#x27;t spend to much money for it.</li>
    <li> junk dont buy ya its crap dont get it under powered and you can get same thing form harbor freight for alot less even free sometimes</li>
    <li> I have used it 6x since I got it in the mail and I love it.Its speed is fast which I love and the perfect size for my hands because I have issues with them as well.I personally would purchase another one from the same seller as a back up</li>
    <li> I knew it probably wasn&#x27;t great, but took a chance. It worked ok, but just didn&#x27;t have the power I needed to remove glitter nails.</li>
    <li> The first drill I received was defective but the second drill is great. Thanks</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this and when I finally got the thing to work it was ok. I still have trouble getting the ends changed to file with. Not real clear directions. Pretty trial and error. One issue was the plug in, into the outlet. I had to bend the prongs and still fits weird for some reason. Wished it was easier to change the bits!!! Also the cord is not long enough to sit on the floor and do my toenails.&lt;br /&gt;I do however like the size and how it fits my hand.</li>
    <li> I am very inpressed with it and for price it was evern better also It came fast ! ! !</li>
    <li> I ordered this and waited for a month for it to actually come in. Right when I opened it, it broke. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> YA TENGO EL ARTICULO EN MIS MANOS Y ME LLEGO EN EL TIEMPO ESTIPULADO, ESPERO QUE SEA DE TODO MI GUSTO CUANDO LO COMIENCE A USAR EN CASA.</li>
    <li> Loved this! But be careful!!!! If it&#x27;s too high it will burn your nail bed!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love that it is pink but works just was well as a more &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; tool.  I think it might even work for filing my dog&#x27;s nails too.</li>
    <li> The item broke after only one use!  I just decided to go back to the salon instead of doing my nails myself.</li>
    <li> This product is a total piece of crap, i bought it and it never came on. Please people do not buy this pc of junk,look for something that is commercial.</li>
    <li> Please stop sending this its stops working after 5 min</li>
    <li> I used this drill three times and now it won&#x27;t even turn on. Also the attachments didnt fit very well you had to like force them into the drill so you could use them</li>
    <li> this product is NOT GOOD At All Am So Mad I Had To Wait A Month For The Nail Drill Came For Nothing This STUPID drill Dosent WORK I Bearly Use It For Only 20 Min And It OVERHEATED AND BURNED..!! }:( But The Way In The Picture Shows That Comes With Sanding Bits But It Dose Not Am So Disappointed ...!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister in Vietnam and she replied to me that she cannot use it with 220V as the product featured !!? Finally, it&#x27;s broken. Do I waste money?</li>
    <li> SHIPPED ON TIME original packaging .. works just like the professional one used in the salon so far so good . Dont like that i had to order two in order to make a purchase . that why they lost two stars and i would not purchase again with the limit per purchase again</li>
    <li> This electric nail file/shaper is basically an adjustable low power dremel tool.  It is very good for sanding and shaping nails and smoothing cuticles but it is very easy to damage your nails with this tool.  It takes a steady hand to use this tool.</li>
    <li> I bought this a year ago and was super excited to use it on my acrylics.....At first it worked womderful, until the motor went out:(  for natural nail this is perfect NOT for acrylics or gels.</li>
    <li> This item sucks!!!!! i was changing the bit and it just stop working,if you ever need to buy a nail drill never get this one.This is the worst drill i have ever bought</li>
    <li> Great, light-weight nail tool! Works perfectly for home use. Gets a little warm after prolonged usage but didn&#x27;t seem to be a big problem.</li>
    <li> Never adjusted properly to fit the drill bits. No matter what I did it never worked properly and was only able to get one in and not the one I bought the drill for.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and never worked for a sec I hated this product! even tho I loved the color</li>
    <li> its okay just not what expected</li>
    <li> Ok, I should have listened to the reviews but the price was right w/prime shipping.  The drill stalls out when used on a low/med speed. Most of the negative reviews dealt with a lack of power.  However, I was looking for a drill to use on low speed ...it failed.</li>
    <li> It does not work very well. I am still trying to figure it out. I did not get instructions and am not very mechanical. It doesn&#x27;t work in any way that In can see to use it. Does not engage the bits. They turn feebly.</li>
    <li> Had some issues with the speed control</li>
    <li> I went to nail school many years ago when no one used drills. I recently decided that I wanted to go back into the Nail Industry but before I can I have to learn how to use a drill. This has been Great! Easy to use! Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Recieved it in one day and it was only $12. When I first turned it on it wouldn&#x27;t work they I figured out you have to have it locked (for safety reasons) in order for it to work.</li>
    <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.</li>
    <li> Just got my drill yesterday and it didn&#x27;t work, and had no instructions on how to use it....it a receipt to return it.....I am so disappointed</li>
    <li> Ok product for the price but after using it on onlytwo nails started to slow and overheat. Had to let it cool off before i could try finishing the rest.</li>
    <li> it is not as powerful as I anticipated but helps removed gel polish easier and quicker so it is ok.</li>
    <li> I should of listened to the reveiws. It over heats real quick and doesnt work good. The tip where you change the bits broke within the first week of me buying it. Your better off going to walmart or sallys to get something thats worth your money</li>
    <li> This drill is very cheap made, it doesn&#x27;t spin correctly, keeps stopping. The button at the top came off almost instantly the first time I used it. I was so excited about getting my own nail acrylic drill, however was very disappointed after I received it and started using it. This drill is not worth your money</li>
    <li> I got his in November and only used a few times. It will not power on anymore. Sucks I waisted my money</li>
    <li> it broke the 2nd time i used it it come apart in lot of pieces, would not recommend it, sorry i had to be honest.</li>
    <li> upon receiving it i assembled it and after filing 2 fingernails it stopped working. i returned it immediately, i do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> when i received this product, i was excited until it went out within SECONDS of using it....sent it back and it was returned to me....the exact one i sent out, though everything was out of the boxes and some pieces were missing...when i repacked it, i put everything exactly the way it was sent the first time....all i have to say now is it is garbage and i will watch for any product i buy that says BELAIR CORP or VOGUE PROFESSIONAL... i dont write out reviews unless i am very satisfied or super dissatisfied...so take heed people...not a good company (s)</li>
    <li> Great for doing my nails and working on my Ooak dolls.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish we could get this price here .</li>
    <li> This is a small very light weight tool. As a professional groomer with arthritis, this file does the trick.Easy to use and it does what I ask it to do</li>
    <li> Was not at all what I expected it to be. The settings on low do not work. I&#x27;m sorry but it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
    <li> I love the way it worked but now One of the bottom on the drill came off and broke and is only been a mouth</li>
    <li> I got it in the mail the day before my wedding extremely excited and ready to finish my nails last minute i open it up completely surprised that it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
    <li> Never again. The wire broke so, I COULD&#x27; use it ay more!</li>
    <li> It was cheap ass hell it broke in a week on me</li>
    <li> The buffer tips don&#x27;t fit properly on the drill, and the drill frequently shuts off when being used...don&#x27;t waste your money or time.</li>
    <li> This is my first nail drill, and I can tell it&#x27;s not the best. I try to be careful with it because I&#x27;m afraid it will break easily. But for at home use it gets the job done and works, and for its cheap price it&#x27;s definitely worth the money. Also, it is very easy to use and the drill bits are not as hard to change as it seems, they DO fit even if they seem like they don&#x27;t at first. I watched a tutorial about it on YouTube and after watching that I had no trouble at all.</li>
    <li> i ordered this drill about 4 months ago and when i first got it i loved it, it worked perfectly fine for like the first two months on the acrylic nails ive done. but ab out 2 months ago the drill bits would come out in the middle of me filing/ shaping my nails, this would happen constantly but it was tolerable tho irritating. I ignored it for a while but then about a week ago the cord started to have a shortage and its not from anything that i have done to it so idk what is wrong, i just know that i have to buy a new ac cord but idk from where?</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit with drill please don&#x27;t give money for this item it is not fit to drill. It is just trashy item don&#x27;t spend money for that piece of .......</li>
    <li> This drill isn&#x27;t professional its a cheap piece of junk...don&#x27;t waste your money on it ! VERY unhappy with it.</li>
    <li> This a real waste of money and time.  It only worked for a few minutes on the day that I got it.</li>
    <li> Waited forever for product to arrive.  Got it, plugged it in...and nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Product didn&#x27;t work.  Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> This is the best drill I have ever used.  It is very sturdy and gets the job done!  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> does what it is supposed to do, but there are issues. such as overheating, and the accessories do not lock securly when the device is in use.</li>
    <li> By far not a high quality. You can feel it getting really hot after just a few seconds of use, but for the price,  if you are using this item to do your own acrylics at home, its a good buy!!</li>
    <li> AMAZON HAS MADE IT ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTACT SELLER OR REPLY TO THIS SELLER WHO HAS OFFERED ME A REFUND ...HOW DO I GET THE REFUND????  NO MATTER HOW I TRY,  IT WILL  N O T  SECURE ANY OF THE BITS..THEY JUST FALL OUT..SO THE ITEM IS OF ABSOLUTELY NO USE  THE LITTLE CHEAP BUTTON YOU CAN PUSH DOES NOTHING TO HELP SECURE BIT..IT IS USELESS</li>
    <li> I had this drill for about a week. The cord didn&#x27;t fit right in the outlet and then the prongs broke off the adaptor. Recieved the product quickly but I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> todo bien gracias, rápido, excelente, vendedor buena la oferta espero volver a  comprales otra ves  sin mas nada que decir.</li>
    <li> This rotary drill is meant got nails and is very rough. The speed setting would not stay on. When at its highest I would lose a nail. At its lowest setting it would shut off in me, over and over again. Not worth the money I paid. Even the directions were hard to understand how to use it. Very very CHEAP!</li>
    <li> Was only used a couple times, now doesn&#x27;t want to run at all. Very disappointing. Bought it as a surprise for my daughter who does nails for her family and friends.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> I received the electric nail drill as advertised and it works great until it over heats. I was able to get through about seven of my nails before it started to overheat and shut off. I  continually had to turn it off and on again to get it to restart or turn it off to cool completely. It works as it should other than that.</li>
    <li> With in five days of have the item the speed control started to short out.  It would slow down without touching it.  the item worked good until the short.  I believe I am going to try with another like this because at times it could just be a flauk</li>
    <li> Well worth it. Exactly what I always wanted. Glad I decided to order this. I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> 2 MONTHS AGO..GOT THIS..BAD PRODUCT ...HATE IT..WASTED MY MONEY ON THISM..NEVER AGAIN..i cant bealive this still on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Take this drill out of order..</li>
    <li> Got this for my 17 year old she does nail what a great price and she loves it helps her go faster on nails love amazon</li>
    <li> great for a non profesional manicurist, I love this product because I can remove my gell in nails at home and I can do my own manicure.&lt;br /&gt;great products</li>
    <li> The price is undeniable, I bought it as a last minute find and could not be happier! It came with a whole case full of different attachments... Quality product that works like a salon style in comparison to $100-$200!! A MUST BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> After just a few min the motor slows all the way down until it finally just stops....and after a few times using it it does it everytime I use it now..</li>
    <li> when I got my drill set it wasn&#x27;t exactly what  was expecting.  I guess for $11 what should I expect?  In honesty, I think the nippers that were sent as a free gift were of better quality than the drill set.....it didn&#x27;t even come with instructions!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read on a lot of other reviews that the attachments don&#x27;t fit- not true. You just have to completely remove the little grommet, insert the attachment, and then tighten the grommet down. They DO fit, trust me. I did my nails with this tool &amp; its pretty good for filing down rough acrylic. It&#x27;s not the most powerful thing I&#x27;ve used, but it makes filing down fresh acrylics go a LOT faster.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product for the money. It does get warm too fast and you have to let it cool off before you can continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!!! Box fell apart after removing from tightly wrapped package and it is so cheaply made it&#x27;s not funny! You don&#x27;t save any money, you lose!! Missing wrench it says to use to insert bits and the it doesn&#x27;t even turn on anyway!!!!!!! they have a good looking knock off here...too bad they couldn&#x27;t make it work like the real one!!!</li>
    <li> excellent and timely service!!</li>
    <li> This is totally a bummer I was really looking forward to this product. It cannot be used due to the wrong size drill bits sent. UGH!! not cool.</li>
    <li> This product was absolutely a disappointment. It quit working right after I turned it on. I did not even get one nail finished. DO NOT BUY!!</li>
    <li> I like this machine, however, it tends to over heat a lot so it will stop working then after a minute it will work again.</li>
    <li> I got this (someone bought it off my wishlist, and I threw the box away, my MISTAKE!) This thing hasn&#x27;t turned on since I got it. Not once. I dont even know what the thing sounds like. Now I&#x27;m completely pissed, never got to use a supposedly brand new product. And my friend spent 10$ for nothing. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> it took about a week to get to me, but its true to its picture it comes with everything but when i pluged it in it ran good until I started using it on my actual nail it just would stop about every 30 seconds and i would have to turn it off then back on again for it to start but it won&#x27;t run steady for more then 30 seconds without turning off!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;expect low quality merchandise!</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted!  Excellant price too!  It sands down the thick nails and gets them ready for the polish!</li>
    <li> i got this for myself since i enjoy doing my own nails and my friends nails...works great for pedicures also.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job. It has a couple blips every once and a while, but nothing major and it works pretty well for the amount I paid.</li>
    <li> hi their the little silver button arrived broken the one that makes the top of the machine spin was missing</li>
    <li> It works good. It came in the mail fast. Thanks I don;t have that much to say. You should only have to write what you want and not th amount of words.</li>
    <li> Its cheap for a reason...its garbage! I purchased it because of course I thought it was a good buy. Its not even worth the 12-13 bucks! This thing over heats, the speed setting changes on its own and it goes out! People, plz save your money...2 dead flies are worth more than this crap!</li>
    <li> I havent been able to use the drill because the bites that were included do not fit into the unit !! I&#x27;ve tried everything including trying to pull this unit apart to get the bites to work.. NOTHING!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have a drill I can&#x27;t use because the parts sold with it doesn&#x27;t work with it.. very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> IT QUIT WORKING AFTER USING IT ON THE FIRST NAIL THE SPEED CONTROL DID NOT WORK.  IT STAYED ON HIGH SPEED I COULD NOT CONTROL IT. I TURNED IT OFF, THINKING IT MIGHT RESET.. IT WOULD NOT COME BACK ON.</li>
    <li> dont work good went get little hot  stop working  is not agood intem  need to get money back  to people</li>
    <li> never worked! I got it and it never turned on, no matter what I do it is stupid! Not worth it!</li>
    <li> it did not work  would like my money back !!!!</li>
    <li> I like this, but I don&#x27;t know how to switch them.  There were no instructions on how to remove the file.</li>
    <li> Secon time i was Going to use it and was not working 😔</li>
    <li> This tool I still use - just I had to put tape around a week after I had it due to the shell coming apart - the vibrations inside are very &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It gets the job done... better than filing.</li>
    <li> Excelente, la entrega sin ningún inconveniente igual el producto en perfectas condiciones se recomienda satisfactoriamente un producto a buen precio</li>
    <li> I went to go use my new nail drill today, I was really excited because I just to use it and I go to change the drill bits... They didn&#x27;t fit it the nail drill. At first I thought I was just doing something wrong, but there&#x27;s only so many ways you can do something! The drill bits did not fit so now I have to either but more drill bits for it, or buy a whole new drill. I would help A LOT if there were instructions in the box.</li>
    <li> I think this will work for what I need it for. I really won&#x27;t know the value of this purchase until I use it for awhile. I certainly will let you know if other wise. Thank you for the speedy service.</li>
    <li> IT BROKE SOON AS I USEED IT FIRST TIME ITS CHEAP AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMED IT TO ANYONE HUH</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t get it together in order to use it.  Worthless....  NOT ALL THE PIECES ARE INCLUDED.&lt;br /&gt;NOT A GOOD BUY</li>
    <li> This is a product worth buying.... Works very good and quick just like the professional use. Glad this is small enough to store and not a lot to maintain.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my niece and it thrilled her to pieces! She said it is light weight and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Once I figured it out it worked pretty good, if you put too much pressure on the nail it&#x27;ll stop spinning thats the only problem. But for the price It&#x27;s a good buy, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for like super professional use because there&#x27;s a lot nicer ones out there, but if you&#x27;re doing your own acrylic nails and whatever it&#x27;s nice to have instead of using a file!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I saw this in my mailbox I instantly ran inside to try it out... it worked awesomely for about oh I don&#x27;t know 45 seconds then turned its self off, come to find out, after my electrical engineer of a husband took it apart to see what was wrong, the only any fuse inside of the drill had burned out! He is now working on it to rig it somehow so I can still use it until I can get the new one I ordered from another seller.... so please don&#x27;t buy this product it is not worth crap, and when you contact this seller to see about replacing or a refund for this piece of junk they give you the run around!</li>
    <li> Love this product, wether you starting out or a profesional, this Is the tool for you and the price Is wonderful</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but no great quality</li>
    <li> Never worked really.  Cheap and not very useful</li>
    <li> The motor is so weak that you can stop it with your fingers. I don&#x27;t know if they are all just as a bad or not but even the bearing seems defective on this one. While spinning the unit would throw itself out of balance gyrating the whole buffer.</li>
    <li> after reading all the reviews i decided to take a chance. the drills work but i was trying it out and it got soo hot in a minnute i decided to turn it off  because i dint want to burn the motor. its cheap but its better to buy an expensive obe that will work for a long time.</li>
    <li> my wife have a Saloon and after she used all the other girls want one like that, so probably will buy more, good product</li>
    <li> This drill is cheap. I&#x27;ve had it for months now and still cannot get it to work. I do not recommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> it works awesome the drill does what i need it to. the different speeds are what i needed. plus the plug is long enough</li>
    <li> it was shipped fast, and it was package right and was the product they said it was..love it! i cant complain</li>
    <li> Well......okay for the price. i would not buy that type again. you get what you pay for. I had to watch video to operate.</li>
    <li> the product is awesome!! it is completely worth the price the only con i would say about this product is that it gets hot VERY VERY quickly and when it gets hot i have to turn it off and let it cool, so i have to literally work on 2 nails at a time instead of all ten in order to allow the drill to cool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to say to equal 20 words. I think clicking the 5th star should&#x27;ve done it because there&#x27;s really nothing to say except I got what I expected and it works just as I expected.</li>
    <li> yesssss now i can star to do my nails yesssss thak you very much, the machine runs good i like the color its my favorite, im  need buy some more things i hope in very short time i doit thanks my machine is on time</li>
    <li> Thank you Great Price for the item and the product its amazing. I will be shopping more of these machines.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to save time filing my artificial nails but it only caused frustration.  It just doesn&#x27;t have the RPMs to do a decent filing job in a timely manner.  It over heats quickly too.</li>
    <li> had to send it back didn&#x27;t work wrong things were sent out with it so it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Equivalent to a Dremel tool. I would never use it one ANYONE&#x27;S nails. I am very surprised at your false advertisement your pictures are NOT what you get. I think from now on I will go some where else. Amazon kinda sucks.</li>
    <li> Works for what I use it for.</li>
    <li> Like said in previous posts, a couple of the nail bits do not fit the drill and I have used it twice now and the other drill bits do not fit tightly anymore because the clamp is already worn out,so it&#x27;s completely useless. Do not buy this drill!</li>
    <li> I am so upset that i didnt read the so true reviews but im pissed and im reading reviews from 2011 and its 2013 and this bull crap company is still selling this items. Something has to be done.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. only problem i have is that it take a little longer to file acrylic nails to perfection. But it do get the job done. I want to try this on uv gel tips</li>
    <li> Item broke after just a couple of uses. The little silver button that you press to release and change the tips is not well made and broke so it no longer holds the tips in place. Do not recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> Was happy when I received this drill but after a week it seem like there was a shortage in the cord, the drill kept shutting off when it was turned on I nevered used it on my clients... Very poor product.</li>
    <li> first time use it ran for literally five minutes than motor burnt out such a waste of money</li>
    <li> Purchase this for my daughter who had one before but got broken. Great tool to do her nails at home. It came fast in the mail.</li>
    <li> This is so bad. It was shaking when I used it. Disappointing !!!! I think everyone never buy it. Because it really bad. That&#x27;s cheaper but quality is very bad.</li>
    <li> The drill never worked and I couldn&#x27;t get a refund either.</li>
    <li> Works great!!!  Very handy item.</li>
    <li> Thank for the  very fast delievery. The nail manicure electric drill is just what I wanted,, it Very nice. Was brand new! I will try it out in a week are two.  Thanks</li>
    <li> The nails art professional manicure nail drill is a great little tool and work very well for home user, I think you will be happy with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to do my own nails.  It&#x27;s cheaply made, but it get&#x27;s the job done.  The extra attachments I won&#x27;t use, but they come in handy.  Having the extra filing attachment is critical and needed.  At times the unit grinds or strains a bit when operating.  It gets a little hot, so be careful.  Over all.. not to fancy, but it get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
    <li> Received in time for Christmas and was able to have a great time with my daughters and their friends at Spa Days.  Very user friendly item.  Will recommend to any nail professional....</li>
    <li> Ok that drill came quickly the first one I received the bits didn&#x27;t fit but I thought maybe I was doing something wrong but I misplaced it and decided to order another and low and behold the second was the exact same way, so no now I have to drills that work but the bits don&#x27;t fit, like really why sell pieces that wont fit....waste of my time now I have to go the salon and pay money to have someone else do my nails something I don&#x27;t want. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY......DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
    <li> great product, saves time for at home manicures, compact, may need more instruction for the first time user. like it.</li>
    <li> Just loved the item, and it was just as the pictured stated, therefore i&#x27;m happy with my purchase, oh joy.</li>
    <li> I just recieced my electric drill and it never turned on grrr it really pisses me off that now I got to deal with the return don&#x27;t get this its made from china and it looks realy cheap anyways</li>
</ol>
