      <li>The Barbe double edge/straight razor is the best of both worlds!!!</li>

      <li>Though, the aggressive end is not really necessary, with this razor and both its ends I got one of the best shaves of my life.</li>

      <li>This razor should cost much more.</li>

      <li>I recommend it to my co workers that wet shave and my best friend.</li>
      <li>This razor makes it easy</li>
      <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
      <li>To begin with let&#x27;s say the weight is pretty nice and balanced.</li>
      <li>but I believe a real straight razor will give you more control.  </li>
      <li>Also the fit and finish of this razor is subpar.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a pro with a straight razor, so I&#x27;ll be experimenting until I become more skilled.</li>
      <li>Great product, I have used various similar products and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>It should be more consistent for blade placement.  </li>
      <li>Not really sure how that is, mine lined up perfectly.  </li>
      <li>This is the most aggressive a razor can be and that means you get the absolute closest shave.</li>
      <li>nice but have never seen one where one side the blade is completely exposed.</li>
      <li>Very close shave and Very cost effective.  </li>
      <li>But after trying it I can say and this is my new favorite razor.</li>
      <li>The first one is a straight razor (non-safety) which is nice quality but way too agressive and you can really cut yourself up.  </li>
      <li>I get awesome shaves when I use Gillette Thin Blades.</li>
      <li>Notwithstanding the criticisms, this razor is still likely a nice option for someone who likes shaving with a shavette.</li>
      <li>I used to be a wetshaver all my life long and shaved with many many razors, so I know how to put a blade into a razor, no possibility to get the blade straight in.</li>
      <li>There is a side for more of an angle/aggressive shave and another that is a little more gentle with a guard.</li>
      <li>Excellent razor for the price, Love the way a single edge blade shaves even though it will take alittle getting used to after shaving with other razors for so long.</li>
      <li>At first it took me some time to get use to the angle.</li>
      <li>The razor has a long handle which I like better for comfort.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find that the razor gave me an excellent and extremely close shave while being able to use the technique I had mastered with other aggressive DE safety razors such as the Muhle R41 or RazoRock Jaws.</li>
      <li>Works okay, handle is long and cumbersome.</li>
      <li>every single one of them has been top quality.  </li>
      <li>If you have large hands, this razor is defiantly for you.</li>
      <li>I also had problems getting the blade in straight, as others have commented.</li>
      <li>No question about it, I really like shaving and saving.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine getting a straight razor and a safety razor in one.</li>
      <li>It is a VERY aggressive razor.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it seemed that way because the razor isnt just a DE razor, but a Straight razor concept as well.</li>
      <li>Just lay the blade against your skin gently, and allow the blade to do the work.</li>
      <li>The shave was still quite agressive although not as much as their straight razor.  </li>
      <li>I read some of the reviews on here about this razor about the blade not lining up straight.  </li>
      <li>The blade sits perfectly straight and fits snugly in the shaver.</li>
      <li>I just recently bought this one and so far I am a happy customer like with the other models.  </li>
      <li>This was an error on my part, but most razors have larger upper guards in order to help protect people from this sort of thing.</li>
      <li>but I noticed from several videos that to use one I would have to learn an entirely new technique and there would most likely be a learning curve.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>One edge is just like a straight razor, and the other side shaves very much like an &amp;#34;Old</li>
      <li>I love my new safety razor it fits comfortably in my hands and gives me a close shave, my previous razor was short and uncomfortable and left a lot of nicks.</li>
      <li>This is a must buy to all wet shavers I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>The long handle allows for better control and less chance is the blade slipping!</li>
      <li>A few nicks on my first two shaves learning speed and technique.  </li>
      <li>This is a double edged shavette, like the ones that are typically used by barbers as a substitute from a straight razor.  </li>

<li> This is a double edged shavette, like the ones that are typically used by barbers as a substitute from a straight razor.  </li>
<li> A couple of personal choices that made it easier: a foaming shaving cream, after shave lotion, a high quality hlade, and a little practice.</li>
<li> At first I was skeptical about a double-edged straight.</li>
<li> So, this razor is extremely aggressive and capable of providing extremely close shaves, as long you accept the fact that there will be a learning curve involved.  </li>
<li> and I enjoy using aggressive razors, but the straight edge side of this razor is a little scary to me, I had to be extremely cautious while using it.  </li>
<li> Oh, and the LONG handle is a must for me.  </li>
<li> Was too long for the stand I got for it.</li>
<li> For me, I&#x27;m going to put my long handle on another BB razor head that I have, this one is a bit too aggressive as I mentioned.  </li>
<li> The fewer passes you need to make the less likely you will suffer any razor burn which is the big advantage of any aggressive razor.&lt;br</li>
<li> is a long handled version, and the handle is very long and robust.</li>
<li> I can take a single double edged blade, use one side to shave my neck, flip it over and edge my beard with the other side.</li>
<li> Lastly, the pegs on the upper guard used to hold the blade and lower guard in place do not fit well with the lower guard.</li>
<li> Though it is possible, this makes it a little harder to even out the blade edge properly.</li>
<li> By the way, I used it with Personna blades (blue box) which are very sharp blades in my opinion.</li>
<li> The double edge side is aggressive too, but less blade is exposed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for a couple of years now</li>
<li> The satin black finish, weight &amp; handle length (long handle) are plus factors for me.  </li>
<li> I can see using the plate in the future as I usually flip edges on the razor when I move to the other side of my face.</li>

    <li> Poor craftmanship. Blades will not fit evenly.</li>
    <li> I was considering buying a shavette but I noticed from several videos that to use one I would have to learn an entirely new technique and there would most likely be a learning curve. This razor has no guard on one side which makes it effectively a shavette with a handle like a DE safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find that the razor gave me an excellent and extremely close shave while being able to use the technique I had mastered with other aggressive DE safety razors such as the Muhle R41 or RazoRock Jaws. It obviously does require the user to pay close attention while shaving as it definitely is not a safety razor as it lacks a guard bar on one side. Still if you have experience and use little or no pressure letting the weight of the razor do the job, you should have no problems using the unguarded edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However while one side of the razor lacks a safety bar, the other side has one which gives the user a choice. This may come in very handy while going against the grain or across the grain especially at first however I was able to get an excellent shave going with the grain and against the grain with the unguarded edge. The fewer passes you need to make the less likely you will suffer any razor burn which is the big advantage of any aggressive razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included with the razor is a bottom plate that has no safety bar on either side. I can see using the plate in the future as I usually flip edges on the razor when I move to the other side of my face.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have used various similar products and this is by far the best. Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> nice but have never seen one where one side the blade is completely exposed.</li>
    <li> The Barbe double edge/straight razor is the best of both worlds!!! This is a must buy to all wet shavers I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It has been a pleasure to deal with this company.  I have purchased several of their safety razors and every single one of them has been top quality.  I just recently bought this one and so far I am a happy customer like with the other models.  No question about it, I really like shaving and saving.  Two thumbs up for BBNY!!!</li>
    <li> I received this item on Sunday and put it to use on Monday afternoon before heading out to work. I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for a couple of years now and I enjoy using aggressive razors, but the straight edge side of this razor is a little scary to me, I had to be extremely cautious while using it.  The satin black finish, weight &amp; handle length (long handle) are plus factors for me.  The double edge side is aggressive too, but less blade is exposed. For those who experienced  workmanship issues, I didn&#x27;t see that.  Maybe it seemed that way because the razor isnt just a DE razor, but a Straight razor concept as well. For me, I&#x27;m going to put my long handle on another BB razor head that I have, this one is a bit too aggressive as I mentioned.  By the way, I used it with Personna blades (blue box) which are very sharp blades in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. One edge is just like a straight razor, and the other side shaves very much like an &amp;#34;Old Type&amp;#34;. I get awesome shaves when I use Gillette Thin Blades. Then again,I have medium to coarse facial hair. This razor has a nice, balanced feel to it as well. Well worth the price !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and Happy Shaving to all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;frederalxpress</li>
    <li> This razor was amazing. The razor comes double-sided. One side is a medium aggressive end, and the other is an aggressive end. Though, the aggressive end is not really necessary, with this razor and both its ends I got one of the best shaves of my life. However, there are a few problems with it. All the problems are with its design: First, it came in the box assembled badly. The lower guard was screwed on the wrong way, and, in order to line up the lower and upper guards properly, I had to turn the lower guard 180 degrees. Second, the upper guard does not protect against injury. I had accidentally made a small cut in my nose using the razor. This was an error on my part, but most razors have larger upper guards in order to help protect people from this sort of thing. Lastly, the pegs on the upper guard used to hold the blade and lower guard in place do not fit well with the lower guard. Though it is possible, this makes it a little harder to even out the blade edge properly.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome it has a gaurd on one side and none on the other. This works perfect I use the gaurded side to cut in my sideburns and the unguarded side is incredible. This is the most aggressive a razor can be and that means you get the absolute closest shave. Build quality is excellent its heavy and the powder coat is flawless! I also own the model x and love it to. But that has no gaurds and is tricky doing sideburns. This razor is really the best of both worlds and is becoming my favorite shaver!</li>
    <li> To begin with let&#x27;s say the weight is pretty nice and balanced. The razor has a long handle which I like better for comfort. There is a side for more of an angle/aggressive shave and another that is a little more gentle with a guard. There are some people that stated some defects, which I didn&#x27;t have any. At first it took me some time to get use to the angle. After some time with the razor though I am glad I got this razor. I recommend it to my co workers that wet shave and my best friend. It looks really nice I love the finish. I used dorco double edge razors with this razor</li>
    <li> Would be a good razor if the razor head would be symmetric. I used to be a wetshaver all my life long and shaved with many many razors, so I know how to put a blade into a razor, no possibility to get the blade straight in. Watch the photos.  Sorry, BB. &amp;#34;NOT MADE IN CHINA&amp;#34;, but in my opinion not better than a chinese razor. Only difference is the price. Very disappointed, because I am from Germany and sending the razor back to the US will cost me too much. Purchased it for USD 37,00 - way to expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I couldn&#x27;t imagine getting a straight razor and a safety razor in one. I can take a single double edged blade, use one side to shave my neck, flip it over and edge my beard with the other side. I&#x27;m not a pro with a straight razor, so I&#x27;ll be experimenting until I become more skilled. I also like the weight and length of the handle. You don&#x27;t need to push the blade against your skin. Just lay the blade against your skin gently, and allow the blade to do the work. It&#x27;s truly a work of art on top of all of that. Just a beautiful shaver. I read another review that criticized the construction of the shaver, and complained that the blade didn&#x27;t sit straight due to bad machining. I had no such problem. The blade sits perfectly straight and fits snugly in the shaver. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is not a safety razor.  So, don&#x27;t purchase this razor if you also looking for a razor that protects your face from the blade.  This is a double edged shavette, like the ones that are typically used by barbers as a substitute from a straight razor.  So, this razor is extremely aggressive and capable of providing extremely close shaves, as long you accept the fact that there will be a learning curve involved.  Also the fit and finish of this razor is subpar.  The bottom plate does not fit evenly with the top plate, and it is also difficult to impossible to insert the razor blade so that the blade is evenly exposed on both sides.  Notwithstanding the criticisms, this razor is still likely a nice option for someone who likes shaving with a shavette.</li>
    <li> This is my second razor from this company.  The first one is a straight razor (non-safety) which is nice quality but way too agressive and you can really cut yourself up.  I liked that this one was a safety razor so I ordered one. I read some of the reviews on here about this razor about the blade not lining up straight.  Not really sure how that is, mine lined up perfectly.  The head has pins that line up the blade.  The shave was still quite agressive although not as much as their straight razor.  I had a good shave but I don&#x27;t see me using it as my everyday razor due to its aggressiveness.  For that I use a Mehaz butterfly razor.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about a double-edged straight. But after trying it I can say and this is my new favorite razor. Good build quality, feels great in hand. Is very heavy but I like that in a razor. Nice travel case.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor for the price, Love the way a single edge blade shaves even though it will take alittle getting used to after shaving with other razors for so long. This razor makes it easy</li>
    <li> This is NICE! I got this item after much internal debate and research. I am VERY pleased.  Very close shave and Very cost effective.  A couple of personal choices that made it easier: a foaming shaving cream, after shave lotion, a high quality hlade, and a little practice. A few nicks on my first two shaves learning speed and technique.  Three (3) months into use and very happy.  Oh, and the LONG handle is a must for me.  The long handle allows for better control and less chance is the blade slipping!</li>
    <li> Wow! Talk about bang for your buck. This razor is defiantly a precision piece of equipment packed with quality and durability. This razor should cost much more. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;This is a long handled version, and the handle is very long and robust. If you have large hands, this razor is defiantly for you. If you have small hands, and just want extra girth, length and weight. Buy this razor.</li>
    <li> Great bang for your buck</li>
    <li> I bought this razor then read the reviews.  I wish I had read them before I bought it.  It is a VERY aggressive razor.  It&#x27;s billed as a straight/safety razor but I believe a real straight razor will give you more control.  I also found that putting the blade in effects the amount of exposure.  It should be more consistent for blade placement.  I also had problems getting the blade in straight, as others have commented.</li>
    <li> Works okay, handle is long and cumbersome. Was too long for the stand I got for it. Coating chips off easily, challenging to change blade compared to the butterfly style.</li>
    <li> I love my new safety razor it fits comfortably in my hands and gives me a close shave, my previous razor was short and uncomfortable and left a lot of nicks.</li>
    <li> awesome awesome awesome razor!!! not for the faint of heart though, with no comb guard it can be slightly intimitating. So shave with care! take your time and appreciate the artform. If you do that then you will love this razor, I know I do. Thank you!</li>
