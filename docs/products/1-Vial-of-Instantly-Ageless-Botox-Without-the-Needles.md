      <li>great buy.</li>
      <li>It made my eyes swell up more than the bags before I put it on!!  </li>
      <li>People need to read more thoroughly before purchasing things online!!</li>
      <li>That stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome to watch work, try it on one eye, you&#x27;ll buy more.</li>

      <li>Love the product it works.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more eventually</li>
      <li>Better products on the market</li>
      <li>I have used this and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>but i thought it would work better than it did.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m about to order more</li>
      <li>I do believe the bags under my eyes look better, but nothing like the videos across the internet.</li>
      <li>but after I applied this product they mostly disappeared.</li>
      <li>I ordered more.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to have found the magic cream, but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>and you better take me out for dinner first!!!  </li>
      <li>In my opinion it works pretty good.</li>
      <li>The effects were good for the first hour or so.</li>
      <li>saw the video on Favebook (as I&#x27;m sure many of you have) and was excited to try it.</li>
      <li>I gave 4 stars just because you have to kind of play with it to get the right amount under your eyes</li>
      <li>Will be getting more for special nights out and events that pictures will be taken.</li>
      <li>and I was fine with that.</li>
      <li>Then upon looking closely you could see fine cracks.</li>
      <li>I have used instantly ageless before and it worked great.</li>
      <li>Worked better for me in my forehead and smile wrinkle areas.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great to have a sample available because I was about to buy the whole box after I saw all the videos.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 27 and have normal skin, with some wrinkles</li>
      <li>I was surprised by this and not in a good way, it made my eyes look super crepey and wrinkly, it did make the puffiness go away but made my skin look wrinkly instead</li>
      <li>and I got excited.  </li>
      <li>The bags under my eyes vanished right in front of me within minutes!</li>
      <li>You can see a change right before nude eyes!</li>
      <li>Really wanted to love this....</li>
      <li>Although this one vial is overpriced, I&#x27;m glad I tried it before I spend the whole amount on a case.</li>
      <li>Because I purchased a couple of vials, as opposed to a full kit, I did not feel &amp;#34;ripped off&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Also the photo shows a box full.</li>
      <li>Shipping was somewhat slow but the seller was great!</li>
      <li>The place I would love to see it work better on is around the upper lip area.</li>
      <li>Came quickly, however, it don&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
      <li>Pleased I only paid for one vial, won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
      <li>BUT then my face started to get a mild burning sensation-like a super mild sunburn.  </li>
      <li>I used exactly how the video demo explained - NO RESULT!</li>
      <li>it really works but you have to learn the precise way to apply it....</li>
      <li>so I ordered only one vial to try and the results were amazing.</li>
      <li>For the price (got mine on Eb@y for $4.75), it is worth a try.</li>
      <li>bigger than expected bottle.very impressed.</li>
      <li>For example it works well anywhere you put it, but under eyes once it dries and then you smile, it wrinkles a lot.</li>
      <li>Go natural ladies, you will look, and FEEL better.</li>
      <li>It was definitely worth a try.  </li>
      <li>If you get it right, it does show a difference.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t FEEL right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just stating my honest opinion on how it worked for me only, and I applied it exactly as directed.</li>
      <li>Yes, it works, last most of the day, it&#x27;s just too expenisve to buy a full case of it.  </li>
      <li>Works for 75-80% of people , I think not bad &amp; could be # 1 if it last longer :)</li>
      <li>After so many products that I have tried and no results, this was by far the best product I havve used for instant results for days that I need a little help.</li>
      <li>It worked pretty good at reducing the bags under my eyes and lightning the dark circles.</li>
      <li>Did not realize  it was only 1 vial paid more for shipping  than what the item was worth</li>
      <li>By midday, my fine lines turned to cracked furrows and one side of my face looked as if it was an 80 year old woman.  </li>
      <li>I am a 37 year old with fine lines (not wrinkles).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Goes on chalky like toothpaste</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother, doesn&#x27;t work, waste of time and money. It did ship on time.</li>
    <li> That stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> Worked for my baggy eyes</li>
    <li> I have used this and absolutely love it. It&#x27;s a temporary (9 hours) fix for bags, wrinkles or puffy eyes if used correctly.</li>
    <li> The product works but only if you don&#x27;t wear make up. As soon as you touch the area where applied it pops like a balloon.</li>
    <li> Garbage, Didn&#x27;t Work Waste Of Money, Thank God I Only Bought 1, If I Could Give It A Zero Rating I Would , It Made My Eyes WORSE!</li>
    <li> Love the product it works. If your sensative don&#x27;t be lazy wash it off before bed. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Does not work as stated.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
    <li> It was a knock off.. don&#x27;t order from here..  did not work at all</li>
    <li> Yes, it works, last most of the day, it&#x27;s just too expenisve to buy a full case of it.  One tube will last about 2-4 days.  I would buy a few single tubes and use it when going out.</li>
    <li> Did not like it...left white film on area I was using it on... Will not buy it again</li>
    <li> The item that is pictured to purchase  is clearly a vial, I got two tiny foil samples clearly labeled &amp;#34;Not for individual sale&amp;#34;!  In other words they were samples! One of them was pasty and gunky. The other one was the texture of toothpaste. Product did absolutely nothing and when it dried it looked like I had watered down elmers glue on my face!  Felt gross and looked nasty! Don&#x27;t waste your money! Will NEVER  buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using 3 weeks and doesn&#x27;t see any different!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. Just can&#x27;t get over the white residue and dry/ crackly look it leaves behind. For example it works well anywhere you put it, but under eyes once it dries and then you smile, it wrinkles a lot. It looks super dry like you didn&#x27;t put moisturizer.  Not sure if I&#x27;d buy it again. You have to try it though.</li>
    <li> Did do ok but not greatly impressed.</li>
    <li> I gave 4 stars just because you have to kind of play with it to get the right amount under your eyes and it not leave a residue. If you get it right, it does show a difference.  Only use a little bit too. I&#x27;ve gotten 5 uses out of one vial and I think I have another use or 2 left...thats how little of amount I use (plus my eyes aren&#x27;t too, too bad).</li>
    <li> Warning!!!!! You only get one vial.  I bought 2 vials for $10 from a jeunesse distributor.  This is extremely overpriced.</li>
    <li> If people would take time to read the description it plainly tells you its for one single vial.</li>
    <li> I do not understand what all of the &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34; is about this product.  While the service from the seller was great, this product was NOT good at all.  It did NOT make my face &amp;#34;instantly ageless&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m sorry but I would not waste your money on it and I do NOT recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Shipping was slower than advertised and seller did not tell me that until I contacted her after the promised delivery date, product did not work for me, I did everything the directions said and there was no visible changes. Eh well.</li>
    <li> SCAM! Don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;m glad I only bought one tiny vial...</li>
    <li> Junk. It&#x27;s like putting on Elmers  glue and when it dries you peel it off</li>
    <li> It worked pretty good at reducing the bags under my eyes and lightning the dark circles. I don&#x27;t really have a lot of wrinkles at age 55, just a lot of laugh lines and it does nothing for those. The place I would love to see it work better on is around the upper lip area. I was a smoker for 30 years and that&#x27;s about the only area that shows a little wrinkles but nothing noticeable unless your right on top of me and you better take me out for dinner first!!!  Do I think it&#x27;s worth the money for such a tiny vial??? I guess but it&#x27;s only something I can afford to use for special occasions, I wasn&#x27;t born into the Trump family.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but i thought it would work better than it did.</li>
    <li> If you scroll to the description it says only comes with one vial. People need to read more thoroughly before purchasing things online!!</li>
    <li> Mix a little water into Elmer&#x27;s glue and rub it under your eyes, let it dry. Same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered in time and worked as promised.</li>
    <li> This is terrible.  It made my eyes swell up more than the bags before I put it on!!  Then it had sucked every bit of moisture out of under my eyes that for a week I had deep looking &amp;#34;wrinkles!&amp;#34;  It felt like glue going on - should have known to wipe it off immediately!</li>
    <li> This is very misleading. I bought this for $12.74, as a gift to my friend. She said it arrived in a little envelope that contained only a tiny amount. The picture hardly looks like an envelope. In all fairness, she did state the product seemed to work.</li>
    <li> Product did not work at all .</li>
    <li> great buy. good product. on time. bigger than expected bottle.very impressed.</li>
    <li> The tube is so small it is ridiculous.  The product seemed a little dry and hard to apply once opened and recapped.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I tried this product.  It did nothing.  It is a scam in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It works, but not under or over makeup. Once water touches the product, it&#x27;s done and will leave a white cast. Save your money. Not worth a penny.</li>
    <li> Nice surprise in a little vile. I dont know if it wears off after a few hours bc I used it at night but it was a pleasant surprise.</li>
    <li> The packaging sucks...paid 15 bucks for one tube...it worked did what it said it would.  But you can&#x27;t get everything out if the tube.  So for me I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Worst thing ever doesn&#x27;t work. I want a refund</li>
    <li> This left a white residue on my face after application.</li>
    <li> I have enlarged pores and expression wrinkles on my forehead.  I used this product and I was amazed. There is no know medical procedure that can to anything for my pores with my complexion.  My pores shrank before my eyes.  I though FINALLY!!!  BUT then my face started to get a mild burning sensation-like a super mild sunburn.  So I washed it off. Now two weeks later my skin is feeling more and more burned, it is extremely itchy and dry.  It is not red or swollen, just burning and itchy.  I am miserable!!!!</li>
    <li> When I made the order the product description suggested there should&#x27;ve been two vials. I only received one and now it&#x27;s says it&#x27;s one. I wish I took a screen shot when I made the order because I have no other way to prove it. I could have ordered from another cheaper supplier if I knew I am only receiving one vial since there were others with one vial and cheaper prices !!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;m only 29 but have hereditary bags that have been around since puberty.  Under my eyes just got tight and more wrinkly.  The bags may have lessened a little but it wasn&#x27;t an attractive trade off.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It really works.  Will be getting more for special nights out and events that pictures will be taken.</li>
    <li> Helped my grandmother very much!!! She loves it!</li>
    <li> Did not see any difference.</li>
    <li> I have already written a long story about this product! I&#x27;m about to order more,I don&#x27;t want a day with out it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t  do  anything but make my eyes look wrinkled,dry, &amp; left white powder residue Under my eye! I had to wash my face to get it off!</li>
    <li> Junk!  Did not work!!</li>
    <li> Small vial comes taped on a used piece of cardboard.  I think there are rules about ingredients and such.  I just wanted to try it and really didn&#x27;t think it would work like the video showed and I was correct.  Presentation and product bad.  Do not waste you money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this product works differently for everybody, it did not work well on me. It was definitely worth a try.  Although this one vial is overpriced, I&#x27;m glad I tried it before I spend the whole amount on a case.</li>
    <li> I am 37 and have dark circles and starting to wrinkle. This cream did nothing but make me look worse.</li>
    <li> did nothing at all very disappointed</li>
    <li> Vary misleading on quanity.</li>
    <li> Did not realize  it was only 1 vial paid more for shipping  than what the item was worth</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t live up to the video that is making the rounds on Facebook. Glad I didn&#x27;t spend 80 on the box</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this. In my opinion it works pretty good. You can see a change right before nude eyes!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome to watch work, try it on one eye, you&#x27;ll buy more. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Does not work like video I watched:(  was really looking forward to product and was let down. Seemed somewhat dried out.</li>
    <li> I wouldnt run out and get it</li>
    <li> Absolutely useless, dries white, once makeup is applied your wrinkles are even worse than without this product.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at any price!</li>
    <li> It sure is a lot for a small tube. Did it on my grandma &amp; couldn&#x27;t really see a difference with before and after photos.</li>
    <li> It works but as soon as u add makeup its gone won&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> I was very disjointed.  I try some stuff at a show in Dallas I liked but too expensive. This was not good</li>
    <li> Works for maybe 5 mins then face is covered in hard dry white flaky  substance. Now I see why videos of this stuff are very short!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference!</li>
    <li> Does tighten your skin with a noticeable change BUT...leaves a white residue. Was sent with NO instructions or tips so I have tried applying by dabbing, adding some moisturizer, using more, using less. Have not found a way to avoid this white with small chunky residue. Also it seems to only last an hour or two. Really wanted to love this....</li>
    <li> This CLEARLY says &amp;#34;box of 25 vials&amp;#34; and you only get one. VERY misleading. Also the photo shows a box full. Product does work relatively well and I&#x27;d order again but not from this seller.</li>
    <li> No it didn&#x27;t,&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t use it under makup, it doesn&#x27;t state that</li>
    <li> IT WORKED, MY HUSBAND WAS SUPRISED. WILL GET MORE</li>
    <li> It did not do anything. I&#x27;m not impressed. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it was completely false advertising.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I felt a little more self confident after I used instantly ageless.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money...  Very dry not enough moister to even pat it under your eye. Turns dry and starts flaking off during the day. Did not look any different when dried, maybe because it was to dry coming out of the tube.  So glad I only bought one tube to try.</li>
    <li> Glad I have few wrinkles because this product is like putting Elmers glue on your face. Don&#x27;t expect to smile or frown without &amp;#34;breaking the seal&amp;#34; and I used very little product. Uncomfortable on face. Go natural ladies, you will look, and FEEL better.</li>
    <li> Actually worked great...but for just a short while and then looked like dried glue. I will try it again though, could be I need to refine the process just a bit. Would give it a 5 star rating if I can get it to last longer.</li>
    <li> Came quickly, however, it don&#x27;t seem to work for me. It did tighten up under my eyes a bit, but it looked dry and flaky. Wound up washing it off and going back to my regular concealer.</li>
    <li> did not like this product at all!!!!! Don&#x27;t waste the money</li>
    <li> Never bought it and won&#x27;t after reviews !! Plus I wouldn&#x27;t put nothing On my face without doctor permission.. Nope!!</li>
    <li> It works very well until I put moisturizer on over it. I wish it would&#x27;ve come with instructions on how it works. I just got the product with no instructions 😒 maybe you can give people instructions on how to do it and how it works best and it would work amazingly.</li>
    <li> I did not see any results</li>
    <li> I cannot tell any difference whatsoever</li>
    <li> This product feels like drying glue within seconds of application...when completely dry it pulls skin taut and looks awful when you smile.....tried every which way and it left a dry, white residue...trying to cover it with makeup was useless.....don&#x27;t waste your money folks....just use a good eye cream.....better to have a few creamy, moisturized lines and wrinkles than prunish eyes....took me days to get my eyes up to speed again...this stuff took the life out of my skin!</li>
    <li> Excelente! I loved it, I just got the product and I tried after a long day of work. it worked perfectly. I was concerning that it wouldn&#x27;t work but I&#x27;m surprised. I don&#x27;t have severe eye bags but after I applied this product they mostly disappeared. I&#x27;m in love! I will definitely get the full box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adorei esse produto. Realmente funciona quero comprar a caixa completa em breve. Estou apaixonada!!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t expect to much but it does work to a degree...if it were half the price I would buy a box</li>
    <li> Its a good temporary wrinkle fix... hard to apply concealer over... the gel dries a little ashy feeling</li>
    <li> This product does what it says how it was not delivered on time</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting a miracle. I don&#x27;t have lots of wrinkles in my eye area, but the eyes bags do bother me. I was hoping to have found the magic cream, but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Stuff really works well! Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Use sparingly, if used too much in one spot under eye can almost make eye look worse. Worked better for me in my forehead and smile wrinkle areas. I don&#x27;t have puffy eyea, so couldn&#x27;t test out what it does for that. Really need to rub in well to prevent white crusty look. .</li>
    <li> Not overly impressed. I don&#x27;t see much. Just feels dry. I&#x27;ve watched the &amp;#34;real life videos&amp;#34;. I didn&#x27;t get any of those results.</li>
    <li> This product is a hoax and doesn&#x27;t give any results what so ever. Waste of time and money. It feels like you are putting Elmers Glue under your eyes. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> works but hate that it doesn&#x27;t last for longer periods of time.</li>
    <li> I was VERY skeptical about using this product, for fear of causing damage to my skin or worse, somehow my vision. (I&#x27;m clumsy with applications of product sometimes!) you will need the entire contents of one vial to apply to both under eyes. I was hoping to get a few uses out of it, but ok. I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I applied the cream as directed, and didn&#x27;t move a muscle. This is hard. I waved my hands, thought of using a hair dryer, but didn&#x27;t. It took approximately 5-10 minutes for me to really feel the pulling sensation. I could truly FEEL my skin being pulled taught. I found it annoying. I looked in the mirror and laughed. I had a fine white powder residue beneath each eye. Barely noticeable. I&#x27;m fair skinned and blonde.&lt;br /&gt;The product works. I don&#x27;t know how, it just really does. But it&#x27;s not for me. I didn&#x27;t like the pulling sensation. It didn&#x27;t FEEL right. Nice to look at though, but my vanity doesn&#x27;t run that deep. I&#x27;ll stick with what Mother Nature gifts to me and be grateful for another day!</li>
    <li> Excellent just ordered 5 more</li>
    <li> Nice,but didn&#x27;t like the residue it left behind.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work.  Complete waste of time and money!!!</li>
    <li> It did not do what was said I was disappointed</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.Very little difference if any</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as advertised-glad we only bought a small quantity.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by this and not in a good way, it made my eyes look super crepey and wrinkly, it did make the puffiness go away but made my skin look wrinkly instead, I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong to cause this.</li>
    <li> Confused on rating this.. I think my order was not complete. I did not like the sachet , due to packaging issues. The cream dries fast once openes in sachet form. Not pleased</li>
    <li> Disappointing,the minute I applied foundation it stopped working.you have to apply some form of coverage as it leaves a white mark.I was not impressed at all,it is quite expensive £10, and the vial is tiny.sorry not for me.</li>
    <li> It I could give this a zero - I would. waste of money! I used exactly how the video demo explained - NO RESULT!</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied. The post says one vial. I got it in no time and it works GREAT! I will definitely be ordering the full box next time. I just wanted to test it out first. The bags under my eyes vanished right in front of me within minutes!</li>
    <li> This did not work on my bags. It made my skin feel like it was pulling and after  awhile it went white.</li>
    <li> Bought 1 vial of this and noticed a 50% difference. It doesn&#x27;t tighten your skin like you would think. It feels more like elders glue tight, where when you smile aftet, those parts will not crease. Is it a miracle in a tube? I don&#x27;t think so. I think it is just another get rich pyramid scheme that happens to have some minor results, but not the results you would expect. I do believe the bags under my eyes look better, but nothing like the videos across the internet. For the price (got mine on Eb@y for $4.75), it is worth a try. See how you like it. I&#x27;m just stating my honest opinion on how it worked for me only, and I applied it exactly as directed.</li>
    <li> FYI. You are getting 1 vial of product when you order.  Over charged &amp; Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got it for a friend and she was blown away on how well it worked so you can say she was very pleased.</li>
    <li> gose on smoth and all you need is dab</li>
    <li> The people posting good reviews are just distributors trying to make money. The people saying it&#x27;s like glue, burns and doesn&#x27;t work like the videos claim are being honest. I know, my wife signed up to sell it, got a box and we tried it on ourselves.. We also gave out lots of samples. Out of 15 people, 14 did not like it the other person said they wanted to buy, but never did.</li>
    <li> Product does not do what it shows in the how to use the video. Very disappointing. Shipping was somewhat slow but the seller was great!</li>
    <li> After viewing an online video of the miraculous cream, I really wanted to try it without making a hefty monetary commitment.  My friend and I decided to try the cream under one eye to see if there were noticeable results.  The results were dry, constricted skin under my eye.  It was uncomfortable and created wrinkles instead of  hiding them.  My friend had the same results with apparent white residue and extra wrinkles under her eye.</li>
    <li> The effects were good for the first hour or so. Then upon looking closely you could see fine cracks. Same as other over the counter brands.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think this is what it is advertised to be...at least not for me.  They should give out 1 vial for trying this product so each individual can see if it works for them.  Then &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; could decide if they want to pay the ridiculous price for it...in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Note:(I did not buy from this seller) just a review.. I got 5 vials for $20 which I thought was pretty decent enough price.. However to me it was a waste of money because I seen no difference in my under eye fine lines and I have somewhat hereditary dark circles. Now the circles lightened a little bit but I think it was from the white film it left after drying but it did diminish a LITTLE of my puffiness..I feel I wasted my money because I&#x27;m expecting results like the videos I&#x27;m watching or at least SOMETHING I can work with! I&#x27;m not gonna use the other vials for what? Its a waste of time when youre not satisfied; therefore I will be going to a professional to fix this issue..this was my last go around with buying expensive products that claim to work and it doesn&#x27;t..if it works..you would think it would work for the MAJORITY at least! And I was reading the wrong reviews for the &amp;#34;instantly ageless&amp;#34; that came in a bottle..not the vials but if I had of read these i wouldn&#x27;t of brought!</li>
    <li> Great product! I was skeptical so I ordered only one vial to try and the results were amazing. I applied to one side of face to see the difference and I was amazed. After so many products that I have tried and no results, this was by far the best product I havve used for instant results for days that I need a little help. I applied at around 7am before i went to work and it lasted all day. I applied again before I went out for the evening with my step daughter at around 5:30 pm. I would reccommend this product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Awful stuff. Dries horrid and after two applications the solution dried up and crystallised inside the tiny tube.</li>
    <li> First I ordered 2 - only got one order.  Effects only lasted sitxty seconds. It dried into a white paste and had to wipe it off to apply my makeup.  Did not do what was advertised at all.  Highly disappointed!!!  Would love a refund!!!  Will not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it, yes it did work for a couple of hours, but the feeling it left on ur face was horrible. It felt like someone had wiped my face down with super glue. Just out of curiosity I applied the instantly ageless to my husband face, didn&#x27;t matter the amount  that I applied, and with him having darken skin, he had white spots everywhere..</li>
    <li> excellent. .i would like to buy again....to expensive. ..</li>
    <li> Made my undereye wrinkles/bags look worse.  I followed application instructions properly.  Not for me</li>
    <li> Does not last, and did not notice any difference</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. Made my dark circles look darker and cracked. I dont think it is a good product for people of color.</li>
    <li> saw the video on Favebook (as I&#x27;m sure many of you have) and was excited to try it. I did understand I was getting only one vial and I was fine with that. Problem was twofold....one, it didn&#x27;t really work. It was gummy and then turned crusty and I still had about the same amount of lines and wrinkles. Two, I only got one application out of the vial. When I went to try it the second time none would come out, so I cut the vial down the side thinking I would get it out that way. No go. It was a dried, clumped mess. I was really sad because I was hoping to add this product to my daily beauty routine, but definitely won&#x27;t be doing so.</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all. Used a small amount and dabbed under the eye, it dried and made the under eye feel quite taut, however when I smiled the lines under my eyes seemed even worse. Also left a white residue and I&#x27;d used hardly anything. Pleased I only paid for one vial, won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
    <li> That stuff feels like you put a piece of tape under your eye. When it is dry it feels very stiff and uncomfortable. I guess I would only use it for a photo shoot. Don&#x27;t think I can get used to that stiff feeling.</li>
    <li> Sales@InstantlyAgelessukandeu.com</li>
    <li> The affects of the product were gone the moment I applied lotion to my face. It also gooped up and peeled off after a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> SMALL TUBE THAN THOUGHT</li>
    <li> It makes the bags go away, but it didn&#x27;t last , but for a few hours</li>
    <li> Did not work. Tried on two different people.</li>
    <li> This listing is false advertising!  Every photo leads one to believe they are getting the box of product.  Not one tiny little vial.  Not until I got it did I come back and see the last little bullet point. I am returning this for sure.  A box of 25 sure doesn&#x27;t cost $250!!!  Don&#x27;t know if the product is awful but this listing sure is.</li>
    <li> Very deceptive no where does it say that you will only receive one small vial.</li>
    <li> Liar liar pants on fire. It says 25 vials on the description!</li>
    <li> Worked great but only lasted a few hours. Reapplying is not possible without removing makeup then reapplying.</li>
    <li> Description&lt;br /&gt;Box of 25 vials. If you&#x27;re interested in being a distributor go to FirmUpNY.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the description under the product, but the shipment only was one vial!!!!</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this again. Better products on the market</li>
    <li> FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!  Only one vial, not 25!!!!</li>
    <li> Results not as described. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not much of a difference for what I paid.</li>
    <li> Left flaky residue, and saw no change did feel it get tight,  but no visual change.....</li>
    <li> Come on people...  Did you really think you were going to get a box of 25 vials for TEN bucks? ... The product works!  Over my makeup and under it. I have found that when i moisturize my face with an oil free moisturizer it works best and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Ohh and if you want to get all the product out, cut the tube down the middle and use a qtip !</li>
    <li> Not really didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to work for me maybe I used it wrong</li>
    <li> I felt dizzy and out of it after applying this product. The finger I used to apply it,  went numb for several hours.  However, it did remove my bags,  not worth it.  Do your research on active ingredient and see if beauty is really worth it.  No thank you.  I&#x27;d rather age with grace</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I&#x27;m glad i bought just the 1 vial before I spent a small fortune on a bigger size</li>
    <li> works good but when it gets wet dont work</li>
    <li> Did Not Worked es for me. Left white residue over my face and I didn&#x27;t like it. Product is good and it seem to work.</li>
    <li> I gave this product four stars due to the fact that I have never used the product prior and did not receive any instructions with it. So I attempted to apply the product and found that it is personally not for me. The tightening of the skin  around my eyes when I applied the product, I could not handle. If you are looking for a firming lotion; this is for you, but I did not like the way it made me look.</li>
    <li> This actually works very well! Just wish it came in a larger amount as that would bring the cost down!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me with my fine wrinkles and it left a whiteish dry coating. It really helped my husband&#x27;s eye bags lessen and a deep scar almost disappear, but you can&#x27;t touch your face or you &amp;#34;release&amp;#34; the tightness. It was also a little bit of a dry whitish film on his face. MIGHT try again for him, but not for me.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly, so I would say the vendor from whom I made my purchase is good.  The product did not perform as seen on the video I saw, as I suspected.  Because I purchased a couple of vials, as opposed to a full kit, I did not feel &amp;#34;ripped off&amp;#34;.  It may be that the product has worked well for others, but I was not impressed.  Don&#x27;t be delusional: Nothing applied topically will get rid of under eye bags.  To accomplish that you WILL have to have plastic surgery.</li>
    <li> Just not what I saw and expected !</li>
    <li> I did not see any results.</li>
    <li> Works immediately.... tried it on a friend and she was amazed by the results...she works in the  cosmetic  industry... and never  before has she seen results from a cream...</li>
    <li> Did not work as advertised.</li>
    <li> This product did NOTHING for me.  I would not recommend it to anyone over 50.  I saw no difference in my wrinkles..........</li>
    <li> Temporary makes skin tight &amp; stiff then cracks</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrible.  I am a 37 year old with fine lines (not wrinkles).  I put the cream on and initially, I felt and saw my skin tighten and I got excited.  By midday, my fine lines turned to cracked furrows and one side of my face looked as if it was an 80 year old woman.  It was like the mortar I applied began cracking.  As a busy working mother, of course I had tons of after-work errands to run in addition to my children&#x27;s&#x27; activities.  By 7:30 in the evening, I was as terrifying as a crackle-faced hag in a horror film.  I could not get home quickly enough to was the overpriced spackle off of my terrifying face.  I had to send apology notes to other parents for scaring their children.  Trust me, this product is terrible.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> The product does exactly what is says</li>
    <li> Glad I only bought one vile because it was a waste of money. It does take away fine lines and saw a little difference. BUT it&#x27;s just like glue. You can&#x27;t wear makeup under or over it and would work fine if you walk around all day with not a single expression on your face. If you smile or anything then you get these big fat lines that look horrible. Not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> I have used instantly ageless before and it worked great. In just a few minutes the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth began to smooth out. The only thing you need be careful will is putting to much on or else there will small amounts of white caking where it is applied. Remember a little goes a long way. The vials are very small and you should be able to get at least 2 or 3 uses out of it.</li>
    <li> Glad I only got the 1 vial</li>
    <li> Ageless was worthless. Do not recommend it at all! At all!</li>
    <li> I loved the product....it really works but you have to learn the precise way to apply it....too much rubbing or taking too long will not give the result you want...less is more!  I purchased a large reorder...wont be living without this product again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay if you want to have your wrinkles disappear for about 30 minutes to have a picture taken or for some other quick event.  It did remove the wrinkles, however, it left a white residue.  When I tried to cover the residue with my foundation, it appeared to wash it away, and the wrinkles returned.  I would not spent the money for this product.  It does deliver, however, it is for a very short period.  If you were to apply this daily, you would go through the vials in a couple of days.</li>
    <li> it really works!  It took a couple tries to find the right amount and how to apply correctly, but my bags were gone and effects lasted about 12 hours.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing, so disappointing, not sure maybe the product is old, but it did not feel to the touch as they described in the videos, and it did nothing, still had all the lines an puffiness, and also left a white sticky residue.</li>
    <li> It does reduce under eye bags, but it felt right and uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me atleast!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the transformation. It really works. Got to get some more, I showed everybody.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> it did a real good job! the price is really high tho....</li>
    <li> Works for 75-80% of people , I think not bad &amp; could be # 1 if it last longer :)</li>
    <li> Very disappointing actually.  It did not do a thing and it made my eyes dry where it was applied.  Also , the picture shows a whole box which is what I thought I was buying, instead only got one sample.  It might work for others but did not work for me.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. The skin around my eyes got stiff and every time I smiled it would wrinkle as if I had glue on it. It didn&#x27;t improve wrinkles or dark circles, but it seems to improve puffiness as long as you don&#x27;t smile.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to have a sample available because I was about to buy the whole box after I saw all the videos.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 27 and have normal skin, with some wrinkles e dark circles under my eyes. Perhaps it will work for people with more age signs than me.</li>
    <li> This is mis advertised on Amazon.  I believed I was buying 25 bails but only one arrived. The product itself is wonderful. I will be purchasing more eventually</li>
    <li> It did not remove the eye puffiness as stated it would do in the advertisement</li>
    <li> Leaves white residue on your face. I ordered more.</li>
    <li> Tiny cream, for one time use</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, watched the video and thought there&#x27;s no way a product can do this! It does and almost instantly. Takes very little, vial lasted me a week and it keeps puffiness away all day</li>
    <li> tried it as directed, no noticeable change in appearance as advertised</li>
    <li> I really loved it, it worked as well as it was advertised to work, however, the product didn&#x27;t hold up when makeup was applied over it. For this  reason I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> Just lasted a couple hours.</li>
</ol>
