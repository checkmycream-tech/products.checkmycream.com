      <li>The bodywash lathers up nicely and you don&#x27;t need a ton to get the job done.  </li>
      <li>It kind of smells like Axe Essence Deodorant Spray.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend really liked this, he never uses any lotions but</li>
      <li>, it suds nicely and gets me</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this bodywash for 3 weeks, and my skin has seen effective moisturizing results.</li>
      <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is something to get used to as it can get very strong in the shower</li>
      <li>I really loved it, the wash is silky smooth and lathers into plenty of cleansing bubbles without stripping moisture away...</li>
      <li>The liquid is very smooth and resembles the thickness of hair conditioner.</li>
      <li>The first thing he mentioned was that it is very strong, scent wise.</li>
      <li>Not to setup a spoiler, but this product did OK on both counts.    </li>
      <li>My boyfriend and I both love using this bodywash.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s OK.  </li>
      <li>Probably will try a couple more competitors that have appeared on the tube to my continuous delight and enlightenment.</li>
      <li>but I love the design that you just pull on the bottom and the liquid comes out.</li>
      <li>So - if a dryer vent is a scent you enjoy - I recommend this!  </li>
      <li>Not so with the Gillette Bodywash; it&#x27;s more like a cream</li>
      <li>It is also a better value.  </li>
      <li>This bodywash is a not a gel like most.  </li>

      <li>If you have dry, itchy, and sometimes flaky skin, this body wash is perfect</li>
      <li>This Gillette bodywash is excellent for dry skin.</li>
      <li>In the begining it is very easy to squeeze it out and the cover is easy to handle and secure.</li>
      <li>This is where the product seems more like its primary role is as a skin hydrator rather than a bodywash.  </li>
      <li>Additionally, my skin is smooth after a shower, which doesn&#x27;t require me to lather more lotion on my skin to keep it hydrated.  </li>
      <li>the bottle is easy to grip in the shower...</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot, it rinses off easily, and the fragrance is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>How easily does it wash</li>
      <li>The bodywash foams up well and spreads easily over my skin using a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>Easy to Dispense&lt;br /&gt;(i)</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is decently strong during use but does not stay with your at all after your bath--for some folks this will be a plus (as you can let your deodorant and/or cologne not be overpowered but for others they will view this as a loss, requiring another product--further increasing the cost per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried this product expecting two things--that it would leave a strong manly scent and that it would be \\&quot;rough\\&quot; on my skin, even with it calling it</li>
      <li>The scent is strong, and man-cologne-like --</li>
      <li>To start off, this particular product has a good woodsy scent.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, a really fresh clean type smell (not fruity like some)</li>
      <li>It may be a little pricier than comparable products, but trust me, it is a real good value for your money.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great and efficient product.</li>
      <li>A very light-fresh scent tops it off nicely.</li>
      <li>/&gt;(I should state now that I am a woman, not a man -- but I often use man-scented products as I enjoy the scents.  </li>
      <li>Overall a very nice product.</li>
      <li>He likes the aroma, it gets him clean, and it makes his skin smooth (which I like).  </li>
      <li>This smells nice and works great, leaving the skin soft and smooth at the same time, who says men can&#x27;t take care of their skin...</li>
      <li>The scent is fresh and clean, and - more importantly - has a nice natural quality unlike some \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scents that betray their chemical origins.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind it, but I don&#x27;t get excited by it either.  </li>
      <li>It is rich and foamy and has a musky smell.</li>
      <li>( great excuse hehe)</li>
      <li>I am a person that loves to looks at packaging design, so the first thing I noticed was the interest and innovative design of the bottle.</li>
      <li>The body wash from Gillette washes off completely clean and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and hydrated without that slippery feeling.</li>
      <li>Gillette Bodywash produces plenty of lather and leaves your skin feeling clean without overdrying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need much to create a lot of suds and the liquid leaves my skin feeling very smooth after the shower.</li>
      <li>and it is used up very quickly, but if you have itchy/dry skin and want a slight clean scent, this body wash is great.  </li>
      <li>My son (early 20&#x27;s) liked the aroma, but he said it made his skin feel</li>
      <li>This body wash has a nice fragrance which is not overpowering and masculine.  </li>
      <li>overall a good and efficient product.</li>
      <li>more do you want from a body wash, really?</li>
      <li>It IS pretty strong, I noticed that myself upon opening it.</li>
      <li>1) Clean and fresh scent - gender neutral.</li>
      <li>The scent is great and the bodywash is something in between lotion and soap that really does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to: cleans and hydrates the skin at the same time.</li>
      <li>Luckily, [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>This is done specifically so that you won&#x27;t be able to take the top off, add a little water, shake the bottle, and get a couple more uses out of what remains in there.</li>
      <li>He has a pretty picky sniffer, so finding something he likes is a huge deal.  </li>
      <li>We are very satisfied with this product that is especially for men.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to lather the whole bod&#x27;, the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming (my gal likes it)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this stuff is worth a try.</li>
      <li>This kind of thing is petty and wasteful on the part of manufacturers, and I avoid such products.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I would only recommend this product if you don&#x27;t like using bar soap for some reason, and if you don&#x27;t like the smell of Axe bodywash.  </li>
      <li>the packaging alone is a pretty big issue considering that every package of bodywash comes in a big plastic bottle, but this is pretty convenient and some of the best soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I thinned  mine out and changed containers because by the time I could really get some out of the original container I probably needed two showers.</li>
      <li>At first it didn&#x27;t seem \\&quot;manly\\&quot; enough, but I realized the scent wasn&#x27;t flowery but more a clean smell.  </li>
      <li>I like the texture and frangrance of this Gilette Bodywash, and it seems to do a good job of gently cleansing the skin, but it&#x27;s effectiveness as a \\&quot;Dry Skin</li>
      <li>Bought a pack of 6 and gave 3 to my boy who like most in his age group seemed to appreciate it a little more than me.</li>
      <li>It is very slippery when I first smooth it on wet skin, then lathers up nicely.  </li>
      <li>and I did notice some kind of soothing effects (or was I just a victim of repeated commercials?)</li>
      <li>The scent is very pleasant and is very subtle.</li>
      <li>shaving cream foam (no surprise from \\&quot;Gillette\\&quot;) and a little bit of the stuff covers your body fairly</li>
      <li>The scent comes out strong in the shower, but is mild once I am done, so if you want a scent to stick, then I would get a cologne shower gel or just use regular cologne after showering.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a real good value for your money because a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>only downer is the stuff seems to go pretty quickly (one bottle can easily be gone within two or three weeks for a bodywash newb like me).</li>
      <li>His consensus: \\&quot;It&#x27;s pretty decent\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>and he definitely prefers this more.  </li>
      <li>so you will use more actual product them some competing products.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of bodywash over soap. Something about bodywash just seems a bit girly. But maybe that&#x27;s why Gillette put this bodywash in such a \\&quot;manly\\&quot; bottle with neutral colors and whatnot. The scent is great and the bodywash is something in between lotion and soap that really does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to: cleans and hydrates the skin at the same time. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m totally sold on bodywash over soap - the packaging alone is a pretty big issue considering that every package of bodywash comes in a big plastic bottle, but this is pretty convenient and some of the best soap I&#x27;ve used. Definitely a good product for someone looking for a non-girly bodywash that also acts as a lotion.</li>
    <li> 1) Clean and fresh scent - gender neutral. So now I have one product and the whole household use.  2) Lasts a long time. I have had it for more than 2 months with average 2.5 users daily.  3) The dispenser is at the bottom. In the begining it is very easy to squeeze it out and the cover is easy to handle and secure. Now there is less than 1/3 left. You must squeeze two times to get enough - like that&#x27;s a big deal!  overall a good and efficient product.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Bodywash has a very clean scent.  At first it didn&#x27;t seem \\&quot;manly\\&quot; enough, but I realized the scent wasn&#x27;t flowery but more a clean smell.  Kind of like standing outside your house near the dryer vent when the dryer is running with some fabric softener sheets in the load.      The bodywash lathers up nicely and you don&#x27;t need a ton to get the job done.  As for \\&quot;hydration\\&quot;, it does not dry my skin and seems to work as advertised.  It rinses off and does not leave you feeling like there is something still on you (like some \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; or \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; washes do).    So - if a dryer vent is a scent you enjoy - I recommend this!  If not - try another scent.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin from head to toe and this body wash is perfect.  I read through the 2-star reviews so I can refute/defend their claims.  One reviewer complained about how many chemicals/ingredients are in the wash, but none are known to be harmful.  One complained about the strong smell, but I found the smell of this wash to be quite tame compared to the vast majority of body washes out there(and even many soaps).  Another complained about the dispensing mechanism, which works by pulling out the bottom so that you can close the bottle by pushing it down on your shower shelf, is inconvenient, but it is actually convenient, gravity doesn&#x27;t close the bottle by itself, you have to push down slightly.  I agree that it doesn&#x27;t lather well in hard water and it is used up very quickly, but if you have itchy/dry skin and want a slight clean scent, this body wash is great.  Stay away from shampoo/body wash combinations, your skin and hair/scalp have different needs!</li>
    <li> I have a family member who suffers from extremely dry skin and eczema.  This results in a twice daily covering of lotion from head to toe.  When I saw this, I had to give this a try.  If it had a chance of being a good moisturizer, I could save someone a lot of trouble.    For starters, cleaning and moisturizing are not always two things that go well together.  Cleaning is typically removing something, while moisturizing is looking to prevent too much of the oils from coming away from the skin.  This often leads to products that don&#x27;t do either chore very well.  Not to setup a spoiler, but this product did OK on both counts.    As a body wash it did an alright job but the moisturizing qualities make it tough to feel you are really getting a deep clean like you do with a bar of soap.  But this is to be expected.  Remember, the purpose of this product is to clean without stripping all of the moisturizing qualities of your skin away and to add a little more to the skin.    As a moisturizer I would have to say it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  It actually smells really good (at least to me) and doesn&#x27;t leave you with that \\&quot;dry itch\\&quot; you can get, especially in the winter time.  It certainly isn&#x27;t the equivalent of a moisturizing lotion, but it isn&#x27;t supposed to be so that&#x27;s OK.  What it seems to do well is leave your skin in a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; state.  In other words, it&#x27;s not dry and it&#x27;s not greasy.  My opinion is that this strikes a good balance and works quite well.    Don&#x27;t expect this to negate the need for using an intermittent bar soap or other \\&quot;cleanser\\&quot;,  and you&#x27;ll still want to use something else in between the times you use Gillette Bodywash.  But, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work bad and the member of my family who also tried it said it seemed to make a difference (although with continued use it might work even better - it&#x27;s hard to tell with just one bottle&#x27;s worth to try).    One note of caution:  If you have a shower tub in your bathroom, be very careful.  The moisturizing nature of this stuff can make the bottom of your shower very slippery.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product and have used it to shower with for the past 6 or 7 showers. I&#x27;ve been using Nivea&#x27;s \\&quot;Energy\\&quot; liquid soap which also claims to hydrate. My feet have a problem of really drying out and getting scaly. Consequently, I have to put lots of moisturizing lotion on them or they look awful and are dry and crackly. Since using the Gillete Bodywash, Dry Skin Hydrator, my feet no longer require lotion. I read the ingredients and saw that the second ingredient (after water) is petroleum jelly. This stuff really does work for men that have dry skin problems. I will continue to use Nivea&#x27;s Facial scrub for men but for my bodywash, I am switching to this product.</li>
    <li> This bodywash is a not a gel like most.  Instead, it has a cream-like texture, which acts as a moisturizer as well.  Those who are left feeling dry after their showers should definitely give this one a spin.  A very light-fresh scent tops it off nicely.</li>
    <li> I took away one star because of the container, explanation to follow. The body wash is an excellent product, marketed for men but my husband and I both use it. The scent is fresh and clean, and - more importantly - has a nice natural quality unlike some \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scents that betray their chemical origins. It&#x27;s kind to your skin and, particularly if you&#x27;re a man who doesn&#x27;t ordinarily use products to moisten your skin, you&#x27;ll notice a change for the better in your skin quality within a few weeks. My husband likes this because it helps noticeably with his dry and itchy winter skin (on which he refuses to use a separate moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained that the product doesn&#x27;t last very long, and I find the container partly to blame for this. It&#x27;s made of a very hard plastic, difficult to squeeze effectively, and lots of the product remains in there and won&#x27;t come out even after prolonged shaking.  We don&#x27;t appreciate this kind of waste, so we used a heavy duty scissors to cut the container open after it wouldn&#x27;t yield any more product - because you could tell there was plenty in there but it just wouldn&#x27;t come out. We were surprised to find enough product remaining in the \\&quot;empty\\&quot; container for at least a week more use for both of us. There was a lot left in there!  The hole in the bottom wasn&#x27;t blocked, but it just wouldn&#x27;t come out. We object to these kinds of tricks on the part of manufacturers to get the consumer to throw away some of the product (and therefore buy it again sooner than they would otherwise). You&#x27;ll notice quite a few shampoo bottles are now made so that the top cannot be removed. This is done specifically so that you won&#x27;t be able to take the top off, add a little water, shake the bottle, and get a couple more uses out of what remains in there. This kind of thing is petty and wasteful on the part of manufacturers, and I avoid such products.</li>
    <li> I bought an 8.4 oz Gillette Bodywash Hydrator &amp; Body Wash from Targ&amp;eacute;t a few months ago because I liked the fragrance and decided to give it a try. It kind of smells like Axe Essence Deodorant Spray. The body wash leaves a just a hint of the fragrance on your body after you shower so the fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering. The Gillette Bodywash not only smells great, it has a few other pluses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Good Value for Money&lt;br /&gt;The 8.4 oz bottle I bought actually lasted 4 months! I reckon the 12 oz bottle will last for about 6 months or so. A little goes a long way - I use about 2 or 3 pea-sized squirts on my loofa and that&#x27;s enough to produce a lot of lather. It may be a little pricier than comparable products, but trust me, it is a real good value for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to Dispense&lt;br /&gt;(i) A lot of shower gels are very drippy. They can leave a mess or run off your sponge (or whatever implement you use to shower with). Not so with the Gillette Bodywash; it&#x27;s more like a cream so it won&#x27;t drip and leave a mess. (ii) The dispenser is easy to open and close. You don&#x27;t have flip open and close a hinged cap. Rather, you simply slide the cap out to open and slide it back in to close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans without Over-drying&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Bodywash produces plenty of lather and leaves your skin feeling clean without overdrying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Smells Great&lt;br /&gt;Did I say it smells great?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Bodywash Hydrator &amp; Body Wash is a superb shower gels that smells great and cleans well without overdrying your skin. It&#x27;s also a real good value for your money because a little goes a long way. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> My husband and sons tried this body wash. Here is their breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Nice container&lt;br /&gt;*Creamy lotion&lt;br /&gt;*Good lather&lt;br /&gt;*Rinses well&lt;br /&gt;*Pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more do you want from a body wash, really? After they used it, they did smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+ from mom and wife.</li>
    <li> We are very satisfied with this product that is especially for men.  The scent is wonderful and matches perfectly with the deodorant line.  My husband finds that with the use of this soap it is not necessary for him to apply deodorant.  Not sure if this is a rare occurence but it is happening to my husband; which is another positive for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the \\&quot;Dry Skin Hydrator\\&quot;, my husband does not necessarily suffer from dry skin all the time, only during certain times of the year.  His skin feels very soft and supple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it is a very thick body wash which needs to be applied to either a wash cloth or loofah.  That way you will be able to evenly distribute the wash and use a lesser amount opposed to putting it on your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for the sexy man in your life!</li>
    <li> Several months back I reviewed Nivea&#x27;s entry into the male body-wash sweepstakes. Everything about it was wrong -- the bottle was hard to hold and pour from, the odor was not particularly appealing, and the cleansing agent -- which was hard to rinse off -- seemed not-far-removed from dishwashing liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette gets pretty much everything right. The bottle sides are concave and ribbed; no matter how soapy your hands are, you&#x27;re unlikely to drop the bottle. The cap is on the /bottom/, so you don&#x27;t have to wait for the contents to flow down. And the cap is broad, so the bottle stays put and rarely tips over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing agent is like a thin mousse, and the small nozzle makes it easy to squeeze exactly the amount you want, so you don&#x27;t waste it. You don&#x27;t need a lot, it rinses off easily, and the fragrance is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the best thing about Gillete Bodywash appears on the ingredients label. The second ingredient (the first being water, the same as in almost every bathing/shampoo product) is petrolatum -- petroleum jelly. Though I&#x27;ve never complainted about Lever 2000 drying my skin, Gillette Bodywash definitely moisturizes it better, and I itch less, and less often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how the per-use cost compares with bar soap, but I suspect they&#x27;re comparable, if you don&#x27;t go crazy squirting it all over your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> The negative first: It took me a couple showers to figure out the darn lid - where and how the soap comes out. And I got two college degrees!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that challenge, I found the product nice. It doesn&#x27;t take much to lather the whole bod&#x27;, the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming (my gal likes it), it suds nicely and gets me clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy it again...especially now that I got the lid figured out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rated by a guy who takes daily showers.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I both love using this bodywash. It is rich and foamy and has a musky smell. I have also noticed that I use less lotion nowadays and my legs would not be dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is something to get used to as it can get very strong in the shower but after you get used to it, the musky smell can be really relaxing and makes the shower experience even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the bottle was something for me to get used to at first but I love the design that you just pull on the bottom and the liquid comes out. It helps to utilize every last drop.</li>
    <li> This body wash (a.k.a soap) has a masculine aroma that my husband likes.  He has a pretty picky sniffer, so finding something he likes is a huge deal.  I think the scent is typical of what you&#x27;d expect from something by Gillette- masculine without being overwhelming.  It does the job.</li>
    <li> Technically the product does everything it&#x27;s says which would typically involve at least 4 stars from me, but in the case of the Gillette bodywash, I&#x27;m just not convinced how it&#x27;s better than a normal bar of soap (which costs CONSIDERABLY less).  With Axe bodywash at least you are getting the advantage of the Axe signature scent, but with the Gillette there is no such advantage.  Honestly, I would only recommend this product if you don&#x27;t like using bar soap for some reason, and if you don&#x27;t like the smell of Axe bodywash.  Otherwise stay away.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from the Vine Program for my husband and son.  My husband, who has dry skin, loves it.  He likes the aroma, it gets him clean, and it makes his skin smooth (which I like).  My son (early 20&#x27;s) liked the aroma, but he said it made his skin feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal or oily skin, you probably won&#x27;t like this.  If, however, you&#x27;ve got dry skin, this will get you clean without drying out your skin.</li>
    <li> Since this is for a male, I picked this for my husband, let him use it a few times, and report back to me. His consensus: \\&quot;It&#x27;s pretty decent\\&quot;. The first thing he mentioned was that it is very strong, scent wise. Almost cologne-like, he explained. He said you&#x27;d have to get used to it. It IS pretty strong, I noticed that myself upon opening it. Also, he mentions he likes the fact that it lasts for a good part of the day, which is good if you like the smell of it. Not sure how it works in the moisture department. My husband doesn&#x27;t have dry skin, but there&#x27;s no complaints either so all in all, I would say it is a highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> My husband uses Old Spice deoderant and body wash.  I received this and made him try it and he definitely prefers this more.  Plus I think he smells better!!  It is also a better value.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> Here we have a thick, opaque shower gel/cream.  It is very slippery when I first smooth it on wet skin, then lathers up nicely.  The scent is strong, and man-cologne-like -- I don&#x27;t mind it, but I don&#x27;t get excited by it either.  It is reminiscent of modern men&#x27;s colognes with words like \\&quot;blue,\\&quot; \\&quot;sport,\\&quot; or \\&quot;water\\&quot; in their names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I should state now that I am a woman, not a man -- but I often use man-scented products as I enjoy the scents.  I tend to like things like Curve for men, Drakar Noir, etc. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this soap lingers on my skin for several hours, but after drying my skin out of the shower I have to really sniff to find it, but that may be because my nerve endings were already dulled from the intense scent experience in the shower itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still need to use lotion after showering with this, but if I forgot for a day, my skin would be ok.  This gel doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as much as typical clear ones do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this for those who don&#x27;t mind strongly scented shower gels, and desire less drying-out of their skin in the shower.</li>
    <li> When it comes to these body washes, I review them by 3 basic criteria:&lt;br /&gt;1. How well does it go on?&lt;br /&gt;2. How easily does it wash off?&lt;br /&gt;3. How does it leave my skin afterwards?  Any breakouts?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Gillette bodywash is a decent product.  It has a pleasant and not overpowering smell, and it meets expectations in my 3 criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The bodywash foams up well and spreads easily over my skin using a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This is where the product seems more like its primary role is as a skin hydrator rather than a bodywash.  The product leaves a bit of a greasy residue behind, and thus does not wash off as well as bar soap such as Lever 2000.  This was expected, however, considering that the product boasts \\&quot;Dry Skin Hydrator\\&quot; above \\&quot;Body Wash\\&quot;.  This can be problematic for some people with sensitive skin, so take this as a word of warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Despite leaving the greasy, moisturizer-like residue, I did not experience any adverse skin reactions such as acne breakouts even after a week of use.  The skin hydrator part certainly did its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product somewhat difficult to rate.  It really came down to how valuable this product is for use on a regular basis.  As a product to use every day, I would give this product 3 stars, but as a product that you use on occasion when you skin is dry, I would give it 5 stars.  For every day use, never feeling like you have washed yourself clean of the soap is an annoying feeling.  But when your skin is dry, say after sunburn, then this product would definitely leave me satisfied.  So, I give it 4 stars.  But I don&#x27;t think this product is particularly suited for general use.</li>
    <li> I am a person that loves to looks at packaging design, so the first thing I noticed was the interest and innovative design of the bottle. It took me a minute to figure out, but all you have to do in order to dispense the body wash is just pull down the plastic tab and squeeze. The gel comes out of an opening on the tab, so you don&#x27;t need to keep tipping the bottle when the supply gets low. No more snapping caps or popping tops! The body wash itself has a strage look: grayish-blue and a bit foamy, but it has a great scent. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in the softness of my skin, per se, but that wasn&#x27;t really one of the selling points for me. Overall, it&#x27;s a great and efficient product.</li>
    <li> This Gillette bodywash is excellent for dry skin. I&#x27;ve been using this bodywash for 3 weeks, and my skin has seen effective moisturizing results. Additionally, my skin is smooth after a shower, which doesn&#x27;t require me to lather more lotion on my skin to keep it hydrated.  Aside the product&#x27;s quality, the smell is an additional perk.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend but pretty soon I was slathering it on myself - with his permission of course, hey I had to review it after all( great excuse hehe)....    I really loved it, the wash is silky smooth and lathers into plenty of cleansing bubbles without stripping moisture away...I think people who are used to soap and the tight extra clean feeling they get, find a moisturizing body wash strange, but sapping all moisture from the skin with soap is not good, if you don&#x27;t moisturize afterwards all that water is escaping and creating wrinkles and discomfort. My boyfriend really liked this, he never uses any lotions but sometimes the skin on his upper back hurts as he says and I have to massage it with thick creams because it&#x27;s in distress, but after using this for a while he doesn&#x27;t need the cream as much, which I don&#x27;t mind putting on but I&#x27;m happy that his skin isn&#x27;t bothering him anymore.     This smells nice and works great, leaving the skin soft and smooth at the same time, who says men can&#x27;t take care of their skin...I think it&#x27;s hardly vanity and more of a necessity to take care of one self.</li>
    <li> The presentation is like a hollywood movie, all bells and whistles. The actual soap seems a little reluctant to come out, kind of thick texture that makes it a little tedious dispensing on a regular basis. I thinned  mine out and changed containers because by the time I could really get some out of the original container I probably needed two showers. The hydration part is always welcome and I did notice some kind of soothing effects (or was I just a victim of repeated commercials?) Bought a pack of 6 and gave 3 to my boy who like most in his age group seemed to appreciate it a little more than me. Yes, the concept of hydration and body wash still intrigues me together with liquid soap or heavy cream, like in this case. Would I buy again? Probably will try a couple more competitors that have appeared on the tube to my continuous delight and enlightenment. The fact of the matter is that commercials of this kind are looking so good these days I just can&#x27;t get enough and apparently my wallet is game. I am a sucker for great advertisement and sooner or later I will buy so please do not get me wrong. 3.5 (disguised as a 4) stars for Gillette Bodywash, Dry Skin Hydrator &amp; Body Wash, 12-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6).</li>
    <li> I admit it, I have dry skin around my joints! I am also a self-conscious man and far too insecure to use the flower-scented lotions and creams my wife uses, so it&#x27;s Gillette Bodywash to the rescue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff dispenses like (and sort of smells like) shaving cream foam (no surprise from \\&quot;Gillette\\&quot;) and a little bit of the stuff covers your body fairly thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;d hope, it seems to work and make my dry, chapped skin a little softer come bath day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downer is the stuff seems to go pretty quickly (one bottle can easily be gone within two or three weeks for a bodywash newb like me). Maybe you can more efficiently spread it over your body if you use a lufa sponge or something, but I&#x27;m not ready to toss in my man badge and use one of those just yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this stuff is worth a try.</li>
    <li> For about ten years now, I have been using body wash (my wife made me give up bar soap because of soap scum). Through the years, there have been some decent attempts to penetrate the Body Wash Male market, but none really have succeeded. This, however, has now changed with the introduction of Gillette body wash and hydrator. Just a few drops give you a great lather, and also provide a great scent. Aside from the body wash, the hydrator did help my hands quite a bit (they are usually dry). For any male that has given up hope on a good Body Wash, look no further. This is the product you need to purchase.</li>
    <li> This body wash has a nice fragrance which is not overpowering and masculine.  It also lathers a lot, which I really like. I also like the way the bottle is made, because you pull it open on the bottom to squirt it out.  Bottles which open on the top eventually have to be turned upside-down to get all of the gel out, and can sometimes be messy.  Overall a very nice product.</li>
    <li> I gave this to the guys in the house to try!  They all gave it a thumbs UP after a few days. They all liked the fragrance and it didn&#x27;t leave them dried out.  I would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I like the texture and frangrance of this Gilette Bodywash, and it seems to do a good job of gently cleansing the skin, but it&#x27;s effectiveness as a \\&quot;Dry Skin Hydator\\&quot; is questionable.    While I don&#x27;t have a serious dry skin problem, I do notice some minor flakiness now and then. After using this product for a week or so, there was no noticeable improvement. The wash is gentle enough not to make matters worse, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that provides a moisturizing effect, you&#x27;ll need a good dry skin lotion for that.    The packaging gets high marks for convenience and ease of use in the shower. You simply pull down on the base to open and dispense the product, then push it back up to close. You may find, though, that a small amount of residual product remains on the base, which might be a problem if you store it in a cabinet rather than leaving it in the shower.</li>
    <li> OK, since this is a body wash, I can&#x27;t say much other than it does what it claims...oh no wait, I can...because it really doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate my skin any more than any other body wash I&#x27;ve tried.  Granted, my skin isn&#x27;t dry to begin with, but it doesn&#x27;t seem any different.  And that&#x27;s really all I have to say about this one... It smells nice, a really fresh clean type smell (not fruity like some) the bottle is easy to grip in the shower...I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I tried this product expecting two things--that it would leave a strong manly scent and that it would be \\&quot;rough\\&quot; on my skin, even with it calling it a hydrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well much to my surprise, it didn&#x27;t do either of those. Instead Gillette created a subtle smelling, gentle body wash that does seem to actually help relieve mild dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lavthers decently but does not create a lot of suds so you will use more actual product them some competing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is decently strong during use but does not stay with your at all after your bath--for some folks this will be a plus (as you can let your deodorant and/or cologne not be overpowered but for others they will view this as a loss, requiring another product--further increasing the cost per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to clean decently and for me (with very dry skin) it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave me feeling dirty (nor stripped dry) like some products do. But if you have normal to oily skin, this product is NOT FOR YOU as it will leave a film on your skin. If you doubt this, attempt to use the product for making bubbles in a bath tub. Unlike most body washes like AXE, this product doesn&#x27;t make many bubbles and instead forms little blue balls that will stick to the edges of the tub. Those balls is what is left on your skin when you use the product normally--something that is good for folks with very dry skin but bad for others that have healthier skin oil production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product for men AND women with dry skin--don&#x27;t let the brand scare you away, but understand are paying extra for the hydration via more usage and zero remaining scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now. I didn&#x27;t think my skin used to be dry until I used this product, and what a difference between 6 months ago and now! I am drawn to Gillette&#x27;s products because they are specifically designed for men in all aspects. This body wash is no different. It didn&#x27;t give me immediate results, but after about 2-3 weeks of use I could tell my skin was a lot smoother and healthier looking than before. I live in FL where the summers are hot and humid and the winters are warm and dry, and this product covers all my bases. Before this product I used Old Spice&#x27;s Double Impact body wash which made my skin feel slippery rather than hydrated. After some research, I found out that the Double Impact has the &#x27;left behind&#x27; effect which is when a body wash leaves an invisible layer of soap scum on your skin. The body wash from Gillette washes off completely clean and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and hydrated without that slippery feeling. The scent is very pleasant and is very subtle. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you are relying on it as your only source of scent. It allows you to put on a cologne and scented deodorant without smelling like you just took a bath in Calvin Klein products. I also LOVE how everything is dispensed from the bottom with a pull down stopper, so there&#x27;s no messy caps to deal with. The bottle also has little grips on the side to prevent any slipping. Overall, a great product that I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lotions to do something about my dry and itchy skin. Most of them only work for a few hours. Luckily, [[ASIN:B0019ZD61A Gillette Dry Skin Hydrator &amp; Body Wash]] has solved that problem.     The texture is very creamy like conditioner and it moisturizes like conditioner.     If you have dry, itchy, and sometimes flaky skin, this body wash is perfect</li>
    <li> To start off, this particular product has a good woodsy scent. The liquid is very smooth and resembles the thickness of hair conditioner. I don&#x27;t need much to create a lot of suds and the liquid leaves my skin feeling very smooth after the shower. The scent comes out strong in the shower, but is mild once I am done, so if you want a scent to stick, then I would get a cologne shower gel or just use regular cologne after showering.</li>
