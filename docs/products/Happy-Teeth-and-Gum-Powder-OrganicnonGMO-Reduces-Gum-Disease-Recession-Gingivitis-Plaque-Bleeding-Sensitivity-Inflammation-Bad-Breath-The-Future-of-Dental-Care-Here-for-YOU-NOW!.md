<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am not sure bcause I ended up with an absessed tooth just two weeks after using it twice daily. But my breath felt fresher in the mornings.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great - threw out my Crest. I am going to order some for friends and family. Get the kit - powder and mouth wash. View the Youtube video to learn which products are used together.</li>
    <li> I want to thank you for your prompt and professional customer service, and for this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Since receiving the product I have been using several times a day and my teeth and gums feel amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Squeaky clean, like I just left the hygienist chair. And super fresh breath too! I like the taste as well.&lt;br /&gt;I use a clean :) and dry toothpick to put a small amount (1/8 tsp) into a very small cup, then take my slightly&lt;br /&gt;wet toothbrush and dip into the powder. I can&#x27;t wait for my next dental check up! I will follow up then.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> For my situation this did not work much better than my $8.69 tube of TheraNeem Mint Toothpaste . Neem works pretty good on gum problems too. I would suggest others try Neem 1st ( because this is so pricey) &amp;amp; see if it works. i must say this does get the teeth clean.</li>
    <li> save yore money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make my teeth yellow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not advise purchased</li>
    <li> I am sure it&#x27;s a great product BUT I didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting my teeth/mouth as clean as when I was using tooth paste. My mouth never got that minty feeling afterward either. I even tried changing up how much I used to see if less or more would make a difference and I was just kinda stuck in a state of &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;awe&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> even though it is a powder and a little messy in our hands, I bought it to help tighten up my husbands  teeth that were loose. He has seen an improvement in the integrity of his gums, and he is pleased</li>
    <li> This product has definitely helped reduce the accumulation of tartar. I use the powder after brushing with my regular toothpaste, and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wish I had found this years ago- I drink a lot of tea and coffee and I could tell a difference within a week-do yourself a favor- if you drink a lot of tea/coffee or smoke,buy it now!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Gum and teeth pain is gone in less than a week! No more bleeding as well! I&#x27;m very grateful!</li>
    <li> I now use this only.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month and have not noticed any difference or improvement.</li>
    <li> Great product. Just wish it was a little more affordable. But I will buy again in the future</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this tooth powder. I have been using it for several years now, along with the Happy Teeth &amp; Gum Mouth Wash. I have periodontal disease, and almost immediately after starting to use these two products, my dental hygienists noticed a difference. I have had nothing but good check-ups (and I go every three months!) since I started this routine. I brush my teeth with regular toothpaste first thing in the morning, and then after meals whenever I can. I use the Happy Teeth and Gum Powder at night before bedtime, then floss (my second flossing of the day), and then the Mouth Wash. It leaves my mouth tasting and feeling fresh, and gives my dental hygienists very little to complain about any more!!!</li>
    <li> I have started using this product about a week ago so I cannot say much about it but I am planning to keep using this. I had a small issue with my gum-occasionally it was bleeding if I pushed my toothbrush a little harder to get stuff out of my teeth when using around the molas. I changed my toothbrush and toothpaste at the same time. I purchase my new toothbrushes from abcOralCare at Amazon and this combination(new powder and toothbrush) changed my oral hygen 180 degrees. No more bleeding, no more sharp pain, and I am so happy with my purchases.  And I just feel it&#x27;s getting whiter as well as I see no plague building on my teeth. I will update my review later if I see any difference after using product a while. But for now, I am very very happy.</li>
    <li> Great taste, my periodontist is happy that I found this.</li>
    <li> I like this teeth and gum powder, although I don&#x27;t know how much good it&#x27;s doing me. Maybe I would be able to tell better if I&#x27;d started using it before I had caused myself major dental concerns by putting off going to the dentist! I &#x27;do have an abcess on my upper gum, and using this has kept it at bay long enough for our dentist to try to take care of some other problems which are more pressing. If I hadn&#x27;t been using this I AM sure it would be worse - because it was before I started using the Happy Teeth and Gum Powder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had SO many bad experiences with dentists over the years, and then add to it that it&#x27;s super expensive, but I know that&#x27;s no reason to put it off so long I just lost a tooth! I had 3 teeth which had been crowned, but the crowns fell off (after many years). I put off going to the dentist long enough that it became a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried many different things, trying to put this off, and the Happy Teeth is the thing which worked the best. Now I&#x27;m back to the dentist, trying to get my dental issues sorted out, and I&#x27;ll continue to use this powder because it has everything in it that most Ayurvedic oral health care products call for. AND because my teeth feel as clean as just after I&#x27;ve had them professionally cleaned after I brush with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product .... and not putting off going to the dentist!</li>
    <li> Every time I brush with this it feels like I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist! This is hands down the best toothpaste I have ever used and the only one I will ever use from now on. Love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of aryuvedic and alternative remedies. This does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar of Happy Teeth and Gum Powder. My teeth are noticeably whiter, gums are pinker, rarely any bleeding when I brush. I like the taste of it and plan to continue using this product!  Label looks a little cheesy... but the powder works. A jar lasts me almost 3 months, so not a bad value either.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about using &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products because they never have produced much results and I was getting tired of trying things that did not work. But, I am so glad I went ahead with this product because I had five problematic areas in my mouth that had been causing me all kinds of issues for years. When I started using this powder and the other powder and mouthwash, to my relief, three of the problem areas are resolved. Once the other two are resolved I will change the three stars to five stars. Also, as a side benefit, my teeth got a shade whiter.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, greatly reduced the number of cavities I was getting, along with taking higher doses of progesterone. (Progesterone prevents the formation of plaque.) Product is pleasant to use. I like the taste and I even like the grittiness. Leaves my teeth feeling clean, and the grit (if you leave a little bit in your mouth after rinsing) helps make flossing more effective.</li>
    <li> .Wanted to try a dental powder and tried this.  Like it very much and will order again.  Teeth feel very clean and gums feel and look healthy.</li>
    <li> I was using the tooth brush with it and it wasn&#x27;t doing nothing. Then decided to go online to see how others were using it and recommending it and started using my finger, leaving it on while watching tv and then scrubbing with a tooth brush and rinsing. Works much better that way now. No pockets on the gums now and starting to see less bleeding and the gums turning pink again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Just had my teeth cleaned (it&#x27;s been 8 months since the last cleaning): hardly any build up on teeth with use of this product. Fastest cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had and dentist and hygienist were both impressed with the shape of my teeth. Love the feeling of smooth, clean teeth after using this product.</li>
    <li> I love that the product is non-gmo. I like the product but haven&#x27;t used long enough to tell how well it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> It makes my teeth white.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to the texture, but I love the taste, and how my teeth feel after brushing.  It takes a while to adjust to change at my age!  LOL. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and will continue to use, at least until it runs out.  I love that it is all natural, and that it comes in a recyclable container.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to a couple other people, and they seem to like it as well.</li>
    <li> Very noticeable improvement on my gums, dental exam showed huge improvement on my gingivitis.</li>
    <li> I like this product so far, thanks</li>
    <li> We love this Happy Teeth &amp; Gums powder, but one gets so little for so much money!  It is good stuff.  I wish the price would come down or one would get more product!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try it, and after about a month of use I threw it away because my teeth turned yellow! The taste was fine and it wasn&#x27;t hard to use but it did not work at all, and certainly was not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping for many results, and so far so good with removing a canker sore that was on my gum line. The products really are best used together I think, not just one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why other reviewers said it was yellow? Mine was creamy colored, and has not stained my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Gave one star because I still have problems, but it&#x27;s been only a couple weeks, so I&#x27;ll send in another review in another month and give more stars ⭐️ once more of my dental issues are resolved.&lt;br /&gt;I like the taste.&lt;br /&gt;Old fashioned powder though... Not paste.</li>
    <li> I like this tooth powder a lot. My teeth did not get that brilliant white you get from chemicals, but they did get a natural white. Also, my mouth feels cleaner after using this powder than with any other other tooth product I&#x27;ve used. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to have a dental check-up to report, but I&#x27;ll keep using it and find out.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 18 months ago and I only regret that it was&lt;br /&gt;not available before this time as it would have saved me from having a couple of&lt;br /&gt;root canals, tooth extractions, as well as a lot of money in dental bills.&lt;br /&gt;After brushing my teeth they feel nice and smooth as if I had just had a professional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;My dental check-ups have been extended from 3 months to 6 months and even&lt;br /&gt;then my teeth are in great condition with very little cleaning necessary.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, according to my dentist one of my lower back teeth was quite loose&lt;br /&gt;and that it would only be a matter of time until it needed to be extracted.&lt;br /&gt;Well, my gums have tightened and my tooth is still in place.</li>
    <li> So I had a cleaning in November, by the dentist not an actual hygienist. My mouth just did not feel clean like I have always known afterwards. I also bit my tongue and drank so much OJ in the days to follow... So it turned into a painful canker. Anyhow, I happened upon this by divine intervention (cause I was not looking for it) - read all great things and I am a sucker for natural products! I ordered, got it fast (thanks A.Prime), used it and even with the painful canker my mouth felt fresh and new like a hygienist just hooked me up! The canker immediately began to heal and I am tres happy I got this! I have told 4 people&lt;br /&gt;About it and plan to share with many! I am grateful for this stuff. It&#x27;s a little thing but it makes life a lot better! ;)</li>
    <li> I tried this on a whim thinking the claims were overhyped.  I&#x27;m a bit of a skeptic.  But I have to eat my words!  I am pleasantly surprised at how good my teeth and gums look after using this.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and even tried making my own, but this formula can&#x27;t be outdone.  Thank you for great product!</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by the whole non-GMO aspect because finding a legitimate natural alternative is a task. I suppose it works ok but I, personally, am not a big fan. The powder feels like it has cleaned but it just looks like i haven&#x27;t brushed..in a while..apparently there may be some discoloring with this product..? I don&#x27;t intend to knock this for anyone else trying to find a less chemical-laden product for their teeth but I don&#x27;t know if I will finish my jar. I try to alternate with this product with a baking soda paste but wouldn&#x27;t use it on its own. As far as gum and teeth health, ehh..same difference as my paste I guess. My gums can be sensitive at times but it isn&#x27;t as if that came to a screeching halt when I was using this stuff, I don&#x27;t know if I really noticed any change on that front. To each his own though, I wish others better luck with this product.</li>
    <li> Since using Happy Teeth and Gum powder my sensitive teeth are not  sensitive.  I ran out of it and used a my old  toothpaste and after the first brushing with my old toothpaste my teeth felt sensitive. I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist since using it so I don&#x27;t know if it is helping my receding gums  or not. I like the way it leaves my mouth feeling.I will keep using it in hopes it will help my gums.</li>
    <li> It should come in another form other than powder. . But taste great</li>
    <li> This is not anything like toothpaste.  So if you purchase this be ready to put a gritty powder on your tooth brush.  The smell is nice, you can tell there are good herbs in there, the color makes you worry it may turn your teeth brown, but it won&#x27;t.  If anything your teeth become a natural white. Not a brilliant (fake) white, but your natural white tooth color.  Because it is gritty, it&#x27;s like your teeth are being exfoliated.  I plan on continuing to use this as long as they keep making it.  Paste or  gel and fluoride  is bad for your teeth and gums... This is the natural way it was meant to be for dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have tried a few toothpast powders that are pretty foul This one tastes great even my 4 year old and 7 year old have converted to using this. Definatly makes my teeth feel clean afterwards. My only complaint is that you need to put the powder in your hand and then apply it onto your toothbrush, you cant dip directly into the jar or the powder hardens and you lose a lot of this powder. My kids always dip their wet toothbrushes into the jar and it is a bit frustrating. Isnt there another way to get this applied??? Other than that love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ll have to tell the truth - this stuff tastes vile!  But - and this is the important thing - after using it for a couple of weeks, I had the best dental check-up/cleaning that I&#x27;ve ever had!  So - I&#x27;ll just have to keep on using it, I guess.  I recommend it, but just be prepared - it does not taste good in any shape, form, or fashion!!!</li>
    <li> I just got back from my dentist. I can&#x27;t believe that I actually was having a good time sitting in the chair. Now, that was a FIRST!!! I have been using your Happy Teeth and Gum Kit for over a year now and each time by dentist visits have gotten better. And, believe me, this quite a miracle because I started off in a bad place. It was so bad, I was going to my dentist ever 3 months. Every time I went they would lecture me on my poor dental hygiene.  Well, today, I can say, for the first time in my life, both my dentist and hygienist said that whatever I was doing, I should keep it up and that I was doing a good job at taking care of my teeth. They said that my gums even looked strong and healthy, which was never the case before now. I really noticed that this time too because when the hygienist used that big needle like instrument to go over the gum line, I was not shooting my legs up to the roof in pain. Happy Teeth and Gums--you have made something that was really bad....into something really good. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Taste like burn herbs.  Very gritty like rocky sand.  So hard to use I&#x27;ve seen no benefits.  I am going to mix it with coconut oil to see if I can improve the experience.</li>
    <li> nice long lasting cleaning sensación</li>
    <li> After 3 years of using the Happy Teeth powder, I finally made an appointment to get my teeth cleaned. I asked my dental hygienist how my teeth looked and if she had any suggestions, and she said, \\&quot;Whatever you&#x27;re doing, keep doing it! There&#x27;s virtually no plaque, I&#x27;ve only removed some stains.\\&quot; In the bay next door, I heard the hygienist setting up another 6-month appointment for her client - and it had been 3 years for me! Not only are my teeth squeaky clean but my gums are pink and healthy and no longer get sore and prone to bleeding. Yay Healthy Teeth - use it and save yourself some major dental bills. And you&#x27;ll get to keep your teeth into old age too.</li>
    <li> I went from very bad to very good dental check-ups with this product. At first, I was not sure about using the powder, but after using it a few times, I got so I actually looked forward to brushing my teeth with it because my teeth felt like I just had them cleaned at the dentist. I also recommend the mouthwash. I could drink that stuff. The company tells me that it is so pure that if I did drink it -- it would be healthy for me. Of course, they don&#x27;t recommend doing that.</li>
    <li> I am on my 4th order of Happy Teeth and Gum Powder.  I can only say &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34;.  I have suffered from gum problems most of my adult life and I always considered  the reason to be  stemming from sinuses&lt;br /&gt;That still holds true, however almost immediately after starting to use this product I experienced relief&lt;br /&gt;from sore and inflamed gums.  When I was growing up I used Colgate Tooth Powder and I never had a problem.  Yes, I&#x27;m that old. Eventually, one could only buy toothpaste. I ran out of the Happy Teeth and Gum Powder and went down to the local Health Food Store to  get something to clean my teeth while waiting for my order to arrive.  I could only find toothpaste.  After using this &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; product, I started experiencing problems again. I&#x27;ve come to the realization that it is toothpaste that is the problem.  There is something in toothpaste that inflames my gums.  I am so happy I found this product.  The name is so apropos.  Thank you so much for creating this wonderful powder.  Mahalo nui loa.</li>
    <li> great taste! my teeth feel polished and very clean.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well!</li>
    <li> How much was everyone paid for there great review. This stuff did nothing.  I&#x27;m not one to leave a review but people should be warned. If you want to brush your teeth with dirt go in your back yard and put it in a jar. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s like. Sand scratching at your teeth. It did nothing that it claimed good luck to anyone that purchases and wastes there money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s o.k., not sure if i&#x27;ll buy again.  It&#x27;s compacted in the jar and if you loosen it too much will spill out.  Get yourself a little scoop or something.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything spectacular happen with my teeth.  Taste wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for several days. It is too soon yet to notice any improvement.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice ANY difference! Actually seemed to make my teeth much more worse!</li>
    <li> This is a very unusual way to brush the teeth , I have to say that I was reluctant to use it. In France where I am from we do have some toothpaste made with clay and it is very commonly used. I had to get used to the powder aspect but now I cannot imagine using another product.&lt;br /&gt;I have had  a lot of teeth issues and I believe that this Happy Teeth and Gum is helping me keeping the remaining teeth I have in good health.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it clean but it is also very nourishing to the gum and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I am a health practitioner and I recommend to my clients this product with no restriction. I have received so many thank you for introducing this product to them. The results are very diverse and generally people get more benefits that they were expecting - for example whitening of the teeth.</li>
    <li> A great natural backpackers tooth powder. Tastes great and lasts a long time. You can rinse knowing that you are not poisoning the earth. No fluoride which makes this poison free.</li>
    <li> After finding out I was allergic to normal toothpaste --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- then finding out what unhealthy stuff was *in* toothpaste --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to have come across this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve made my own tooth powder for years, but my home-made stuff tasted horrible.  This little jar is actually pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> Saw no improvement with receding gums</li>
    <li> I turned to this product for several reasons: The green part of it, that it is non-toxic, my teeth sensitivity, no flouride and it&#x27;s tarter control. I really love this product. I have always been very diligent with my oral hygiene. I go to the dentist every 6 months. I brush 2 times a day however I was advised to brush 3 times a day because of my insane tarter production, and of course there is the vain side of me that wants perfectly white teeth.  Then one day I made the mistake of falling asleep with Crest whitening strips in my mouth. My teeth have never been the same as I now have horrible teeth sensitivity and I can no longer whiten my teeth with anything unless I am put under (literally) and have it done through the dentist, followed with pain pills. I decided that route for vanity was a little nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found this product to help relieve my sensitivity and I really like the texture and mild refreshing mint flavor. I was not expecting this product to whiten my teeth as I was more concerned about my sensitivity and gum recession yet it is whitening my teeth beautifully. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that perk! I am very pleasantly pleased with the product on so many levels. I am very thankful to have found it and I will use it for as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably good but it does not taste yum, and don&#x27;t expect foam.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping , great product , theeth more clean with a great taste</li>
    <li> I was hesitant when I read the reviews for this tooth powder if it would really do everything that was claimed.  But I had gotten away from using paste instead of powder as I felt my teeth and gums were a lot cleaner and in better health.  I decided to give this product a try and was glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste isn&#x27;t that great, but the smell of cinnamon is very nice and a change from the usual mint flavors that one has in tooth products.  It didn&#x27;t take much to clean my teeth, though I will warn anyone using it for the first time that it does not foam up like a lot of tooth pastes.  But it did a good job of making my mouth feel clean and my teeth were squeaky clean.  The best thing that did happen is that my dentist was very happy with the condition of my teeth and gums and said it was the best they had ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product and will say that it seems to be lasting a long time so the price is very reasonable for the amount of cleanings it is providing.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had your gums sore and bleeding when you brush them, you know it&#x27;s kind of scarey! And when your dentist refers you to a periodontist who wants to schedule surgery you know it&#x27;s way past time to find an effective remedy elsewhere. This incredible Happy Teeth and Gum Powder is not only delicious and easy to use, it&#x27;s very effective in awakening the body&#x27;s innate intelligence to restore gums to their robustly healthy condition. I no longer have bleeding gums, no more &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; in my gums, my breath smells sweet, and my teeth are getting whiter.&lt;br /&gt;All the ingredients are organic. Even the bottle is made of lead free glass.I give a solid WOW for the Happy Teeth and Gum Powder!!!</li>
    <li> No more bleeding and the taste is good.</li>
    <li> I used this product and was disappointed.  After brushing my teeth with it, it didn&#x27;t give me that clean, freshly brushed teeth feeling I get with regular toothpaste.  I did notice, however, that it made my senstive tooth not feel as sensitive, so I resorted to brushing my teeth with the powder first, then following up with regular toothpaste to get that clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Still trying to justify why I paid this much for this tooth powder.  I would like to wait to post my comment until my husband and I have used the jar up.  I have not really noticed anything different, still waiting for the magic to happen.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This is very interesting product. A novelty for me, surprisingly very satisfying sensation while cleaning my teeth. Will keep using to see the results. Like the smell and taste, totally natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Within just a week, we&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference with our teeth, gums and breath. Our teeth are lighter, gums are much cleaner, and no more bad breath...how cool is that?! We&#x27;re totally in love with this product...will keep buying!! :D</li>
    <li> My gums are too sensitive for this so I use it only two or three times a week.  I wish I could use it every day because it really makes your teeth whiter.  Nothing ages a person like dark teeth.  I am 69 and my teeth still are white as they were when I was in my twenties.&lt;br /&gt;This is because of using a Sonic toothbrush, but when I added this product they really began to sparkle.  However, not due to the product, but due to my gums I just can&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. It makes your mouth feel super clean. I just had a dental cleaning yesterday and my hygienist said I had no plaque or tarter. It was nice not to have her use that scraping thing. :)</li>
    <li> I have definate gum issues and have had for about five years.  Toothpaste really bothers it and this is the only product I have used that actually feels good on my gums.  It is weird and grainy and you kind of think when you are using it that it will stain your teeth dark, but it doesnt.  The only gripe I have is that it is in such a small little jar and cost quite a bit so as much as I loved the product I would think twice about paying that much for the little I got. But it does what it says and is a good product.</li>
    <li> I plan to use this for as long as they make it.  Right away I noticed my teeth were slightly whiter.  After two months, my teeth are at least two shades whiter without any potentially harmful chemicals.  After one or two uses, I could chew food on both sides of my mouth.  I didn&#x27;t even realize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things to notice.  The jar is very small.  I brush my teeth a lot, so it only lasted 2 months, which makes it rather expensive.  The benefits are so great, I plan to continue using it anyway.  Also, keep in mind that the product is brown in color.  You just have to rinse your toothbrush more  if you don&#x27;t like the brown in your brush and around the sink.  I truly believe my teeth and gums are healthier.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I used this product for a couple of months.  Didn&#x27;t really see any change in gums.  I think it is a little pricy.</li>
    <li> great product, no soft sticky plaque buildup. my gums feel so much better, and teeth so clean.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use any other tooth paste - this is the only paste that doesn&#x27;t burn my gums and they look healthier then they have in a long time - plus it tast really good. I like the fact that all organic natural products are used in the making of this tooth paste. It took me a little bit to get used to using the powder but now I don&#x27;t think anything of it. I recommended to my family and I now have both of my sisters using also.</li>
    <li> Purchased the &amp;#34;Gum Powder&amp;#34; for receding gums and general gum health. Cannot say that I noticed some kind of improvement. In fact, my teeth became more sensitive I&#x27;m guessing due to the salt in the product. It probably serves as an abrasive, but it caused sensitivity in my case. Other than that, no other negatives.</li>
    <li> It took 53 years for me to find this.  Everyone should be using this from the time they first use a toothbrush ever!  I will always use it.  Great taste too!</li>
    <li> wish it were in paste form. kind of a pain to use dry.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, and didn&#x27;t please me.</li>
    <li> After two weeks my teeth are brown!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. The product has a pleasant smell also. It will take time to reap the benefits expected.</li>
    <li> THIS WILL SAVE YOU THOUSANDS IN DENTAL COSTS!  I read all the good reviews and was skeptical.  I have had 3 root canals over several years and recently started having pain in another back molar.  At nearly $1600 for a root canal &amp; crown, and no dental ins. I was willing to give this a try.  I agree with the others, your teeth feel really clean &amp; gums tighter, no bleeding which is an added plus. Also fresher breath. But I was skeptical it could eliminate the need for expensive dentistry.  In about 2-3 weeks of using this, I am PAIN FREE!! It had gotten so bad I couldn&#x27;t chew on that side and even bringing my teeth together would cause pain.  For the last several days there is no pain, I can chew even the hardest foods and NO PAIN!! This stuff is amazing!  It heals the infection that causes the pain.  If you read and google root canal alternatives there are numerous sites that tell you you can sometimes cure the infection by diet or different remedies, natural antibiotics etc.  Also if I ever do need a root canal there is another alternative - laser surgery.  But for now this has done the trick and I plan to use it on a regular basis esp.if I have any more pain. TRULY AMAZING PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> I only use it a few times so I can&#x27;t recommend this product. I didn&#x27;t like the taste so I don&#x27;t think I will use it again.</li>
    <li> My husband is a truck driver, he has this &amp; the mouth wash. He likes them very much. We might try the severe kind next time.</li>
    <li> This is the first tooth product that has ever really delivered on its promise to whiten teeth. Not just mine but my daughters &amp; my grandson too. Plus every time we brush our teeth feel like theyve just been cleaned at the dentist office. It gives us fresh breath without having to use an overpowering mint flavoring. It just has a mild pleasant taste. Its perfect for anyone with sensitive teeth or gums.</li>
    <li> Finally a toothpaste that actually cleans the tartar off your teeth , without paying a dentist $100</li>
    <li> Great product! My teeth feel super clean!</li>
    <li> I really like this powder. It tastes slightly minty but not too overpowering. My teeth feel really clean after using it. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and am satisfied with it, however I don&#x27;t notice any whitening (says on label it whitens) but I didn&#x27;t get it for that so no big deal. The labeling is pretty silly looking though, its hard to take a company seriously when their packaging looks like that</li>
    <li> I have been using Happy Teeth and Gum Powder for many years and I love the product because it certainly keep my teeth clean and healthy.  In fact I gave a bottle to my brother who is a smoker and it took away the stain on his teeth from smoking for so many years. By the way, someone said that the powder was orange in color.  I have used it so many years and it is a whitish tan color - never orange color.</li>
    <li> I tried this to get something natural and chemical free. It seemed to work but I noticed that after about a week, that my teeth were being stained by the dark clay in the powder. Someone said pearly look?  More dingy yellow to me.  I have stopped using the powder. Also, even after rinsing well, I would occasionally get some grit wandering around my month. I hate that. I went back to using baking soda and salt. No more grit, no more yellowing.</li>
    <li> I had been using Anti Aging Company&#x27;s Happy Teeth and Gum Powder for several years (had a big turn around in gum health when I first started).  A few months before my last cleaning I ran out and coasted into the chair without using the powdered problem solver for 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning and exam was not good- Tatar under the gum line, several deep pockets.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered more Happy Teeth And Gums about 3 months ago and got back on the wagon(I had never stopped flossing and regular brushing, just with out the powder).&lt;br /&gt;After 3 months of regular brushing with the powder, I went in for my 6 month appointment yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;My Hygienist was amazed - she had planned on putting me on a four month schedule for cleaning, but my gums were healthy, the pockets had receded and there was very little tartar and none below the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this wonderful product for gums and teeth!&lt;br /&gt;The money saved by staying with a 6 month cleaning schedule and possible periodontal procedures makes Healthy Teeth and Gums the best bargain in oral health care - no need for EMF from electric brushes, no surgery!</li>
    <li> My dentist was amazed! I have been having severe problems with receding gums that would bleed every time I flossed the plaque and build up that has had me seeing the dentist every 3 months for the last 2 years. After only days of using this my gums stopped bleeding when I flossed. I went in after 3 weeks of using this and they said I had the least amount of build up they had ever seen on me and my teeth look great and my gums are actually growing back where they were getting so long in the tooth that it was looking like I was going to have to see a specialist for gum disease. I am now back on a regular 6 month cleaning schedule and my teeth and gums look and feel great! This stuff works!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll update after dental visit. Doesn&#x27;t taste good. Seems to clean</li>
    <li> I use it with the rescue powder. Nice.</li>
    <li> I received this gum powder and was very happy in the way it cleaned my teeth.  I use it morning and night.  I found that my teeth are very smooth and free of plague in the am.</li>
    <li> I just got this today, it&#x27;s great.I will be ordering the set next.it has a good taste and my teeth feel really clean.</li>
    <li> I really like that it is as the product was described, a natural good product.  Personally I need to learn how to use it, so used to paste on a toothbrush, the powder doesn&#x27;t stick to the brush.  Teeth feel REALLY good after brushing and I like the taste.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I am planning to purchase this again. It truly makes my teeth feel better/clean. I wish that it could arrive via Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> Pretty good!!&lt;br /&gt;Can be kind of messy, use it properly and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used.  It really works!!  Even my dental hygienist was surprised to see the huge improvement of my overall dental health.  Thank you!  I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I like the feel and taste of it ...and i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s working as advertised ...luckily i don&#x27;t have any problems ...just maintenance !</li>
    <li> Just started to use this plus the mouth wash ,ill report back later</li>
    <li> This highly effective powder not only makes my teeth feel like I just had them cleaned at the dentist, it also has helped my bleeding gum situation and plaque build-up.&lt;br /&gt;I had just been using this powder for a month and I went to my dentist for my regular half year check-up and the hygienist asked me if I had gone to another dentist and had my teeth cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;She said there was no plaque.&lt;br /&gt;Well, that was a first for me.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t ever stop making this stuff! I am hooked. I think I am going to try your other oral care products, like the mouthwash.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd jar and I am happy with the product I do not have mouth sores and my gums look good to.</li>
    <li> my question is, why such a goofy lable, for such a well made product</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth feel clean and fresh. I have only been using it for a short while but so far so good.  I like that it is Organic and doesn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients in it.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!! I was very impressed with the results and I liked the idea od taking something naturally without chemicals. I seen non GMO as well and this also allowed me to buy this product. I seen a noticeable difference and I am yet to go to my dentist and my periodontist to show her the results.  I had gums that needed some TLC and my periodontist wanted me to use a special hand held device in which you inserted the tip of a toothpick to get the plaque out from between the tooth and the gum line and then after that water pick a lot!!! Well I was also taking a medication that also causes gum inflammation, and my dentist said this was mostly the cause for my gums being swollen. I have an expensive mouth full of crowns too that are super white, so there was a concern about this. I did not want to risk losing those. I still water pick, floss, and also use these small little brushes that floss my teeth as well after meals at work. And with all of that and brushing of course, with the addition of this product after brushing, my gums look great, and my mouth feels fresh. I am going to order more and their mouthwash too.</li>
    <li> Thanks god I found this gum powder.I have a problem with my lower gum .And this magic powder done a great job.Ive been using this stuff a weeks ago now and all I can say is \\&quot;IT WORKS\\&quot; also it whitens your teeth.</li>
    <li> I have been using the whole range for a year now. I react to any artificial ingredients immediately allergic. No reaction ever. I have not seen my dental hygienist since. I have have recommended the whole range to all my clients. We all live in Switzerland, the shipping costs are heavy, nonetheless we all keep ordering.&lt;br /&gt; This is the high end of best ingredients.keep up the standard,. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Nadja</li>
    <li> Product is eh... Customer service is eh..</li>
    <li> Do not use water! I thought I didn&#x27;t like it til I actually followed directions and used my dry toothbrush and oh how comforting snd good it feels you know its working can&#x27;t wait yo order more but I&#x27;m getting super comfort this time</li>
    <li> Excellent product and it really worked. My teeth are much cleaner and white. Taste good as well.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful natural product!</li>
