      <li>There&#x27;s no oily or film like residue after applying and it leaves my face feeling super</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a more youthful appearance.</li>

      <li>This particular product is a larger size than most and comes with a handy press top that makes it easy to get just a few drops which is really all you will need.  </li>

      <li>The area around my eyes seems lighter and more firm leaving me looking a lot more alert.</li>
      <li>this product does not do anything it says,  first of all it dries like a peeling product,  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this.  I&#x27;m new to hyuralonic acid even though I&#x27;m 45 years old.  I look very young for my age but I realize that my skin is going to get worse every passing day.  This seemed like a great deal for the amount of product as well as the low price.  I love how it feels on my face.</li>
    <li> this product does not do anything it says,  first of all it dries like a peeling product,  when applied and when it dries it starts to peel.  therefore, couldn&#x27;t use under my foundation.  not worth buying.</li>
    <li> I did not feel/see any change</li>
    <li> Packaging is amazing and the quality of the bottle is very durable and chic. The formula itself is super concentrated, not greasy and absorbs into my skin nicely. Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> This serum has a great mild smell and moisturizes the skin really well.</li>
    <li> It was worth the try. I thought about getting a refund after I thought there was no change after using it. But then When I compared my old picture to the new ones I have, there was definitely a lighter complexion and quite a more radiant look on it. Even without make up, my fake looks pinkish and healthy, which I think has benefited because of the vitamins that this serum has. Because of that, I continued using it and hopefully it does reveal much more noticeably than not.</li>
    <li> My mother really wanted to try this out because she has a few problem areas around her eyes and mouth that she wanted to see if this would help get rid of and I have to say that it did exactly what it said it would do. After using it for about a week we both started to see results in the area around her eyes. The fine lines and wrinkles were becoming less visible and her skin was becoming softer and smoother when before it looked rough and dry. Her age spots are also fading and some have even faded away, which she is so happy about. She says that she can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product and she is going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Not good enough. First application left my skin tight but surprisingly dry.  Looked even more wrinkled.  Always need to moisturize right after using.  Since I bought two bottles and hate to waste money, I&#x27;ll continue using.  Have done better with other products.</li>
    <li> Seems working but do not expect an overnight miracle.</li>
    <li> I was chosen to try another amazing Bellafab face product free of charge in return for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;Once again the lived up to the hype. It took me awhile to be able to use this product so I could use it as a standalone to give it the best possible evaluation. This product makes my skin feel so incredible soft and supple it is amazing. I just want to rub the skin on my face it is so soft. It goes on nice and you need very little to completely cover your face and neck. It rubs in completely without leaving your skin too oily and without clogging your pores. The area around my eyes seems lighter and more firm leaving me looking a lot more alert. With all of the vitamins I know it is helping my skin in the long term by preventing the look of aging. Another great Bellafab product. If you aren’t using their products you should be!!</li>
    <li> Typically I am hesitant to try out products on my body that have words which I can’t even pronounce, but  I wanted to test it out on the small sunspots that I have starting to form on my face and the spots on my husbands neck from being out in the sun all day.&lt;br /&gt;The serum has a really mild scent which is extremely important to me because I can’t tolerate any types of serums or lotions with strong and harsh scents. It goes on very light and clear and takes a minute to absorb into the skin. I have been using it here and there (because some nights I tend to forget to apply it), but I have noticed that my trouble eye areas are a little more firm than prior to using it. On another note, the packaging is pretty and I love the look of the bottle! It’s lightweight and can easily be packed away in your purse or wherever you need it.&lt;br /&gt;I had some trouble with amazon and my mail carrier delivering this product, but the company was awesome and shipped me another one free of charge. Great customer service on their end and would not only recommend them but purchase from them in the future.</li>
    <li> This leaves my skin so soft! It&#x27;s a big bottle it should last a few months.  I highly recommend</li>
    <li> The serum is super light weight and there aren&#x27;t any harsh ingredients or chemicals used in this product. There&#x27;s no oily or film like residue after applying and it leaves my face feeling super soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that my skin is looking a bit more even toned and a bit brighter. While I really don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, I will continue using this to fight off any that may be planning to invade my face soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has become a strong ally in my attempt to ward off any signs of aging. I am truly impressed with this product and I&#x27;ll choose this over any name brand or department store any day!</li>
    <li> Great for use after a deep cleaning micro treatment.&lt;br /&gt;One little step added to your facial routine can make a big difference to your overall tone, texture &amp; best of all, pore size.&lt;br /&gt;I am not what I would consider an older person, but I am trying to maintain and stave off some signs of aging. I like that this does not in any way leave my face greasy or cause additional oil and quietly fights this battle for me.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do what it was advertised as doing. I don&#x27;t see any difference and my face isn&#x27;t any better in the morning after I put it on at night.  It wasn&#x27;t expensive and probably doesn&#x27;t hurt, it just didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> I really like Hyaluronic Acid Serums. I love that this product is made in the USA using FDA approved ingredients. It&#x27;s also not test on animals and is 100% natural! This has made my skin feel and look more youthful after only a couple of weeks. I have noticed that the fine lines around my eyes are diminishing. You only have to apply a small amount so this bottle will last a very long time. I have also noticed that my pores are not so large. It is non-greasy and oil-free so you can easily apply it under your makeup. This is really a great product! I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a more youthful appearance. I did receive this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. My opinion is 100% my own and I only recommend products or services I use personally.</li>
    <li> This glides on nicely and makes skin moist, Until it dries. I don&#x27;t see any benefit in using this product. So far I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give it a fair review so it may work for some but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
    <li> I like it. but not the best i ever used</li>
    <li> I think this serum works pretty well, it absorbs into my skin quickly and it does make my skin softer.  The only thing I have an issue with, is that it shows how many different vitamins are listed on the bottle....but the bottle is clear.  If you know anything about Vitamin serum, especially viatmin c, is that you need to have it stored in a  dark bottle because light will accelerate the break down of the vitamin C.  This fact makes me question what really is in this serum.</li>
    <li> It is just okay as well.</li>
    <li> I got this product free in an exhange for a review. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of hyaluronic serums and this one is by far the best and you get more bang for your buck! A little goes an extremely long way. I&#x27;ve noticed a change in the appearance and the feeling of my skin. Around my eyes was my problem area. I applied this serum with a special focus on my eyes and I&#x27;m amazed at the results. I will definitely be buying more of this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know to see things special about this product accepted it was cheap</li>
    <li> My skin just loves it. It has become one of the vitamins that my skin needs and I even dropped my old anti-aging lotion for this one because of its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> This is my new top pick!!. The packaging of this product is awesome and ir fits in my make up bag, When i first put this on i was surprised, it felt so light weight and wasnt oily. After useing this for a couple days i noticed a differnecr in my skin. I will be useing this every day in my routine.</li>
    <li> Who wants to make their skin look better?  Well I think that answer would be everyone!  No one can say they have perfect skin and hyaluronic acid has been gaining momentum over the past few years as a miracle-worker for skin, especially the facial area.  This particular product is a larger size than most and comes with a handy press top that makes it easy to get just a few drops which is really all you will need.  It is 100% natural and FDA approved - that is something you really want to watch for when purchasing any skincare product.  This worked wonders for my skin, made it smooth and helped me get rid of acne, and all it took was a few pumps a day!  It didn&#x27;t leave my face red or with any residue which is awesome because that is something I don&#x27;t like.  It is a serum, thick and silky smooth on your skin.  This also fights aging and sun spots, really gets into the skin and tightens it and improves elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BellaFab also offers a 90 day money back guarantee, so you really have nothing to lose by trying it out :)  And I guarantee you won&#x27;t want to send it back once you try it for a few days!  It has so many vitamins and minerals in it but nothing harmful to your skin.  The biggest ones are witch hazel, Vitamins A, C, D and E and lavender.  You cannot go wrong purchasing one of these bottles!  So what are you waiting for?  Grab one now and do away with that saggy skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest review***</li>

    <li> BellaFab sent me this awesome serum to review for my blog GlamRiver!  The BellaFab Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum is clear, light-weight and absorbs really quickly into my skin and leaves it feeling soft and well hydrated.  I also really like the fresh, clean smell.  Best of all, the BellaFab Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum has evened-out my skin tone and has helped make my fine lines less noticeable.  Awesome product at an awesome price!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I am a 33 year old fair-skinned female so, now that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve reached that point in my life where the thought of aging has really started to nag at me. Thus, I have been on the look out for some good products to help with those little fine lines that I&#x27;m starting to see on my forehead. I also have lots of freckles so I wouldn&#x27;t mind lightening those up too. I was in an Ulta store a few years back and an employee there had recommended using vitamin C to help lighten spots/scars/hyper-pigment and even out skin tone so that was definitely on my list of must have ingredients. I came across this serum while looking for a replacement for the vitamin C serum of which I was running out (had success but it was no longer available, plus, I wanted to try something new) and came across this one on sale for $14.95. After having paid close to $30 for my last bottle of serum, I most certainly liked the price. Plus, the reviews looked good, and after cross comparing with a few others with good reviews, all the must-have ingredients were there. So I gave it a shot... and, if I remember correctly, it came in the very next day.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have not been using it very long (a few weeks), and I have not remembered to apply it everyday.... but when I have, boy oh boy, does my skin feel nice. I really like this stuff. I can definitely confirm what other reviewers have said... it goes on smoothly, rubs in quickly, smells nice, and there is no residue whatsoever. And talk about leaving skin feeling so, so soft. I have also noticed that my skin tone is already more even... even enough to not really feel the need to apply foundation (on a casual basis that is... I would still use foundation makeup if I&#x27;m getting dressed up for something). I just put on some mascara and lip gloss, and I&#x27;m good to go. I put it on the backs of my hands too. With it being winter time, they are super dry and old looking... putting this stuff on most definitely fixes that problem.&lt;br /&gt;So, my plan is to get some new needle/derma rollers and use this with a daily derma-rolling routine. I bought a second bottle after the first one came in and I tried it and liked it. I knew at the sale price, it would run out quickly, and it sure enough did. To date, it still says out of stock, but hopefully there will be plenty of more to come and at a good price. I highly recommend this product. I will try to remember to update after I&#x27;ve used it consistently for a while.

    <li> As a beauty blogger I do not always try items as soon as I received them. It is because I may be currently reviewing another skin care item and I never cross the products. I want to make sure I do not change the outcome of the review. Here is one of those items I overlooked for a little bit while I was testing another and now I have only begun to tell you how amazing it truly is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the Bella Fab Hyaluronic Acid Serum. It is a medley of amazing skin renewing ingredients. Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, and Vitamin E. Perfectly balanced to slow down those signs of aging, create intense hydration, and leave your skin with a beautiful healthy glow. I love when companies design products that aid in skin repair, treatment, and renewal. It is the focus of why we invest in such products. We want all the facets of our skin to be better. The glow, hydration, the tone, the evenness, and its well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding a product where all the key ingredients work together is a effective yet calming way is beautiful. No down time, no needles, and no harsh treatments. It is simply a serum that can transform your skin with daily use. Like it did my skin. Wrinkles, fine lines, dull skin, dryness, large pores, spots... all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to suffer from redness, blotchiness, dryness, dullness and it was just a mess and simply hard to make happy but my skin has been so happy, soft, radiant, and youthful. And simply happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think your skin will be happy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it. You have nothing to lose. It&#x27;s 100% guaranteed. Find yours on AMAZON.</li>
