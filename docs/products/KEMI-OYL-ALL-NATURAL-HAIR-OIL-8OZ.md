    <li> Just so you know my status on Kemi OYL, I am a balck male with hair length from skin to 1/2\\&quot; in length (fade style). After washing my hair I use 3-5 small drops of KEMI OYL. It can keep your hair treated all week (Mon-Fri) if you want to. 1 application per hair wash... anything more would be too much. Non-greasey, practically odorless, and application longevity it the perks of Kemi OYL. My wife is Puerto Rican with hair to her bra strap... an 8oz bottle lasts her 4-6 months. I have a 4oz bottle.... It will be over 12 months before I would even think about buying the next bottle :D. Great stuff. I was using PINK hair products prior to KEMI OYL. Almost the same rating, but PINK hair product(S) would run out way before Kemi OYL would...and PINK does not have the staying power like KEMI OYL does.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil on my hair for yrs and I absolutely love this stuff. It makes your hair shiny and soft with a pleasant smell with out feeling really heavy and greasy. I mix it with Jojoba oil and it gives my hair this healthy glow nice moisture without that greasy oily feel to it. If you have not tried it, then take my advice buy it. You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Great product good multipurpose oil</li>
    <li> Love this product. Glad I could find it on amazon in the larger size.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I used it growing up and remembered it leaving my hair soft, shiny and smelling great!  This product left her hair a greasy mess that smelled terrible-little better than plain cooking oil.</li>
    <li> well this oil can&#x27;t  be found in beauty salons, i check NYC every where, no one has it. we love using this product.</li>
    <li> I use to use it a long time ago but it faded out of the stores. I found it again but it was expensive. Buying this way I save money.</li>
    <li> I like using this product right before I flat iron. It&#x27;s moisturizes and creates a beautiful shine that I like.</li>
    <li> i have been a fan of this product for many years a product I will cntinue to purchase for years to come. My shipment took a while thats the only reason I didint give 5 stars.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used kemi oyl for about 10 years and I&#x27;m never disappointed. I like to use it right before I blow dry my hair and when I use the flat iron. You only need about 5 or so drops. A little really does go a long way. Amazing results!</li>
