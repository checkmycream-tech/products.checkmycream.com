      <li>I love the piercings</li>
      <li>Way more bang for my buck with SQdeal</li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I am satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>many pairs</li>
      <li>In my area, I can get at most five labret bars for about twelve bucks.</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>mostly duplicates</li>
      <li>Love this item</li>
      <li>However, the bars are fantastic for use!</li>
      <li>but that is ok by me...</li>
      <li>Too cute</li>
      <li>but I love the choices</li>
      <li>youre going to spend more there</li>
      <li>so many different colors and the price is awesome.</li>
      <li>A lot came in singles, but a lot came in pairs, most of pairs of threes.</li>
      <li>Just wish I got what I paid for :)</li>
      <li>i got more than 100.</li>
      <li>so these are really good can wear them for a long time and they are great.</li>
      <li>Pretty good quality, greeeat patterns.  </li>
      <li>but so worth it!!</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how great they are.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>i loved the variety but the plastic balls break very often.</li>
      <li>they are true to the picture!</li>
      <li>I love the colors and cannot wait to find all kinds of fun combinations to wear!</li>
      <li>so i end up going through the piercings very quickly</li>
      <li>The spikes break really easily.</li>
      <li>There are a lot of duplicates, but I lose things so easily that I don&#x27;t find that to be any type of problem.</li>
      <li>You do get the full amount here but for the most part, you get crappy spikes.</li>
      <li>Otherwise the product was fine, and shipped on time</li>
      <li>Which was fine with me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m not as much of a fan of the spikes, the circular ones are adorable!</li>
      <li>When I ordered these, I was pleased at first!</li>
      <li>They emailed me back very quickly and the person I talked to was very nice about helping me with the problem.</li>
      <li>The girl at the gas station with the labret piercing is stoked for all the free jewerly now</li>
      <li>Too many of a similar kind of design, also too many of them with the marijuana leaf on them</li>
      <li>So many colorful pieces.</li>
      <li>Their pretty good quality and a lot of them are really pretty and detailed.</li>
      <li>The fit is seamless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fit</li>
      <li>They are very colorful.</li>
      <li>happy with the product because i&#x27;m getting angel bites and the package came with multiple doubles, some even had triplets, which i found okay as well because i have a boyfriend with a lip piercing who liked the extra jewelry,&lt;br</li>
      <li>All the labrets are really nice and work well for normal earrings to not just lip piercings.  </li>
      <li>not the best, not great, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>their just cool.</li>
      <li>This is really cool.  </li>
      <li>They are much cheaper than many I have seen, and they are made well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There is so many different styles and colors! Love them!</li>
    <li> I got 117 lip rings. None were broken and I love them!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my girlfriend (at the time). She was very happy with them. There were a few dupes in there. But over all none of the beads were cross threaded and none of them seemed to unscrew. I would recommend these to someone who is always changing theirs out for a different kind of look every day. Also wonderful price!</li>
    <li> Even tho not all the pieces match up, still a great buy. I think it was a little over a 100 pieces which makes it even better. So many colorful pieces.</li>
    <li> so many different colors and the price is awesome. I always have reactions to fake earrings so these are really good can wear them for a long time and they are great.</li>
    <li> Options, options, options... You gotta love options. The only problem I had with these was that the bar itself was a little short. Other than that, good fit and not too tight.</li>
    <li> Only thing i dint like was there was too many colorfull retro styles im not into colorfull stuff but nice buy u save allot of money buying this that going to the stores shipping was fast</li>
    <li> This is really cool.  Like it alot. You get everything at once for a reasonable price. How can you bet that.</li>
    <li> First off I really liked the labret pins I got,not much of a variety had like 10 of the same ones but I didn&#x27;t mind because I need pairs anyways so it worked out. Second I only got 93 labrets which was annoying but I emailed SQdeal and they work with me and are going to give me some of my money back which is really nice. They emailed me back very quickly and the person I talked to was very nice about helping me with the problem. All the labrets are really nice and work well for normal earrings to not just lip piercings.  I would totally buy these again and may in the near future.</li>
    <li> I received this item a few days ago and it was good.  i suggest anyone to buy it. i counted them it was 100 lip rings !!!! I&#x27;m excited to have new lip rings</li>
    <li> Was very happy with this purchase. I had bought Labret Lip Body Jewelry  from other online stores through Amazon and turned out to break easily and was junk. Happy with SQdeal !!</li>
    <li> Received 97/100 but no biggie&lt;br /&gt;shipped fast</li>
    <li> Love them! Too cute and there&#x27;s like 3 of the same ones. But if you loose them atleast I have back up!</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says. A good price when at some places they&#x27;re a dollar or more a piece. Good quality as well</li>
    <li> Extremely cheap quality. :( The balls/cones are so small that it&#x27;s near impossible to screw them on/off, and the plastic is weak, so every single one I&#x27;ve worn breaks within hours. It&#x27;s a good price for how many you get, though.</li>
    <li> I recieved this order a day earlier than expected packaged nicely. I got 105 pieces as well. mostly duplicates but that is ok by me... they are true to the picture! none of them were broken and they were exactly what I wanted. if you like the picture and know the size then I would recommend this to you...</li>
    <li> Amazon needs to up the ante for its accuracy in tracking packages. The predicted delivery date was off by a day. This may be not be a big deal as this order was only for lip labrets, but it would matter if the order was for college textbooks or other time-sensitive items. Moving on now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I am terrible with organization myself, I know it is easy to lose lip labrets or the ball/cone tops. This is a great deal, a total of 105 lip labrets with various, colorful tops in different shapes all for roughly $12. The 16g was exactly the size I was looking for, as I like my lip piercing to feel as if it is hardly there at all. The fit is seamless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit of a struggle to put the labret on securely as the bar length itself is short and the top is small. You need to be careful handling the top itself. I typically wear long bars myself, as my bottom lip is pretty thick (I have a left lip piercing). I had to push the bar in a bit for enough room to screw the top on it. Worked all out good, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am satisfied with the product. I recommend this product for individuals who are looking to have lip labrets with short bars in mass bulk. If you are specifically looking for lip labrets with long bars, I suggest you look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Beautiful selection, but the base (the flat part that sits inside) is much too small.  Otherwise the product was fine, and shipped on time</li>
    <li> I got 98 lip rings instead of 100 ! Which isnt too bad but I am really particular when It comes to stuff like that. Especially if I&#x27;m not getting what I&#x27;m expecting and paid for. There&#x27;s alot of replicates but I don&#x27;t mind...  very pretty, cool.. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be purchasing again for here though.</li>
    <li> The bars were extremely short but I love the choices n was happy wit the duplicates because I have a snake bite</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s ALRIGHT.. but the bars were just a little too small for the lip. But overall, I liked the purchase and it came way before it was due and I liked that. not the best, not great, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I didnt get the exact quantity. Hopefully they can fix this. Otherwise, the 73 that I got were good. Just wish I got what I paid for :)</li>
    <li> just buy them i would give these 9.5 out of 10 they are really good and when you go to the store to buy these well youre going to spend more there then it is on here</li>
    <li> I found a few repeats, as expected, but I love them anyways, I love the selection, and they are a comfortable fit. Definitely happy.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect. Love this item and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.  There was two maybe three doubles but I lose a lot of things so I don&#x27;t mind. And also came a day early !! Amazing.</li>
    <li> These are very small. The balls are very hard to even get on the post. Forget trying to get these on if you have any kind of leanth on your fingernail&#x27;s because they are so small. They work great for earring&#x27;s not lip rings. They are not even long enough to go throught the lip.</li>
    <li> I love that I now have so many choices to choose from... yes there are repeats but there are alot of varietis as well.</li>
    <li> i ordered these for my friend for his birthday. they were 105 he was very happy. alot of them are UV , meaning they glow under black light. i would recomend these. highly</li>
    <li> Oh,boy...I have a lot of piercings for a really reasonable price.I have a perfect one for each occasion or change of clothes..lol</li>
    <li> So perfecttt. I got 107 in 2 daya whwn it said a week. Pretty good quality, greeeat patterns.  I got some ying yang ones, cool swirls, and even a pot leaf one haha. Hiiighly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I recieved less than the amount advertised and on top of that several more were not able to thread onto the bar. Majority were girly colors which these were for a male so it was disappointing. The girl at the gas station with the labret piercing is stoked for all the free jewerly now so I suppose I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars....</li>
    <li> I ordered for someone as a Christmas gift and I was happy with the order. One of the pieces was broken, but that&#x27;s no big deal. I would definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> They sent me all my earrings! and most of them were completely different from one another. I would recommend these to anyone. They are much cheaper than many I have seen, and they are made well.</li>
    <li> They are good if you don&#x27;t like to spend 5 dollars every time you lose a piercing or want something a little different in each day, just don&#x27;t expect to get 100 as advertised you could be lucky like others and get more or unlucky like me and a few others who got every where from 70 to 90.&lt;br /&gt;Some will come broken, like the threading on the bar is already stripped but getting a decent quantity like 100 it is no big deal.</li>
    <li> So I bought these a couple days ago and they came in super fast the shipping was great but I had a couple where they didn&#x27;t have the ball on top or wouldn&#x27;t screw in now my main problem is that I&#x27;ve been wearing a pair for a few days now and I had to take them out because it was starting to did into my lip and make a circular cut around the hole of the piercing because the stud is to short.</li>
    <li> I didnt count how many were in the package, but it was close enough to 100 that i didnt care. All were right size and different designs, one was broken, but in the end a good deal</li>
    <li> Yes there are a lot of repeats, but that is the whole reason I ordered these. I am always playing with my jewelry and always losing the balls because I forget to see if they are tight. In my area, I can get at most five labret bars for about twelve bucks. I got a hundred with this order. I am more than happy. I got about 96, which is fine with me! Way more bang for my buck with SQdeal and I am happy with these. I love the colors and cannot wait to find all kinds of fun combinations to wear!</li>
    <li> i loved these. worth the money. some brake but you have 100 so who cares. i got more than 100. none the same</li>
    <li> . . . They don&#x27;t all screw in. . . :/ Most of them did though. And some of the colors or designs are kind of funky. . .</li>
    <li> Got here on time and was as described however the bars are a little too short. Would have given it 5 stars if not for that.</li>
    <li> I got free shipping and the right amount of bars. I know they don&#x27;t gurantee that they will all be different, I expected that. But getting eleven of the same design is pretty ridicules. That was the only problem I had with this but it was kinda bad so I gave it two stars.</li>
    <li> they came in just on time and they&#x27;re so cute! i would definitely buy again! but if you&#x27;re looking for 100 different ones you&#x27;ll be out of luck. many pairs but so worth it!!</li>
    <li> a lot of the balls were missing but they are very nice.</li>
    <li> The balls won&#x27;t stay on</li>
    <li> they truely are amazing, some are hard to screw on though, and they are externally threated so putting one into a fresh piercing can cause tearing or scaring. but for the price its good.</li>
    <li> I got these a week before the estimated arrival date. They were everything I expected (: In total i got 99 lip studs, but i really use them for my cartilage piercing. Also if you have problems with the length of the bar, use a bar that is comfortable in your piercing and just change the balls, since they are all the same size. I noticed that was a common complaint with these but over all ive had them for about 3 weeks and none have broken . Some balls are little crooked but its no big deal since they&#x27;r are so many. The colors and patterns were nice. Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with this and would purchase again. (:</li>
    <li> I bought these hoping they would be long enough to allow for comfort due to swelling of my brand new snakebites.  However, the posts are too short for that.  They will be perfect to wear once the swelling goes down because the spikes and balls are small, have nice colors and cool designs.  There are several with a cannabis leaf motif, but because they are so small, it is hard to tell, especially on the spikes.</li>
    <li> So many color options, which I loved. However, majority of them were shaped as spheres. my preference is round. Also its a good thing you get so many because if you twist it on to tight the plastic breaks. Overall, it&#x27;s still a good purchase.</li>
    <li> They Came.. Were NOT 16g So NONE Of Them Fit And Im Stuck With A Bag Of Liprings That I Can Not Use</li>
    <li> LOVE!!!! Comes early and is cheaper then at the store! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> i loved the variety but the plastic balls break very often. so i end up going through the piercings very quickly</li>
    <li> Too many of a similar kind of design, also too many of them with the marijuana leaf on them</li>
    <li> This purchase arrived before it was due. They where small if u like them small you will love these lip rings. I like them a bit larger. They are very colorful. And all was in the pack. Good buy. Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not as much of a fan of the spikes, the circular ones are adorable! They&#x27;re the perfect size, just a bit small, so they&#x27;re subtler than most of my larger studs. This is a great deal for the money you pay! I know people reported that some of the studs were stripped, etc, but I did not encounter this. The designs are adorable and mine ranged from playing card designs to fluorescent green transparent and there was even an off color pot leaf thrown in. There are a lot of duplicates, but I lose things so easily that I don&#x27;t find that to be any type of problem. A steal, in my opinion!</li>
    <li> i rarely write reveiws but was so annoyed i figured i&#x27;d warn people. i bought these hoping to save a few bucks since you usually pay $11.99 for like 3 lip rings. the shipping was quick &amp; all the lip rings are pretty but i&#x27;ve had literally about 8 of them fall apart &amp; crack. its starting to get really annoying! i would save your money. DON&#x27;T BUY THEM! no idea why it has such high reveiws.</li>
    <li> The cheapest i can buy a ring in my town is 5 bucks a piece! So a hundred for only 12 is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the product because i&#x27;m getting angel bites and the package came with multiple doubles, some even had triplets, which i found okay as well because i have a boyfriend with a lip piercing who liked the extra jewelry,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t order if you don&#x27;t have double piercings and please don&#x27;t expect 100 different rings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the quality was better, i was confused as to why there where triples but it became clear to me when two of the piercings pretty much crumpled apart when i unscrewed and re screwed them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, if i had spent a large amount of money for them i&#x27;d have been very upset but for 12 dollars ill consider it a steal!(:</li>
    <li> I liked the variety of colors to pick from.</li>
    <li> They are 18g. Not 16g, I double checked with some of my other jewelry. Other than that they are great. I got 101, so that&#x27;s kinda nice. The balls and spikes are really small. I use them in my cartilage. I got these to help with one of my cartilage piercing, its always irritable, not infection, just painful. I thought these would help, having a flat back. They didn&#x27;t, not the labrets&#x27; fault. My piercing is askew, at a funny angle from the original piercing and having been ripped before. Needless to say its always been painful, about 6 years now. Take my word, these are 18g. I&#x27;ve bought jewelry labeled wrong before, i take the time to check now. This isn&#x27;t like that time, I&#x27;ve shoved a 12g into my 16g cartilage piercings before. Either way it was labeled wrong.</li>
    <li> I love these. I mean i got 98, when i was supposed to get 100 but its fine. Their pretty good quality and a lot of them are really pretty and detailed. Theres skulls and yin yangs, and hearts and flowers and their just cool. A lot came in singles, but a lot came in pairs, most of pairs of threes. There were actually some that came in like pairs of 7-8 but i think all together its just a really good set of peircings for the price. Its a really good deal. I have snakebites and my girlfriend just has one side of her lip peirced so the pairs of three are kind of handy, if we wanna match xp.</li>
    <li> The customer service was amazing. However I have snake bites and am completely ocd about them matching and didn&#x27;t come with too many sets. Not crappy metal. And arrived sooner than expected</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I bought these, and definitely would not buy them again. They caused allergic reactions in my piercings, all the ends were either stripped or they crumbled after a few days of wearing them. You definitely get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> I did get all of them no cracked beads or anything but I had alot of doubles and I didn&#x27;t get a diamond or clear which is the main reason I bought this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lip studs.&lt;br /&gt;When ordering them, I was afraid that they would be cracked, or the wrong size. I was surprised at how great they are.&lt;br /&gt;I expected 100 lip studs, but instead I received 105. Which was fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been planning to give some of these out to a few friends as Christmas gifts, so I sorted through all of them and checked out every little pattern. I found a skull one, a couple with yin-yang symbols, and one even had a little pot leaf on it. It was entertaining to see all of the different patterns included in this bunch. My friends got a kick out of them, too.&lt;br /&gt;There were plenty of duplicates, which I wanted because I have snakebites, along with a friend who got some of these as a gift. If you&#x27;re looking to buy these and expecting 100 different patterns, you&#x27;ll be highly disappointed. But if you have double piercings, they&#x27;re perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to order more of these and see what other patterns I get.</li>
    <li> I got so many different lip studs, but many were duplicates. For the price this is a must buy!</li>
    <li> I got all 100 pieces, some multiples which i wanted because i have snakebites, and only 2 were damaged in shipping. They arrived promptly and are all adorable! they are on the short side, so make sure thats what you want.</li>
    <li> These are TINY I have small lips and the bar doesn&#x27;t even fit. at least 15 of the are broken too. You get what you pay for!!</li>
    <li> The spikes break really easily. You do get the full amount here but for the most part, you get crappy spikes. However, the bars are fantastic for use!</li>
    <li> Dosent recieve it first time around but they resent promptly and I&#x27;m one happy camper!</li>
    <li> 14$ for 100! wow!that deffinently beats hot topic or spencers. 4 for 15-20$. i always loose or break these things so now i have plenty to last for a loooooooong time. will never go through the mall again! manny awesome option here on amazon im addicted :)</li>
    <li> Okay. When I ordered these, I was pleased at first! Then all the balls started crackin or stripping out. I was mad when I put the pot leaf one on and it broke in my hands. :&#x27;( the spike are soooo much more durable than the balls. Recommendation? Maybe..</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves them!</li>
    <li> Good quality &amp; quantity!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, many cute different balls and spikes.</li>
    <li> So I just got my order today and one of the bar bells is bent.. I love the piercings but I didn&#x27;t pay for bent ones. Please be more careful..</li>
    <li> Ordered these once back in April 2014 where I got my snakebites done, no broken pieces, many varieties to choose from.. love this! Now I have my monroe and ordered them again!&lt;br /&gt;Best thing of jewelry I&#x27;ve bought!</li>
