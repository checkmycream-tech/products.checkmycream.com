<li> It can be used every day, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.</li>
<li> Your hair isn&#x27;t dried out and it has shine, which I noticed that with other products it doesn&#x27;t have.  </li>
<li> Quite expensive at salons, which is the only place locally we can buy it.  </li>
<li> I also do not need to use a conditioner after shampooing, I have a few tangles but very little hair loss compared to other products.  </li>
<li> I ordered the Kenra Volumizing shampoo and conditioner combo a few weeks ago</li>
<li> As we know ladies, we all need to change shampoos for a couple of weeks every few months.  </li>
<li> It takes very little as my hair is a medium length.</li>
<li> I used it faithfully for years before deciding it was too expensive and moved to a cheaper, supermarket shampoo.</li>

    <li> I have very fine, limp hair. I have had it all of my life, and I have never been able to find a shampoo and conditioner that would ACTUALLY give my hair volume, make it soft, and make it healthy without weighing it down...until now. I ordered the Kenra Volumizing shampoo and conditioner combo a few weeks ago and I can already tell the difference! My hair is so healthy now, and my color and highlights look as good as ever!    The only negative that I can say about this product is that the scent is like Peach Rings candy, and I don&#x27;t really like my hair smelling sweet like that. I will probably try out Schwartzkopf hair products after my Kenra runs out, but until then, I am EXTREMELY happy with the product and recommend it to everyone!

Your hair isn&#x27;t dried out and it has shine, which I noticed that with other products it doesn&#x27;t have.  It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of its vitality.

    <li> Love this shampoo.  As I have gotten older my hair has gotten thinner and this shampoo gives it volume.</li>

    <li> Just what my wife wanted in a larger size.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo along with the volumizing conditioner for about a year now and it&#x27;s absolutely fabulous. My hair is color-treated, fine and I have a lot of it so it gets weighted down easily. Due to this, boosting volume is my number one priority, even more so than color maintenance. This shampoo does the trick. Smell preferences are very personal and this shampoo smells very pleasant to me. It also lathers well, even though it&#x27;s sulfate-free. My hair gets clean and has volume after washing. I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> a great product I have been this shampoo for many years over 10 years for sure, I wish the price was better and hard to find sometimes...</li>
    <li> I have issues with my hair being oily.  But not with this.  I never get an oily buildup and my hair is light ans soft.  I never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Kenra! I used it faithfully for years before deciding it was too expensive and moved to a cheaper, supermarket shampoo. However, I still had a little Kenra left. The day I used it, my hair had volume and cooperated with the styling process in a way it had not done for a long time. So, I made the decision to go back to Kenra once the supermarket shampoo was empty. It was very convenient to order it through Amazon, and it came on time and in perfect condition. Whoever packaged it took obvious care and pride in their work.</li>
    <li> I have fine but thick hair, this spray holds my hair in place without feeling sticky. Wind and rain can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Mess up your hair using this hair spray.</li>
    <li> I have very fine and thinning hair.  I had used a lot of products cheap and very expensive.  I found this product gives me a lot of body and moisture.  I also do not need to use a conditioner after shampooing, I have a few tangles but very little hair loss compared to other products.  I will definitely be buying this again.  It takes very little as my hair is a medium length.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is good for cleaning, without using too much.  It&#x27;s pricier than I typically use, but it cleans well and leaves my hair soft.</li>
