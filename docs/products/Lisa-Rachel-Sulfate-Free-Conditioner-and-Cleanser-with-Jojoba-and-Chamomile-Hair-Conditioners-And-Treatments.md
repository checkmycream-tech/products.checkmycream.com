      <li>You have to get use to using this kind of shampoo..</li>
      <li>I noticed it doesn&#x27;t have the creaminess that I liked with Lisa Rachel and probably WEN users are used to.  </li>

      <li>If you can obtain a sample of some kind, try this before you buy it--I&#x27;d return it if I could</li>
      <li>This product is ok, but not as good as Wen.</li>

      <li>While I liked how my hair felt, I did get more build up than I have with</li>

      <li>and I&#x27;m really glad for the price tag.  </li>
      <li>It does leave my hair slightly more tangled when getting out of the shower than WEN did, but that&#x27;s what they make combs for.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Compare  to wen, this is a more affordable option, but I feel that I have to apply significantly more to have similar effect, and  the fragrance needs improvement</li>
    <li> I am in the midst of looking for a conditioner cleanser that is not Wen, due to the fact that they make you purchase a whole bunch of products that you do not need instead of allowing you to just make a single purchase of the conditioner cleanser. whether or not that has recently changed I do not know. I have used salon graffix and loreals conditioner cleanser. I purchased this product and have been using it for 1 week now. I would like to start off by making a general statement about conditioner cleansers. I have noticed that you do need to used a lot more product in your hair then you would using shampoo. If you are using the same amount of conditioner cleanser as you would shampoo (like a quarter size if you are being generous) you will not get clean hair as a result. I found that for a good cleansing you will need to use 8-10 pumps per section of hair. Meaning 8-10 pumps for the top of your head/scalp, middle of hair and and addition 8-10 pumps below. You really need to spend time massaging the product into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;With this specific product it is thick, you want to make sure your hair is fully wet before applying the product. Once you have worked the product into your hair you should add some water to help the product spread. leaving it in your hair for a period of 3-5 mins will help get a maximum success of clean hair. My issue with this product is that it makes my scalp burn as if I have rubbed vicks all over it. To my ignorance I thought maybe there is mint in the product. But after reading a previous review I now know that its a chemical ingredient that can cause burning should it affect you negatively. I&#x27;m really disappointed in this company for using an unnecessary ingredient. I will not be purchasing this product again. ironically the directions suggest using it as a leave in condition which I find hysterical. If you want a burning scalp all day long then sure go ahead and use it as a leave in. Not to mention you will need to use a separate conditioner as this product does not leave your hair soft and smooth. It leaves you hair as if you are just using shampoo once you wash it out.</li>
    <li> Smells kind of like old-lady lotion....</li>
    <li> Was an ok product, but it made my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I love lisa Rachel sulfate free Conditioner works well on my hair and color looks great. Even on my hair and it is short keeps my hair soft and not frizzy because i have course hair.. Great product.!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used Lisa Rachel Conditioner &amp; Cleanser for the first time today, and so far I&#x27;m impressed.  I am Caucasian with thick, coarse, colored hair that frizzes at the slightest humidity.  I live in Houston so it&#x27;s a constant battle to get my flyaways under control.  I wash my hair every other day or every two days and flatiron my hair every day to keep it in check, but the styling and coloring have taken a toll on my hair.  I decided to try a cleansing conditioner to help bring back some of the softness my hair has lost, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for a product that I wasn&#x27;t sure would work for me (i.e. WEN).  I really liked how rich and creamy Lisa Rachel C&amp;C was and how it tingled on my scalp.  It gave me the feeling of getting clean even though there weren&#x27;t any suds.  I used the max recommended for my hair length and a small amount as a leave in conditioner.  I did my normal styling routine and noticed right away that my hair was more manageable.  Not drastically, but definitely different.  When I stepped outside, it was raining, and I thought I&#x27;ll really be putting this stuff to the test.  7 hours later, my hair is tame and soft.  Lisa Rachel absolutely calmed my frizzies, even on a rainy day.  My scalp isn&#x27;t itchy or greasy, and I love the way my hair smells.  I dislike mint scents in my hair products (another reason I didn&#x27;t want to order WEN), and it only smells sweet and clean even though it had a mint-like tingle.  I expect my hair to only get softer and more manageable the longer I use this product.  I&#x27;ll update my review when I&#x27;m ready to re-order.  For now, I&#x27;m really happy with the results and relieved I decided to go with Lisa Rachel instead of WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* - It&#x27;s about a month later, and I used up the bottle about a week ago.  I wish they sold a larger bottle so I wouldn&#x27;t have to shop so often because it does go fast even with short hair.  I actually switched to Hair One because they sell it at the Sally Beauty Supply near my house, andI wouldn&#x27;t have to wait for shipping.  I don&#x27;t like the Hair One as much as the Lisa Rachel conditioner/cleanser and will switch back to Lisa Rachel when I&#x27;ve finished the bottle.  Hair One leaves my hair dryer than Lisa Rachel, and I use a regular conditioner along with it to make my hair softer.  I noticed it doesn&#x27;t have the creaminess that I liked with Lisa Rachel and probably WEN users are used to.  It&#x27;s still better for my hair than using regular shampoo.  Anyway, back to this product.  Three weeks after using Lisa Rachel, my hair is much improved.  It no longer feels coarse like horse hair and doesn&#x27;t get as frizzy as it used to.  The longer I use it, the better my hair is.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I expected it to be like Wen but sadly it isn&#x27;t. I need to use conditioner and a detangle after. Also, bottle size was smaller than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;It does an ok job of cleaning hair.</li>
    <li> I am a WEN product user and wanted to see if I could find a comparable product that was less money.  I think I&#x27;ve found it.  I have fine hair and often gets tangled underneath and this product works just as well as WEN in getting out the tangles.  My hair is color treated and using this product  moisturizes yet allows body in my style. I even distribute one pump on the ends before I blow dry my hair.  I like the scent and the texture isn&#x27;t as rich as WEN, but I am fine with the Lisa Rachel product.  It&#x27;s much cheaper and I can get it for a great price on Amazon Prime when I need it.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day except when I exercise and this bottle has lasted me for almost two months now.  Will be ordering some soon.  Try it.</li>
    <li> I always wanted to try a cleanser/conditioner and Wen was just way too expensive. After one use of Lisa Rachel, I loved it! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Since I have been using Lisa Rachel Conditioner and Cleanser for color treated hair, my color has not faded at all. This is very similar to WEN and much less expensive. I love how soft my hair is compared to how it felt when using regular shampoo. My advise is to use lukewarm water to rinse this out with, never hot, as this will leave your hair a bit oily. Other than that I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this condition, thanks!</li>
    <li> The smell of jasmine is overpowering. Seems to work ok as a cleanser though I hate using it because of the smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this locally for a fourth of the price of Wen and the ONLY difference I saw aside from the price is that it left my hair with LESS fly-aways. It tingles, smells good, cleanses, conditions, detangles and leaves the hair smooth and shiny - All that at a much lower cost. I&#x27;m super excited about Lisa Rachel&#x27;s hair products.</li>
    <li> I love the tingling in my scalp thanks to the menthol added, but if you want a FANTASTIC cleansing conditioner alternative, trying Uniqone....prepare for the hairgasm in the shower...you will thank me later...</li>
    <li> Not like Wen, I did not like it too greasy. It felt more like hand lotion not hair cleanser. Not a fan</li>
    <li> I used WEN for the trial 30 day period and loved it. However, the price and commitment turned me off. I saw this in a salon for 1/2 the price and decided to give it a try. I love it. It leaves my normally fine hair full of body for the entire day, without having to use any products. It does leave my hair slightly more tangled when getting out of the shower than WEN did, but that&#x27;s what they make combs for. If you love WEN but don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune, try this product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I started using this as a cheaper alternative to Wen, and also to maintain my purple color. Used correctly, it works perfectly.. leaves my fine/normal hair feeling clean without stripping it or weighing it down. Make sure you massage a few pumps throughout, concentrating on your scalp and moving downward.</li>
    <li> After seeing a good majority of reviews from women with course and curly hair, I was skeptical that this product would work for me. I have poker straight blonde hair that I&#x27;ve been dying black for about 9 years. Before using this product, I tried going back to Blonde, which result was a very elastic, prone to breaking, and all around damaged state. It&#x27;s come along way since then, and is actually growing again, so this product was the next step. After using it the first time, I was worried that a lot of hair was coming out in the shower like some of the other reviewers, but after a few days of washing and seeing the effect it&#x27;s had on my hair, a lot less is actually failing out during the day, so that&#x27;s no longer a worry. I can actually comb through my hair without a lot of breakage!  I still use coconut oil to keep it shiny, but other than that, nothing else is necessary! This product keeps my hair volumized, even when I curl it. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all! I do suggest following the directions carefully and do admit my hair has gone to okay without washing for around 2-3 days to around 1-2 days without washing. This isn&#x27;t a big deal to me though, since I wasn&#x27;t washing it daily to save it from breaking. I definitely recommend it to anyone with normal to dry hair that&#x27;s been dyed into almost oblivion.</li>
    <li> Love it and a cheaper alternative to Wen.</li>
    <li> I have used WEN for a couple of years. Works great, but I add water to the WEN product to make it easier to put through long hair.  I just tried Lisa Rachel and am extremely impressed. Results are near identical to WEN products except that Lisa Rachel does not leave your hair as shiny as WEN. Lisa Rachel product smell is fresher, more creamy and so I use less and don&#x27;t even have to add water to it, and it costs much LESS than WEN.  I would highly recommend this line to anyone who uses WEN.</li>
    <li> ...as good or better than higher priced hair cleansers...my fine straight hair responded very well to this product!</li>
    <li> I AM A WEN USER HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG WHILE.I SAW THIS SHAMPOO READ REVIEWS AND RAN TO BUY IT,I LOVE WEN BUT IT IS A LITTLE PRICEY.I WASH MY HAIR EVERYDAY SO IT DOES GET EXPENSIVE.FOR 11.00 I FIGURED WHATS THE HARM,ANYONE WHO WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS ANYTHING LIKE WEN IS WRONG,THERE IS NOTHING LIKE WEN.THIS SHAMPOO IS NOT CREAMY YOU WOULD NEED THE WHOLE BOTTLE TO GET THE CREAMINESS YOU GET WITH WEN,AND EVEN THEN I DON&#x27;T THINK SO.CHAZ DEAN IS THE BOMB OF SHAMPOO PRODUCTS AND I WILL NEVER STRAY AGAIN. I WILL JUST HAVE TO GET A SECOND JOB TO SUPPORT MY SHAMPOO HABIT.&lt;br /&gt;  STRAY NO MORE</li>
    <li> I get keratin treatments on my hair so sulfate free is a must.  A friend recommended WEN and I was very weirded out because not only do I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s thick and long; the idea of putting something that didn&#x27;t make suds on my hair was disgusting. But he swore, so I tried it and I loved it.  But I didn&#x27;t like the price.  I found this Lisa Rachel gem and the price was right.  I liked it better than WEN.  This particular fragrance is really nice and fresh. It leaves my hair unbelievably soft and fuss free.  Some people said it was hard to distribute through their hair and onto their scalp.  I&#x27;ve found this to be true with any cleanser of this type, you just have to work with it and get the hang of hit.  I usually part my hair 3 times horizontally to get to the scalp: at the front, the crown and the nape.  The key really is the rinsing.  Rinse until you&#x27;re done and then you rinse some more.  Now, when I do use a \\&quot;typical\\&quot; cleanser my hair feels really dry and it&#x27;s much harder to tame.  The only con with this is that it&#x27;s a little more time consuming, to distribute it, massage it in, let it sit and rinse rinse rinse.  I&#x27;m in the tub anyway lounging so it makes no difference to me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product hoping that it would do wonders for my hair, as it seemed to do for everyone else. I generally have to be careful about what I use on my hair since it is so thin. The first time I used it, it made my hair greasy. I continued to use it, as other reviewers suggested, but it never did anything but make my hair look dirty. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for some hair types, but I would steer clear if you have thin hair that is prone to getting weighed down.</li>
    <li> I dye my hair regularly, so I thought I&#x27;d try this to see if it would help my color stay longer. It did seem to make the color fade less quickly. However, I had to use SO much of it! I think the bottle says to use a minimum of 10 pumps. Since my hair is thick and long-ish, I usually had to use around 15 pumps! Not only did it take a long time just to pump it out, getting it distributed all over my scalp and throughout my hair seemed to take forever! I&#x27;m usually in a rush to get in and out of the shower, so this wasn&#x27;t the product for me.</li>
    <li> This product smells fresh and clean (I like it much better than WEN which smells a bit medicinal to me), and the end result is the same...hair is clean without stripping out the color, nice shine and easy to use.  Just put it on when you get in the shower and by the time you are done with the shower, rinse it out and you are done!  I have super thick curly hair with highlights and it works just as good as WEN; I will NEVER spend money on any other product again!</li>
    <li> Did not like this at all. Strong perfume smell. Made my scalp itch.</li>
    <li> Never need another hair care product</li>
    <li> Lisa Rachel conditioning cleanser shampoo is very much like the Wen, same texture and usage.  But this line has no additional products.  I highly recommend it as a positive substitute for the Wen.</li>
    <li> Completely love this product! Great Price! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find something as good as Wen but for less money. This product is ok, but not as good as Wen. My hair tangled a bit, which I can deal with, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel as good as Wen does.  I went back to Wen and glad I did. It did cost less, but you also get less and you have to use the same amount, so not sure how cost effective that really is. Sorry Lisa Rachel, but my hair loves Wen.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, and this is my favorite &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;.  The others are very nice as well, I use the olive oil one on my length, but not the scalp because it gets oily to soon, but the length of my hair just glistens!  Play with them, you will be happy.</li>
    <li> This one didn&#x27;t seem to clean as well for me as others I have tried.  Scent was very pleasant, liked that a lot!  While I liked how my hair felt, I did get more build up than I have with Hair One or the L&#x27;Oreal brand and had to use a regular cleansing shampoo every week or two to get that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling back again!  Still, a decent alternative to Wen if that is what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell very good, smells like an old lady : / It made my hair very soft, but as soon as I dried my hair I noticed my roots looked very greasy. Id rather use regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen products in the past but they are so expensive and some bloggers posted that this is a product that is just like Wen only with a smaller price tag, WRONG!  It does not work like Wen. It left my oily hair very greasy and unmanageable.</li>
    <li> I have used cleansing conditioners almost exclusively for 4 years. They seem to be either terribly expensive or not very effective. I was really pleased with the Lisa Rachel, as it left my hair feeling clean and bouncy, very shiny, and smelling good. I am going to try all the formulas in this line. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It makes my hair feel very silky and it looks wonderful.  I DO have to shampoo my hair about every 3 washes.  I think that would be the case with any of this type of product.  I will not stop using it tho.</li>
    <li> This works really well, on my swimming pool hair. Calms it right down. Great fast service. would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I am a huge WEN fan and use the cleansing conditioner, among other products, daily.  I happened to see this product on Amazon and decided to purchase it as not something to try by itself but to mix it with my WEN product to help extend it because WEN, as everybody that uses it knows, it&#x27;s not in-expensive.  I was surprised to read the instructions on the label and it kind of suggests to use was equals to about 1/4 of the bottle for a single shampoo!  Could this be a mis-print?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is slightly thicker than what I&#x27;m used to but it mixed well with the WEN (about 3-4 pumps of each).  Have not tried it by itself...yet.  But, so far, my hair seems to like it.  Frizzies are down and it feels moisturized.  I wear my hear in a bob and scrunch it, letting it dry naturally so I don&#x27;t brush it throughout the day.  Moisturized hair in this style is critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m liking this and I&#x27;m really glad for the price tag.  I would definitely recommend at least trying this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using WEN for several years and wanted a less costly alternative. This is not it. My hair is not as smooth and tangle free as with WEN and the texture of the product is not as thick and rich. Will try some other cleansing conditioner brands recognizing I may be going back to WEN.</li>
    <li> Wow, this is nice! It is the closest formula to Wen, that I have tried. It&#x27;s thicker and creamier, than some of the other brands out there. It has a nice mild scent as well. Can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair.  Lighter than Wen.</li>
    <li> Recommended this too my mom who wanted to try WEN and she likes it alot. I&#x27;ve used it in the past and like it as well but I&#x27;ve switched to an all natural shampoo bar since the ingredients are a cleaner but still a great product overall.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my hair shine, and manageable.</li>
    <li> Being a devoted Wen user, I was looking for a more economical counterpart.  Upon opening the container, the product smelled somewhat like lilies of the valley.  The minute that the cleansing conditioner was on my head, the smell turned to what could only be described as the odor of mothballs.  While I should have returned it for a refund, instead, I threw it out.</li>
    <li> Close to Wen but still doesn&#x27;t leave hair as tangle free or soft. And the smell isnt as rich.  The price is certainly better. I mixed it with some Wen and its working better.</li>
    <li> Use as directed and your hair will be sooooo soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Wen is a much better product, however this is good for the price,</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative for those of you looking for a less expensive option to the Wen products.  This brand might not have the same range of scents, but they preform well and don&#x27;t leave a greasy residue, and you don&#x27;t have to use half a bottle to get great results.  They leave your hair very soft and manageable and I have tried many of the formulas - all have similar results.  I like the fragrance of this one - it is soft and soothing.  The best thing I can say about the Lisa Rachel brand is that it worked exactly as I expected Wen to but I didn&#x27;t have any of the hair breakage that I had with Wen.</li>
    <li> LUV, LUV, LUV this conditioning cleanser.  I quit using shampoo several years ago .............  I had curly red hair growing up and as a young adult and I always wondered where my curls went.  My hair was weighed down by all the shampoo, conditioners, and hair products that I used.  I decided to go &#x27;poo free&#x27; and started using Lisa Rachel .................  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair after 3 uses ..............  all my body and curls are back.  My hair is manageable and if I straighten or use a curling iron on my hair, the style stays in my hair all day without using any other hair product.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough .............. be sure to follow instructions and leave the product in your hair for several minutes before rinsing.  With Lisa Rachel cleansing conditioner I only clean my hair twice a week ..................  my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily nor does it smell bad.  I use a deep conditioner once a week.  I will never go back to shampoo ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all you Wen users, try Lisa Rachel .................  great product and much cheaper.</li>
    <li> makes your hair greasy and the fragrance is old lady</li>
    <li> This is possibly the worst hair experience I&#x27;ve ever had-and I&#x27;m 56.  I started purchasing WEN products when I tore a rotator cuff and needed to reduce the time I spent with my arms raised above my head to shampoo/condition my hair.  I was underwhelmed with the Wen (Mint), as I felt that my hair was too greasy far too fast.  My hair is fine but thick (fine hair, but a ton of it), straight and waist-length.  At my age, using regular shampoo and conditioner, it stays clean for days, as the scalp isn&#x27;t oily like it was in my 20&#x27;s.  With the WEN, though, if I washed it on Thursday night, it would be showing signs of greasiness by Saturday.  So I decided to try this product instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to explain what a horrid experience it was.  First, the size of the bottle is 4 oz. smaller than the WEN bottle, so the price savings isn&#x27;t quite what it seems.  Secondly, it also seems that you have to use a LOT, and I mean, a LOT more product than WEN.  I suspect that this has silicone in it, because shortly after I applied it, it started to burn my scalp (I&#x27;m sensitive to &#x27;cones in hair &amp; skin products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that wasn&#x27;t the worst of it.  I applied the stuff diligently, just like WEN, but when I went to comb it through, I wasn&#x27;t able to get my big old-fashioned \\&quot;hair pick\\&quot;-style comb through my hair for ANYTHING.  It took forever to comb through, and my hair ended up coming out in handfuls.  I don&#x27;t know how much of it I ended up tearing out, but  it was a bunch.  Then the capper:  after rinsing and rinsing, and ensuring that the product was thoroughly out of the hair (the hair squeaked), and exiting the shower, when I took the towel off of my head, standing bent over, so that my hair would fall toward the floor and I could towel it off--my hair didn&#x27;t fall toward the floor.  Instead, it stayed bunched up near my scalp--nearly two FEET of hair.  It was as though I&#x27;d mixed Crazy Glue and MUD and put it on my hair, and this was AFTER all the product waspurported rinsed out.  I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it.  My scalp still burned, so I put some Humectress in it to see if that would salve the scalp, which seemed to work as it dried, but still, I had a hell of a time combing it out with a very wide-toothed comb.  Honestly, this was a dreadful experience all &#x27;round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only good thing I can say is that my hair didn&#x27;t get greasy as fast as with the WEN, but one experience with this horrible product and I ordered more WEN as soon as I got done with that shower (this time, the Cucumber-Aloe, which I like better than the Mint, for what that&#x27;s worth).  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of WEN, don&#x27;t get me wrong-I&#x27;m just seeking a one-product solution, and I can&#x27;t recommend this Lisa Rachel Conditioner to ANYONE.  I cannot imagine what hair type you could have that would be suited by this, I really cannot.  If you can obtain a sample of some kind, try this before you buy it--I&#x27;d return it if I could, I think it is that unbelievably bad, and I almost never return ANYTHING.  Just incredibly, incredibly bad product.</li>
    <li> Just used this conditioner and cleanser for the first time....not very impressed so far!,at 56 yrs old I&#x27;ve never had knots or tangles in my hair that just running a comb through won&#x27;t get rid of,until today!,my hair has always been very silky and soft and very thick,and,since it grew back after chemo treatment,it&#x27;s loosely curly...sadly now it feels like greasy straw....I&#x27;ll see how it feels at the end of this week,and add an update....&lt;br /&gt;Okay,happier with this product now...not exstatic...but happier!,will decide,when the bottle is finished whether,or not,to get it again....my advice is give it a try,everyones hair is different!</li>
    <li> This is not a bad product.  Some days my hair feels great; some days my roots are super greasy and my ends are like straw and other days it&#x27;s somewhere in between.  When following the directions, I end up with greasy top/straw like ends.  I will continue to try different amounts until I&#x27;m done with it, but will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Product works well. Would recommend it to others. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The product did what they said it would for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin fine hair. It gave it thickness and body.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I was allergic to it. My Sister LOVES it&lt;br /&gt;though.</li>
    <li> Not abfan of this conditioning cleanser. First time I&#x27;ve ever tried a conditioning cleanser. I&#x27;ve been sulfate free for almost 3 years using L&#x27;Oreal. I decided to try this out. My hair is ethnic (I&#x27;m Hispanic) very thick and very curly corse and waist length. Because of this I get the keratin treatment done twice a year at my hair dresser&#x27;s.  Even with that it is still thick just less curly and much much more manageable. I wash and straighten it weekly. Its super healthy and shiny I take really good care of it. I used Lisa Rachel and followed the directions exactly but my hair feels clean, yes, but heavy and a bit greasy? It feels even thicker than usual which is making it feel even heavier. I have a dry scalp and each time I wash I am sure to get all that build up off my scalp but today there are flakes stuck to my hair because it is slightly greasy. I dont even know if greasy is the right word because I guess I&#x27;m not sure what outcome you should get with a conditioning cleanser. I do know it was very very hard to rinse out.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, it isn&#x27;t great.  It is good.  I might buy it again but I do prefer WEN to this....</li>
    <li> I  bought this with hopes it could replace my Wen, since it was getting expensive.  I was able to purchase it at Bed Bath and Beyond with a 20% off coupon.  I did not like it at all.  It made my hair extremely tangly and it would not look healthy after it was styled.  I kept using it for a few days and gave up because I felt like I was putting more stress on my hair than before.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not quite the same as Wen, but definately better than spending what you would on Wen--it made my scalp a little more oily, but o/w OK</li>
    <li> I really like this product I had been using Wen and this product was as good to, me as Wen and not expensive.</li>
    <li> After trying Wen, and also Hair One from Sally Beauty, I tried this one. I am impressed!! My baby fine hair has more volume and looks so healthy! I love Wen, but honestly, Lisa Rachel works just as well in my case!</li>
    <li> does not work very well</li>
    <li> Been using Wen for years, it&#x27;s great but pricey! Found this, reviews looked good, gave it a try and really glad I did! I just might like it better than Wen! Only downside is the 16 oz bottle. Please come out with larger bottles!</li>
    <li> Ok, first let me start off by saying,I&#x27;m no newbie when it comes to cleansing conditioners.I know how to use them and I enjoy using them.With that said, let me tell you about Lisa Rachel for Color Treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;At first it looked and smelled exactly like Hair One, although with a slightly stronger menthol smell.The texture looked identical too.That&#x27;s where the similarities stopped.Upon using it,I noticed it felt heavy and greasy in my wet hair,like I was running cold butter through my hair.(Sorry,but that&#x27;s the closest way to describe it).Another surprise was that it hardly had that tingly menthol feel on the scalp like Hair One, which is odd because it smelled so strong of it. It&#x27;s not easy to rinse out because it leaves a heavy greasy feeling at the roots while the rest of my hair felt stripped and parched.&lt;br /&gt;So after drying and styling I did my \\&quot;Crunch Test\\&quot;. I grabbed a fistfull of hair and gently squeezed.All I heard was \\&quot;CRUNCH\\&quot;.That says enough that a product is not preserving my hairs moisture or adding to it.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I won&#x27;t repurchase because there are better and cheaper options.Yes cheaper,(I paid $15+ for this).I&#x27;ll just finish it off and up my deep conditioning.I just think it was a waste because a product this simple needs to be just that..and do what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> If you love Wen you will NOT love this product.  I noticed at first pump that the texture of the shampoo was alot thinner then Wen.  Because of the thinness of the product it took more to feel like I had enough to do the cleaning. My scalp did not have the same tingly clean feeling I get with Wen also.  After shampooing the comb out was horrible, I have very tangley hair and love that with Wen I can comb right through my hair, with this shampoo I actually rewet my hair and put conditioner on it to feel like my hair had been conditioned.  I so wanted to like this product since it was more affordable but instead I feel I just wasted my money</li>
    <li> Left my hair a little oily.</li>
    <li> I bought this and Wen at the same time.  Lisa Rachel SEEMED so much cheaper.  I should have looked more carefully - the bottle is considerably smaller than the Wen bottle.  Did not work as well as Wen, left my hair greasy and limp.</li>
    <li> I still had to use conditioner afterward,  I went back to Suave shampoo and conditioner and this was thrown away half used.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I began using Wen and tried this last year as a lower cost option.  Honestly, it leaves my hair softer than Wen - wow.  And I really liked Wen.  This is a great product for my natural, wash and go hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I stumbled onto this cleanser at an Outlet store in my town. I am African American with thick curly 3c colored treated hair and normally cowash my hair with conditioner instead of shampoo, but have to wash with shampoo once a month to remove buildup n residue. I have tried hairone and liked it and this product after the first try was impressive. I followed the directions, left it on for 15 mins and my hair was soft and detangled easily. Im going back to get two more bottles.</li>
    <li> I would have gave it a one star rating, but my hair did feel moisurized. This SMELLS TERRIBLE! My dogs shampoo smells better. I purchases some pantene conditioning wash after this purchase and it was much cheeper Only $4.95 and it smells great and works great. I don&#x27;t mind paying a little more if the product is good but not when the product is below standard. I hope this will keep another person from wasting their money.</li>
    <li> I will just keep using WEN.  This stuff left a nasty residue.  I can&#x27;t even GIVE it away!  WEN does everything it says it does. Totally worth the $.</li>
    <li> The product says its comparable to wen and its okay. It says for color treated hair but I&#x27;ve noticed a little of my color fading but other than that its an okay product and way cheaper than what I would pay for wen.</li>
    <li> Good stuff at a great price..... You have to get use to using this kind of shampoo..but my hair is so much healthier and grows now</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS CONDITIONER ITS LIKE WEN BUT HALF EVEN A QUARTER THE PRICE . THE ONLY THING IS THE PUMP EVERYONE IVE ORDERED THE PUMP NEVER WORKS. BUT ITS GREAT FOR MY HAIR.</li>
    <li> great smell and works miracles on my hair. I have thick 3A/4A bra-length natural hair and previously used wen, but was looking for a more economical alternative to help maintain my locks. after reading several reviews by other on Lisa Rachel, I decided to give it a try.  after the 1st use, my hair was noticeably more manageable and I was actually able to use a regular width comb on my hair, even when dry. I love the smell( nice and refreshing) and more importantly that m hair felt soft and clean afterwards, no residue left on strands.</li>
    <li> LISA RACHEL Conditioner &amp; love it</li>
    <li> Excellent! I have been using Lisa Rachel for a while now and very pleased, it works well for me and is so much cheaper than Wen.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time and it makes my hair so soft it&#x27;s like baby-hair. Just love it! I will definitely be reordering it.</li>
    <li> I have been a WEN user for the last 3 years...I accidentally came across Lisa Rachel products, read the great reviews and thought to try it..The price is wonderful!  It does the same thing WEN does.  It has the same consistency..thick.  I would love to see lavender in stock.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER used a better cleanser for my hair... NEVER.  If you have thin hair, damaged hair.. or even.. healthy hair, but you want your hair to have less fly aways.. and less splitting.. get this product!  A few months ago my hair started breaking, and I have tried different thickening shampoos... biotin shampoo.. and all of these did ok.. but my hair kept breaking..I have been using this conditioner cleanser.. and I will keep using it!!! take my word for it.. you will thank me later!</li>
    <li> I loved using Wen but can&#x27;t justify the high price so I went looking for alternatives. I&#x27;ve tried other brands that try to mimic wen as well and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found next to the real thing. Sally beauty supply has one and it&#x27;s *meh*, as well as &amp;#34;renpure,&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This leaves my hair cleansed without drying it out. I have fine hair that tends to look oily unless it&#x27;s washed every day, and this product does not weigh it down. The key is rinsing it out really well.  I would definitely buy again and the reasonable price allows me to do so. 1 bottle lasts me at least a month (I wash my hair every other day).</li>
    <li> I have been a WEN customer for about 2 years, and I love the way my scalp feels and my hair reacts.  However, I am getting to the point where I can not afford, nor justify the expense every 2 mos.  I read the reviews for Lisa Rachel, so I thought I would try it.  I like it just as much as WEN, and I actually do not have to use as much product.  Great Product!</li>
    <li> This product contains PROPYLENE GLYCOL.  It is a known skin irritant and can produce unpleasant fumes, burning and redness of the skin in some people.  Hair One Conditioning Cleanser contains this chemical as well.</li>
    <li> I never really write reviews but I had to on this one. Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used! Just like some of the other girls on here I loved wen but couldn&#x27;t afford buying it every time I was out. So after reading the reviews I got it and it&#x27;s way better then wen in my opinion not only did it make my hair smooth and shinny it feels so clean. One thing I didn&#x27;t care for about wen was the way you can feel the product in your hair all the way to the tips this one you don&#x27;t at all it&#x27;s soft yet clean.</li>
    <li> I have used WEN in the past and liked it except for the price. I decided to go back to sulfate-free hair products and was contemplating which of the WEN products to purchase when I came across this product. So, I purchased it because of the reasonableness of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it works fabulously well. I have a medium length bob and I color my hair to boot. Most styling products leave my hair and scalp feeling icky, so I like to wash my hair often, about every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this product last week I started using it right away. The product itself is a little thicker than the WEN product. In order to spread it through my hair and scalp, I have to make sure that my head is thoroughly wet and then rub the product on my hands to spread it before applying to the scalp and hair. After the first use, I could feel the difference in the hair from that of using regular shampoos. I didn&#x27;t have to apply conditioner before I tried to comb my hair through. I didn&#x27;t style it at all and could feel the softness and suppleness of my hair after it dried. Darned if it didn&#x27;t feel like it had more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am a happy camper with this product. And, I will continue buying it because at this price, it will not break my bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other reviewer mentioned that her hair wasn&#x27;t as shiny as when using WEN. Well, my experience is quite different. My hair is manageable, supple, has body and it shines after using this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to compare to WEN.  Besides the smell (again, I don&#x27;t know why but I really loved it), this was just okay.  I had to use more and it wasn&#x27;t as good imo.  I&#x27;ve since gone back to WEN but, man, I miss that aroma!</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t bad, not a great savings however for 10.99 for 12 oz.  I usually buy 32 oz of Wen online for 45.00-that includes shipping, but this is about an $8.00 savings, and did work about the same as Wen.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try in place of my Wen because it was priced better - Its not a bad product but much thinner that what I am use to.</li>
    <li> In truth this isn&#x27;t a rating of the product.  I never received the product that is listed here.  The seller sent me Hair One instead.  Hair One is another brand of cleansing conditioner that can be purchased here on Amazon, but is cheaper at Sally Beauty Supply and you won&#x27;t have a wait.  I wasn&#x27;t entirely happy with Hair One which is why I went looking for an alternative.  So imagine my disappointment when I opened my box and instead of the Lisa Rachel brand I had been sent Hair One.  I then requested a refund through Amazon only to get a reply that they wouldn&#x27;t process it through Amazon and I had to call them directly during business hours.  To me this seems like a lot of hassel for a situation that should never have occurred in the first place.  To me this is a form of lying (sugar coat it and call it dishonesty if that makes you happier).  They are presenting one product for sale and then giving you a different one for whatever reason and they probably feel it is okay because it is the same family of products.  If they were out of this brand, they should have simply declined my order stating they were out.  Easy.  Instead they were greedy and wanted the money so, they sent me something they hoped I would find acceptable and even if I didn&#x27;t would make it so difficult to return that I may just give up.  Fortunately for me, I charged it to my Amazon Visa and I will easily dispute it through them without the hassle of the sellers customer service.</li>
    <li> I loved this at first, but after using it a while it just weighs my hair down and my scalp smells oily, even with everyday use! Had to go to a different product.</li>
    <li> I have used WEN for many years now (about 6 or 7), but the price is just too high any more. I was VERY happy to discover this product and after using it for the first time, I really like it and plan to continue. It costs a lot less and I don&#x27;t see any difference in the end result. I actually think my hair feels LESS dry than before. And even a little &amp;#34;conditioned,&amp;#34; too. When I put it on my hair, it did feel a little more &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; or moisturizing maybe, but that&#x27;s fine with me as I have very dry, straight, thin, fine hair that I color about every 3 wks, plus I usually have to blow dry (I use WEN Re-Moisturing Mist first) it a tiny bit to get it to stay in a style, every day. The scent is pleasant, not quite as strong and after rinsing it out and drying my hair, I don&#x27;t ever seem to notice anyway, regardless of the product.</li>
    <li> I first used WEN but found it quite expensive.  Someone recommended Lisa Rachel and I love it.  Really can&#x27;t tell the difference between WEN and Lisa Rachel except in cost.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so creamy. I love it. It does not leave my hair oily feeling. I just love it so far.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find a less expensive Wen alternative. This was unfortunately not it for me. I can&#x27;t get past the smell. I think it is just a personal thing, like the kind of perfume you prefer.</li>
    <li> Does not clean as well as I thought and the scent is not very nice.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used Wen and Salon Grafix cleansing conditioners and this one by far is the best for the price. It smells good and cleans well. My favorite so far!</li>
    <li> I do not care for this shampoo... You cannot compare it to Wen shampoo.  You use very little of Wen. You have to use ALOT of pumps of this shampoo.  My hair feels thick and like product did not rinse out.  I threw away my paper work or I eould send it back.</li>
