    <li> This body wash and the moisturing lotion are the only products I have found to help with my chronic body itch.  If I shower with this body wash just as soon as I feel the itching start it will go away for the rest of the day.  Sometimes it takes two showers a day to stay itch free.  I love this gentle wash and the Mosture Lotion.  The Wash is veHry concentrated so a little goes a long way.  I have recently had a problem finding it.  I tried several other exzema products.  They all made my skin itch.  I&#x27;m sticking with Neosporin Body Wash.  I just hope the manufactures get their supply problems worked out.</li>
    <li> This stuff saves my son&#x27;s skin. Nothing else works on his ecsema</li>
    <li> Very good for sensitive skin!!!  I love it and it makes my skin feel so cool. I can&#x27;t use soaps with perfumes and harsh detergents cause my skin is very sensitive, so this product is liquid gold to me cause it feel so good on my skin. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> This body wash is the best I ever tried, wish it came in bar soap, I hide from everyone else! :)</li>
