<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil as part of my skin care regimen for smile lines around eyes and uneven skin tone with acne scars twice a day (after cleansing). I follow this with an avocado oil massage once a day.  So far after one week, my skin has looked better than when I used to use the high-end, expensive creams and serums. I work night shift at a hospital so my skin suffers from lack of rest and sleep and the fatigue and tiredness shows.  I used to wear alot of makeup to look fresh and perky.  Now, I carry my oil in my bag and dab a little around the eyes before my break. Before I go to work, I look in the mirror and I don&#x27;t need any makeup (just mascara).  I&#x27;ve been told I look younger and my colleagues want to know my secret. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and look 35. That&#x27;s great for 10 days use. I have bought 2 more bottles already.  I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I have been using rose hip seed oil for about 2 years now.  I have tried atleast 5 different brands.  This one is not the best, but is pretty decent.  The price is good considering you get 1.2 oz.  Like the brands, this one sinks right into the skin and without leaving an oily residue.  Although I am 40, I have no wrinkles, so I can not tell if it works to get rid of wrinkles as others have professed.  I will say, it is a pretty good and economical moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I like this product, I have ordered the NOW version before, and this one seems much more dense and darker amber in color.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge difference, but have only been using about 2 months.</li>
    <li> WOW !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even tell how much I love this OIL! The quality is amazing. I tried few brands (Trilogy is my second fav) but Koru Naturals (NZ Fusion Botanicals) is simply the BEST.&lt;br /&gt;My skin loves it. I do not use any creams - just pure and organic oils (even under my makeup (Tarte Recreate or Amazonian Clay Foundation).&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this brand! (+ they have lightning fast shipping)</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic! It has very little scent, glides on easily and absorbs very well. A little goes a long way, too!</li>
    <li> I researched this stuff a lot before buying.. Decided on this provider.    Great quality, shipping etc.    My skin is already looking great.    I didn&#x27;t need makeup yesterday.    Ive replaced my moisturizers with this.  Use a natural sunscreen in the am over it.      PERFECT</li>
    <li> I can see that it already started to work, would recommend to anyone looking for something great to get rid of scars.</li>
    <li> I mix a few drop of it with my soothing cream. It&#x27;s moisturizing and smooth. A little gose a long way. Also it&#x27;s not irritating at all since i&#x27;ve got a sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. Mild rosacea and dryness. This has been the best oil. I have tried Shea, Cocoa, Jojoba, coconut, ect.. this stuff soaks in fast and doesn&#x27;t leave you all oily. three or four drops does me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one year now. Before I started using it, my skin was really dry and I had some noticeable wrinkles. This oil softened my wrinkles. I am 38 years old, and I am happy how my skin looks. I don&#x27;t know if there are better quality products in the market. This is the first brand of rose hip oil I bought and I liked it and continued buying it. The price is fair and it ships fast. I always get this product within three days of ordering it. I bought this oil for my two teenager daughters also. They like it too. One of my daughters has acne. I read that she is not supposed to use it with her acne, but she still uses it. My daughter says that this oil does not clog her pores,(the Non-comedogenic creams, that her dermatologist recommended, clog her pores). The one thing I do not like about this oil is that during summer time, it is very hot outside and as I sweat, and the sweat get close to my eyes, my eyes burn because of the oil I applied. I supposed I should use this oil only at night before going to sleep, but I like having it on all the time.</li>
    <li> I orginally bought this product to help remove the acne scars on my face, after hearing how it removes scars well. But It made my active acne worst so I started using it on my hair. This product made my hair soft and more moisturized than it has ever been. I Have natural african american hair type 4a/4b, and use a little of this product after I am done washing and conditioning it. Its a small bottle but you dont need to use alot of the oil on your hair just a few drops. Its also USDA certified 100% rose hip seed oil.</li>
    <li> i like the product and benefits but, i have to put a cream or something on top because i cant handle the smell so much, as if i was putting cooking oil LOL im sure is not the case, is just the way it is</li>
    <li> I did notice a difference after about a week. It moisturized my face and made it look brighter. I use it at night under my regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this only for facial use. it&#x27;s wonderful! I mix it with my Mario Badescu honey moisturizer. I also wipe one drop around my eyes at night. skin has improvement so much.</li>
    <li> This product is really organic...i use it for a scar and its starting to disappear....i love it i also use it for my face..this company has a great product and great customer service...</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It has so many beneficial properties and goes on very smooth.  I will get this again!</li>
    <li> This product is very silky feeling and absorbs instantly.  My skin glows and my normal winter flakyness is gone.  I haven&#x27;t seen any wrinkles disappear or soften, but I hope with time some improvement in this area will occur.  At the very least I can rest assured that supreme antioxidants are being delivered to my skin and in a most affordable manner.</li>
    <li> Go to product. Big fan</li>
    <li> Got as a gift I have very dry feet and heard on a TV show this was a good item to use.  So far I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
    <li> Me encanta este aceite,, el pedido llego bastante rapido y ha funcionado muy bien en mi piel para marcas de acne.. si tienes piel grasa es recomendable que lo coloques en la piel de forma ligera y no espesa.. En general le doy 5 estrellas..</li>
    <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t have any rave reviews for this product.  I read a lot about Rose Hip oil and decided on this product over others.  I have been using it for about a month and it has not changed my life any.  It has not distinguished itself in any way.  I have not noticed any changes in my skin.  I have been using it on my face and hands. I don&#x27;t know if I have to wait longer to notice any benefits, all I know is that in a month I have noticed 0 signs that it is remotely more beneficial than a cheap drug store face cream.  I am a little disappointed actually. I was hoping to really see some changes.  I will use it until its gone, of course, and get a true opinion of the product. But so far, I would not buy it again or recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It dried out my skin in about 3 days usage.  I can&#x27;t tell you if it is a property of the oil or just my skin type.  I asked for a refund and the company responded immediately.</li>
    <li> my daughter&#x27;s psoriatic arthritis was a total life altering situation for her. With this product she has found relief and feels that as she continues to use it things will be even better.</li>
    <li> The high quality of this product combined with the low price cannot be beat! I have searched for rosehip oils elsewhere and love this one. I am very satisfied with this purchase, and love buying from Koru Naturals.  I use the rosehip oil to clear up hyperpigmentation, and it seems to be helping fade those marks. I will continue to use and will certainly repurchase from KN when I am out!</li>
    <li> I RESEARCHED THE BENEFITS OF ROSEHIP OIL, I WILL KEEP THIS PRODUCT FOR SURE BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE A NICE SMELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I GUESS I CAN OVERLOOK THE SMELL</li>
    <li> I used this product as I compared it with the one from Spain, and it did worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;Is self absorbent and when used twice a day help to improve and clear the dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product, but I do prefer organic, as is free of pesticides and other unwanted chemicals.</li>
    <li> I read about rosehip oil and decided to give it a try. I am in my early forties and wanted to try it out on my fine lines/wrinkles. I have been using it for about a month. My skin is softer and my fine lines/wrinkles are less noticeable. The addictive part is that I am using it twice a day and I absolutely love how my skin feels so hydrated after using it. I travel a lot and have had periods of panic when I have thought I left my rosehip oil behind. I have tried lots of other creams and &#x27;potions&#x27; and this is the best I have used.  This is my go to beauty staple.</li>
    <li> Rose Hip Seed Oil is excellent for acne scarring.  I  Personally have seen results My skin is brighter, and my complexion is more even since Ive been using the product. It DOES NOT promote acne, in fact, Ive seen LESS breakouts since Ive been using the product. I love this stuff and I use it on my clients as well.</li>
    <li> INCREDIBLE! MY BEAUTY SECRET!!! I use this when I get out of the shower on semi-damp skin as a night serum and wake up with rejuvenated, glow-like, brighter looking skin! Rose Hip Oil is food for the skin it gives you the vitamins and nutrition that your skin is missing and it absorbs beautifully! The bottle may be small, but the results are quite powerful. I would highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This Rose-hip seed oil is wonderful-it smells great, is a wonderful oil for use with nightly skin care. Thank you Amazon for making available to us, so many wonderful products!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff.  I&#x27;ve had a few scars on my cheeks for several years now and I can tell a significant difference in their appearance.  I have naturally oily skin and this oil does NOT make me break out.  I put it on in the mornings after my tea tree oil and at night.  The fishy smell that people talk about is more so out of the bottle.  It&#x27;s not strong and I asked my coworkers to &amp;#34;smell my face for fish&amp;#34; and they didn&#x27;t smell anything, lol.  But then again maybe it&#x27;s because I put mine on after the tea tree.  Anyway, it makes you look younger and refreshed.  After only using it for a month, I can only imagine what the difference will be in a year.  I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> I rawly liked this oil. I went through it quit quickly it is light and my skin seems to respond well to daily use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  The seller was great and the oil is lasting a very long time.  I have ordered more skin care products from this company and I have been very pleased every time I&#x27;ve purchased from them.  I use this every night before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the healing, antioxidant and firming benefits of rose hip oil.  Add a small drop to your hand, then add you moisturizer and apply to your face.</li>
    <li> I have waited to write a review to see the results it has on my face.....and I can tell you that this is really good. I have a wrinkle between my eyebrows and it helps vanishing it. Also the bottle has a dropper which helps in getting just a small amount of oil each time so it lasts a lot. I honestly recommend this oil instead of spending lots of money on expensive brand creams.</li>
    <li> This Rosehip seed oil is amazing.  I use it with my alcohol free which hazel on my face and as an aftershave.  The customer service is top notch.  I had questions about the oil and received an answer right away.  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> This oil has eased the dry skin on my face, which evolved due to having my gallbladder removed.  Prior to having gallbladder disease I always had oily skin; however, in the wake of the gallbladder problem  my skin had become painfully dry and flaky which is a common side effect.  NZ Fusion Botanicals Organic Rosehip Seed Oil has been a blessing and I use it daily.  It is pure and has no preservatives, so make sure to keep it in the refrigerator so that it doesn&#x27;t go rancid.</li>
    <li> The container looks small but it will last you a long time, and the product it self is amazing. Great buy!</li>
    <li> After I wash my face, I put this on my face and neck before going to bed.  It actually gives me some slightly rosy cheeks and is a natural way to moisturize.  I am on my second bottle now - it lasts maybe about 2-3 months for me as it doesn&#x27;t take much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after reading what Miranda Kerr said about it.  Although I don&#x27;t look like her yet, I do like how my skin looks and feels after I use it ( I&#x27;m in my 60s.)</li>
    <li> Anne F. Pagan from New York- This is the second time I purchased this product.  It leaves your face soft, and smooth, especially when you have sensitive skin.  I only could use natural stuff for my skin.  Its absolutely great when I am doing my honey mixed with rose hip oil and sweet almond oil mask.  I have oily skin and no wrinkles, and it seems it balance my skin.  Its affordable and gives your skin all the antioxidants and the other good stuff your skin needs to look healthy, young, and firm.</li>
    <li> Pure Organic Certified Rosehip Seed Oil is great. I use it daily on face to help soothe and restore quality of skin. I saw big difference in just two weeks. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this oil, and the way it makes my skin look and feel the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It does moisturize the skin but I find it heavy and has a  fishy smell, not like the Now rosehip oil I bought in the store.  But maybe I don&#x27;t know what true rosehip oil should be.  Because I this I cannot use it when I go out and has to reserve it for night time.  Is this how rosehip oil is supposed to smell? I cannot use scented creams, lotions etc. because of my allergy so I would love to have good oil I can trust to use on my skin.</li>
    <li> I am 30 with very fair skin that is dry and prone to breakouts.  I have been using this product for several months and it works wonderfully.  My skin is moisturized and this has not caused any added problems.  I do not really have any wrinkles, so i cannot say if it helps in that area. I was looking for a natural way to keep my skin moisturized and this really does the job.  I will say that as others have stated, it can be a bit frustrating to get the oil out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I feel that it had improved the tone of my skin around my forehead where I was suffering from bad breakouts. It definitely lightened some redness on my skin that was caused from pimple scarring. After about 3 weeks of use on my forehead I noticed that the wrinkles on my forehead (thanks to my endless facial expressions) began to fade, as well. Now, I am by no means old, I am only 23, so I&#x27;m sure that factors into it too, but the wrinkles are definitely less noticeable now than 3 weeks ago. Often I would wake up in the morning and apply my makeup and my forehead would look awful! Now it looks great and I can barely notice.    I would definitely recommend this product. I only wish it came in a larger size! I already ordered some for my sister.</li>
    <li> The air is so dry in the winter.  I use this in lieu of a moisturizer at night.  It&#x27;s not oily.  It makes your skin very soft.  Just use a few drops.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My mid-fifties skin just soaks this oil up, leaving it incredibly hydrated and soft. Just what I needed right now in the middle of winter! I appreciate that the oil is organic - it&#x27;s a very high quality product.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery. Haven&#x27;t had the product long, but so far loving it. Pleasant smell, very moisturizing without being greasy. Deffinatly will repurchase!!!</li>
    <li> After a lot of time spent researching what would be best for acne scarring I purchased this product. I don&#x27;t see a difference, and used it diligently.</li>
    <li> I started using this as a moisturizer because I needed something different after I moved and I found that I needed to use something that could deal with both semi-humid summers and dry, cold winters. Not huge into using skin products in general, I just wanted to keep things simple. This oil is so light and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do thus far. My skin also feels softer and smoother. I haven&#x27;t tested it out for winter yet though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I will say that it&#x27;s had a fortunate impact I hadn&#x27;t considered when I purchased this. I had bad acne as a teenager and in my mid-30s I still get breakouts now and then. It is incredibly fantastic for acne. Strangely enough. Never thought an oil would. It dries out the pimples. Seriously. I occasionally get a huge one that usually lasts a few weeks to a month despite what I use (causes me no end of grief). Within less than a week of using this oil just as a moisturiser when I wake up and before bed, and it&#x27;s going away. No ickiness either. Just drying out and getting smaller and smaller. I&#x27;m almost wishing I had this when I was 15.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle oil. Bought it to use on my stretch marks, but discovered that I would love to use it on my entire body. This oil completely moisturized without leaving behind a greasy feel. I use shea butter as my primary moisturizer, so I know all about feeling greasy. Wish this came in larger sizes so I could bathe in it lol. Unfortunately, I will no longer be able to purchase this brand because I used the bottle up in about 2 weeks (twice a day application on areas with stretch marks). I need to buy this oil in bulk sizes for my purposes since my stretch marks are extensive AND I now plan to use it on my entire body. However, if you only need to use this oil on small areas it will last you a long time and is amazing quality. Life changing. My stretch marks already look much better and they are super old (like ten yrs old). Cant wait for the next few months. Im optimistic about the final results since things already look better after 2 weeks, and I have spent tons of money over the years on products catered specifically to stretch mark fading that never worked at all. Shipped super quickly as well.</li>
    <li> I received my order a week ago but I am very unhappy with the oil; it has a strong rancid smell.  I don&#x27;t think this is normal as I have used a different brand before and it didn&#x27;t smell like this.  I was wondering what is your return policy.</li>
    <li> i am VERY HAPPY to tell all I COULDNT BE MORE PLEASED WITH THIS SELLER(koru naturals) OR THE PRODUCT!! Product arrived super prompt,packaged perfectly&amp;in PRISTINE CONDITION. Sadly alot of sellers show a picture of an item&amp;this is what you believ you&#x27;ll recieve when you order from them but it ISNT  what you get. KORU NATURALS SENT ME EXACTLY WHAT WAS IN THEIR PICTURE:A brand spankin&#x27; new unopened boxed bottle of pure organic rosehip seed oil. I cant say enuf about how much it pleases me that a seller stands by their product picture. Thank YOU KORU NATURALS &amp; Thank you Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I saw online that Rose Hip Oil was good for people who had eczema or itchy skin. They are right! I&#x27;ve been an eczema sufferer all my life and this really does help. In the past few years I have been getting eczema around my eyes. Ever since I&#x27;ve been putting oil on my face (I also do Olive Oil) I have not had a full blown case of eczema all this year! My skin on my face has also improved especially around my eyes less wrinkles. I highly recommend this for people with dry and itchy skin!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Helps soften wrinkles and maintain good moisture levels.&lt;br /&gt;Only wish the bottle had a better spout, the oil comes out too slow.  In my 50&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;and this product has helped my skin appearance so very much.</li>
    <li> It absorbs beautifully and works better than any processed product ever could. this one is much cheaper than some and seems to work just as good. Try it!</li>
    <li> This is very high quality essential oil. I would definitely reorder. The oil makes your skin smooth and helps with wrinkles.</li>
    <li> this oil smells pretty nice and arrived quickly. Overall I am satisfied. Apparently there is a word limit to these reviews, now it is met.</li>
    <li> I love the effect that rosehip seed oil has on my face, and this product is no different.  I have been using it in place of retinol products and it keeps my skin smooth and soft.  However, the company needs to rethink its packaging.  The plastic stopper at the top of the bottle, which is supposed to allow just a few drops of oil out at a time, lets out NO oil. I can&#x27;t get the product to come out of the bottle at all unless I shake it so vigorously that I splatter the drops I&#x27;m trying to get out all over the place.  I will either have to drill a larger hole in the plastic or take the stopper out altogether and just hope I don&#x27;t pour out too much.  So, the packaging needs some work (which is why I give the product four out of five stars). But the oil itself is good (if I can ever get it out of the bottle!)</li>
    <li> I like to put this stuff on my face at bedtime in the winter to combat dry skin.  This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> Excellent product...used to treat scar tissue...improvement in density of the scar noted</li>
    <li> I have purchased this before and never had an issue with it.  This one seemed to get rancid shortly after I received it.  It was put in the same dark, cool location as the previous one.</li>
    <li> I thought the other reviews mentioning rancid oil were flukes until I received my order.  Oil was thick with a rancid smell &amp; did not have the light color &amp; fresh scent of other rose hip oil. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Ok, first the good. Yes, this product did get rid of some of the newer dark spots on my face as well as faded some of the older ones. It has also made my skin smoother, less oily, and made my pores smaller. Now, the bad. I don&#x27;t have particularly acne prone skin and the product states on the box that it is not for acneic skin, yet it broke me out. Nothing too bad but I definitely developed a problem with pimples while using it. So my old scars faded but I got new ones from the pimples the product gave me. I followed the instructions for application on the box exactly, yet I couldn&#x27;t seem to keep the pimples at bay. I haven&#x27;t given up on it, though. I&#x27;m just very, very diligent now about using masks and scrubs to try to curb some of the small pimples I now have on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
    <li> I have combo skin, so I bought this based on a glowing article on its benefits. After years of struggling to find something that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne or leave my skin flaky and dry, I had hoped this might solve my problems. I have now been using it for 5 months (once morning and night) and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve been blown away by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- does keep dryness at bay, especially around the nose.&lt;br /&gt;- does soften skin and help even oil production.&lt;br /&gt;- seems to work best at night.&lt;br /&gt;- spreads well, with a few drops going a long way.&lt;br /&gt;- the bottle is excellent - small, made of glass, with a cap around the lip for pouring out drops and minimizing waste.&lt;br /&gt;- has expiration date clearly labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- can make oily parts of skin feel greasy, especially when put on in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;- aggravated acne-prone sections of face (forehead, cheeks).&lt;br /&gt;- smells a little odd.&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t minimize acne or scarring.&lt;br /&gt;- has expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, an okay oil, especially for the cost. But I think I&#x27;ll buy something else when it&#x27;s done/too old.</li>
    <li> I do not have anything to compare this to since this is my first rosehip seed oil but I will definitely purchase again.  I have been doing a lot of things differently with my skin so hard to say what is really causing the most improvement but I do know my skin likes this oil.  It does NOT smell good/fragrant but its not like you are walking around with a face smelling like fish either.  I only use this in the mornings and we have pretty rough winters here but so far my skin has held up pretty well.  I usually break out more and have flaky spots in the winter but now my skin seems to be more hydrated inside and out.</li>
    <li> I got a bad sunburn all over my body about 2 months ago.  I applied NZ Fusion Botanical rosehip seed oil, a few hours after sun exposure, only on my belly because I&#x27;ve been using it to help prevent pregnancy stretch marks. Later that night, I noticed that despite my belly being red from too much sun, it didn&#x27;t burn at all, while the rest of my red skin did. I attributed that to the oil. I hadn&#x27;t applied anything else to my stomach area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And earlier tonight while making dinner,  one of my hands was exposed to hot jalapeno slices.  Three of my fingers burned for about 4 hours before I remembered to try the rosehip seed oil as a remedy.  Just minutes after applying a generous amount to the burning fingers, the burning sensation was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for the help in stretch mark prevention, so far at 35 weeks pregnant I have none.  For 13 weeks I have used it once daily almost everyday, maybe missed 5 days or so during the time. I have always applied it heavily.  I want to add that at about 18 weeks pregnant I began to cut out many foods which are not nutrient dense.  I&#x27;ve also been steadily increasing leafy greens and fruit in my diet for 2 months.  My weight gain has been slow and steady. I do believe that my nutrient rich diet has helped immensely in the health and resilience of my skin, and the oil is a wonderful plus which adds to the health of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have never been overweight, I do have old, barely visible stretch marks right above my butt, some behind my knees and the back of my thighs below my butt. I suppose some of these stretchmarks are from normal growth, but the ones on my thighs I think are from sudden and unhealthy fat accumulation at some point.  So I assume that puts me in the category of being genetically predisposed to stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To finish - the oil has, to me, a very slight hay aroma, which I find inoffensive.  The color is a dark yellow.  It goes on light and absorbs well unless you apply it thickly.  Doesn&#x27;t appear to stain clothing, but might leave an oily scent on your clothing until you wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new look did not change the smell, texture or color of the oil.  It still comes in a dark amber bottle with a euro dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pour the oil into a cobalt blue or amber spray bottle for an easier application to larger areas of the body, and I keep them refrigerated for maximum freshness.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent product.  I like it</li>
    <li> Love Koru Naturals.  Have used a few NZ Fusion products and all are quality and excellent for the skin.  The rosehip oil is perfect for an after sun on the face.  Very moisturizing! Skin looks excellent after use.</li>
    <li> This product does not have a scent as explained in description. I do see a glow to my skin. It can appear glossy so I tend to use it at night. But I also have used it under makeup and it does give my skin a glow.</li>
    <li> I received my product within a couple days and it is exactly what I ordered. I&#x27;m using this product for skin care and so far so good but it&#x27;s only been a couple days.  Excited to see if I will see any benefits to my skin.</li>
    <li> only have had it for 3 days and so far i like it, however the its pretty hard to get drops of the oil out of the bottle. Wish it was just a little bit easier.</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic for face skin! Wow! I recently switched from face lotion to oils (argon and coconut oil) and wanted to try adding rose hip oil to the mix. In adding Rosehip Seed Oil as the top layer (first argon, then coconut, now rosehip oil), it has made just the difference in moisture. My skin feels like rose petals. I can&#x27;t believe the difference. It feels great not using lotions that contain ingredients I don&#x27;t recognize. I&#x27;m 49 years old and get tons of compliments on my skin. I highly recommend this brand&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
    <li> This oil seems to have a softening effect. The quality also seems good.&lt;br /&gt;If you are expecting a rose-scented oil, that is not what this is.</li>
