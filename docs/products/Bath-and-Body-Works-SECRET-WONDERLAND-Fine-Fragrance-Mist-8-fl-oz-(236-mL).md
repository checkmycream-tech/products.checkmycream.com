    <li> Love it so much I bought another bottle!!</li>
    <li> I JUST PURCHASED this 2 days ago and I just got it in the mail!!! Very fast shipping! I love the fragrance and I will highly recommend this seller to anyone! So happy, Now I can wear my new fragrance for Christmas! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Came on time and smells great.</li>
    <li> The wrong scent was delivered.  However it did reach me before anticipated.  I&#x27;m currently overseas and did not respond to the seller, so they may have fixed the issue had I pressed them.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this on Amazon, it is discontinued at the stores and I was almost out! It did cost a little more than the retail store sold it for, but I am just happy to have more.</li>
    <li> Perfect !! They discontinued this at B&amp;BW so I had to get it from here and its still great ! Cheaper too !</li>
    <li> I specifically ordered this product because the photo showed the fine mist spray bottle, with the cap that twists off. What was sent was actually a completely different bottle, the one with a cap that doesn&#x27;t twist and has a thicker spray stream. Really disappointed in the product photo and what was sent to me. It was the correct scent, but completely different perfume bottle and spray.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I asked for. 5 stars</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know what to say about this product just that it smells good just as I expected it to smell like</li>
    <li> Awesome perfume and it came when it was supposed too!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. Bath &amp; Body Works discontinued it. Bought two bottles and both were exactly what was expected.</li>
    <li> im a big bath and body works fan already, and i never thought id like another fragrance besides brown sugar n fig, but this is wonderful, it smells so gud, and actully last through the day, i work at a pretty busy hospital, and im always getting compliments on it, great product, strong but not over-bearing!</li>
    <li> Soft lovely fragrance</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom, because it is her #1 favorite and they have discontinued it at our mall. There was lots of it and it smells great! She takes one in her purse and leaves the other in the car.</li>
    <li> it is my third bottle of it ,</li>
    <li> This was horrible. Smelled like alcohol. And i know what its supposed to smell like. It used to be my favorite scent. Idk if they somehow tampered with the perfume and topped it off with something else or what. But it was horrible.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, the product was in perfect condition! Love this fragrance, and Bath &amp; Body Works no longer makes it. Was so glad that Simply Blissful had it! Will definitely use them again! I get so many compliments on this body mist! Thank you so much for having it available!</li>
    <li> it doesn&amp;#34;t seem to be as strong in scent as my other bottle.  It seems like it is old. Thank you</li>
