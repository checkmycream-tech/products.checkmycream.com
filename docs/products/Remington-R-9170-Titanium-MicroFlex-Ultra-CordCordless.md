### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Not the best cordless shave you can buy, but the best you can buy for the money.  </li>
      <li>best I&#x27;ve had of any electric razor.</li>
      <li>The price is excellent for the quality you are getting.  </li>
      <li>Great deal!!</li>
      <li>the con side, I think its not the best at shaving stubble below the chin.</li>
      <li>Very good shaver.  </li>
      <li>I have used Remington for 25 years but R 9170 gives a very good shave but head components and hinges  </li>
      <li>Was going to buy two because price was very good, but plastic components and hinges made me change my mind.</li>
      <li>LOL  </li>
      <li>The side trimmer is great for eyebrows and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is great for those of us who are a day or two</li>
      <li>Great shaver for the price (paid ~$35).  </li>
      <li>Includes a travel pouch which is very handy.</li>
      <li>The titanium blades are very effective and noise levels are acceptable.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this shaver for more than 6 months and it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>Price is certainly good compared to Norelco.</li>
      <li>And that&#x27;s the good news.</li>
      <li>As if it were a good thing.</li>
      <li>Good close shave and 1-hour charging time is nice.</li>
      <li>The R-9170 cost more than the $50 Norelco and I&#x27;ll take that crummy Norelco anyday!</li>
      <li>It gives nice close shaves.  </li>
      <li>I would say it is the best economic shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>Recharge light works good in letting you know when to recharge.  </li>
      <li>The shaver works excellently and did not trouble me till now in any way.</li>
      <li>The closeness is OK, probably the best I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver but nowhere near as close as a blade shave.  </li>
      <li>The shaving is very smooth.</li>
      <li>Boy, I am glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Many years ago I bought an electric razor and didn&#x27;t like it and used a razor ever since.</li>
      <li>R-845 if I had to do over again, even though it cost a bit more.</li>
      <li>Use it most every day.</li>
      <li>, so it feels like you have to work the shaver more to do what you want.  </li>
      <li>The Remington R-9170 is an OK shaver, but I have used better.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I am very happy overall with the quality and performance of this razor.</li>
      <li>Feels like the shaver blades aren&#x27;t able to cut as well as the R-845, they seem to pull more.  </li>
      <li>I am not going to try electric shaver any more.</li>
      <li>He is satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>My mach 3 is just so much better</li>
      <li>The gist of this shaver is simply, a better value.  </li>
      <li>If it cuts a whisker it is by mistake, its much better at pulling them.</li>
      <li>For the current deals on Amazon (I got mine for $30), its an excellent shaver.</li>
      <li>The Remington does not shave as close and yields more skin irritation.  </li>
      <li>Thank you for such great service!</li>
      <li>the price with free shipping is amazing.</li>
      <li>The razor can be used plugged in and gets many shaves per charging.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this at Sears for $70 after my Norelco battery gave out after 15 years (yup, 15 years), and there is no way this is worth that kind of investment, but at $35 its probably an OK buy.  </li>
      <li>It recharges very quickly.</li>
      <li>The razor is easy to rinse out when you&#x27;re through.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for its value and for doing a good job with its purpose.</li>
      <li>The shaver is well designed for easy handling and cleaning, while delivering a comfortable, &lt;br</li>
      <li>Since the Remington cost less than one-half the price of the Norelco, I like the Remington best.</li>
      <li>I also received my product quickly!  </li>
      <li>It does not shave smooth.</li>
      <li>Plus the razor does a fantastic job also.</li>
      <li>The razor is light weight.   </li>
      <li>When you clean the unit, it just feels like it can break easily.  </li>
      <li>The actual model itself is pretty sleek and the power button is very good (push it once to turn on/off).  </li>
      <li>Amazon should probably, like most of their products they broker for, check them out first and test them...</li>
      <li>The item was delivered using Super Saver Shipping (free),  &lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>Gives a clean shave.</li>
      <li>But you should manually take the blades out, clean and oil them every couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my purchase and will certainly use Amazon.com again.</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
      <li>I have also had very good results from using Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave (green formula with Tea Tree oil).</li>
      <li>You also have to go over your face 4 or 5 times to get a good shave, whereas the R-834 only required 2 or 3 times.  </li>
      <li>so we can take it to travel &amp; it is really good on skin &amp; so simple to operate.</li>
      <li>But the last $50 Norelco was not that good, so I tried the Titanium Ultra R-9170.</li>
      <li>It can be used for a month after a full battery charge.</li>
      <li>I think to get the most benefit from any electric shaver, you really should buy a quality pre-shave treatment of some sort.</li>
      <li>I was back with excellent results, and continued to use it the next 8months I&#x27;ve been redeployed in Iraq and</li>
      <li>This is a top-notch shaver, and was on sale for only 1/3 its regular price.</li>
      <li>Cordless power is good and runs shaver for a long time.  </li>
      <li>I ran across this item purely by accident, but I am so pleased to have gotten such a high quality product for such a great price!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I think its a very good buy for such low prices.</li>
      <li>Pretty good, but does take a long time to shave your face.</li>
      <li>it adjusts nicely to all facial contours.  </li>
      <li>My old Norelco died after many years of dependable service.</li>
      <li>Other than that, seems to be a good electric razor.</li>
      <li>Right from the start</li>
      <li>If I had it to do over again, I would have read reviews more carefully and spent $50-$60 to get a really great razor.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the Remington R-9170 for my dad as a Christmas gift he liked it so much he wanted a second one.  </li>
      <li>A $90 corless selling for less than $50 is a good deal.</li>
      <li>Its good that you can have cord &amp; cord less shaver.</li>
      <li>I also now always start with shaving my neck first.</li>
      <li>For the first week</li>
      <li>It holds a charge for a long time and is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>When i received this product my first experinace was horrid.</li>
      <li>This is is my first eletric shaver.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get the same level of closeness as razor.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my son&#x27;s first electric shaver, and he likes it</li>
      <li>Overall, satisfied with its performance..............</li>
      <li>I got the R9170 Titanium after I returned from my first deployment to Iraq.</li>
      <li>This razor worked pretty well for about 10 months.  </li>
      <li>My face was fine from the first shave and it gave me a much better/closer shave than my old Norelco triple head.  </li>
      <li>Other features are nice.  </li>
      <li>This one screams average, although washing it out with water from the tap is a nice convenience I&#x27;ve never had before with an electric razor.</li>
      <li>Decided to buy new blades for my old remington!!!!!</li>
      <li>Cheeks and upper lower lips are fine, but where the chin meets the neck, I get chewed up.  </li>
      <li>it gives a very close shave--</li>
      <li>I really believe the claim that the titanium on the blades makes them sharper.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really believe the claim that the titanium on the blades makes them sharper.  This shaver gives me a closer shave than any electric I have tried previously.  I had gone back to manual blades because I couldn&#x27;t get as close but this shaver seems to do the trick.  I also like the fact that I can take this razor overseas with me since it converts to other volts.</li>
    <li> Es la segunda rasuradora que compro y la primera de Remington, y no tengo quejas al respecto.  Es muy facil de usar y como destaca el manual la primera afeitada no es muy buena pero luego la cara se va acostumbrando.  La cabeza es muy fragil y parece que se puede romper. no hay instructivo de como lavarla con agua (una grafica por ejemplo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Se carga rapido y es silenciosa. tengo dos semansa con ella y no tengo quejas.</li>
    <li> After quite a bit of research, I let myself be snared by the word \\&quot;Titanium.\\&quot; As if it were a good thing. I don&#x27;t know if its the titanium or the design or what, but it leaves the skin of my neck burning for about 20 minutes after use - a problem I never had with other shavers, even very old ones. Now I&#x27;m back to hand-shaving, and only keep these for emergencies - if I have to run. What&#x27;s worse, I&#x27;ve been scared out of buying other shavers, in case they are as bad as this. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington R-9170 and like it. It holds a charge for a long time and is easy to clean. It does take about 2 weeks of use to stop the initial skin irritation but it was stated in the brochure. It recharges very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have had several electric razors over the years some expensive and some inexpensive.  This is the worst, hands down.  It does a horrible job, the first time I used it I thought it hadn&#x27;t been charged long enough, so I plugged it in.  Nothing changed, I don&#x27;t understand how this company could let this product hit the market.  Terrible, horrible, awful!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco, a Schick, and various other shavers, &lt;br /&gt;and this R-9170 has them all beat. The shaver is well designed for easy handling and cleaning, while delivering a comfortable, &lt;br /&gt;close shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     The item was delivered using Super Saver Shipping (free),  &lt;br /&gt;and I received it within three days. You just can&#x27;t beat the &lt;br /&gt;service ! I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my purchase and will certainly use Amazon.com again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Seems to shave close enough but much tougher on the skin than a Norelco. Directions warn about this when it is new but it hasn&#x27;t improved. Price is certainly good compared to Norelco.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this Electric Razor, I believe they are way to low.  The price is excellent for the quality you are getting.  The razor can be used plugged in and gets many shaves per charging.  The design is slick and the head is completely removable to allow for easy cleaning under running water.  The motor is quiet.  The grip is confortable.  The razor is light weight.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this razor 4 stars and not 5 is because there is a short break-in period.  For the first week or so my face was a little sensitive.  The razor comes with a statement saying that it may take up to 3 weeks for your face to adjust.  After 1 week, I was experiencing extremely close and comfortable shaves.  I highly recommend this product for its value and for doing a good job with its purpose.</li>
    <li> After only two months of use the blades started pulling on my beard and irratating my neck area.  I&#x27;ve tried pre shave lotions and they seem to help a little.  I have to put medicated cream on my neck every time I shave.  I don&#x27;t think the blades last long enough.  It seems as though I will have to go back to a Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the price (paid ~$35).  Don&#x27;t understand some of the negative reviews about the irritation.  My face was fine from the first shave and it gave me a much better/closer shave than my old Norelco triple head.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this shaver if you need a new one.</li>
    <li> I really like the shaver. Use it most every day. Does take about one week to break in but after that no problems. Purchased the second one because it&#x27;s cheaper, in the long run, then purchasing a replacement blade.</li>
    <li> The Remington R-9170 is an OK shaver, but I have used better.  After more than 7 weeks, still am getting rough shave.  Other features are nice.  Cordless power is good and runs shaver for a long time.  Recharge light works good in letting you know when to recharge.  Recharging is just a simple plug in.  Would not rebuy this model.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my dad. He is satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> After several attempts to use it over a period of two weeks, I gave up and went back to Gillette M3.  The manual says that after few days you will get used to the power shaver, but after several tries and skin irritation, I&#x27;m back to the good old razor.</li>
    <li> The gist of this shaver is simply, a better value.  I have been a Norelco man for several years now and was reluctant to make the move to Remington.  Boy, I am glad I did.  This shaver is solid and very sturdy.  Essentially, every bit as good as my old Norelco, but half the price! &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;This shaver did take a bit of getting used to.  For about 4 shaves, I had a bit of irritation.  However, I think everyone will experience this with any shaver.  Many reviews about Remington products complain on excessive noise.  I did not experience this with my unit.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this unit 4 is due to its flip up top.  When you clean the unit, it just feels like it can break easily.  This design could be improved. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price this unit can&#x27;t be beat!  If you are looking for an affordable rechargeable shaver, this is the one! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the sole opinion of the writer</li>
    <li> 1.VERY short battery life--battery dead after aprox. 10 medium shaves &lt;br /&gt;2.Battery indicator inaccurate, asks for re-charge after aprox. 5 medium shaves &lt;br /&gt;3.Release button for clippers too low on shaver-- holding shaver normally triggers the opening of the clippers &lt;br /&gt;4.Badly designed releases for shaver head --one needs to press two buttons simultaneously--very inconvenient</li>
    <li> Very good shaver.  It gives nice close shaves.  Just wish the battery would stay charged a little longer, my older Remington would hold a charge about a week longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve liked my R-9170 for the past year that I&#x27;ve been using it.  The closeness is OK, probably the best I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver but nowhere near as close as a blade shave.  But the real disappointment is that battery life is short, and it is not designed to be user-replaceable.  Now even when I use it corded, there are times when it acts as though it is out of power &amp; doesn&#x27;t want to shave.  That is a real disappointment.  I didn&#x27;t expect to be back in the marker for a shaver after only a year.  I&#x27;d avoid this unit, and at least look for one with replaceable batteries.</li>
    <li> I bought this for $32.99 shipped. I would say it is the best economic shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. Good close shave and 1-hour charging time is nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Remington 845 shaver for 5 years and it worked well for me, typically got 2 weeks for each charging.  But charging took an entire day, and if it ran out you couldn&#x27;t get a shave with it plugged in.  So I figured the R-9170 would be an improvement, charging only takes an hour or so, and it can run off the plug.  These are true, but the shave itself is more difficult.  Feels like the shaver blades aren&#x27;t able to cut as well as the R-845, they seem to pull more.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3-4 weeks and still pulling.  I actually got nicked a couple of times, something that the R-845 never did.  You also have to go over your face 4 or 5 times to get a good shave, whereas the R-834 only required 2 or 3 times.  I also don&#x27;t like how the 3 heads are taller and farther apart, plus the heads are angled away from the center (rather than flat like the R-845), so it feels like you have to work the shaver more to do what you want.  In summary, I probably would opt to get another R-845 if I had to do over again, even though it cost a bit more.</li>
    <li> I got the R9170 Titanium after I returned from my first deployment to Iraq. I used it for the 9months I was back with excellent results, and continued to use it the next 8months I&#x27;ve been redeployed in Iraq and its still cutting clean on the original heads!! Titanium has me sold. I&#x27;m thinking of upgrading to the R-9270.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, but does take a long time to shave your face. Amazon should probably, like most of their products they broker for, check them out first and test them...</li>
    <li> Malsima, es como afeitarse con una navaja oxidada. Rompe la piel y hace brotar sangre. Jams la podr recomendar. No sirve, me engaaron!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve held off on writing a review of this item to give myself a break-in period for using this electric razor.  Well, I&#x27;ll keep it and continue to use it, but only because I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning to Amazon (that&#x27;s the big advantage of going to a B&amp;M store).  I transitioned from an old Norelco 835 whose power plug was starting to give out.  The Remington does not shave as close and yields more skin irritation.  The actual model itself is pretty sleek and the power button is very good (push it once to turn on/off).  After running the heads under the faucet, there is still some bits that need to get wiped off manually if you want a a pristine surface.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this shaver. When I use it to shave, I feel like it&#x27;s pulling not shaving. Battery won&#x27;t last long either. &lt;br /&gt;I have to switch back to Philips shaver.</li>
    <li> Would not buy again.  Rough on your face, short battery cycle and not very good shaving job in general</li>
    <li> I received the razor much faster than I expected. The razer is of excllent quality and shaves with very close precision. Also it lasted over a month on a charge.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;KWS</li>
    <li> I have been using a straight razor for over 57 years and with a white beard, I was only shaving every other day because of the amount of time it took to lather up, etc.  With this electric razor, it only takes a second or two to have a daily shave.  It is great for those of us who are a day or two over 30 (14,965 to be exact) and have white beards.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for more than 6 months and it works perfectly. The shaving is very smooth. It can be used for a month after a full battery charge. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco for 38 years (followed my Grandfather and Dad). But the last $50 Norelco was not that good, so I tried the Titanium Ultra R-9170. Right from the start I had problems -- very poor design: hard to turn on (often takes several times) and it&#x27;s awkward to remove the top for cleaning. Plus the hinge will probably break. And that&#x27;s the good news. Now for the bad -- the R-9170 does not come close to Norelco&#x27;s for a close shave. Even shaving longer does not help. Plus, the after shave irritation alone deserves a return. The R-9170 cost more than the $50 Norelco and I&#x27;ll take that crummy Norelco anyday!</li>
    <li> Thought the motor would be stronger. Seems weak compared to Norelco. Other than that, seems to be a good electric razor.</li>
    <li> Not the best cordless shave you can buy, but the best you can buy for the money.  I bought this for my father who shaves every other day so frequent shave irritations aren&#x27;t an issue, but I can see the validity to some of the other buyers&#x27; comments.  I tried this product once and could see how it might bother those with sensitive skin.  It did however provide a reasonably close shave.  For $40 delivered, you can&#x27;t go wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for me, I&#x27;ll stick to the old fashioned blade.  I still can&#x27;t understand why anyone would use anything else. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I ran across this item purely by accident, but I am so pleased to have gotten such a high quality product for such a great price!  I also received my product quickly!  Thank you for such great service!</li>
    <li> I have a new rechargeable Norelco and the R-9170 Remington.  I consider them equal in quality.  Since the Remington cost less than one-half the price of the Norelco, I like the Remington best.</li>
    <li> It does not shave smooth. After you shave, you will still feel like you have sheved a day before, not just now. Each time after I shave with it my skin itches for a while, especially under the lower lip.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I get shave burn when I shave with the razor. I use the electric shave solution and still get the burn. Never had this to happen before.</li>
    <li> Overall, satisfied with its performance.............. &lt;br /&gt;no problem until now..........</li>
    <li> If it cuts a whisker it is by mistake, its much better at pulling them.</li>
    <li> Its good that you can have cord &amp; cord less shaver. so we can take it to travel &amp; it is really good on skin &amp; so simple to operate.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I purchased a lemon, but this was the worst product I ever bought. My old Norelco died after many years of dependable service. Tried this remington model. Didn&#x27;t shave well at all, battery emptied frequently after 2-3 shaves, and trimmer broke as well. Customer service suggested that I send it back to them and wait. I ran back and back and bought a new Norelco within 6 months.</li>
    <li> It is a real pain-maker when shaving. The worst is its the battery that has unbelievable short life span! It should have been returned to Amazon long time ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about seven months now.  I have never really liked electric shavers...they always seem to cause bad razor burn on my neck.  Well, since this was gift from my wife, I thought I would give it a shot.  I used it a couple times and it felt like somebody had jabbed needles in my face.  LOL  So, not to be outdone and determined to make this work, I went and bought an electric razor shaving stick. I just rubbed this powder all over my face and started shaving. It really works. I don&#x27;t get the razor burn anymore from this shaver and it feels like my face is smoother as well. I also now always start with shaving my neck first. I have also had very good results from using Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave (green formula with Tea Tree oil). The razor is easy to rinse out when you&#x27;re through.  But you should manually take the blades out, clean and oil them every couple of weeks. It only takes a few minutes and is very easy. Anyway, I am very happy overall with the quality and performance of this razor. It still can&#x27;t beat a Schick Quattro (or any multi-blade razor), but I find myself using it more and the Schick less. I think to get the most benefit from any electric shaver, you really should buy a quality pre-shave treatment of some sort.</li>
    <li> For the current deals on Amazon (I got mine for $30), its an excellent shaver. This is my first electric shaver ever, and I was a little concerned about my skin...however, it was not that bad. The titanium blades are very effective and noise levels are acceptable.  &lt;br /&gt;On the con side, I think its not the best at shaving stubble below the chin. Also incessant attempts can cause rashes on your neck.  &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think its a very good buy for such low prices.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Remington R-9170 for my dad as a Christmas gift he liked it so much he wanted a second one.  He travels alot, so now he has one at home and in his travel bag.  He has spoke so highly of the Remington R-9170 now my husband wants one.</li>
    <li> Many years ago I bought an electric razor and didn&#x27;t like it and used a razor ever since.I decided to give them a try again and couldn&#x27;t pass this one up.A $90 corless selling for less than $50 is a good deal. Plus the razor does a fantastic job also.The titanium blades and the Remington brand were what sold me.</li>
    <li> This is a top-notch shaver, and was on sale for only 1/3 its regular price. It&#x27;s my son&#x27;s first electric shaver, and he likes it a *lot*. Great deal!!</li>
    <li> The shaver works excellently and did not trouble me till now in any way. Gives a clean shave. World wide voltage helped me a lot. I could use the shaver even at 240V. Includes a travel pouch which is very handy.</li>
    <li> This razor worked pretty well for about 10 months.  Over time the battery life diminished to where I couldn&#x27;t even use it without the cord.  As long as you don&#x27;t need to use the razor cordless I think it would have worked longer.  I tried to see if the batteries were replaceable (not without considerable effort), and when I tried to put the razor back together it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my skin, but this thing eats up my skin.  Cheeks and upper lower lips are fine, but where the chin meets the neck, I get chewed up.  Can&#x27;t believe I tried to live with it for a week!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it and has for 2 years</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Sears for $70 after my Norelco battery gave out after 15 years (yup, 15 years), and there is no way this is worth that kind of investment, but at $35 its probably an OK buy.  The manual says the shave gets better after a few weeks to allow your skin to adjust to the razor, and they are correct.  Out of the box this razor was a big disappointment, but after a couple of weeks I noticed a lot of improvement.  If I had it to do over again, I would have read reviews more carefully and spent $50-$60 to get a really great razor.  This one screams average, although washing it out with water from the tap is a nice convenience I&#x27;ve never had before with an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor on a whim while surfing. I&#x27;ve been a lather and blade shaver for over 50 years. I find the Remington does at least as good a job if I wait till my face is well dried. I get 4-5 shaves on each recharge. The side trimmer is great for eyebrows and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to nick myself  from time to time with the blades. Hasn&#x27;t happened yet with the R-9170 Titanium Microflex Ultra!!</li>
    <li> I have used Remington for 25 years but R 9170 gives a very good shave but head components and hinges  are plastic!!! Was going to buy two because price was very good, but plastic components and hinges made me change my mind. Decided to buy new blades for my old remington!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product was total waste of money for me. Thought of returning, but since I used it once with out success, and to prevent use by other person, I kept it.</li>
    <li> This is is my first eletric shaver. I wasn&#x27;t able to get the same level of closeness as razor. I am not going to try electric shaver any more.</li>
    <li> This shaver burns every time I use it. I do not have sensitive skin. I am sending it back to Remington.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because i expected remington razors to preform. When i received this product my first experinace was horrid. First time i shaved with it, it left rashes, scratched and injured skin on my neck. I have never had razor burns that bad. My mach 3 is just so much better then this terrible product. I reccommend against buying this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year and it&#x27;s held up for that long so I guess it&#x27;s decent.  Never had any problems with it but it isn&#x27;t anything special.  It doesn&#x27;t work well on really thick hair, thatis my only problem with it.</li>
    <li> this baby is a beauty. it gives a very close shave--best I&#x27;ve had of any electric razor. it has a very light touch requiring little pressure to get an extremely close shave. it adjusts nicely to all facial contours.  the price with free shipping is amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a good imitation of the Norelco rotary shaver and it costs less for someone who is price conscious.</li>
