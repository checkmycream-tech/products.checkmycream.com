      <li>Easy to apply</li>
      <li>This blush gives a good pop of color , its not as amazing as I expected .. because I usually love anything nyx ,</li>
      <li>Its to light for me.</li>

      <li>blush is great but the last shipment the container was cracked</li>
      <li>This color is actually a bright pinkish red.</li>
      <li>It is really pigmented and gives your cheeks a lovely glow.</li>
      <li>Love this blush so much.</li>
      <li>A little light, but the formula is excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This cream blush in Boho Chic is really pretty on my light skin.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast with the free super saver shipping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and looks nice, no smells, easy to open package.</li>
      <li>i will recomendend its really soft easy to wash off very worth for the money</li>
      <li>It blends easily and it doesn&#x27;t take much to give the right amount of color to your cheeks.</li>
      <li>GOOD PRODUCT JUST TOO DARK.</li>
      <li>At first it&#x27;s seems to be very gel-like &amp; waxy, but it looks great after a few minutes of wear.</li>
      <li>I mean it&#x27;s not horrible just not so amazing .</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned and blonde and it just barely shows up, which is what I wanted anyway.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Glow looks EXACTLY like the color &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>And as it took more than 30 days to come to my place, I caanot ask for return money back.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>/&gt;SO pretty.</li>
      <li>The colors on Amazon are VERY MISLEADING!</li>
      <li>On the cheeks though it gives a very pretty very natural flush of color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light peachy pink, very sparkly, &amp; stays dewey looking which is important to me in the winter.</li>
      <li>I can use it when I go to California in a dry climate because it sets up better.  </li>
      <li>It is a very light pink.</li>
      <li>The color is a faint rose, if you live in a warm humid climate, this will make you too shiny.  </li>
      <li>Its a really light pink, which is still very pretty.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a bit of shimmer and a more of a Pepto Bismol pink tone than how it looks in the package.</li>
      <li>but if you got it whole..</li>
      <li>The color is much lighter than pictured online.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t very pigmented.</li>
      <li>Also, there are sparkles in this blush in real life as opposed to how it is pictured here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>As I put glow next to natural on my counter top, not even I could tell which was which.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Looks like a light, flirty pink blush, but it&#x27;s creamy</li>
      <li>It is so easy to apply and long lasting.</li>
      <li>so it looks natural too!</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a very pretty pink color.</li>
      <li>As far as application, I recommend swirling your ring finger around in the compact and then dabbing it onto the desired area.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the natural / lighter colors.  </li>
      <li>Natural look.  </li>
      <li>The Boho Chic shade is a very wearable and natural pink shade.</li>
      <li>At first I was put off by the shade, it was much lighter than the picture and hardly an pigmentation.</li>
      <li>a darker color - pink doesn&#x27;t show up very well.</li>
      <li>This color is beautiful and can be as subtle or as dramatic as you want it to be.</li>
      <li>I will say that the way the colors are pictured here are not true to their appearance in real life.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I found this at ulta for cheaper, but so I don&#x27;t know how amazon&#x27;s packaging practices are for this product.. but if you got it whole.. I think it&#x27;s a very pretty pink color. It looks more muted and matte in the compact than it does on the cheeks.. There&#x27;s a bit of shimmer and a more of a Pepto Bismol pink tone than how it looks in the package. It&#x27;s very creamy and looks nice, no smells, easy to open package. It looks good on me as a more middle tanned person, but I&#x27;ve also seen it on very fair skin and it looks great. I kinda wished that there was some kind of warning on the package that lets you know that it&#x27;s shimmery instead of matte. If you&#x27;re looking for a matte blush with the muted color that&#x27;s on the package.. you might need to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The picture is not true to the product.</li>
    <li> Sooo upset. The blush came completely crushed! The cream blush was all over the bubble wrap, not to mention how long it took them to actually ship the item out. I wont be buying from here again</li>
    <li> I love NYX creamy blush. It blends easily and it doesn&#x27;t take much to give the right amount of color to your cheeks. It blends well so it looks natural too!</li>
    <li> blush is great but the last shipment the container was cracked</li>
    <li> Not as dark as I hoped</li>
    <li> Its to light for me. Doesn&#x27;t look anything like on the add</li>
    <li> If you are wary of cream blush, try this mistake proof shade.  The formula is smooth and creamy, and Bohochic is an amazing color.  I have a light/medium skin tone and it&#x27;s just perfect.  I will definitely try other shades.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lighter than the color shown.  It&#x27;s a nice color, but I need to put more on.</li>
    <li> A little light, but the formula is excellent for sensitive skin. I have wildly unpredictable contact dermatitis, and this product hasn&#x27;t let me down. No breakouts. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> It arrived  in a nice case, the color is way lighter then it looked on the website but I will keep it for the summer.  If you want dark this is not the product for you.........</li>
    <li> Love NYX products but this blush did not give my sking the glow I wanted. The texture is too oily.</li>
    <li> The picture is deceiving.  Its a really light pink, which is still very pretty.  I am fair skinned and blonde and it just barely shows up, which is what I wanted anyway.  However, it is not reddish, like this picture shows.</li>
    <li> I am rating this low because the color pictured here is nothing like, not even close to the actual color of the blush.  I was very disappointed.  The actual color is very pale, as to be invisible on my face.</li>
    <li> This blush gives a good pop of color , its not as amazing as I expected .. because I usually love anything nyx , I mean it&#x27;s not horrible just not so amazing .</li>
    <li> Lovely blush. Easy to apply</li>
    <li> I love NYX blushes. But this shade is wayyyyyyyyyyy lighter than the picture. While I can use it, I was disappointed that the color was not what I expected. I have two others that I ordered previously and they were closer to what was shown in the picture. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Color not as deep as indicated on web-site.  Read other reviews should have paid attention to this previously stated issue.</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful and can be as subtle or as dramatic as you want it to be. I have very fair skin and it looks great on me. Shipping was fast with the free super saver shipping.</li>
    <li> Wanted to like this more, but the smell made me throw it away. I put on the blush, got in my car, and I thought my car was on fire - the smell was like burning plastic/wax. Nasty.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice creme blush.  I like the way it goes on, leaving skin looking dewy and youthful.  Sometimes powders can look overly dry or harsh but this blush has a light texture.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! At first I was put off by the shade, it was much lighter than the picture and hardly an pigmentation. It is a very light pink. On the cheeks though it gives a very pretty very natural flush of color. I had been meaning to purchase a shade like this so it worked out!</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d gotten a darker color - pink doesn&#x27;t show up very well.</li>
    <li> I have pale skin with cool/neutral undertones &amp; this color looks very nice on me. It&#x27;s a light peachy pink, very sparkly, &amp; stays dewey looking which is important to me in the winter. At first it&#x27;s seems to be very gel-like &amp; waxy, but it looks great after a few minutes of wear.</li>
    <li> Love this blush so much. It is so easy to apply and long lasting. It is really pigmented and gives your cheeks a lovely glow.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t very pigmented. It was sticky and would need to be set with a powder unless you want a dewy finish.</li>
    <li> This cream blush in Boho Chic is really pretty on my light skin.  It has a dewy finish and is a delicate color.It stays on quite well.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this blush in the shade Boho Chic from Target. I will say that the way the colors are pictured here are not true to their appearance in real life. It is for this reason that I decided to view the colors in person before making a purchase. If you&#x27;re unable to do that then you can always look up swatches or find a review on YouTube. The Boho Chic shade is a very wearable and natural pink shade. Also, there are sparkles in this blush in real life as opposed to how it is pictured here on Amazon. As far as application, I recommend swirling your ring finger around in the compact and then dabbing it onto the desired area.</li>
    <li> This product would be perfect if the color actually matched the photograph. The color is much lighter than pictured online. Apart from that misrepresentation, the blush is perfect.</li>
    <li> I saw a review on YouTube and the lady in the video has the same skin coloring as me, porcelain.  She was wearing Boho Chic blush and it complemented her skin tone perfectly.  I was very pleased that it complements my skin tone as well.  Natural look.  Blends beautifully.  On par with MAC cosmetics at a much better price.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT JUST TOO DARK.</li>
    <li> The color is a lot lighter than shown.  I am medium olive complected.</li>
    <li> It came broken. And as it took more than 30 days to come to my place, I caanot ask for return money back. Awful!</li>
    <li> The color is a faint rose, if you live in a warm humid climate, this will make you too shiny.  It also has some glitter in it.  I can use it when I go to California in a dry climate because it sets up better.  It is sticky to the touch so it stays in place, but will glisten</li>
    <li> very nice easy to use i will recomendend its really soft easy to wash off very worth for the money</li>
    <li> Great color, easy to put on.  Cream blush is hard to find.</li>
    <li> The colors on Amazon are VERY MISLEADING! THEY ARE NOT TRUE TO COLOR AT ALL. Because oof that I&#x27;m very disappointed. You choose a blush based on the color, if the color you receive is totally different than what is displayed what&#x27;s the point? This color is actually a bright pinkish red. I&#x27;ll never wear it and what&#x27;s the point in returning for the price? I should have just bought at my local Ulta and saved the ten bucks as I bought two colors...Boho Chic and Glow. Glow looks EXACTLY like the color &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34;. I had bought that at Ulta and liked it but wanted something a bit darker as I&#x27;m a medium complexion. As I put glow next to natural on my counter top, not even I could tell which was which. Annoyed and bummed!</li>
    <li> I love the NYX cream blushes - they offer so many colors and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the natural / lighter colors.  Boho Chic is my favorite, though!  I have light/medium skin and the color is lovely.  Looks like a light, flirty pink blush, but it&#x27;s creamy so it gives my dry skin a little extra boost.  Definitely not as peach as it looks in the picture. Also - some of the reviews mentioned it was glittery?  I don&#x27;t see any glitter in my Boho Chic.  Just dreamy, creamy, pink &amp; flirty goodness.&lt;br /&gt;SO pretty. Love love love.  Thank you NYX for continuously coming out with affordable &amp; cruelty free beauty products!</li>
