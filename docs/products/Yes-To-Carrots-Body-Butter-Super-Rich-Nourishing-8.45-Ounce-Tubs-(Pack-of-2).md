      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Who knows how many people are allergic to it?</li>
      <li>I used to use Burt&#x27;s Bees body butter (which I still love, and to me it smells like chocolate)</li>
      <li>But it got rid of the dryness in many areas on the body.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love how it goes on.</li>
      <li>The scent is lovely but not over powering.</li>
      <li>There is a light scent that is quite nice.  </li>
      <li>more than once to see if it works.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m far away from there now, but love the fact that I can bring sea minerals to my skin in this wonderful, rich cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay</li>

      <li>Carrots body butter is the best product I&#x27;ve found for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>This body butter is wonderful for dry skin and protection from the elements.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s made of natural products and it smells great</li>
      <li>Overall, very good.</li>
      <li>It is light but moisturizing after my shower without leaving the greasy residue that so many of the body butters do.</li>
      <li>But to keep my hands soft, I&#x27;ll supplement with Ahava, also a great gift.</li>
      <li>This will produce healthy-feeling skin without too much of a scent, which is good -</li>
      <li>It rubs into the skin easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy, oily feel to it.</li>
      <li>it is a bit too strong for me...</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of moisturizers, especially body butters, and this is one of the very best. Despite not being ultra thick like most butters, it certainly moisturizes like them! It has a pleasant smell, yet is subtle, unlike many of the butters I&#x27;ve used; they&#x27;re usually a bit overwhelming when it comes to scent.    This is also one of the very few moisturizers I can use when my skin isn&#x27;t still damp from the shower. Maybe I&#x27;m alone in this, but I usually can&#x27;t apply a moisturizer to skin that isn&#x27;t freshly washed without being very conscious of it being there, and feeling like it hasn&#x27;t absorbed. That feeling drives me crazy, so I usually only apply moisturizer directly after showering. I can use this butter anytime, and it never gives me that feeling that it&#x27;s just sitting on my skin. It also leaves a pretty, healthy looking sheen on my skin without making it look oily.</li>
    <li> I found this body butter a couple of years ago and have been hooked ever since. I must be very careful about the products I buy because the members of my household all have allergies, very sensitive skin and we live in a very dry climate. We have tired every brand of &#x27;hypo-allergenic&#x27; &#x27;scent free&#x27; &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; etc type of lotion and have not found any that can even start to compare to the Say Yes to line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I use the body butter every night and after bathing. Since I began using it I have noticed that my skin no longer has that ashy look from being dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son loves this body butter and uses it after bathing. Since he started using it on a regular basis I have noticed his eczema has been less bothersome to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that other reviewers have said that they had an allergic reaction to this product, which is possible with any product to a certain percentage of people who try it. I am one of those people who gets itchy and is sensitive to scents and such just walking down the detergent isle in the supermarket and the Say Yes to Carrots line is the only line of products I have found that my family has been able to use for any amount of time w/o having any negative reaction. If you are the type of person who is prone to allergic reactions I would recommend trying any new product out at a local store to see if you have a reaction prior to purchasing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because the picture shown was the \\&quot;BODY butter\\&quot; that I had purchased in Walgreens in Florida, which was one of the greatest creams i have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, when i received the product it was not body butter and was not in the container pictured.&lt;br /&gt;This cream isnt the same and is inferior.  Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOOTNOTE: (1/3/14)&lt;br /&gt;I now order this cream, because it still has no parabens..and even though its not the original, its a good cream. The original was made by another company. I guess they were bought out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I bought one that i thought was the original as it was packaged that way, but it was nothing like the previous formula.</li>
    <li> The ingredient-list of this substantial body cream reads like the ingredients of a smoothie with vegetables and extracts galore-- and few of the mysterious chemicals found in most moisturizing lotions.  Natural is nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the name, there&#x27;s no scent or sight of carrots (or dead sea mud for that matter) in the smooth cream, which smells like you&#x27;d expect a hand-lotion to smell (no fragrance other than a lotion scent).  No cloying fragrance is another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A half-hour after application to my hands, my palms still have a slight coating and the backs of my hands have a visible (slight) shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So probably NOT something you want on your hands before handling something smudgable, or working in the kitchen, or petting the family cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for dry skin, this seems a winner.  A small amount goes a long way, so one tub might last a couple of months depending on your usage.</li>
    <li> and Dead Sea mud, pumpkin juice, shea butter, cocoa butter, melon juice, sweet potato extract, and all the other ingredients that make up this wonderful, wonderful body butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, first, this is where I&#x27;m coming from: I have reached an age where my skin is starting to get dry, and this time of year, I sometimes wonder if the Sahara Desert is taking over my body.  I have tried all kinds of lotions, creams, body butters, and although they&#x27;re nice, none has had the staying power of Yes to Carrots C Through the Dry Spell Body Butter.  It goes on nice and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel, and I found the smell very light and pleasant.  Best of all--it works--I don&#x27;t have to constantly reapply it.  My skin feels soft, smooth, and, wonder of wonders, hydrated.  And I can pick up a glass without feeling like it&#x27;s going to slip through my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one final bonus to this body butter: my cats don&#x27;t recoil in horror at the scent, nor do they try to lick it off my hands.  My six persnickety felines have accepted the smell of this body butter and they give it two paws up.  This is very important to me because there are few things worse than having a product on you hands that make my cats run away when I try to pet them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I say \\&quot;Yup\\&quot; to this jar of carrots!</li>
    <li> I am very happy I purchased this cream.  My hands have been extremely dry and cracked the last few Illinois winters.  I just bought this about a  week ago and after a couple of sub-zero days here, my hands are soft and no painful cracking!!  I am buying some for family members for Christmas.  The smell is not like something you would get from a specialty store, but it is not bad either.  Kind-of a neutral scent - neither offensive nor exciting - but well worth the effectiveness!</li>
    <li> One of the first things I check when I use a body or hand cream is the fragrance as I am fragrance sensitive. The fragrance is a turn off for me as it had a sweet like scent to it. I prefer fragrance free, but that is a near impossibility, but when I do I like clean light scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I look for, what type of ingredients are in a product, I prefer the organic made products. All the products in the body butter are natural, no man-made junk. The thing I liked in the Yes To Carrots products is it being a source of beta-carotene. Beta-carotene is a powerful antioxidant that helps reduce daily damage to skin and hair. This was a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like products that leave a greasy, slimey or overly-silky feel to the skin. This product does leave a greasy feel. I ended up rubbing habds and arms on a paper towel. Even after rubbing it off, I still felt a slick film on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I did not like the product. I let my daughter and a friend use the body butter and they loved it. So, it all depends on the like/dislikes of the person using it.</li>
    <li> I am a frugal person but I tossed this product after trying it. I have used many different body butters over the years and I would not consider this to be a body butter. It is a super thick lotion that was never absorbed. I had to literally wash with soap and water to remove the greasiness. I also found the rubber eraser scent off-putting. I enjoy my art supplies, but I really don&#x27;t want to smell like them.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin ,especially during the winter months.  I was reading a magazine one day and saw this body butter recommended by one of the stars on \\&quot;Brothers and Sisters\\&quot;.   I tried it and I love it.  It goes on so smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Your skin feels so soft and dry skin is gone.  I had never found a body lotion that worked for dry skin until this one and it&#x27;s made from all natural ingredients which is a plus! I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> When I was younger, I believed that all body butters from The Body Shop were #1.  I still think they rock (esp. the Nut scent!)  However, The Body Shop is now owned by L&#x27;Oreal, and L&#x27;Oreal tests on animals, so purchasing from TBS now puts money into their pockets, hence the reason I no longer shop there.  I also tried philosphy&#x27;s Marshmallow Fluff body butter and loved it, but their animal testing policies are shady.      SO, I tried this one with high hopes and high expectations, and am I glad I did!  It is smooth and thick and smells AWESOME.  I think most of the YTC line smells like Cabbage Patch Kids, which to me is great, as weird as it sounds!  This stuff absorbs into your skin quickly and leaves it soft and satiny.  The fact that it&#x27;s cruelty-free is the cherry on top.  I don&#x27;t foresee using any other body butter in the future.</li>
    <li> Im a woman and this is Excellent creme, and something in it made me hairless too ! I have baby fine skin thanks to Yes to Carrots. Like the ingrediants were so natural. it didnt skew my hormones and cause hair growth like hormone mimicking laden lotions and soaps out there.  Im serious ! My skin is soft and I dont have to shave. very magical ! Im glad I bought it, Its the best priced Body butter out there, and all natural.</li>
    <li> Within a short time of using this product I got a rash over my entire body. Natch, I didn&#x27;t use it again. But the worst of it is that when I called them the next day I got an email response that told me I should have read the caution on the container (there was none) and that the best they could do was to send me a coupon for a free product (no refund). Hmmm, I don&#x27;t think so. Ever.    Ok, so I&#x27;ve updated this review now two months later. I am frugal &amp; kept the body butter &amp; tried it again (in just a small area of my body) with the same resulting rash. I&#x27;ve since talked someone who&#x27;s had the same problem. Who knows how many people are allergic to it? But the company does not care. Caveat emptor!!</li>
    <li> I used to use Burt&#x27;s Bees body butter (which I still love, and to me it smells like chocolate) but I recently bought this as they were out of Burt&#x27;s Bees at Walmart, and let me tell you I think I will switch over to this permanently. This smells a little odd to me, almost like baby powder but not quite - but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and its not overpowering. The smell dissipates rather fast. I love how it goes on. It is thicker and more buttery than the Burt&#x27;s Bees new formula. It relieves my itchy, dry skin and makes my skin smooth and happy, all while smelling good and a little goes a long way. It rubs into the skin easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy, oily feel to it. I WILL be buying this again! I love it!</li>
    <li> Carrots body butter is the best product I&#x27;ve found for my dry skin. Most lotions and body creams provide relief for a short period of time, then later seem to dry me out even more.  Carrots body butter keeps my skin moist usually all day. If I wash my hands a lot, I may have to reapply once (at the very most twice) a day to my hands. I also use on my legs, and one application after my shower is all I need to sooth my dry flaky skin.</li>
    <li> I first tried this body butter at Target, buying the sample size for traveling purposes, and immediately fell in love with it the first time I tried it!! It&#x27;s smooth, rich, and full of &#x27;good for you&#x27; things, especially for your skin! The only downside personally was the smell, it was light and smelled a bit like carrots + play-dough, but was missing some fresh notes. I decided to add a few drops of grapefruit and lemongrass essential oils and turned out perfect! This body butter is wonderful for dry skin and protection from the elements. It&#x27;s light, fast absorbing, and feels incredibly good on the skin! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have eczema and very dry skin,and I have sensitivity to many products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great, it didn&#x27;t burn at all or cause any sensitivity. It was rich, creamy, and it&#x27;s made a signficant difference in my eczema in just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heels often crack and this cream softened them and got rid of all noticeable cracks in 3 days. I love that it is natural and it virtually has no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just another person who is now devoted to this wonderfully healthy line of products that put those costing exponentially more to shame!  My addiction started with the lovely fluffy body butter that I now put under my eyes at night, carry in a plastic film container in my purse and can not imagine facing the arid winter air or plane cabin with out. The scent is light and delicate and given how well this concoction I really don&#x27;t care how it smells (ok, a little). A little goes a long way and I loved it so much that I stocked immediately thanks to the special promotion till the end of January. The body butter did something very cool too - I cauteously applied it to a very raw scratchy area of my shin which has bothered me for years and chronic dry spots on the knees - all nearly gone. What makes it amazing is that I&#x27;ve had boxes of expensive prescription creams which did less if anythig in prolonged use. That was totally unexpected. So, I said YES to the line and NO to the products this clever butter replaced - cuticle creams, dry skin creams, under eye moisturizers, etc etc. We&#x27;ve had some really cold windy weather and after I tried just a little  on my face I could hardly feel the cold sting. I&#x27;m a huge Nivea, Phylosophy and The Body Shop fan but I&#x27;m not switching back. When some reviews comment that it&#x27;s not really a butter, does it really matter if it feels so good and works great? Fine, let&#x27;s rename it Whipped Butter Souffle Mousse. My picky spouse is also growing to love it on his super dry hands and face. He now has his own jar. It&#x27;s great to have a line of products that meet the needs of every family member from an infant to the elderly - gentle, healthy, cruelty free and multi-functional. Guess what my 17 year old stepdaughter is getting in her goodie bag for Valentine&#x27;s day? :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got those nasty, pimply bumps all over my upper arms and rib cage.  I have tried EVERYTHING to clear it up and nothing ever worked... really everything.  I bought this cream months ago because I&#x27;m trying to stay away from artificial garbage and used it once.  I hated the smell.  I shoved the tub into a drawer and forgot about it.  I rediscovered it during spring cleaning a couple of weeks ago and thought, what the hey?  I&#x27;ll try it again... more than once to see if it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess what?  Yes To Carrots works!  I still don&#x27;t like the smell... it is a bit too strong for me... BUT I will never stop using this cream.  My skin is buttery soft!!  After just a couple of days my upper arms felt smooth!!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  You can still see the red spots (I don&#x27;t think those will go away) but my arms FEEL smooth and that&#x27;s all I care about.  I&#x27;m so very, very happy!  This also works miracles on my elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a star off because I don&#x27;t like the smell, but other than that this is a fabulous cream.  It is worth the price for what it does and for the quality of ingredients.  I think the reason Yes to Carrots helps my Keratosis is because of the Dead Sea Minerals in it.  The only time in my life that the KP on my arms was even remotely clear was during childhood summers spent swimming in the ocean in Florida.  I&#x27;m far away from there now, but love the fact that I can bring sea minerals to my skin in this wonderful, rich cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay for Yes To Carrots!!  :)</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. LASTS FOREVER AND HAS NO OBSCENE FRAGRANCE. BODY CREME MAKES THE SKIN FEEL WONDERFUL. HAIR PRODUCTS WORKS WELL WHEN I REALLY WANT A CURL TO MY HAIR.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WILL BUY FOR AS LONG AS THEY MAKE IT.</li>
    <li> Rubs in well, I live in Minnesota and in the winter my legs, thighs would burn (itch) wearing clothes right after my shower. So I put it on right away after my shower and as long as I use it, my skin doesn&#x27;t get the burning dry feeling. It is thick and easy to apply, not greasy, though it is heavy (I slather it on pretty much). Not a lot of smell to it so it doesn&#x27;t fight with your perfume, which is a good thing. I like the fact that it has natural ingredients and no gluten!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it again.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin that itches like crazy, but I&#x27;m also a cheapskate. So when I ran out of my expensive organic body butter, I decided to give this one a try. Such a bad idea! Not only does it have a nasty clinical smell, but it moisturizes no better than much cheaper alternatives--in other words, not at all. I&#x27;m applying it three times a day and still suffering! It&#x27;s true that the texture is nice and it&#x27;s not greasy (...since it&#x27;s not moisturizing), but I&#x27;ll be throwing it out as soon as I can get more of the expensive stuff I know works. Saving a few dollars is not worth the discomfort.    (For those who are wondering, this is my favorite moisturizer: Chagrin Valley Soap&#x27;s Chocolate Buttercream Body Balm, [...]. I&#x27;ve never once had an itchy moment using that body butter! A little actually does go a long way, and as a bonus it smells deliciously like chocolate. Yum!)</li>
    <li> I have been using YTC Body Butter for a little over a year.  At first I really liked it.  I still like it, but less so.  Why?  In a word, consistency.    At first, the product was thicker and more manageable. I would give the thicker version 5 stars.  Now it is runny, drips off my fingers, the ingredients separate now requiring me to to stir, and the containers leak when I travel; especially when traveling in mountainous terrain.    Suggestion for the Manufacturer: make two versions.  Thick version and the runny kind.  Keep the thick version in the current packaging.  Place the drippy runny version in a lotion dispensing type bottle.  Call one butter and the other lotion.    S...</li>
    <li> I found this product to be very effective in keeping dry skin from flaking in cold weather. It is comparable in effect to more expensive competitors. My only regret (which well may be an attractive feature in the eyes of others) that it does not have a luxurious scent - it has no real fragrance once one slathers it on. I have a love for aromatherapy products, so the lack of fragrance is a drawback for me. Otherwise, it is a first rate product.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.  I use it and it works great for that after-shave burn.  It soaks in well and feels healthy.  The scent is great.  An excellent product for beauty or practical everyday use.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s made of natural products and it smells great but this leaves my skin feeling dry. I still want to apply my Vaseline Intensive Care afterwards.</li>
    <li> I weed through moisturizers like a landscaper mows lawns.  Open them up, use them and spit them out.  This is my 3rd or 4th order of this product.  That&#x27;s says a lot.  I&#x27;m super picky - it needs to sink in, smell nice, be more natural.  These meets all those.  And it helps keep my KP at bay to boot.  Love!  Highly rec.</li>
    <li> I have tried various moisturizers. Yes to carrots was love at first touch. It has great texture and smell.</li>
    <li> I have crazy sensitive skin. I will break out on my arms if I use a product that is too heavy, greasy, or scented. I need a light lotion that will absorb quickly and get the job done. Whether it&#x27;s paraben laden or all natural I find it really hard to get a lotion that I love and not only use all of but purchase again. I buy this again and again and give out the travel sized jars for stocking stuffers every year. This product is so gentle I&#x27;ve even used it on my face a few days when I was away from home and forgot my face lotion. It&#x27;s a tad greasy but it soaks in so I found it did not aggravate my skin and did not leave me feeling like I was slicked down and in need of a shower. It&#x27;s rich and works wonderfully to heal my cracked skin in the summer. The scent is barely there and wears away within minutes.</li>
    <li> I have bought so many body creams, I cannot count them, but this is the first one that actually works to take care of the problem of dry skin, and makes it smooth.     The jar is large, and it doesnt take much to spread it on your body.  The smell is wonderful, but not too strong.   I use this on my feet, heels, toes, in two days my feet are very soft.   My hands feel smooth, as does my body.  When I first put this on, it seemed a bit greasy, but not for long.     I will be buying this, its Awesome..</li>
    <li> I had stopped using creams and oils because they left me feeling greasy, like wearing a grease wet suit!  I tried this cream because my legs had become so dry they were flaky and scaly looking and the skin on my hands was looking thin and brittle.   Not attractive! I was drawn to try this cream because of the list of natural ingredients.  I have been using this cream for about 10 days now, at least once a day, if not twice.  I love the feel of it going on, it is very smooth and a little goes a long way.  It absorbs in within a few moments and my skin feels smooth and supple all day.  Every feel like your skin is &#x27;pulling&#x27;?  This cream will take care of that.  It has a very slight odor in the jar, which disappears when applied.  I have no contrast with this cream and wearing perfume.  I see a very significant difference in skin texture and would recommend this cream to anyone.</li>
    <li> The list of natural ingredients on this product is very impressive. The fact that the sellers donate large portions of profit to sustain agriculture is also impressive. The product itself is pretty impressive. I used it on hands so dry that my knuckles were cracked open and bleeding. After one application (left on overnight) they were no longer bleeding. After 2 nights, the cracks were no longer visible. Applied in the day time to legs so dry I could write my name in them. I was left with incredibly healthy-looking and soft-to-the-touch skin and it stayed that way, even after my shower the next day.  For those who don&#x27;t like heavy fragrance, this would be wonderful. There is hardy any smell to speak of and what little exists is not perfume-y.  My sensitive skin had no negative reaction and even my 3-year-old daughter could use it without a reaction.  Initially, I thought the price was a little high. After I realized how very little is needed for an application, I realized that this is an extremely reasonable price, especially when compared to similar products from companies like Bath and Body Works with a much higher price tag. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I felt like it was a little greasy on my hands. Some other reviewers felt differently. It may be because I applied it so heavily.  And being a female consumer, I think the packaging could use some artistic embellishment. This is pretty unexciting. How about some art using carrots?  Overall, very good.</li>
    <li> My dad and I have used the \\&quot;Yes To Carrots Body Butter\\&quot; for over three weeks.  Initially, we used it only on our knees to ensure that the product didn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction.  According to the ingredients list on the container, the butter contains mostly vegetable extracts that are high in beta carotene, an anti-oxidant known to prevent aging.  The butter should be non-hypoallergenic but we didn&#x27;t want to take a risk.  My dad reported a feeling of skin tightness, but it eventually subsided.  There were never any rashes, pimples, blisters or other skin outbreaks.  Also, the butter has a slight fragrance that is rather pleasing - not an overpowering, obnoxious one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  When I felt that the butter was safe, I used the product from my neck down.  (I tried to use it on my face but it stung.)  Dad continued to rub it faithfully only on his knees before retiring to bed.  In the mornings, I used it as a body lotion after taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The butter feels slightly greasy like Ponds Face Cream.  However, it rubs in quickly, leaving dry skin feeling smooth.  Before his surgery to correct a ruptured disc in his lower back, Dad had to scoot around on his knees in order to move heavy objects.  Consequently, his knees became extremely scaly and rough like an alligator&#x27;s.  After three weeks of using the product, his knees are noticeably smoother.  He wishes to continue using the product until his knees are completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As for me, the product is great as a body lotion.  My skin is extremely smooth.  There is no evidence of roughness, redness, or cracking anywhere on my body.  However, unless your skin is extremely dry throughout your body, I highly recommend using the butter only on troubled areas such as knees and elbows.  Note:  People with eczema and other serious skin conditions should seek professional help before using this or any other skin care product.</li>
    <li> This is probably some of the best moisturizer or body butter I have ever used. I have exceptionally dry skin and have tried most things on the market, so I was skeptical to try this. Needless to say, it turned out to be great! I like to put it on after a shower when my body is still wet. Then I dry off. It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and soft. I also use it on my legs and feet every night before I climb into bed.</li>
    <li> I thought this product felt way too greasy, (so much that I thought my coffee cup would slip out of my hand when I went to take a sip after applying). Once it was absorbed, it left a \\&quot;film\\&quot; on my skin that made me feel gross. In addition, this body butter is unlike other body butters I have used. It is not as thick and seems more like a thick lotion rather than a butter. I would not use this product again.</li>
    <li> I have problems with calluses on my feet and was impressed with the way that \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; moisturized without leaving my skin feeling greasy. When combined with my daily Pedegg regimen, my calluses have nearly disappeared in a week, and I have noticed that the cuticles on my fingers are in better shape too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback for me was the smell - I didn&#x27;t really care for it and it is pretty stong, clashing with my perfume. I&#x27;d prefer an unscented version of the cream but I&#x27;m willing to forgo the smell for the other benefits, namely heels that are no longer cracked.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the fragrance of this product.  I guess I expected it to smell like carrots or something.  It actually has a nice, light, almost baby powderish fragrance.  The butter is pretty solid, the kind that won&#x27;t move in the jar if you lay it on its side.  I like to use it on my elbows but I think it&#x27;s too greasy to put on my hands.  I also use it on my feet, which is fine if you put socks on and don&#x27;t try to walk right away.  Pretty good body butter.</li>
    <li> The product says it is a \\&quot;yummy way to feed your skin\\&quot; and I agree. This product smells wonderful and feels like creamy silk. Just a touch changed my dry, winter weatherd hands to softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been leary of lotions because I don&#x27;t like heavy smells or oily residue. There is nothiing worse than using a hand lotion and then leaving part of that lotion on everything you touch! However, that is not the case with YTC because as the product states, \\&quot;it melts\\&quot; into your skin and there is no residue. Also, the smell is light and pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YTC contains carrot seed, carrot juice and other vegetable products as well as Dead Sea mud, which the product says has high concentrations of minerals that are good for our skin. It is suitable for use all over the body.</li>
    <li> This is a thick cream that moisturizes and re-hydrates my skin wonderfully.  There is a light scent that is quite nice.  It is not overpowering or cloyingly sweet and it most definitely does not smell like carrots.  For me, I found a little bit goes a long way.  It soaks in fast and does not have a greasy feel as long as I used it sparingly. The first time I used it I slathered it on my legs and arms much as I would do if I were applying sun screen on a cloudless day at the beach.  This I found to be a mistake as  it did take it a few minutes for the cream to soak into my skin and even longer for me to get rid of a greasy-feeling film on my skin.  I found that for me I get better results by using much smaller dabs and slicking it over my skin in a much thinner layer.  It still moisturizes and makes my skin feel silky and non-itchy but by using less I do not feel greasy after application.  Another thing that I like about this product is that the container is very easy to open and it is easy to scoop out the amount I want to apply.  For that reason I think the price is actually very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I am hoarding a few jars of the discontinued original Burt&#x27;s Bees body butter which was wonderful (especially for my heels and hands in winter), but was looking for something just as good that I could use with more abandon. I picked this up as a gift for a friend in Japan and of course, had to get one to try myself. Wow! Very impressed! Already the cold weather was causing my dry hands to feel like sandpaper - no fun when you&#x27;re sorting the laundry. This soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling, but my skin is smooth. Even after washing my hands several times they still feel smooth.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has taken a jar into his shop. The scent is very light.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Yes to Carrots is so smooth and creamy. It made my skin feel silky and soft as soon as I applied it. Even my normally sandpaper-textured elbows feel smooth and silky! That&#x27;s a miracle in and of itself. I let my mom try a dab for her hands; she loved it right off and wanted her own jar.     The fragrance is light and not unpleasant. It seems to linger a bit.    Downsides: Right after applying, you might want to give it time to soak in so that you don&#x27;t leave shiny fingerprints everywhere. The greasiness soon goes away. Pricey, yes, but a dab of this moisturizer goes a long way.     Conclusion: Very addictive, great body butter. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> My mother-in-love has pretty dry skin, and she absolutely loved this item. My toddler loves it because the fragance is very pleasing.  And I love it because it gets absorbed relatively fast and doesn&#x27;t leave an icky thick feeling on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product. It feels light weight and provides great moisturizing benefits. It&#x27;s not a heavy duty cream however, i.e. it didn&#x27;t make a dent in my husband&#x27;s dry heels.  But it got rid of the dryness in many areas on the body.</li>
    <li> Yes to Carrots Body Butter states that this product is a &#x27;delicious way to feed your skin&#x27;.  Since I was given two 8.45 ounce tubs for review, I just knew I was in for the skin softening experience of my lifetime.  Yes to Carrots is supposed to revive and rejuvenate my skin without harsh chemicals.      My legs, arms, and elbows suffer horribly in the winter time and so that is the area where I started first.  Right off the bat I noticed the smell of Yes to Carrots.  Or rather, the lack of smell.  Not a fan of rich scents, light ones are what I prefer and Yes to Carrots had none. No smell at all.  I shrugged my shoulders and went to work on the dry parts of my body.    Big mistake. I used too much and was a big greasy mess.  Yes to Carrots does not need to be used plentifully.  A smaller amount than normal lotion goes a long way with this product, and could actually be a money saving tip.  Going on the body butter was smooth but I could not get it to rub all the way in. I finally had to get a damp towel and clean my hands, etc. so as not to be so greasy and wet.  Then again, you had the lack of smell. I don&#x27;t mind being a greasy mess when I smell like vanilla.  Carrot body butter with no scent? Not so much.    However, the thing that I noticed the most was that in a matter of hours, my skin was softer, looked more refreshed, and actually felt tighter.  Not sure if this is what the product is designed for, but that was my experience.  I also used this product on my feet at night. I wore a pair of &#x27;lotion&#x27; socks and globbed up my feet with Yes to Carrots.  The next morning my heels were even soft.  If you don&#x27;t use this product for anything else, the overnight lotion feet treatment is a winner in my book.    If you can get past the fact that this body butter takes forever to rub in, then Yes to Carrots just might be the product for you. Men would probably benefit the most from this body butter because of its lack of scent.  Real men, according to my husband, do not want to smell like vanilla sugar and so therefore would eat up this unscented tub.      I will definately use every bit of this product and will more than likely buy more.    ***Natalie S. for Amazon Vine***</li>
    <li> I see that many reviewers don&#x27;t like the smell of this stuff.  I like it a LOT.  It smells sweet and pleasant.  Great body moisturizer.  Not a good hand moisturizer at all.  With all its creaminess, my hands feel chapped and not soft after using it.  I&#x27;ve experienced that oddity with other things, like Trader Joe Citrus Body Lotion with Vitamin C.  Can&#x27;t quite understand it.  But here&#x27;s something that fixes it for me:  Ahava Mineral Hand Cream.  No chapped!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order \\&quot;Yes to Carrots Body Butter\\&quot; again.  I like it a lot and it&#x27;s a great gift.  But to keep my hands soft, I&#x27;ll supplement with Ahava, also a great gift.</li>
    <li> Yes to Carrots body butter is great but 45 buck for two tubs is crazy talk.  Go to Target and get it for less than 10 dollars a tub.</li>
    <li> I love this body butter! It is light but moisturizing after my shower without leaving the greasy residue that so many of the body butters do. And the other reason I choose this brand is for the lack of certain harmful ingredients I see in many of the other body butters/lotion.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found that actually moisturizes my extremely dry skin. Put it on before going to bed at night and feel how smooth your skin is in the morning.  I&#x27;ll never use any other product since I found this one!</li>
    <li> I have used many different types of body creams. this is the best because the butter is not greasy and does not stain clothing. It will last longer than most body butter creams, and it has a nice fragrance to it. It seems to work for my skin type the best. It might just be my body chemistry? My choice for personal use.</li>
    <li> i thought that this cream is the best body butter cream out their. I no its kid of thick but it will keep your skin moist and soft. it has a soft fragrance not overwhelming. I wish they made a tube so I can carry it in my ourse</li>
    <li> Those I&#x27;d tried were always greasy! Yuck! But I don&#x27;t experience this as anything but moist, subtly fragrant and NON-greasy!  Wonderful stuff! Like it so much that I&#x27;m even hesitant to try its&#x27; \\&quot;mates\\&quot; - tomato and cuc.  I&#x27;ll have to read their reviews.</li>
    <li> This is the best body butter I have ever put on my body. It literally melted into my skin and left me soft all over. The price is great also. The scent is lovely but not over powering. Ladies and even gents GET some. It&#x27;s especially great during the winter season when skin tends to get really dry.</li>
    <li> I normally use Body Shop body butter.  I live in a dry climate that requires a lot of body butter to keep my skin from flaking off and I&#x27;ve found that The Body Shop body butter is the only one that smells wonderful and keeps my skin moist all day long.  That is, until now.  This body butter is fantastic.  Wonderful smell.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and stays with you.  Who would have thought carrots could be so useful?  It rivals my favorite Body Shop body butter.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to be able to try this product.  I tend to have very dry body skin and am always on the lookout for a product that will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While labeled as a body butter, I ended up using it on my hands more than anywhere for the last week or so and am very, very pleased.  My hands are very dry to begin with and the Indiana winters are very hard on them, even with wearing gloves religiously.  I put the butter on them in the morning and again right before bed.  It made a significant different in how my skin feels.  Another big test is that I cooked Thanksgiving dinner which requires lots of hand washing.  Even with that, my skin is much softer than it was this time last year.  I actually get cracks in the skin around the top of the fingernail and there is no sign of that this year -- yea !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is subtle but pleasant.  This is also a plus for me since I don&#x27;t really like having lotions, etc. with a lot of scent --  I like to wear perfume and don&#x27;t like the clashing aromas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can find is that the butter is a bit greasy when you first put it on, but it absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t really a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people with really dry skin, this product is definitely worth a try.  I will also be ordering the lotion version of this product in the future to carry in my purse.</li>
    <li> A creamy moisturizing cream, that goes on nicely and evenly into the skin. Feels good on and does not leave a residue on skin.  Could be a little bit stronger in the area of protection.  You may have to apply more than once or twice during the day.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff, and that&#x27;s coming from a macho kind of guy who doesn&#x27;t sit around thinking about creams all that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on my itchy calves and rough knees for about three weeks now. So far, I haven&#x27;t gotten the winter itches on my calves, which I&#x27;ve been experiencing beginning every November for the last 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My knees have always been so rough that I could sand furniture with them. But in the last three weeks they have become as soft as a baby&#x27;s sit-down area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gal loves the cream, too. She uses it all over her birthday suit, which has warranted a big thumbs up from this here guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent stuff. Get it.</li>
    <li> Yes to Carrots Body Butter, with its plethora of natural ingredients, is a good find. In the past I have tended to avoid creams for their greasiness factor. While Yes to Carrots is a bit oily on first application, it absorbs fairly quickly. I still prefer to apply this at night. For wintertime dry skin, it really can&#x27;t be beat. The cream concept is much better than lotions I&#x27;ve tried, which tend to evaporate from my skin after initially feeling good. With this product, I noticed the flakiness significantly reduced, even the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using this regularly my hands, which tend to chap in the winter and turn red, have been better than usual with only mild redness and no itchiness. Hooray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still working on my first jar after three weeks, and imagine it will last quite a bit longer. I plan to continue with this product after it&#x27;s gone. A winner!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had a bunch of the \\&quot;Yes To Carrots\\&quot; product line, and they are consistenly good products.  The Body Butter is a quality moisturizing cream that does the job of hydrating your skin without an overwhelming scent or unappealing \\&quot;skin-feel\\&quot; (e.g., greasy or pasty).      I can&#x27;t vouch for any extra effectiveness these ingredients have over what&#x27;s found in normal Body Butters, but it works and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m slathering on chemicals, dyes and perfumes.  A huge plus for me.</li>
    <li> This body butter is a good, average-quality mositurizer that will do its job well enough. However, in the course of my experimenting with options, I&#x27;ve found this Yes To Carrots product to not be the best available, especially for the high price. I&#x27;ve used lots of other Yes To Carrots products and am generally pleased with them. This will produce healthy-feeling skin without too much of a scent, which is good - but I do have extremely dry and itchy skin in the wintertime, and this did not take care of all my itch. I also have a hard time getting it to rub into my skin all the way.    If you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer that&#x27;s still nutritional with plenty of vitamins, try  [[ASIN:B0014LTJV0 Bath &amp; Body Works Aquatanica Sea Moisture Gel Souffle with Exclusive Marine Nutrient Complex]]. Personally, the product after that link is the most incredible and unique moisterizer I&#x27;ve ever encountered; I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. Another product that I think is of higher quality than Yes To Carrots&#x27;s, and more worth the price, is pretty much any of Victoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27;s ultra softening body butters. However, with that brand you will be lacking in the organics.     I hope this helped you in the search for something to nourish your skin in the healthiest way. Best of luck in the search.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid Yes To fan, and when I saw they had a super rich body butter, I was all over it.  However, this is NOT a body butter--this is a lotion.  Body butters are usually thick and creamy, this has a watery, greasy consistency more in line with a lower end lotion.  It does absorb quickly, and it has a subtle, unobtrusive odor--it smells, to me, the same as their face masks but it leaves my skin oily, and it doesn&#x27;t fully absorb so I&#x27;m left with a residue on my skin.  This may be nourishing and rich, but it&#x27;s not the body butter I thought I was going to receive.</li>
    <li> I was looking for natural made creams and I came across this one. It&#x27;s not wonderful but It feels nice.</li>
    <li> I get dishydrotic eczema on my hands, and it&#x27;s been really bad this winter.  I tried eliminating soaps, shampoos, cleaners and have religiously been using my prescription cream, even sleeping with it slathered on my cotton-gloved hands.  Nothing seemed to be helping this time.  Then I bought this.  Within 2 days, I noticed significant improvement.  I mean SIGNIFICANT.  I don&#x27;t know if it healed the eczema, or just didn&#x27;t irritate my skin allowing it to heal, or both, but the results have been amazing.  I will never be without this.  I can&#x27;t tell you how HUGE this is; besides not helping much, the prescription &amp;#34;creams&amp;#34; are more ointment than cream, and never completely rub in.  I am so excited to have soft, non-irritated, healthy, non-cracked, non-oily hands again!</li>
    <li> This very average product worked more like an exfoliating cream than a moisturising one.  Will not be purchasing anything from this range again as it very disappointing.</li>
    <li> After using this product for only a short period I&#x27;ve already witnessed an improvement. Perhaps I need to mention that on a scale of 1-5 in terms of crustiness (due to dry skin) a crocodile rates 3 but I a 5. Hence if I say there&#x27;s marked improvement in the texture of the rough areas (heels and elbows) then this product is worth buying. The only thing is I would prefer something scentless.</li>
    <li> In the New York winters it&#x27;s easy to get dry and scaly. This cream would definitely be too rich for summer, but for winter it smoothes on beautifully.  I would recommend it especially for heels and cuticles.  It&#x27;s a thick white cream (not at all a lotion,  butter is a good description) It&#x27;s very rich, and does tend to sit on your skin for longer than other moisturizers, (so I wouldn&#x27;t use it on days I expected to be very active,  or before the gym)  but for before bed,  or for very dry areas its very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re scent - it has a soft scent,  but nothing special.  I would like it more if it had had a nicer perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add - it&#x27;s now 2010 and I&#x27;ve  used this for 2 winters.  It&#x27;s def too thick for a summer lotion but in winter when your heels feel like they are turning into hooves,  this cream really does help soften them back to human appearance.  My cuticles often split and bleed in the dry winters here,  but not if I use this cream.  I  used often and it really helps.</li>
    <li> This body butter is an excellent product!  My daughter who suffers with painfully dry elbows and feet, has found this to be the best skin conditioner she&#x27;s ever used.      Though my skin isn&#x27;t that dry, I like using the body butter on my arms &amp; hands first thing in the morning and it certainly is rich enough that it keeps my skin soft &amp; supple all day long...something this gal in her 70&#x27;s appreciates!    Initially the BB leaves a slightly greasy feel, but just be patient &amp; give it about 3 minutes &amp; that \\&quot;extra richness\\&quot; soaks right into the skin with no slickness, only softness left behind.      The fragrance is light &amp; I think could be used by either ladies or men.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this body butter. It works great! I use it after my showers (at night) so it fully moisturizes during the might. It smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> I already use this brands face lotion and misc other make up products so I thought this body butter would be great too. In all honesty, it&#x27;s not very &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;nourishing&amp;#34; feeling. It&#x27;s kinda thin and not very moisturizing. I&#x27;ve stopped using it for awhile because my skin was starting to feel dry.</li>
    <li> Great body butter, but hard to find.  Now it&#x27;s overpriced when you do find it.</li>
    <li> In 2007, I bought this after my friend was using it on my newborn Godson. It was amazing. So smooth, nourishing and it smelled amazing. I was consistently stopped on the street and asked what I was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the new formula smells like a little like burnt plastic. The effect is the same, but I cannot take the smell. It has a hint of the old smell, but it&#x27;s so repugnant in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2013, I asked if they had the old formula available anywhere. Yes to Carrots replied that they do not have it available and would &amp;#34;pass along my feedback&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They told me about Grapefruit, but it&#x27;s no where as good as the old formula of Carrots.</li>
    <li> I had a sample of this and thought it was very nourishing so I ordered it. I have received it and it is just like the sample and the jar is full. Very nice fragrance and texture.</li>
    <li> This product has urea in it which gets a #4 rating in EWG&#x27;s list of toxic ingredients.  Urea releases formaldehyde.  Many companies promote their products with all of their &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; ingredients and then add in toxic preservatives that are banned in Europe.  Makes no sense.</li>
