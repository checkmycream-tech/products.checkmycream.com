<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For the price, I am totally satisfied. I am mixing this with other hair &amp; body care to give them the magical difference that last all day.</li>
    <li> This product is a good form of argan oil. You get a lot for the price and it was just as good as some of the more expensive argan oils I have bought in the past.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BRAND OF ARGAN OIL!!!  I BELIEVE IT&#x27;S AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THAN THE JOSIE MARAN BRAND....IT&#x27;S AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT AT AN EXCELLENT PRICE.  I ACTUALLY LOVE THE SMELL OF IT (KINDA LIKE A MIX OF LICCORICE &amp; CHOCOLATE...VERY EARTHY) BUT THE SCENT OF IT QUICKLY GOES AWAY AS IT SO EASILY ABSORBS INTO THE SKIN.  MAKES MY FACE FEEL VELVETY AND LOOKS AIRBRUSHED...LOVE THIS OIL!!!</li>
    <li> Extremely allergy reaction on the face and had to go to the hospital because one of my chick got swelling. The Doctor proscribed an anti inflammatory pills.  Please be care who ever has sensitive skin when using this product.</li>
    <li> This pure and all natural!  Feels wonderful on the skin.  I have not broken out with this at all!  Use it on hair as well.  Really moistures</li>
    <li> Great Oil. Ive been using it for my hair and its wonderful. Just use when your hair is wet so your can distributed it. Also, LITTLE GOES ALONG WAY. :)Better than Emu oil annnddddd, great price for the amount. Argan Oil is just soo expensive</li>
    <li> I have only used this for 2-3 weeks but this stuff has been awesome on my and my daughters long hair. Her hair is down to her butt and it has given her hair back it&#x27;s amazing life and shine. I use this on my face since I live in Michigan and I tan in the tanning bed sometimes, so my skin sometimes looks a tad rough, but after using this it has smoothed out my appearance. I am not sure what cooking grade means below, but it has worked for me so far and I am a oily person so I was worried it would be so oily on my face, nope it has actually made my face produce less oils for some weird reason so it&#x27;s a smooth feeling all day. Sorta like when I was a teen my face felt smooth all the time.</li>
    <li> I received this oil after trying a much more expensive brand and found that it was a better value,much more product and the quality is the same . I am very satisfied with this oil.  I also like the pump  that makes it easy to use. I would highly recommend this oil over smaller bottles and more expensive!</li>
    <li> I use Argan Oil on regular bases to take care of my feet.  It made my skin much smoother. I am fully satisfied by the results.</li>
    <li> I use this in my shampoos and in my leave in conditioners.  Great value for the price.  Helps keep my hair under control and healthy.</li>
    <li> Love it! Use on my face, neck, chest &amp; hair.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this oil for the last 6 months, very satisfied with the quality and the price. Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice product, outstanding quality and customer service! Goes on so smooth and easily blended with other oils and butters. Skin absorption with this product is great.</li>
    <li> Use a very small amount!! The first time I used this on my wet hair, I used too much and my hair was very weighted down and greasy. After that, I used only a few drops and it worked great. My hair is soft and I have thick, very course, dry hair. I am very pleased with this product and I will repurchase it.</li>
    <li> Ive recently gone organic with all my beauty products. I ordered this product about 3 months ago, and I am back to order my second bottle. I absolutely love this stuff. I use it on my hair, my face, and my pregnant belly :)  For the people who have complaints, Id remind you that this is not a magic elixir... I use it along with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s 18-1 Hemp Castile soap, and I have had absolutely amazing results! My skin is clear and completely even, my hair is thick and shiny and I have VERY little breakage. And (the biggest plus), I have no stretch marks whatsoever. This is the only Argan oil Ive ever used, so I dont have anything to compare it to, but it works very well for me, and Id recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> the argan oil is very nice. like the feel of it on skin. helps the itching on my sclap for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have used Argan oil in the past and never had such a bad smell.  Usually I notice a light, not unpleasant, nutty scent.  Ths one is unusable, it REEKS.  Literally smells like poop.  I do NOT recommend this, it was a total waste of money</li>
    <li> I used to buy the Josie Maran Argan Oil and it&#x27;s so expensive for just an ounce.  Here you get so much more for less money.  I compared both when I first got them and found no difference; they are the same.  Love it!</li>
    <li> this is the worst product i have ever purchased from amazon in the 6yrs i have shopped with them.  this product smells like feces in a bottle.  very disgusting.  do not waste your money</li>
    <li> This is pretty good, but there are several on Amazon that are better I believe (ex: ELMA&amp;SANA®Golden Argan Oil and Watts).  There is no doubt in my mind that Essential Argan is 100% Argan oil.  I believe this to be 100% cold pressed argan oil and very nicely priced.  Some of the more expensive and known brands I don&#x27;t believe to be 100% as I think that they add other ingredients in to counteract the natural smell of argan oil and possibly other things as well. Just my 2 cents.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research about Argan Oil and read a lot of reviews about different companies.  I went with this one because it is pure virgin cold pressed which makes a difference.  With any oil whether it be flax oil or coconut oil its better to use it in the purest form.  I am very happy with this product quality and the amount you get for the price.  I will continue to use this product and order from seller regularly.  I wish I could set up auto ship like other products I order.</li>
    <li> The seller was very, very accommodating.  Sometimes people have somewhat of an adverse reaction, and mine was itching.  They refunded my money immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good way to conduct business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people would benefit greatly from this.  It&#x27;s a quality product, organic, all the things you&#x27;d want.</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing this type of oil after having done some research on it prior. This works great on my scalp &amp; hair, as it is light &amp; has a very mild fragrance. Does not leave any buildup &amp; adds sheen. Arrived in new/excellent condition &amp; I will definitely purchase again when I need to.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it mainly for my hair, but it works nicely on skin also.  This is the 2nd time I have ordered this product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m finding that with argan oil, you get what you pay for.  This is no cosmetic grade oil.  You could probably cook with it, but I will not be using this on my face...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various botanical oils for use on my psoriasis and on my box turtles.&lt;br /&gt;Argan has all the benefits of sunflower, linseed and flaxseed oil but with higher concentrate of fatty acids.&lt;br /&gt;The viscosity was the lowest too, no thick greasy residue.  Very fast absorbancy.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first Argan oil product I&#x27;ve used, so I cannot compare it in terms of quality.  However, I can compare it to the other oils and it is the best.</li>
    <li> I was sold on the benefits of using Argan Oil by watching Josie Maren on QVC but I couldn&#x27;t imagine paying over $100 for 6-oz. plus their costly s/h.  So, I came over to Amazon to compared the features, the prices and found free shipping on this product.  I admit I was a little worried about reviewer&#x27;s claims of an unpleasant odor.  Then the order arrived, very timely in a cute little organza bag.  I tore into the bottle and noticed a little odor, not like a \\&quot;dirty diaper\\&quot; just organic smelling.  And then I used it after my shower and fell in love. I wonder if they have this on auto-ship?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 70 yrs old. I&#x27;ve read a lot about Argan oil. It&#x27;s wonderful for your face &amp; skin. makes your hair feel like silk</li>
    <li> This product is great, I use it on my face as a daily moisturizer before I put makeup on.  I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;this to all the ladies out there who are looking for a good facial oil without having to pay for an expensive&lt;br /&gt;designer one.</li>
    <li> The packaging is awesome. The product is of great quality and smells wonderful as well. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It came well packaged and within the specified number of days. It came with instructions and description of the product. It is as described. Good product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Putting a little on every night before bed has worked wonders on my dry curly hair! The light nutty smell also works as a mask for the smoke odors that get trapped in my hair from a smokey establishment. As a nonsmoker, these odors stay in m hair causing me to have wash my hair even when I have just done so!</li>
    <li> Good product. fast service.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of argon oil.  The fact that is very high quality and also offered at a reasonable price means I will be buying regularly.  I use the oil on my face and body and in my hair.  I prefer it over the virgin coconut oil I used to use because it contains no cholesterol so it is not greasy.  It absorbs into the skin quickly without the residue.  I highly recommend this brand and thank the sellers for the fair price.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered this product from them. Love the product and the fast response to my inquiry. They have changed the packaging for the better.</li>
    <li> I saw this similar item (100% organic argan oil from Josie Maran brand)at Sephora store in the mall and wonder if I could find one that is cheaper somewhere else since the one from Josie Maran cost $96.00 for the same 4oz. jar compare to this one for much affording price.  I tried the oil right away once I received it in the mail but notice that the feel of the oil is different from Josie brand.  The one from Josie seem to instantly made my hand feels soft, supple and absorb quickly when I tried it at the mall and this one seem to just sit there on the surface of my hand and didn&#x27;t have the ability to soften my skin.  I wonder why they are so much different when both are cold press 100% organic oil in the description or may it could be just me over thinking it ???  Anyhow since it doesn&#x27;t work great by itself like the other brand. I&#x27;m planning to mix it up with my other hand lotion to enhances it and call it good since I don&#x27;t want to go through all the trouble of sending it back.  If you have tried Josie brand and have similar experienced like i did, I would like to read your review (just to proof I&#x27;m not crazy).  I gave it 4 stars for the price and for a fast shipping but for quality wise, I&#x27;m still in doubt?</li>
    <li> The oil works great on hair, cuticles, and as a body oil. Despite what is said, I do not suggest using on the face unless diluted somewhat with lotion meant for the face or extremely light use. If your skin is already oily, it will make it worse and cause break outs as I learned the hard way. Do not use the pump in this regard because too much oil will come out. It is best to use the finger or a cotton ball when applying to the face in \\&quot;moderation.\\&quot; Best place to use this oil is the hair, the feet, and hands where the results are quickly noticed. So far this is the best beauty purchase I have made to date.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 or 4 different brands of Argan oil, including this one. I don&#x27;t like it at all, because the fragrance was so disgustingly awful. None of the argon oils I&#x27;ve used, ever had a bad odor. Maybe it was old? Anyway, I couldn&#x27;t stand it and I threw it in the trash. I suppose I should notify the seller, because it might not be like this, as a rule.</li>
    <li> I heard about so many benefits about Argan Oil. I have so many good uses of it. Applied it on my hair, mixed into my skin remedy... love it.</li>
    <li> I read the negative reviews and tried this anyway -- glad I did. This Argan oil absorbs well and I don&#x27;t smell any foul odor at all; it softens my skin well. I use it on face, arms &amp; hands and all over.  I would highly recommend this .</li>
    <li> This is one of the best oils i have ever used softens skins add a drop when washing hair the shine is unbelievable</li>
    <li> This is my second order for this product.  It does not smell as other reviews have indicated....there is a faint natural nut smell perhaps but that is all I can detect.  It is very hydrating...and the price is a wonderful deal.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Wish I would have read the reviews by others. This product does have not a slight nutty smell but a rotten smell. I have tried to use it occasionally but I think I&#x27;m just going to have to throw it away because it is intolerable.</li>
    <li> We used up our Argan oil and bought this one online.  Came quickly, but when we opened it up to use it had a strange smell.  Not horrible, but weird, not like our other one which had no smell at all.</li>
    <li> Nice product, very light smell, light amber color. Product is quickly absorbed by my hair and leave them frizz free and shiny! I came to learn about argan oil when my hairdresser suggested I used Moroccan Oil, which is actually a mixed of argan oil and many chemicals. It did a good job on my hair, but I wanted to get the real thing, and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. In comparaison to Moroccan Oil, the Pure Argan Oil is lighter, more liquid and smells more natural. I&#x27;m thrilled cause I can also use the argan oil on my skin now :)</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I would like to say that this is a great product... if you don&#x27;t mind smelling like rancid baby poop. I mean this in the absolute most literal description of the words, &#x27;rancid baby poop&#x27;.  However, it doesn&#x27;t last long, and honestly you get used to smelling it (seriously, scent blindness kicks in, and everything is golden). That&#x27;s not to say that those around you will get used to it as quickly, but who cares? Let them suffer! It takes about 30 minutes to absorb and stop smelling, it takes about 15-20 to stop smelling the turds on yourself. I would mix it with coconut oil just to help with the scent. Anyway, the oil works very well in the winter when your skin is dry and/or cracking. I would put it on my face before bed and snuggle close to my husband, he just loved that. :D As it&#x27;s an oil, it&#x27;s very oily/greasy, so be prepared to not touch anything. Oh, the squirt top sucks. I took the top off and poured the stuff into my own bottle and used that instead because the one it comes in squirts everywhere but where you intend.</li>
    <li> It would be so hard to get along without this product. I use i daily. Wonderful for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few weeks for my haare and skin and i like it. It&#x27;s very sooft and really good for the skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!!!!  I have a very bad wound on my ankle.....I am using this oil and added essential oils to it....lemon, oregano, lavender, and tea tree.  It has healed my ankle more than any other conventional medication I&#x27;ve tried.  Just fabulous.  I also use it on my hair, nails, and skin in general.  I just bought 4 more.</li>
    <li> At a fraction of the cost. This makes ones hair looks amazing a little goes a long way. Experiment with it till you get the mixture right. Then watch out. Your hair will make a statement with impeccable sheen &amp; softness.</li>
    <li> Perfect!! This was exactly as described. The shipping was Super fast and was packaged well. It is a very good value.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it makes my skin feel and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this product for straightening because the smell is so awful, and because it makes my hair greasy instead of silky. I use it for deep conditioning sometimes before I wash my hair, or as an under-eye syrum. It really does smell awful. I would recommend awapuhi oil over this.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way to smooth, soft, healthy looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;A dab every morning and night to my clean face keeps it&lt;br /&gt;younger looking and feeling.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and found this product extremely helpful in restring moisture to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and I love the pump feature. It makes it much easier to dispense.  I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Love the product and it&#x27;s very nice Oil and make my skin looks younger, beautiful and shinnying more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend all my friends to own it.</li>
    <li> This oil really goes into the skin fast. Great for our dry air &amp; hot day. I recommend it for every skin type!</li>
    <li> I hate giving bad reviews, but I have to warn you. This product smells like an old diaper. I cant stand to have it in my hair.</li>
    <li> Read lots of reviews on this oil, decided to try it.  After recieving the oil, i had to use it immediately.  To my surprise, it has an overpowering  \\&quot;scent\\&quot;, which eventually fades away.  Did see the results in the morning, as my slightly irritated skin looked much calmer and helthier.  I try to use it every day, but find myself finding excuses every time I reach for the bottle to not use it.  It is a wonderful product though if you are ok with the smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Essential Argan Oil with pump.  I also ordered it from another producer, which had much less in the container.  I see no difference in how it has worked with my skin.  I would definitely recommend this product and the value it has given me for the money.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used 100% argon oil, but I have been very pleased with the product. My hair appears to be stronger and shinier than it was. I will try other suppliers to compare their products, but I will continue to use the argon oil on my hair.</li>
    <li> You just need a few drops  apply to dry areas and massage in  next day you will notice a huge difference... Love this.. so Happy I tried it  well worth the money...</li>
    <li> ARGAN OIL HAS BEEN THE ONE PRODUCT, THAT HAS HELP MY BURNS AFTER RADIATION TREATMENTS. VERY SUPPLE ON THE BURNS. ALSO GOOD FOR YOUR FACE AND NECK. I HAVE TRIED MANY PRODUCTS, AND ARGAN OIL WORKS THE BEST.ALSO WORK SOME INTO HAIR AT NIGHT AND HELPS MY CURLY HAIR FRIZZIES.</li>
    <li> This is a natural product, smooth oil and works well on my skin.  This is not scented, as some are so you may find a slight scent to the oil you are not used to, I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product to soothe irritated skin (before and after waxing). It does the trick just fine. Probably won&#x27;t purchase it again, as it was expensive and I could probably find something a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> nice for face or hair</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different brands of \\&quot;organic\\&quot; Argan Oil and this one is the best.  It&#x27;s denser and smoother and really seems to moisturize my skin. It is actually very soothing and it does not sting. I have ridiculously sensitive skin and I will get a nasty rash if someone walked by with a perfume I was allergic to!  I have just recently found out much of my skin problems were due to allergies to chemicals that are often found in \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot;  and \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; products.  It&#x27;s a great price and a quality product.  I will definitely re-order this item. It is not an overnight solution, but it is definitely helping my skin heal from a lifetime of skin issues.</li>
    <li> Argan oil makes my skin feel so soft.  It goes on lightly and absorbs Ina reasonable amount of time. It can also be used on hair, but use it sparingly on your head. Excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews, they are true, this stuff smells bad. Bought another brand of Argan oil before, loved it, ran out, this one was cheaper. I should have listened. I had thought I might give this as a gift, not the way this smells and/or looks. It is very cheaply packaged in a plastic bottle with paper label, the bag contains a separate pump. Annoying that Amazon makes you get \\&quot;authorization\\&quot; from the seller to return, which \\&quot;authorization\\&quot; Amazon says can take up to 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Just got an email from Amazon saying I will have to pay the costs to return this stinky stuff.</li>
    <li> I will probably reorder it again when i am finished.  My skin has responded well to it.  I believe it is a good product.  I do not believe this is for facial it is more like food grade.  cosmetic argan will not have as much of a smell.  However the smell is the same.  I had another brand, the smell was the same but lighter.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and I have tried others, they are just as good and this is less pricier. I  saw the reviews that said it smelled like poop or olive oil, I just don&#x27;t agree. It has the same smell as the others. Light and kind of nutty. I don&#x27;t know what they got, maybe it was very old. It absorbs well, I use it for my face, neck, hands and lashes. I have notice a big difference on my face it&#x27;s softer and the lines are softer. I am 58 and my skin was in good condition before using this, a year or so ago. I think it has helped to keep it that way. I have bought lash accelerator and it didn&#x27;t work, they fell out, they are growing with this. I have this in my cart again, waiting for me to order a new bottle here in a few months. But I think I could put it in the fridge and it would keep. I do that with olive oil, when I get it for a great price. Would definably referrer a friend! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil! I use it as a night time moisturizer every day and it works great. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. My skin looks and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> the real deal ,a great product ,fot many uses.dilivery on time and nicely package .would recomend and order again.&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
    <li> Product is not nearly as thick or penetrating as other brands of argon oil I&#x27;ve used. I will not reorder this brand. It is a diluted product.</li>
    <li> After starting to use oil , I got so much hooked-up on the staff!  I think it&#x27;s working a miracle on my skin.  I love it so much, that I started to use oil on my body too.  And this particular oil, I think, should be advertised as a women&#x27;s best friend everywhere.  Great and amazing staff.</li>
    <li> I am so thrilled with this product! Many reasons to highly recommend: skin looks &amp; feels like silk, not greasy &amp; absorbs quickly, makeup glides on perfectly, lasts for hours, excellent for nails, great for hair but use sparingly to avoid greasy look. One product replaces many creams, lotions, serums, etc. for face, body, hair, and nails. Bottle lasts for months because you need only a few drops. Lots of imitators, but this is the one to buy because it&#x27;s cold pressed &amp; certified organic. Very pure &amp; does not clog pores. I use it on my entire body. Tried the 4 oz bottle first to be sure it was the real thing &amp; just ordered the 16 oz bottle because it&#x27;s so amazing. Get lots of compliments on my skin these days, which feels fantastic to a 60 year old woman! Thank you Argana Shop.</li>
    <li> This product is the real deal, the smell was organic and not overwhelming, I noticed some reviews on the smell they must have extra sensors. To me it was not offensive nor did it last long. The pure oil is lovely for moisturizing my skin. I wish it came in larger sizes.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am so surprised by some of the negative comments. Mine has no scent whats so ever. My first bottle of the oil was a much more expensive brand and I loved it. I was worried this less expensive brand would not work as well, but it has been wonderful. I feel like i look ten years younger in just the 4 months I have used the product. I&#x27;ll even go out of the house with out make up on! My teenage son used it on his acne and it cleared it up within 2 days. We adopted a rescue puppy who was pretty managy and after her first bath it became apparent that it wasn&#x27;t just dirt. We then used the oil on her fur and now she looks like she has just a gorgeous coat and her skin is no longer dry and itchy. All my kids apply to lips in the morning and no one has needed chapstick in months (and we live in the desert. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It gives my skin a&lt;br /&gt;rosy glow and absorbs quickly. The only drawback is a strange smell&lt;br /&gt;when first out of the bottle. Thankfully it fades quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s first time I tried Argan oil, absolutely love it, works better than expensive creams, and can use it all over body, including hair</li>
    <li> I´ ve  read that argan oil  that  is  properly collected, doesn´t have&lt;br /&gt;unpleasant odor. It smells like urine or goat meat,  I don&#x27;t know, I do not like the smell at all. It make me sick.</li>
    <li> Good oil its the only thing I use on my face and for moisturizing my hair. Its very thin and absorbent.</li>
    <li> I was worried from other reviews that this would smell bad. It is neither good or bad. I have Argan hair product that smell wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my hair as suggested by my stylist. Immediately tried it on my skin. It soaks in well and has no lasting odor. It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t wash off like others. It only takes a small amount to cover.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my hair as directed as an oil treatment. My hair felt soft and silky after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;Glad this doesn&#x27;t take much as it is a little pricy. But it does go a long way.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and its a tad too concentrated, this specific brand suggests to put on hair prior to showering, too much oils...</li>
    <li> This version of argan oil seemed as good as any higher priced oil that I have tried. I also like the pump, instead of a dropper. I would definitely buy this product again. It is a good value.</li>
    <li> This stuff has to be fake and it smells like green olives. I am so mad that I bought it. I&#x27;m returning it. Don&#x27;t waste your minry</li>
    <li> The 100% pure, cold-pressed features of Essential Argan Oil make this an extremely soft, wonderful high-quaility feeling product.  It reminds me of putting some kind of actual vitamins/nutrients on your skin it is so nice.  I use this w/2 sprays of TwinLab&#x27;s NaPCA spray on my facial skin right after using a 1.5 mm micro needle roller, and after doing Clarisonic facial cleanses using castille soap, a real good makeup and build-up remover.  You have to apply the argan oil right after cleansing, with the face still wettened, and it soaks in really well protecting your skin from abnormal stretching due to drying unprotected.  I also add it as a key ingredient for facial skin in my home-made moisturizer with NOW 100% pure moisturing avocado oil for collagen/elasticity, dermae&#x27;s Vitamin A with E Wrinkle Treatment oil, Now Liquid Lanolin, Giovanni D:tox System replenishing facial moisturizer, a little jojoba oil, &amp; some spring or distilled water.  All mixed together in reasonable amounts so as to get benefits from each.  This Essential Argan Oil is a really, really nice wonderful product I feel lucky we get to have.</li>
    <li> This is a good useful product to use everyday, so it seems. I do not know of any harmful effects, so if there is something you know, please post it for the rest of us. After doing a clay-mask in the morning, i apply argan oil and find it to be very soothing.</li>
    <li> This oil is quite good and it is also organic.  I have a dry skin and I found that it is absorbed nicely especially coupled with a good moisturizer.  Give it a try if your skin is dry.  The price is reasonable and you do not need to use a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;I find it to be a very good product.</li>
