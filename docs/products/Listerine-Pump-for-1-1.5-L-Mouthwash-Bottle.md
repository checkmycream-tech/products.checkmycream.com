<li> that one is loose - the pumps each accomplish their duty so this buyer is &amp;#34;SATISFIED&amp;#34;</li>
<li> Have not tried it on other brands.  </li>
<li> They are both Listerine, both 1L, one fits snugly, the other just will not fit as snug as the other.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s somewhat expensive for what it really is.</li>
<li> It sticks a little, but then pumps fine.&lt;br</li>
<li> It dispenses the correct amount without any waste.</li>
<li> Why would you make such a poor product.</li>
<li> Not a good quality.  </li>
<li> This pump is nearly impossible to get on.</li>
<li> So disappointed.</li>

    <li> OK but not as smooth as the pump provided by my dentist several years ago.</li>
    <li> It works ok. Claims to fit on the bottle snugly but my husband and I both can&#x27;t get it all the way on the opening of the bottle. It would leak if it was pushed over. Pump itself works great. Just some fitment issues.</li>
    <li> Not at all happy with this pump. We&#x27;ve had a pump for a number of years and it worked great. Was getting old and time to replace. This pump is nearly impossible to get on. It&#x27;s somewhat expensive for what it really is. I would ne but it again and would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Satisfy customer:  I don&#x27;t have to tug with safety top, holding bottle, then trying to pour Listerine mouth wash out..</li>
    <li> Not a good quality.  Splashes all over the place when the pump is pushed.</li>
    <li> I love this thing it enable all of in the house to share the listerine without worrying about germs</li>
    <li> Pump didn&#x27;t fit right on the bottle. Thought it was the bottle at first. Nope, the pump does not screw on square on the second bottle.So disappointed.Why would you make such a poor product.</li>
    <li> Love my pump, perfect fit. Will be ordering another for my mom</li>
    <li> The pump fits perfectly on a Listerine bottle.  Have not tried it on other brands.  It dispenses the correct amount without any waste. It is the best way to share a bottle in  a germ free way.  This is a must have for the kid&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
    <li> The advertised picture shows a bottle of Listerine. When the product was delivered, only the pump was enclosed.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit the 1.0 litre snugly, but it works as intended</li>
    <li> Just  what I was looking for!  Works well!!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these for our two bathrooms.  They are both Listerine, both 1L, one fits snugly, the other just will not fit as snug as the other.  Tried swapping its definitely the pump.  This is an $7-8 item so I am not going to go berserk that one is loose - the pumps each accomplish their duty so this buyer is &amp;#34;SATISFIED&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The items works just fine except for the first pump. It sticks a little, but then pumps fine.&lt;br /&gt;This was the only pump that I found that fits on the 1.5 L bottle.</li>
    <li> pump works fine ,fits fine. do have an issue when the pump received does not match the description or the pictures at all. no name manufacturer. No &amp;#34;listerine&amp;#34; stamped into the pump as shown in the pics.The pumps I got are just some no name generic clone. I bought these based on the pics and description. Listing is a LIE.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these and both are a very tight fit, have to really push to get them on properly, but once on works well and looks very nice.</li>
