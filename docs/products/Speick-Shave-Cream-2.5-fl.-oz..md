      <li>Pretty impressed with this.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m looking for something that lathers easily and provides a great post shave feeling.</li>
      <li>It is smooth and smells great.</li>
      <li>I find myself wanting to not just wash but scrub my face after using it, and that takes away that nice scent.  </li>
      <li>but nothing spectacular either.  </li>
      <li>It lathers well and doesn&#x27;t smell like some kind of department store perfume section.  </li>
      <li>For what you pay, it works as good as the better creams.  </li>
      <li>I even liked the \\&quot;medicinal\\</li>
      <li>Really liked it.</li>
      <li>Nicely packaged.</li>
      <li>I liked the scent, and wanted to try it.  </li>
      <li>I was wondering what kind of shave cream to get.  </li>
      <li>If you stop too soon, it won&#x27;t be nearly as nice a lather.  </li>
      <li>Blows anything else out of the water, doesn&#x27;t give me allergies, and smells nice.</li>
      <li>No doubt about it -- great for travel, very comfortable on the face, makes for a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>a really nice cream I&#x27;ld spend more and go with a better brand, something that comes in a jar.</li>
      <li>It has a great scent that ladies are apparently pretty into</li>
      <li>This my first Speick product and it has a great scent.  </li>
      <li>Spend a couple of bucks more and go with TOBS or Cyril R. Slater cream, trust me you won&#x27;t regret it....</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>There are creams with better slickness</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would love to replicate the scent in a cologne.  </li>
      <li>It also lathers very well, is protective, and leaves a great feeling on your face.  </li>
      <li>I love the fragrance of the Proraso, however, it didn&#x27;t provide the &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I wish it smelled more like the Speick bar soap, this is blend with a lavender smell.</li>
      <li>This one provides a nice smooth shave</li>
      <li>I love the lavender scent</li>
      <li>Love this shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is simply the best rub on Shave cream I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find it cheaper.</li>
      <li>It seems much more slippery than the Nivea I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My favorite shaving cream in a tube.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is more like shaving with shave soap than with</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try more products from Speick.</li>
      <li>You MIGHT not like the scent, but it&#x27;s 100000000000000000x better than ANYTHING by Mennen or Axe.</li>
      <li>Tabac being my favorite.</li>
      <li>It lathers nicely, protects your skin from razor burn and has a great masculine smell.  </li>
      <li>but I still think to myself that maybe something might be better.</li>
      <li>The lavender smell is ok.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice scent, and most importantly it gets the whiskers off and gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Performance is okay.</li>
      <li>The cream is uniform and well-textured; it lathers beautifully; it smells like the old timey medicinal lavender of the barber shop shave; really sets up the beard and moisturizes; great shave.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good shave cream.</li>
      <li>It was definitely better than your average creme, but not the best I have ever used.</li>
      <li>all good but not my absolute favorites.</li>
      <li>Lathers easily with bowl and brush, provides thick, rich cream with good glide and cushion, and has that awesome Speick fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I think it may have something to do with the speick plant extract and the fact that the cream rinses off extremely easily when you are done shaving.</li>
      <li>Hands down the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>This is fine though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is fine.</li>
      <li>*Not tested or confirmed by science.</li>
      <li>The cream itself has an attractive pearly sheen and which lathers to a brighter white.</li>
      <li>I have seen great lather built in a bowl using this cream in various shaving videos.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of shaving cream, and this is the best so far.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Blows anything else out of the water, doesn&#x27;t give me allergies, and smells nice.</li>
    <li> Great scent, lathers like a champ. Great shave. It&#x27;s a Speick product, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Pretty impressed with this. Scent does have a medicinal lavender feel but it dissipates quickly when applying and I enjoy the scent that is left.  I had an excellent shave with this cream using distilled water to whip up lather in my bowl. Close to BBS and no irritation, definitely keeping this in my rotation. Now to test the Palmolive!</li>
    <li> This my first Speick product and it has a great scent.  I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it but some people say it is peppery which is true but doesn&#x27;t do it justice. It has a very classic masculine smell that is reminiscent of a barbershop.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like Clubman Pinaud but if you like that you&#x27;ll probably like this.  It lathers well but the amount of water is critical and can be a little fussy until you learn to get right. Gives a nice slick feeling and rinses away clean with no residue.</li>
    <li> My favorite shave cream, by far.  It&#x27;s nearly as slippery as Proraso, but has a very pleasing, subtle scent of Austrian alpine lavender.  I stopped using any after-shave treatments because it is so soothing to my skin.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Nothing has shaved closer or smoother.  The lavender smell is ok.  This makes my other shaving products obsolete!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. One of the best lather shave creams on the market.</li>
    <li> This is ridiculously good shaving cream. I would recommend it to anyone who knows what they&#x27;re doing. The aftershave is wonderful as well.</li>
    <li> A great Shaving Cream. When I want just a good shave that leaves my face feeling good, I reach for Speick.&lt;br /&gt;A great cream with good cushion and slickness. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Also get the Aftershave as well.</li>
    <li> I only buy this product as I tried others and since this is natural and doesn&#x27;t have dangerous ingredients, this is the best.  It lathers well and doesn&#x27;t smell like some kind of department store perfume section.  The price went up and I am disappointed as I bought this for 20% cheaper 4 years ago but I can&#x27;t find any product that comes close to this one.  I tried but ended up back to buying this item.  The tube is metal and not plastic and the company believes in natural product line.  No doubt about buying again and again.</li>
    <li> This smells great, not some sickly sweet or sharp irritating scent.  It works quite well, but the consistency is very thick before you use a shaving brush, and tends to cling to the skin after shaving.  I find myself wanting to not just wash but scrub my face after using it, and that takes away that nice scent.  I think the size makes it a good candidate for travel.</li>
    <li> Great scent, works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several other tube shave creams and this one is awful. 857 pounds of pressure to get this mess out of the tube. It&#x27;s as hard as 14-year-old toothpaste and almost impossible to lather. It ends up as small rock hard lump in your hand. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad tube, an old batch, or this is normal. As far as I&#x27;m concerned Speick owes me $8.50 for a refund and another $14.75 as an apology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general I tend to ignore mediocre products and not buy them again. This trash deserves every malicious word.</li>
    <li> I discovered Speick when I lived in Germany.  It lathers nicely, protects your skin from razor burn and has a great masculine smell.  I have very sensitive skin and sometimes shaving cream makes me break out.  I do not have these problems when I use Speick. I think it may have something to do with the speick plant extract and the fact that the cream rinses off extremely easily when you are done shaving.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this by my brother in-law.  I liked the scent, and wanted to try it.  I do not use a shaving brush to mix or apply; just wet my face, put a pea-sized amount on my hand, and lather up.  It seems much more slippery than the Nivea I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now my standard shaving cream.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the same time as another of the expensive creams, but none of them are worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great slickness! Clean, masculine and spicy scent. Takes a little more water than most creams, but once you get the hang of it, the lather can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> No doubt about it -- great for travel, very comfortable on the face, makes for a smooth shave. Never going back.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream to try as an alternative to the ubiquitous Proraso.  I love the fragrance of the Proraso, however, it didn&#x27;t provide the &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; I was looking for.  The same is not true for the Speick.  While not perfect, I find I get a better lather and glide with the Speick.  The fragrance is just icing on the cake.  Absolutely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of shaving cream, and this is the best so far.  It really softens up hairs and makes shaving easy.  You don&#x27;t have to use much either.  My skin is quite sensitive.  I&#x27;ve had zero acne outbreaks using this product.</li>
    <li> This is a good cream.  It lasts a very long time wet shaving with a brush using about a pea shaped amount.  It has a nice fragrance and is very slick when applying for a single pass shave on a double edge or newer type blades.  I&#x27;m an old school double edge wet shaver all the way.</li>
    <li> I got this, knowing full well that some hate the scent.  Well, the scent is very masculine with just a hint of lavender and it doesn&#x27;t hit me in the nose with a powerful odor.  I like that.  The cream is made from beeswax so it lubricates well and soothes sensitive skin.  It lathers VERY well with a brush and provides a perfect result every single time.  This beats Nivea&#x27;s sensitive line and Taylor of Old Bond; the former on performance and the latter on both performance and value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably get 4 or 5 tubes of this and stock up.  I really enjoy shaving with this and highly recommend it to everyone.  You MIGHT not like the scent, but it&#x27;s 100000000000000000x better than ANYTHING by Mennen or Axe.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Speick shaving cream for about 6 or 7 years and am very pleased with the shaving comfort it provides.</li>
    <li> Use it daily, I find the sent to be pleasing and the lather of the right consistency.  My hair is very soft and my face not to hairy, so that gives me lots of options, but this one is one of my favorites.  Paired with a good blade and you have a very nice shave.</li>
    <li> First, you are paying premium for this since this is a 2.5oz product that costs $10+. The cream is good and the packaging I have no problem with. However, the shave is not as smooth as that of Proraso Green Tube which is about $15 for 5.2oz. I love the lavender scent and I love natural products, however, this particular cream has some ingredients that may not be so natural. Also, the scent of lavender is reduced by the presence of bees wax. I&#x27;ve shaved with it 2 days back to back and I will give it another try, but I was a tad bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shaving creams I&#x27;ve ever used. Used it a couple days ago and the smell was fantastic. It created a superb lather and provided lots of protection. Nicely packaged. I recommend to everyone. Thank you seller.</li>
    <li> This stuff is more like shaving with shave soap than with a really nice cream I&#x27;ld spend more and go with a better brand, something that comes in a jar.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream punches facial hair in the mouth. I won&#x27;t stand for anything else protecting my skin.    Fun fact: Spiek shave cream can stop a bullet, razors don&#x27;t stand a chance.*    *Not tested or confirmed by science.</li>
    <li> The aroma must be an acquired taste and I don&#x27;t have it.  I&#x27;ll save this tube for travel but otherwise not use it again.</li>
    <li> Slick. Good lather with stiff brush. Smell is odd at first. I agree it is medicinal. There is also a musk (very faint) note to it. It has become a pleasure to use it. A touch pricey but what the hell......you only live once. I may note that I was complimented on the smell by a woman at the grocery store(stranger). This is the first attention I have had from a woman in years.  I am old and fat with gray hair. If it helps me, younger men should have lots of comments from women. The strong medicinal note was an initial surprise. After 4 or 5 shaves I got used to it and it is now one of my favorites in the morning rotation of shaving cream. I would try the aftershave but it is not in my budget. The scent blends well with club man talc and aftershave.</li>
    <li> Because it comes in a tube, I purchased this as a travel shave cream to go in my toiletry kit.  After using it on my trip, I&#x27;m considering making it my daily shave cream when I&#x27;m home.  This stuff is fantastic.  Lathers easily with bowl and brush, provides thick, rich cream with good glide and cushion, and has that awesome Speick fragrance.  Leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized.  The shave was comfortable and the razor just glided.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> smells great, works well, reportedly vegan ingredients per xref with data on other sites. not much else to say: I will definitely be re-ordering it.</li>
    <li> Love this shaving cream.  I like to use several different shave creams.  This one provides a nice smooth shave an has a great scent.  A staple for me -- I&#x27;ll keep a tube of Speick in the drawer.</li>
    <li> I am now 4-5 years into Double-Edge shaving and use a good soap at home.  I tried this for my travel kit at the recommendation of other Amazon.com users. It is a first rate product and I get a close shave.  The tube is under the TSA 3 ounce size limit for carry on items and goes a long way. It is smooth and smells great.</li>
    <li> I bought this after trying a sample.  Speick shave cream is a great product.  Lathers up wonderfully with a shave brush and bowl.  It is equally wonderful as a face lather cream.  I highly recommend this cream to anyone who safety shaves.  You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> For what you pay, it works as good as the better creams.  Is it the best, no, but it can hold its own with creams 3 times its price.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving cream. The smell is fine. Its all nature and leaves the face feeling great. Works well with a straight razor. I&#x27;m going to try more products from Speick. This is a little expensive, but simply put - IT&#x27;S THE BEST</li>
    <li> I bought this as an add on to an after shave purchase not expecting much. What a surprise after the first use. Great scent and one of the closest shave I had without using pre shave oil. I&#x27;ll let you know my setup so I can qualify this. I use a Merker Futur and Feather Super Stainless blades. First try I did with no pre shave oil, second with Art of Shaving pre shave oil. 2 pass&#x27;s  and no razor burn, and I do have sensitive skin. I have used Proraso pruducts in the past and also Tabac. Tabac being my favorite. give it a try, I will say it won&#x27;t last long, I am working with exactly how much less I can use and get a decent shave.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting to like this shave cream. Many have indicated they like it but some not so much. It lathered well in the bowl with a silvertip big brush, felt great on the face and performed really well. I even liked the \\&quot;medicinal\\&quot; smell some people do not. Very slippery with the razor if kept moist and the second and third pass applications went on as well as the first. Really liked it. Same league as Proraso and Musgo Real. All three are excellent, straightforward shave products with distinctive scents.</li>
    <li> In this range, $8-$12 for a 2-3 oz. tube, I have found Speick to be one of the very best. The cream is uniform and well-textured; it lathers beautifully; it smells like the old timey medicinal lavender of the barber shop shave; really sets up the beard and moisturizes; great shave. After rinsing, feels well conditioned. I don&#x27;t know much about this allegedely magicial Speick plant that they extract and put in this and their other products, but seems to add some nice properties to this shave cream.  This is my new favorite, after trying so many others. Made in Germany and the plant extract is sourced from one location and of high quality. You don&#x27;t need much, so the 2.5 oz tube lasts surprisingly long. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Watch your price on this. I picked it up for $6.50 plus tax at Merz Apothecary here in Chicago. Merz is the brick-and-mortar for Smallflower here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: at $6.50 five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather: five stars. Very rich cool whip level lather using little product. Lather built on the face, not in a bowl. I have seen great lather built in a bowl using this cream in various shaving videos. I just prefer to build lather on my face instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cushion: five stars. I use a very aggressive razor and have not had a nick yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slickness: four stars. There are creams with better slickness but you have to pay. This is fine though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: four stars. Scent is always subjective. I like this scent, just not up there with my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin protection: five stars. No razor burn or redness after 3 passes with and aggressive razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself: five stars. Close, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy again? You bet. This is now a permanent part of my cream/soap rotation.</li>
    <li> If you are very budget minded then perhaps this is for you.  Not bad but nothing spectacular either.  Spend a couple of bucks more and go with TOBS or Cyril R. Slater cream, trust me you won&#x27;t regret it....</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this line of products during a trip to Germany - I wondered what the fresh smell I smelled coming off them and they pointed me to Speick. I needed shaving Cream, and so I bought this to try.&lt;br /&gt;It is simply the best rub on Shave cream I have ever used. just a small dab lathers the whole face and shaving is smooth and razor burn free. moreover unlike other similar american products that package their creams in unwieldy plastic tubes that are almost impossible to get the last 1/4 out of (Neutrogena, call your office) the traditional metal toothpaste tube Speick uses makes it easy to get to every last bit. I hope they don&#x27;t change this.&lt;br /&gt;I believe I have found a line of products that I will use for years to come.</li>
    <li> Great smell and great feel. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff. Price is a little hefty compared to other brands but well worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I felt it was worth the price and I liked the scent, although it goes away in less than an hour.  It was definitely better than your average creme, but not the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> WOW this smells good. Seriously, I dab a tiny bit on my face to smell good before I go out at night sometimes. I&#x27;m looking for a deodorant/cologne with this smell if anyone knows of some! It smells very old-school barber shop, which smells very manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first shaving cream you mix yourself, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but it does its job. Takes about 1 minute to get a lather, and some self-training to get the amount of water and such right, but it isn&#x27;t difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Shave also with Pro Raso, but find Speick provides a better, thicker lather and is easier and less reactive to my skin.  I shave daily, having a thick beard with tough hair and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I picked some of this up locally a ways back to give it a try. While I&#x27;m not THAT wild about the scent, this stuff makes a great lather and leaves my skin feeling GREAT! I&#x27;d give 4 stars because I&#x27;m not wild about the scent, but it really is that good of a shave cream. I gave a tube to my boss because he really likes the scent, I still keep one around myself because I&#x27;ll not go without a cream that gives as good of a shave as this stuff does.</li>
    <li> Buy this shaving cream, and I am very agrdecido of its results, was what I was looking for a long time, is a very rendidora cream because you put a small portion in the shaving brush, and this produces a pleasant and plentiful foam, smell nice, and this low price cream worth buying will not disappoint, and neither will lose the money invested. recommend is the excellent cream.</li>
    <li> &#x27;A Very Good and Nice Product!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I really liked this creme, It has a nice manly tho a bit peppery &#x27;EURO&#x27; style scent to it,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a very good Shave Creme but &#x27;Not Quite&#x27; my cup of tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The earlier reviewer I think was right when he said Speick was overrated, Tho I&#x27;m a bit more charitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a good creme but I insist that a shave creme :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be smooth plus It has a nice scent, and most importantly it gets the whiskers off and gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with a top grade razor and a new blade, And YES I used a hot towel but after 2passes I still had some fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad but a &#x27;Top Grade&#x27; soap would do it in 2 Passes but I had to Make a 3rd pass here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I had some &#x27;Very Slight&#x27; irritation but not badly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my beard is really tough and its hard for me to shave it without a menthol creme to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Other Side?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a more softer or &#x27;Normal Beard&#x27; ,Or say Menthol Cremes don&#x27;t work for you then I&#x27;d try Speick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could be just the ticket for you, And overall its a good creme tho not a 5 star one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller get top marks as he ships fast and this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course Amazon always has the best prices,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuff Said.&lt;br /&gt;IndianaEd</li>
    <li> I wish it smelled more like the Speick bar soap, this is blend with a lavender smell. Performance is okay.</li>
    <li> Provides a clean, smooth shave.  The scent is good - like a barbershop.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used:  great, natural herbal scent, takes almost no cream to create a thick lather, and lasts forever:  one tube lasted me a year based on 3x weekly shaves.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. You only need a pea sized amount to shave your whole face. The only downside is the terrible price on Amazon. I have not been able to find it cheaper. I really like the metal tube as well. It allows you to get the very last bit out of the tube.</li>
    <li> After trying many shaving preps since entering the world of traditional wet shaving I have yet to find my absolute favorite. Tabac, cella, body shop maca root, van der hagen, col conk soaps, TOBS, proraso and Speick....all good but not my absolute favorites. I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m looking for something that lathers easily and provides a great post shave feeling. Tabac, Cella and Speick come close to what I want but I still think to myself that maybe something might be better. For my daily shave I find myself using Cella and Tabac because I can just load them up and face lather without using a bowl/mug. As for Speick its a great cream...lathers well in a bowl/mug, smells good and provides good protection from the razor. Still I&#x27;m looking for THAT shaving prep.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream smells great!  Its not like what Americans are used though!  You wont get the lather of a gel but it still serves it purpose.  Speick soap is a great bang for its buck!  Their shaving cream is a bit pricey compared to what you would get from an American Gel!</li>
    <li> My favorite shaving cream in a tube.  It smells wonderful (valeriana celtica) - like a minty lavender.  The scent alone gets 5 stars.  It also lathers very well, is protective, and leaves a great feeling on your face.  One caveat - when using a brush (the only way I&#x27;ve used this), keep lathering until you get a rich, creamy, yogurt lather.  If you stop too soon, it won&#x27;t be nearly as nice a lather.  2 almond sized snurdles/dollops works quite well for me for a 2 pass shave with touchups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to replicate the scent in a cologne.  Alas, even their cologne (and their toilet water, which smells differently) doesn&#x27;t have the same scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Speick shave cream for about two and a half years now and I love it. I&#x27;m not a hardcore traditional shaving enthusiast or anything, but I do enjoy shaving with a brush and a safety razor and the Speick cream is a pleasant addition to my mornings. I have sensitive skin that reacts badly to a lot of normal/benign products, but have never had a problem with this shave cream. It has a great scent that ladies are apparently pretty into (I&#x27;ve been complimented by a couple of overnight guests.) The cream itself has an attractive pearly sheen and which lathers to a brighter white. The lather is suitably thick, doesn&#x27;t take forever to build up, and doesn&#x27;t dry out too quickly. One tube lasts me a few months, so I think it&#x27;s good value for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good shave cream. C.O. Bigelow, Proraso and many of the Taylor of Old Bond Streets have gotten my 5 stars. I give Speick along with Omega and Musgo 4 stars. I just think my 5 stars lather up a little bit better. IMHO most shavers would be quite happy with Speick.</li>
    <li> Lathers great and gives a slick and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I was wondering what kind of shave cream to get.  My all-time favorite is Taylor of Old Bond St, but that is fairly&lt;br /&gt;expensive.  This is at least 5.00 less.  It does have an odd smell. I at first found that disagreeable, but after using&lt;br /&gt;the product, it bothered me less and less.  Mixed properly with water, it does lather up rather well. I do recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product.</li>
