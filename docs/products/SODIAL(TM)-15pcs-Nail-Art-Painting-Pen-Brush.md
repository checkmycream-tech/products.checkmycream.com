      <li>Once one of mine came off I got some super glue and, very easily, pulled the rest off of their handles and re glued them all on.</li>
      <li>I do know that the brown flat headed brush I specifically use to clean up around my nails after polishing them, works perfectly.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s good as new!</li>
      <li>Not only was it greatly priced, but its a cute package with a variety of nail brushes.</li>
      <li>Good quality, got them pretty quickly (being they came from China to the US).</li>
      <li>Excellent value (less than $3).  </li>
      <li>Which is fine for me.</li>

      <li>Easy to clean...</li>
      <li>these are going to make a great gift for a friend whos totally into nail art and manicures.</li>
      <li>I must admit I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet, but the few that I have, have worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the brushes.</li>
      <li>They came before the deadline, they are all unique and they work.</li>
      <li>glad I ordered them...but be willing to wait...</li>
      <li>Other than that happy nail designing.</li>
      <li>I can let my creative imagination run wild with these brushes.</li>
      <li>Brushes are as described and are worth the price.</li>
      <li>I purchased this packet because I&#x27;m starting to do my own &amp; nieces nails.</li>
      <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>There is such an assortment I&#x27;m not quite sure what to do with all of them</li>
      <li>I love the effects that these different brushes make.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was expecting and description was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>, the picture shows exactly what you are getting.  </li>
      <li>I showed it to friends and at first they were uninterested, then they all called needing it for one thing or another.</li>
      <li>Will buy more in future</li>
      <li>Also the hair is super soft and after dipped in acetone become dry but hair conditioner makes them good as new.</li>
      <li>Thisnproduct took longer than usual to get...but good quality and variety of nail art brushes.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>That Is why I bought it because it wasn&#x27;t that much money</li>
      <li>I like the product is very usefull, but it took a lot of time to arrive.</li>
      <li>but money really does buy quality.</li>
      <li>As soon as they were used, the top dried up and were then unusable.</li>
      <li>I especially love the long thin one, which helps me make really nice even and thin lines across my nails.</li>
      <li>I am new to nail art</li>
      <li>they brake really easily, the little hairs fall easily too and they are very hard to clean</li>
      <li>They are not top of the line brushes, but work ok for the price.</li>
      <li>I use them to create basic designs and I use the smaller ones to clean up any polish around my nail.</li>
      <li>The only real problem is that if any acetone gets near the metal it eats threw the glue and the brush falls off the handle.</li>
      <li>The bristles are all the same length unlike some other cheap brushes.</li>
      <li>They came way earlier than expected mine came 5 weeks before the latest expected date.</li>
      <li>but a little super glue</li>
      <li>They won&#x27;t last long but they made painting designs on little girls nails fun and colorful.</li>
      <li>Each standard (not fan) brush comes with a clear protective cap to preserve the hairs while in storage or during transport.  </li>
      <li>They dried up after first use and one even came apart.</li>
      <li>my only complaint is that when i wipe the brushes clean from the polish  </li>
      <li>I was able to put them back together and use a small set of pliers to pinch the metal tight to the wood.  </li>

    <li> They are good to start a nail artist life. You can use with any kind of nail polish. I would get them again...</li>
    <li> Not only was it greatly priced, but its a cute package with a variety of nail brushes. I purchased this packet because I&#x27;m starting to do my own &amp; nieces nails. I love the brushes, although I am afraid that they might not last me too long . I must admit I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet, but the few that I have, have worked wonderfully. My only suggestion is that when you use them don&#x27;t dip the brush into the nail polish remover bottle--I tried to take a short cut and it backfired--the paint from the wooden stick started coming off. Other than that happy nail designing.</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes for the price paid.. I would have given it a better rating had the handles been made or wrapped with something that would not come off on my hand every time the acetone touches them.</li>
    <li> These brushes were pretty awesome to use. They won&#x27;t last long but they made painting designs on little girls nails fun and colorful.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional, but bought these brushes with the intent of painting some designs on my nails. Although painting designs takes some practice these were definitely a good deal for the price. They arrived in a few weeks after order.</li>
    <li> They came before the deadline, they are all unique and they work. I am new to nail art but these brushes seem to do the trick and didn&#x27;t cost me a fortune! I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> I received brushes that were bent at the metal section. The bristles were uneven and jagged. It also took a really long time for it to ship</li>
    <li> Really nice and soft brushes that I use for more detailed designs on my nails. I especially love the long thin one, which helps me make really nice even and thin lines across my nails.</li>
    <li> Honestly i wouldnt buy these again they brake really easily, the little hairs fall easily too and they are very hard to clean</li>
    <li> they are good my only complaint is that when i wipe the brushes clean from the polish  the paint strips off</li>
    <li> This was a terrible product. Very poorly made and broke when using. I would not recommend it at all even though it is cheap. That Is why I bought it because it wasn&#x27;t that much money but money really does buy quality.</li>
    <li> love the brushes!! they are very very nice, they don&#x27;t fall apart, great for nail art!! must i say more?! (: me being a girl i always paint my nails and always wanted to do a design somehow but now i can!! GET THIS PRODUCT!! you might think it&#x27;s bad because it&#x27;s cheap but this is one of those rare things where it&#x27;s cheap and it works!!</li>
    <li> Good price and quality</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for nail designs and for detailing paintings. I use these all the time. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without them!</li>
    <li> These brushes are super great! I was almost worried to buy then because of the low price but I&#x27;m glad I did! These brushes are super soft and really great to use all but one came in perfect condition, one of mine was bent and when I bent it back into place it broke but a little super glue and it&#x27;s good as new! They came way earlier than expected mine came 5 weeks before the latest expected date. The bristles are all the same length unlike some other cheap brushes. Also the hair is super soft and after dipped in acetone become dry but hair conditioner makes them good as new. You have very good control over the brush and the way it moves. I would definetly recommend these to a friend and I would buy these again in a heart beat!</li>
    <li> if you like to have a different manicure those painting brush make it possible even if you are not a professional.&lt;br /&gt;ever since I got them I an able to play more with all the shapes. great price great item (s)</li>
    <li> They dried up after first use and one even came apart. Hopefully they will loosen up but not easily. The paint does come off with any contact with acetone. They also took quite a while to get here.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift.  Recipient was very pleased</li>
    <li> just what i needed to make a variation of designs and dots. it does include a dotter so you dont have to buy one</li>
    <li> The white on the brushes come off when it comes in contact with acetone. It finish then stains you hand and fingers when it comes off...I didn&#x27;t like that at all.</li>
    <li> As soon as they were used, the top dried up and were then unusable. My daughter was unhappy about this.</li>
    <li> I like the product is very usefull, but it took a lot of time to arrive. I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to take that long.</li>
    <li> Excellent value (less than $3).  Brushes seem well made, a good variety of sizes and shapes.  Firm tips to brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than I need for the nails, some will find there way into my art brushes (and I&#x27;m getting my nephew a set to use with acrylic art paints).</li>
    <li> Great items Great product will buy again beautiful color love the nail art painting brush  just what I thought it will be can&#x27;t wait to try</li>
    <li> Bought 4 of these for my nieces to start their nail art kits.  Several brushes in each kit were missing the protective covers causing the brushes to be crushed and bent.  Several of the brushes came apart (separated where the metal and wood connect).  I was able to put them back together and use a small set of pliers to pinch the metal tight to the wood.  All of the brushes were hard, I had to play with each brush to soften it up in order to be used.  Some brushes didn&#x27;t not soften...tossed them away.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome there are many artworks that I have been trying out and they work perfectly I recommend any nail artist to use</li>
    <li> So many brushes, oh what will I do with them ALL? Lol. I&#x27;m no pro at nails so I don&#x27;t know which brush does what. I do know that the brown flat headed brush I specifically use to clean up around my nails after polishing them, works perfectly. The dotting tool is great as well. I just can&#x27;t get into the use of the yellow &amp; the white fan brush-  I did learn a trick on how to do flowers with my other brushes, flat heads &amp; pointed ones! (&#x3D;</li>
    <li> These are one of those &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; kind of items. They aren&#x27;t good quality but for your first set of nail art brushes they will work. I use them to create basic designs and I use the smaller ones to clean up any polish around my nail. The only real problem is that if any acetone gets near the metal it eats threw the glue and the brush falls off the handle. Once one of mine came off I got some super glue and, very easily, pulled the rest off of their handles and re glued them all on.</li>
    <li> Thisnproduct took longer than usual to get...but good quality and variety of nail art brushes.  Easy to clean...bristols last...glad I ordered them...but be willing to wait...delivery willntake time.</li>
    <li> There is such an assortment I&#x27;m not quite sure what to do with all of them but I cant wait to try! Arrived in excellent condition and are a good quality!</li>
    <li> This brush set is truly amazing.  The shafts are smooth and well shaped.  The brush hairs are well secured and of excellent quality.  Each standard (not fan) brush comes with a clear protective cap to preserve the hairs while in storage or during transport.  With proper care, these should outlive me!</li>
    <li> The brushes were bent up and looked used. I ordered 5 packs and not one was the way it should of been.</li>
    <li> Very good!! Fast shipping. Thank you</li>
    <li> great brushes but not for nail polish u cant leave them in water to long cause they will crack hope u like them</li>
    <li> these are going to make a great gift for a friend whos totally into nail art and manicures. shes going to love them</li>
    <li> I love the effects that these different brushes make. I can let my creative imagination run wild with these brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend of mine who loves painting nails and she loved it!  It is the perfect gift at a great price!.  The only downside was it took a very long time to get here, but I believe it&#x27;s because it was coming over from a different country.  Other than that, the picture shows exactly what you are getting.  It comes in a plastic bag to keep all of the brushes together.  I&#x27;m very glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 sets of these one for a girl I work with and one for me.  I love them.  Good quality, got them pretty quickly (being they came from China to the US).</li>
    <li> The brushes are a nice variety of sizes and shapes... I especially liked the dotting tool and the mini paint brush.</li>
    <li> Very reasonable price. The only thing that it looks like it has repetitive brushes. Which is fine for me. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Hasnt arrived its been a month very poor shipment.  . . . . . . . . . .. .</li>
    <li> I showed it to friends and at first they were uninterested, then they all called needing it for one thing or another. LOL.</li>
