      <li>Very beautiful and many colors.</li>
      <li>The colors look bright in the photos.</li>
      <li>so that was good.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good thank you, it was what we were looking for.</li>
      <li>The picture is good at showing the amount that you recieve in each pot.</li>
      <li>I loved the colores, but could not get them to cure.</li>
      <li>, good coverage&lt;br</li>
      <li>The colours are nice bright colours</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product,</li>
      <li>Best solid gel win win</li>
      <li>Love the colors of these!</li>
      <li>I love these colors!</li>
      <li>There are a ton of colors and they cure nicely.</li>
      <li>Nice staff.</li>
      <li>so I ended up having to make my own to avoid opening every lid.&lt;br /&gt;-Secure lids before shipping?</li>
      <li>Lots of nice colors.</li>
      <li>I added my own glitter to kind of perk them up a bit.</li>
      <li>What can I say 36 colors to choose from and I&#x27;m loving them.</li>
      <li>The colors are very nice and rich.</li>
      <li>Had to put a drop of the color on top of each jar and set it because there was no label of any kind on the jar or color chart or a number.  </li>
      <li>Let me start out by saying one bottle of any gel polish is generally around $15, so this pack of 36 for their price is awesome!</li>
      <li>Mine cure just fine!</li>
      <li>I love these colours and this kind of gel its easy and dries good also the gels came quick and undamaged I recommend this product and seller.</li>
      <li>I wanted more glamorous colors and the performance to be better.</li>
      <li>All in all, I guess for the price is ok, but I would not buy it again.</li>
      <li>I love them</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>when using this you must remember to cap the free edge or it will lift/peel off!</li>
      <li>okay.....</li>
      <li>all though I&#x27;m very happy with the product and for the price it is, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it! :)</li>
      <li>I kept them and will re order the solid colors because I was impressed with the glitter.</li>
      <li>I love the selection in color and the price per unit is unbeatable.  </li>
      <li>Thicker than most</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>If you are doing just one coat the product will peel off easy, however if you apply the gel correctly and use 3 coats it will be durable.  </li>
      <li>But its easy to work with and to apply to nails.&lt;br /&gt;-Amount for your money.</li>
      <li>Most of the colours are two bright, kind of neon colours (neon pink, neon purple, etc.).</li>
      <li>The light that I use isn&#x27;t the highest quality, but once I cure my nails for a total of 5 min, I am good to go!</li>
      <li>I bought it thinking it was more colorful.</li>
      <li>for the people who say it &amp;#34;never cures,&amp;#34; they must not be doing it correctly or have a crappy light.</li>
      <li>Overall great product.</li>
      <li>The pluses are that the product came pretty fast and in good condition.</li>
      <li>Also, I use regular nail polish on top of the uv gel colors to make many interesting designs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My bottles were mostly clean except 2 that had spilt during shipping and handling.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I love doing my own nails and having them last.</li>
      <li>Would have liked what I really ordered but these are pretty</li>
      <li>The lil containers were all full and when I received the package nothing had leaked out during transporting.</li>
      <li>Works well for full nail.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The colors are beautiful and arrived quickly, only the yellow oozed out a bit, but it was easy to clean up with a gel brush!</li>
      <li>loys of pretty colors!</li>
      <li>The colors really were great, but my personal prefrence is not so many shades of red.</li>
      <li>I will stick to more professional gels vs this stuff.</li>
      <li>well pretty, the colors are darker than pictured.</li>
      <li>Very disapointed!</li>
      <li>Make sure you have all the proper tools to use gel polish.</li>
      <li>All of them simply had a number on the top</li>
      <li>Love the colors and its a good value but half of these leaked through their containers when I reveived them, now i have gel everywhere and those are a lot of little containers to clean up.</li>
      <li>Some are really close to being the same, I&#x27;d just prefer even more variety with the pastels instead of</li>
      <li>Positive points about the gel</li>
      <li>The colors don&#x27;t really match up with the box.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t take more than 2 hours per set of nails &amp; spent 4 HOURS doing ONE SET because this gel is s***.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T</li>
      <li>HOPE TO USE THEM REAL SOON</li>
      <li>Takes longer than 2 minutes under standard UV Light.</li>
      <li>But for the price, I don&#x27;t mind so much.</li>
      <li>I really really do.</li>
      <li>Other than that the colors that I have used so far are nice</li>
      <li>Color is a little more opaque than I would have liked, and is super thick.  </li>
      <li>Several of them look quite similar until you put them on and finish off with the top coat.  </li>
      <li>Colors vibrant yet opaque</li>
      <li>Foil was REALLY hard to get off cleanly, but I prefer the secure foil to them leaking everywhere during shipment.</li>
      <li>Just over 1/2, but its sure to last for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;-Cures and lasts.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t change couse i live in another country</li>
      <li>There is just a slight sticky layer after curing but is easily taken care of with some alcohol.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works great for decorating due to the fact that it levels slowly.  </li>
      <li>The back of the box has the colors and numbers to each color, on the little tubs the number is on the bottom , so I just used a marker and marked the top of each with the number, keep the box</li>
      <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap and I dontt have money to waste like this.</li>
      <li>I was really expecting to receive atleast one white which I didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>i just brushed the gel back into the container and used my cleanser to wipe the outside clean, problem solved ~_^</li>
      <li>It was too clear and does not dry well.</li>
      <li>My wife just started doing her own gel nails at home 3 wks ago and was in the search of colored gels, but everything I found for her was either a powder or expensive.</li>
      <li>I like to use it more as a thin gel almost shellac type on my nails.</li>
      <li>You can barely tell they are different.</li>
      <li>i will reorder due to overall versatility and price - worth the $ spent.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve only done black, white and what I thought was neon green but now looks more like a minty green.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is great.  I love the selection in color and the price per unit is unbeatable.  If you are doing just one coat the product will peel off easy, however if you apply the gel correctly and use 3 coats it will be durable.  The product cures and works great!  Make sure you have all the proper tools to use gel polish.</li>
    <li> I was kindof dissappointed in this product. When it arrive three different pots were leaking, a red, brown and purple. I also thought I was going to get 36 different colors but I only received 23 different colors: 3 burgandy, 4 pastel pink, 2 yellow, 4 purple, 1 darkpink, 1 magenta, 1 bubblegum, 1 gray, 1 plum, 1 green, 1 red, 1 black, 2 neon pink, 2 lavendar, 1 brown, 1 neon orange, 2 blue, 1 pastel yellow, 1 teal, 1 turquoise, 2 pink, 1 dark blue and 1 light green. I was really expecting to receive atleast one white which I didn&#x27;t. Other than that the colors that I have used so far are nice but I wish I had a bigger selection in colors I feel like I am missing out. I would say this is a bargin for the amount of money I paid but I wish I would have gotten what I thought I was ordering.</li>
    <li> I loved the colores, but could not get them to cure. If anyone out there would like to but then I will sell then for what I gave for them just used then twice either time I couldn&#x27;t get tben to cure. What am I doing wrong</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking it was more colorful. It was too clear and does not dry well. I wanted more glamorous colors and the performance to be better. All in all, I guess for the price is ok, but I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> A for communication effort, unfortunately that is all I can say about this. The colors look bright in the photos.</li>
    <li> I couldnt wait for the order to reach ...im a lil disappointed how watering it is.  The colours are nice bright colours but im somewhat satisified with the quality or my buck.</li>
    <li> These are hit &amp; miss, even on the same set of nails!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it is about this gel, but it takes forEVER to harden, and sometimes won&#x27;t!! I don&#x27;t take more than 2 hours per set of nails &amp; spent 4 HOURS doing ONE SET because this gel is s***.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I ordered these to start my color gel collection. There are a ton of colors and they cure nicely. The only thing i wish was different was variety. There are a few colors that have near duplicates. You can barely tell they are different. But for the price, I don&#x27;t mind so much.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and many colors. However the vials are not marked. It&#x27;s all guesswork. I will figure out a way to identify them. They are thick colors that you only need one or two coats. Beautiful and shinny too! I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> What can I say 36 colors to choose from and I&#x27;m loving them. The colors are very nice and rich. The lil containers were all full and when I received the package nothing had leaked out during transporting. Would order these again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed but I can say they arrived in a timely matter. What I got was nothing close to what is pictured. All the pots were crammed into a small box and a few even leaked. Some of the colors were pretty and some were horrible. I added my own glitter to kind of perk them up a bit.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I cant get them to dry even waiting for 10-15 minutes under the lights. Repeat colors I believe I got at least 3 of the same color three different times. NOT HAPPY almost sent back but that&#x27;s a big pain. I chalked it up to internet ordering and threw them away.</li>
    <li> When I received these they were the wrong ones.  I got all glitter gels, but the seller worked out the mistake. I kept them and will re order the solid colors because I was impressed with the glitter. I love them</li>
    <li> These are a little thick and the pots are a little messy but for the price, it&#x27;s great.  Lots of nice colors.</li>
    <li> The gel peels and lifts.  I have tried extra curing, no such luck.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this merchandise</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good thank you, it was what we were looking for. It helps out a lot around the house. thank you</li>
    <li> Love the colors of these! They come in a pack of 36. The back of the box has the colors and numbers to each color, on the little tubs the number is on the bottom , so I just used a marker and marked the top of each with the number, keep the box so you can corespondent number to color on box! Will order gain!</li>
    <li> My wife just started doing her own gel nails at home 3 wks ago and was in the search of colored gels, but everything I found for her was either a powder or expensive. I then stumbled across this item. Although there were no reviews, I took the chance in purchasing because it looked like the liquid gel I&#x27;ve seen her use. We were given a 6 day window to receive the product once shipped and to our surprise it showed up a day sooner than the 1st day of expected arrival. Upon arrival she opened and found the gels as we expected with one slight difference, well pretty, the colors are darker than pictured. However, she tested a few of the colors and they work as she expected. One last thing is she doesn&#x27;t know, nor does it state in the description, if the gels are soak off or file off gels, but either way she loves them. I am planning on buying her the glitter gels as soon as I can and if Crazy Cart still has them in stock.</li>
    <li> the consistency of the product varies from pot to pot. The colors on the pictures do not match the color of the product. All in all, nothing to complain about and the price is very good.</li>
    <li> I would give it 2.5 stars. The pluses are that the product came pretty fast and in good condition. But then the minuses: although there should be 36 different colours, unfortunately, there were a few colours that repeated three times. Most of the colours are two bright, kind of neon colours (neon pink, neon purple, etc.). No navy blue or red colour, which was the biggest disappointment to me. Before I ordered it, I read other reviews, which said that there were no white colour in the set. Well, there was white colour in my box. So I assume that each set may contain different colours, which is weird!!! Not the worst product ever, but not the best either.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful and arrived quickly, only the yellow oozed out a bit, but it was easy to clean up with a gel brush! i just brushed the gel back into the container and used my cleanser to wipe the outside clean, problem solved ~_^ when using this you must remember to cap the free edge or it will lift/peel off! this is to be used thinly if you apply to much and it gets on the sidewalls/cuticles of your nails it will lift! if you apply too thick it will not cure properly! as with any UV gel product don&#x27;t care what brand it is. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, Thank you &amp;#34;Crazy Cart&amp;#34; will be ordering other UV Set soon! ^_^ ~Queen G~</li>
    <li> it took awhile to write this review so i  could  take some time actually use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Price per pot is a very good value&lt;br /&gt;2. Product viscosity one of the thickest I&#x27;ve used... Thicker than most builders.&lt;br /&gt;3. Cures okay..... Takes a little longer than 2 minutes when costs are moderately thick.&lt;br /&gt;4. Colors vibrant yet opaque, good coverage&lt;br /&gt;5. Very good for designs or accent colors. Works well for full nail.&lt;br /&gt;6. i found it odd that some colors cure \\&quot;hotter\\&quot; than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF I run out in the next couple months i will reorder due to overall versatility and price - worth the $ spent.</li>
    <li> I ordered the solid colors and got all glitter colors. Would have liked what I really ordered but these are pretty so I will keep.  There was not one color the same so that was good.  Had to put a drop of the color on top of each jar and set it because there was no label of any kind on the jar or color chart or a number.  Just a white jar.  Packaged well no spills on mine</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying one bottle of any gel polish is generally around $15, so this pack of 36 for their price is awesome! for the people who say it &amp;#34;never cures,&amp;#34; they must not be doing it correctly or have a crappy light. Mine cure just fine! They get a little thick, but that&#x27;s a minor sacrifice. Colors are not true to box, but I like them anyway. Foil was REALLY hard to get off cleanly, but I prefer the secure foil to them leaking everywhere during shipment. Somehow I got stuck with an extra yellow.... That&#x27;s what the missing star is for. Still not sure what color I am missing. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> I love these colours and this kind of gel its easy and dries good also the gels came quick and undamaged I recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> If I could give thus no stars I would I waited almost 2 months for this stuff and it never came in just a big waist of time.</li>
    <li> I bought solid colors and got glitter! Very disapointed! Can&#x27;t change couse i live in another country and it took me 3 month to get it since Dicember. Now what?</li>
    <li> I love these colors! I really really do. I love doing my own nails and having them last. Also, I use regular nail polish on top of the uv gel colors to make many interesting designs.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish there was a list of color descriptions for all 26. So far I&#x27;ve only done black, white and what I thought was neon green but now looks more like a minty green. I&#x27;m happy with how it turned out.</li>
    <li> it took a while to get to me, and when i got it, it was opened and some of the products leaked over other products… &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Nice staff. I love it.</li>
    <li> This product can not be cured under LED.  Takes longer than 2 minutes under standard UV Light. Color is a little more opaque than I would have liked, and is super thick.  Takes a few coated to get complete coverage unless you are looking for the opaque look.  Works great for decorating due to the fact that it levels slowly.  I will stick to more professional gels vs this stuff.</li>
    <li> The colors don&#x27;t really match up with the box.  Several of them look quite similar until you put them on and finish off with the top coat.  Will have to put the color on the cover in order to figure out what it looks like.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s came in a promptly manner and I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Positive points about the gel I recieved:&lt;br /&gt;-Good variety of color! Vibrants, pastel, and neon colors. Lots of choices&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect consistency for the job. I like to use it more as a thin gel almost shellac type on my nails. But its easy to work with and to apply to nails.&lt;br /&gt;-Amount for your money. The picture is good at showing the amount that you recieve in each pot. Just over 1/2, but its sure to last for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;-Cures and lasts. The light that I use isn&#x27;t the highest quality, but once I cure my nails for a total of 5 min, I am good to go! There is just a slight sticky layer after curing but is easily taken care of with some alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I would improve on:&lt;br /&gt;-Labeling the lids of the color. All of them simply had a number on the top but you dont know which color it is so I ended up having to make my own to avoid opening every lid.&lt;br /&gt;-Secure lids before shipping? I understand coming from China to the US can do some work to a package. My bottles were mostly clean except 2 that had spilt during shipping and handling.&lt;br /&gt;- The colors really were great, but my personal prefrence is not so many shades of red. Some are really close to being the same, I&#x27;d just prefer even more variety with the pastels instead of deep reds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all though I&#x27;m very happy with the product and for the price it is, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it! :)</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my product</li>
    <li> Best solid gel win win</li>
    <li> loys of pretty colors!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and its a good value but half of these leaked through their containers when I reveived them, now i have gel everywhere and those are a lot of little containers to clean up.</li>
    <li> Not happy that my shipment of gel was set and received upside down. Resulting in gel leaking everywhere and my money wasted. This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap and I dontt have money to waste like this. Maybe put a this side or end up sticker on the package.... :(</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cure in the UV lamp...</li>
    <li> LOOKING FORWARD TO USING THIS PRODUCT TO DO SOME ART ON MY DAUGHTERS NAILS. HOPE TO USE THEM REAL SOON</li>
