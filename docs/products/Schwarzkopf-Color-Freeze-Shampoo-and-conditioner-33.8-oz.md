      <li>It&#x27;s strange but when I comb the conditioner thru my hair &amp; rinse, it doesn&#x27;t feel soft</li>

    <li> Shampoo and conditioner texture seems not right like the one I used to used. Seems like it&#x27;s fake! But make my hair soft and smelled after washed. My husband love my hair smelled after shower. Lol</li>
    <li> Favorite of mine.  This is the good stuff at a great price.  I&#x27;ve gotten inferior product before just shopping by price, but this is what I expected and wanted.</li>
    <li> I just bought this tonight for the first time (at a retailer store) because my beautician recommended it to me for my colored hair,  and I absolutely love it!!  It makes my hair so shiny,  vibrant,  and healthy.  It really does  what it says.  It  protects my hair color, and it smells amazing too.  I am definitely buying this line/products in the future for my hair. I am in love!!!</li>
    <li> I like very much. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Product is great but description is misleading- there are no pumps that come with this which is a pain. It also doesn&#x27;t come as packaged- no bag. Just the shampoo. I ended up having to buy my own pumps which is a hassle. However, this product is wonderful and I highly recommend it. Just ask that Amazon verify the description.</li>
    <li> I cannot even run my fingers through my hair with this shampoo. I do not like this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product will order again</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I love the scent. It got to my door in a timely manner and it was packaged well. My son was using it and I tried it out. No sulfates and good for color treated hair. Buy it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shampoo and conditioner and it protected my color very well. I especially liked that it didn&#x27;t contain all the harsh chemicals found in some products.  The conditioner slightly weighed down my fine hair although styling aids resolved the problem.  The only negative for me is that the fragrance is a strong, heavy perfume type scent.  I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrance so I probably would not buy again but it is an excellent product otherwise.  I received the bag and pumps with my order.</li>
    <li> I wonder if it is the real product.  It burned our scalps and left dryness and scabs.</li>
    <li> great shampoo for color treated hair</li>
    <li> Arrived incomplete and damaged!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner set!</li>
    <li> Love their hair shampoo &amp; conditioning, I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.</li>
    <li> I would love this shampoo if it were more moisturizing. It seemed to dry my hair, and that&#x27;s just something I don&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the shampoo and the price!</li>
    <li> This Schwarzkopf BC new formula is awsome it smells great and makes your hair soft and shine plus its made my  Schwarzkopf cappuccino brown hair color last. I just love Schwarzkopf . They no what women want in a beauty products. Let Schwarzkopf make your day and make your hair have that wow effect.  I just love Schwarzkopf.</li>
    <li> Great smelling and makes hair color last longer!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s strange but when I comb the conditioner thru my hair &amp; rinse, it doesn&#x27;t feel soft BUT, my hair feels great! My color seems to stay nicer!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing....and great for the hair too!</li>
    <li> The product is fine but these were supposed to come with pumps and all I received in the bag were the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; portion.  Need better quality control on what goes out.</li>
    <li> Fashion shipping it smells really good good big bottles and it says no friends and I not quite sure yet but I like the way it feels on my hair</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel clean and so soft. Would highly recommend  it.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo conditioner. My first experience with Schwarzkopf was years ago. The products are always fantastic. I love this shampoo and conditioner. The fragrance is wonderful. But that is not what makes the product. Its how the hair feels after you wash and condition. Will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser used this product on my hair at my last visit, I was so impressed I looked on Amazon to see if they had it. WOW! What a GREAT Price! I paid for a small size of shampoo $18 and conditioner $22 at the shop. Crazy! My hair dresser when I told her what I paid said it&#x27;s most likely a watered down product not the real stuff from Schwarzkopf. OK......... This is a great product, the real stuff,  my hair  color lasted the entire almost 3 weeks before I returned  to have it touched up, lathers up nicely for a sulfite free shampoo.</li>
