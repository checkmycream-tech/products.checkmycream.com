      <li>nice pad for the knee</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>The price was most affordable.</li>
      <li>It is much better than ice packs.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product...instead of going back and forth to the freezer for ice packs</li>
      <li>Great product, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>so I kept a roll of transpore tape (avail at any drugstore or hosp)on hand to help secure the ends together when applying over top of the flannel pillowcase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I loved it so much I bought this just in case.</li>
      <li>My other one got a hole in it and this one seems to be working just great!</li>
      <li>They fall off easily and you have to keep refilling them.</li>
      <li>It is amazing how much it reduces the swelling and pain,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>so it was nice being able to ice both at the same time vs one at a time.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Started using less than 24hrs post surgery with immediate pain relief felt( more effective than the femeral nerve blocks I had for 2 days</li>
      <li>Its soft and adjustsble with velcro strsps for s comfortable fit.</li>
      <li>I have drained out the first one and hope it doesn&#x27;t get mildewed.</li>
      <li>This is a much more involved surgery than a regular replacement.</li>
      <li>Thanks a million!</li>
      <li>This knee pad has really helped in my recovery from my knee replacement!</li>
      <li>day.(Could not stand up my first postop day but was walking in</li>
      <li>If sleeping I would make sure I would keep cooling unit on low setting.</li>
      <li>The Ossur cold-chill unit is simple and useful but the pads are easily damaged and meant for one patient use (meaning one incident).  </li>
      <li>And I believe being able to ice both injuries at the same time vs icing 1 injury at a time really helped me reduce the amount of time I had to be hooked up to a machine.</li>
      <li>motor is quiet...lightweight easy to carry....if they ever attach a battery for mobile use I&#x27;d buy another one in a second..</li>
      <li>Great fit around the knee for post op cold therapy.</li>
      <li>It does what it says and works perfectly with my cold rush machine.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This has truly helped with my PT and works very well.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>When she tried to use it later for a friend the pad was full of mold</li>
      <li>and I was able to reduce my pain meds by half.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for anyone having knee surgery</li>
      <li>especially if up walking or sitting as it gives me so much comfort</li>
      <li>Ice is a vital part of the pain management.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend always wearing some clothing on your leg while using the pad because you dont want it to be directly against the knee.</li>
      <li>I recently had my hip, femur and knee replaced - all in one surgery - due to sarcoma (fortunately, they got all he cancer out).</li>
      <li>If you do then you need to keep that in mind when you order multiple pads or reuse older straps.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to apply and switch pad myself and disconnect when getting up.&lt;br /&gt;I placed the pad in a soft flannette pillow case which gave a protective insulating layer between pad and my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The two wide Velcro straps that come with pad were a little short</li>
      <li>The pad itself is on the large size so you will need to tuck the middle flaps in and lay the outer flaps on the outside to adjust it.  </li>
      <li>no extra duties charged when I received unit.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely made my post recovery time following total bilateral knee replacements so much quicker.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It provides a good coverage and constant flow of cold water around swollen knee to help reduce inflamed area.</li>
      <li>It really helps to keep the swelling down.</li>

<li> The combination of this very poorly designed pad that misses the areas of your knee that you need to ice, and the horrible ossur cold rush ice machine that you use it with is a waste of money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does what it says and works perfectly with my cold rush machine.  helped me through surgery several times.  Thanks</li>
    <li> It works just like it&#x27;s supposed to - provides a RUSH of icy-cold relief to a post-surgical knee!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful ice pack and machine. I have artificial knees and recently had to have one revised. This is a much more involved surgery than a regular replacement. Ice is a vital part of the pain management.  This product is fantastic. The system has two velcro bands that hold this pad in place no matter what position you put it in. It holds the pad correctly in place on your knee. The Ossur ice machine is invaluable for ice therapy for surgeries or injuries of all kinds.</li>
    <li> It provides a good coverage and constant flow of cold water around swollen knee to help reduce inflamed area. Thanks</li>
    <li> Please see my  other review on the device itself. I gave three stars because it should cove all the way around the knee. The hamstring muscles on the back of the knee are involved also after Total knee surgery.  Get the universal pad and save yourself some hassles.</li>
    <li> Love it.  This has truly helped with my PT and works very well.  The price was most affordable. Thanks a million!</li>
    <li> With all its bends this works extremely well on both my knee surgeries. VERY nice..</li>
    <li> The combination of this very poorly designed pad that misses the areas of your knee that you need to ice, and the horrible ossur cold rush ice machine that you use it with is a waste of money. Do not buy it!!</li>
    <li> Great fit around the knee for post op cold therapy. Its soft and adjustsble with velcro strsps for s comfortable fit.</li>
    <li> I got a machine when I had a knee replacement which came with a all purpose Pad. I loved it so much I bought this just in case. I have drained out the first one and hope it doesn&#x27;t get mildewed.</li>
    <li> I recently had my hip, femur and knee replaced - all in one surgery - due to sarcoma (fortunately, they got all he cancer out). My sister, who is a nurse, heard me complaining about how hard it was to keep ice packs on my knee. They fall off easily and you have to keep refilling them. She recommended I try the Ossur with the knee pad. Don&#x27;t tell her I said this, but that was brilliant! It&#x27;s a great product! It can be tightened to the extent that I want it and it never falls off. It gets - and stays- cold for up to about 6 hours, so I often use it when I&#x27;m sleeping. It really helps to keep the swelling down. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product, especially for those who have undergone a surgical knee procedure.</li>
    <li> The pad works well applying cold to the knee. But if you average size and have a swollen leg, the strap for the lower thigh, will cut off blood to the leg. It is 6 to 8 inches to short.</li>
    <li> Worked well after having meniscus repair. Helped keep swelling down and reduced pain. Highly recommend for anyone having knee surgery</li>
    <li> nice pad for the knee</li>
    <li> I like the Cold Rush pump unit, but this pad has a few too many problems. I would look elsewhere if you specifically need a knee pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Thin&lt;br /&gt;-Well constructed&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with two high-quality velcro straps&lt;br /&gt;-The entire back is felted so you can attach the velcro straps anywhere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The thin design comes with a serious trade-off: the pad creases easily and stops flowing&lt;br /&gt;-The inner corners are so close to the center hole that they frequently pinch off all flow&lt;br /&gt;-The pad only comes in one size (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10&amp;#34;, 180lbs, and it&#x27;s too small in my opinion)</li>
    <li> It works well but does not wrap around the knee like I had hoped.</li>
    <li> It was perfect for my ice machine. My other one got a hole in it and this one seems to be working just great! Thank goodness it came with all of the attachments and hose!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This knee pad has really helped in my recovery from my knee replacement! It is very comfortable and gets really cold to keep the swelling down. I would recommend always wearing some clothing on your leg while using the pad because you dont want it to be directly against the knee. It is much better than ice packs.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product...instead of going back and forth to the freezer for ice packs you have the convenience of a 4 hour ice treatment...motor is quiet...lightweight easy to carry....if they ever attach a battery for mobile use I&#x27;d buy another one in a second..you won&#x27;t be disappointed with your purchase..jim leblanc</li>
    <li> Recommended by friend who used shoulder pad following surgery and lent me the cooling unit .&lt;br /&gt;Only had to purchase knee pad. Took. approx 2.5-3wks regular shipping from Calif to Nova Scotia&lt;br /&gt;with no extra duties charged when I received unit.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely made my post recovery time following total bilateral knee replacements so much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Started using less than 24hrs post surgery with immediate pain relief felt( more effective than the femeral nerve blocks I had for 2 days post op).I would alternate the pad for 1.5-3 hr periods on each knee depending on if I was&lt;br /&gt;sleeping. If sleeping I would make sure I would keep cooling unit on low setting. Just had to ask Hosp staff to add&lt;br /&gt;ice to unit. Very easy to apply and switch pad myself and disconnect when getting up.&lt;br /&gt;I placed the pad in a soft flannette pillow case which gave a protective insulating layer between pad and my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The two wide Velcro straps that come with pad were a little short so I kept a roll of transpore tape (avail at any drugstore or hosp)on hand to help secure the ends together when applying over top of the flannel pillowcase.&lt;br /&gt;I left hospital on my 4th pistol day.(Could not stand up my first postop day but was walking in l&lt;br /&gt;hallway second day with walker after starting cooling unit. It is amazing how much it reduces the swelling and pain,&lt;br /&gt;I am now 7 days post op and use regularly at home. Usually don&#x27;t go longer than 2hrs before reapplying cooling&lt;br /&gt;pad especially if up walking or sitting as it gives me so much comfort and I was able to reduce my pain meds by half.</li>
    <li> less than 3 months and it leaked !!!! bad stuff</li>
    <li> The Ossur cold-chill unit is simple and useful but the pads are easily damaged and meant for one patient use (meaning one incident).  My daughter had knee surgery and found this chiller unit essential in her recovery.  It was expensive to buy so she kept it for later use.  When she tried to use it later for a friend the pad was full of mold (it&#x27;s almost impossible to get all the water out of it).  We tried to use bleach to kill the mold and rinse it out but this damaged the plastic so it leaked like a sieve.  We had to buy a new pad before it could be used again and they are not cheap - usually over 50USD but finally found one for 44 w/ shipping.  Still expensive for a disposable item but without this pad the rest of the unit is trash.  We will try to find a way to air dry pad internally after use before storing this time.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Perfect for knee rehab.</li>
    <li> I bought this to ice my knee and it does the job. The pad is made of good quality.  This is the 2nd knee pad I&#x27;ve purchased in the last 5 years so I wouldn&#x27;t say the pad last forever which is why I gave it 4 stars.  The knee pad I&#x27;m replacing was made by someone else so I don&#x27;t know how long this one will last.  I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for the last couple of weeks and it works well.  When I plug the pad into the machine it fills up with ice cold water and does what it&#x27;s suppose to.  The pad itself is on the large size so you will need to tuck the middle flaps in and lay the outer flaps on the outside to adjust it.  I saw someone had posted this as issue saying the ice cold water was not flowing inside pad due to bulking up.  I do NOT see this as issue.  The pad came with instructions however I&#x27;ve done this before so I didn&#x27;t bother to reading the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;My knee pad came with 2 velcro straps.  I also purchased the foot/ankle pad which they didn&#x27;t ship any velcro straps for (foot and ankle you need velcro staps for).  Since the velcro straps are removable you can transfer them from the knee pad to an ankle/foot pad.  If you have two ice pump machines, like I do,  I can in theory ice my foot/ankle and knee at the same time. I don&#x27;t think they thought someone would own/use multiple machines at the same time.  If you do then you need to keep that in mind when you order multiple pads or reuse older straps.  Years ago I hurt both my wrists so I had to ice both my wrists at the same time so it was nice being able to ice both at the same time vs one at a time.  And I believe being able to ice both injuries at the same time vs icing 1 injury at a time really helped me reduce the amount of time I had to be hooked up to a machine.</li>
