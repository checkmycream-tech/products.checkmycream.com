### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is also excellent for hair or scalp dryness.</li>
      <li>and he said it was excellent.</li>
      <li>The product itself is &#x27;so-so&#x27; at best.</li>
      <li>This is the best lotion we&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I must say that the product is great.  </li>
      <li>This product is a great product</li>
      <li>Admittedly, most of the ingredients are very good; however, the end product did not deliver.</li>
      <li>The ingredients listed are good, but it just doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do.</li>
      <li>No matter how good I thought their products were</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I will be adding mine to the others soon, however, I feel that something with greater ramification must be done!</li>
      <li>Now I use it because I love it!  </li>
      <li>I love the stuff !</li>
      <li>So, buy at your own risk: not a product that I would ever use or sell.....</li>
      <li>I can think of many, many charges he will be up against!</li>
      <li>- I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Many complaints have been made to the BBB.</li>
      <li>Tried this lotion in the store and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>and I love using it around my eyes and on my neck.</li>
      <li>Check Better Business Bureau before dealing with this product.</li>
      <li>It is not a moisturizing lotion like you would expect and is quite liquid, but sure does heal skin</li>
      <li>The order came with 12 unlabeled samples and they keep sending more products.</li>
      <li>and I love to use it.  </li>
      <li>Many scents can be added or get unscented if that&#x27;s what you need.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worked in the nutritional/holistic field for more than 20 years and there are many products that do a better job than their Healing Lotion.</li>
      <li>Then I ended up with even more product I didn&#x27;t order.  </li>
      <li>Before you order from Kathy&#x27;s Family or Tate&#x27;s read reviews from Better Business Bureau.</li>
      <li>Whether my \\&quot;Eczema\\&quot; was getting better on its own or whether Kathy&#x27;s was responsible I cannot say.  </li>
      <li>I am not an easy person to convince with this alternative stuff, but now use there body wash, soaps, solutions, etc.   </li>
      <li>Works to calm the itchiness and helps restore healthy skin.  </li>
      <li>However, my skin is now free of rashes, I use it every day, there is no \\&quot;greasy</li>
      <li>/&gt;Order was shipped and received ridiculously fast - I ordered it at 1 am and received it about 36 hours later - very impressed.</li>
      <li>I liked that it was natural, rubbed in easy and was not sticky with a light smell.</li>
      <li>then they want to send you a special offer.    </li>
      <li>Their products are only as good as their customer service.</li>
      <li>It states right on the label that it is great for nurses with dry hands.  </li>
      <li>Personally I could not be more pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I love these products and recommend them highly.  </li>
      <li>Gone are all the steroids and Elidel and for the first time in 5 months I can say I am not scratching and my skin is free of \\&quot;Eczema\\&quot;.    </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and some issues with most lotions.</li>
      <li>Will always have this on hand, worth the price.</li>
      <li>I recently suffered from some kind of \\&quot;allergy\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>It felt clean and gentle.</li>
      <li>and it is pretty true, before you use the lotion you should shake the bottle to make sure everything is mixed well.</li>
      <li>I feel that the lotion does a good job re-hydrating your skin, but the price is a little steep...</li>
      <li>I am now only taking a high dose anti-histamine at night and using these amazing products.  </li>
      <li>I started using this because it&#x27;s oil free and all natural.  </li>
      <li>It has the same address and ingredients, however this lotion costs a lot more money.</li>
      <li>They regularly call me to see if they can send me more, despite the fact that I have told them over and over and over and over and over and over again that I will NEVER buy their product and to stop calling me.</li>
      <li>Sure enough!</li>
      <li>I can see how the nurse that has to overwash was not pleased with it because it is NOT a heavy cream, but if you have any kind of sensitive skin or normally dry skin this product would be wonderful for you.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe the makers of this product claim it to be such a great product for \\&quot;severely dry skin\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>However it would be nice to see a complete breakdown of what is actually in their product.</li>
      <li>And even most really dry skin issues are addressed within seconds with this.</li>
      <li>My wife and her mom really like it.  </li>
      <li>all their product seems to be very nourishing for the skin.</li>
      <li>DO NOT GIVE ANY CREDIT INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THE COMPANY!!!</li>
      <li>DO NOT GIVE ANY CREDIT INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THE COMPANY!!!</li>
      <li>None of the ingredients are even natural!!!</li>
      <li>Many other products to choose from.  </li>
      <li>The only way you get to talk with a real person is when they keep calling you back to check and see if you need more products.</li>
      <li>They have tried many other products, which did not have the same positive results.  </li>
      <li>My wife is a licensed health professional, and she says this really works.</li>
      <li>It leaves no horrible residue or heavy smell.</li>
      <li>Being a nurse, I wash my hands many times an hour and my hands are so dry and cracked, especially during the winter.  </li>
      <li>When I went to reorder some for our dental office and gave them the office banking information I was told that Tate&#x27; s had just came out with a new toothpaste and wanted to send some samples.</li>
      <li>In addition, the names are completely fictitious!</li>
      <li>I have tried samples of both of their \\&quot;Family Recipes\\&quot; and they appear to be the EXACT SAME THING...</li>
      <li>So I sent back what I didn&#x27;t order, paid for product I didn&#x27;t want in the first shipment</li>
      <li>I must state that this is appears to be the same exact company as Tate&#x27;s The Natural Miracle Conditioner.</li>
      <li>Tate&#x27;s Natural Miracle claims to be a family business out of a home in Ohio?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in the nutrition business and received this product direct from the manufacturer, even though I never ordered it.</li>
      <li>The all natural ingredients are truly just that, all natural.  </li>
      <li>This seems like odd lotion at first but even though it takes quite a bit to really saturate your skin it works wonders for me.</li>
      <li>It sinks right in with no slime.</li>
      <li>the past years, I have spent more money on this company&#x27;s products than I care to admit.</li>
      <li>It is not a thick and heavy lotion and absorbs in your skin really well.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much money on this......</li>
      <li>I have stated it in every manner possible (from &#x27;sweet as pie&#x27; to rude), yet they continue to call (from a line that is designated as &#x27;private&#x27; by caller ID).</li>

<li> Just not a good way to run a business.</li>

<li> Nothing worked and my rash got worse.    </li>
<li> I&#x27;m terrified about what chemicals I have been putting on my body for the past 3 years!!!</li>
<li> Additionally, I find it difficult to trust a company that does not have a valid email address and never answers the phone.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had horrible skin my ENTIRE life.</li>
<li> I had horrible, painful eczema on my hands for about 6 years, my mom bought this for me to try and after using it for about 2 weeks, it was completely healed.  </li>
<li> Well, I am sorely disappointed with this product.  </li>
<li> Something is very, VERY wrong here!</li>
<li> Very bad business</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product was recommended to me to use with the HCG diet.  Being a nurse, I wash my hands many times an hour and my hands are so dry and cracked, especially during the winter.  It states right on the label that it is great for nurses with dry hands.  Well, I am sorely disappointed with this product.  The moisture lasts about 2 minutes and the cracking and bleeding has never healed after several weeks of use.  I can&#x27;t believe the makers of this product claim it to be such a great product for \\&quot;severely dry skin\\&quot;.  Are you kidding?  I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much money on this......</li>
    <li> I recently suffered from some kind of \\&quot;allergy\\&quot;.  I am a doctor, not a believer in \\&quot;holistic\\&quot; or any \\&quot;natural\\&quot; treatments.  I was diagnosed with \\&quot;Eczema\\&quot; had multiple biopsies, put on all types of steroids and Elidel.  Nothing worked and my rash got worse.    I gave up on steroids, Elidel and by accident found \\&quot;Kathy&#x27;s\\&quot;.  I must say that the product is great.  Whether my \\&quot;Eczema\\&quot; was getting better on its own or whether Kathy&#x27;s was responsible I cannot say.  However, my skin is now free of rashes, I use it every day, there is no \\&quot;greasy feel\\&quot; like from Cetaphil and all is well.    I love these products and recommend them highly.  I am now only taking a high dose anti-histamine at night and using these amazing products.  It is simple to apply and after letting your skin soak up the product, you would never know it was there.  Gone are all the steroids and Elidel and for the first time in 5 months I can say I am not scratching and my skin is free of \\&quot;Eczema\\&quot;.    I am not an easy person to convince with this alternative stuff, but now use there body wash, soaps, solutions, etc.   It does work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible skin my ENTIRE life. Little did I know I was making it worse with chemicals. I discovered this lotion at a local nutrition store on sample at the counter. As soon as I felt it I had to buy a bottle, tho I was not there for lotion and it is pricier that the lotions I&#x27;d tried in the past. It felt clean and gentle. It leaves no horrible residue or heavy smell. I have itchy rashy arms, the small red almost acne looking bumps that were never successfully treated and this stuff does the trick. It also helps with bikini line shaving bumps and I love using it around my eyes and on my neck. I can see how the nurse that has to overwash was not pleased with it because it is NOT a heavy cream, but if you have any kind of sensitive skin or normally dry skin this product would be wonderful for you. A friend of mine also used it on hemorrhoids and he said it was excellent. Personally I could not be more pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I was given several of the Kathy&#x27;s Family Products and found all to be disappointing. Admittedly, most of the ingredients are very good; however, the end product did not deliver. I&#x27;ve worked in the nutritional/holistic field for more than 20 years and there are many products that do a better job than their Healing Lotion. Additionally, I find it difficult to trust a company that does not have a valid email address and never answers the phone. I&#x27;ve tried contacting them on several occasions and their customer service is non-existent.</li>
    <li> Before you order from Kathy&#x27;s Family or Tate&#x27;s read reviews from Better Business Bureau. I have used products from both companies they are the same. I started using the healing lotion for dry sentive skin. I liked that it was natural, rubbed in easy and was not sticky with a light smell. When I went to reorder some for our dental office and gave them the office banking information I was told that Tate&#x27; s had just came out with a new toothpaste and wanted to send some samples. The order came with 12 unlabeled samples and they keep sending more products. I could not get any information when I tried to return the unordered products. Our bank account was charged $1500 in one week for products I did not order. Their products are only as good as their customer service. The only way you get to talk with a real person is when they keep calling you back to check and see if you need more products. Even when you tell them NO! then they want to send you a special offer.    They call from a diffrent number so I can&#x27;t use caller ID. No matter how good I thought their products were I will NEVER ORDER FROM from them (Tate&#x27; s / Kathy&#x27;s Family) again. Please don&#x27;t let them have any banking information they WILL RIP YOU OFF.</li>
    <li> Tried this lotion in the store and fell in love with it. Will always have this on hand, worth the price.</li>
    <li> I had horrible, painful eczema on my hands for about 6 years, my mom bought this for me to try and after using it for about 2 weeks, it was completely healed.  I had tried everything and nothing helped until this product - I love this stuff.  It is not a moisturizing lotion like you would expect and is quite liquid, but sure does heal skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order was shipped and received ridiculously fast - I ordered it at 1 am and received it about 36 hours later - very impressed.</li>
    <li> I like it. My skin looked healthier. It is also excellent for hair or scalp dryness. Hair looks and feels healthier.</li>
    <li> Before I say anything else I must state that this is appears to be the same exact company as Tate&#x27;s The Natural Miracle Conditioner. The two companies share the same address, only their names and phone numbers differ. I have tried samples of both of their \\&quot;Family Recipes\\&quot; and they appear to be the EXACT SAME THING...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all their product seems to be very nourishing for the skin. However it would be nice to see a complete breakdown of what is actually in their product. I read another review about how watery their product is and it is pretty true, before you use the lotion you should shake the bottle to make sure everything is mixed well. I feel that the lotion does a good job re-hydrating your skin, but the price is a little steep... And the fact that there is another \\&quot;family owned company\\&quot; that shares the same street address and puts out a product that is indistinguishable to the naked eye is a little concerning.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is not a thick and heavy lotion and absorbs in your skin really well.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and some issues with most lotions. This seems like odd lotion at first but even though it takes quite a bit to really saturate your skin it works wonders for me. And even most really dry skin issues are addressed within seconds with this. I also use it on my face. Since you can even eat this lotion you need not worry about it being toxic. I like that also!</li>
    <li> I started using this because it&#x27;s oil free and all natural.  Now I use it because I love it!  Many other products to choose from.  Many scents can be added or get unscented if that&#x27;s what you need.  Hypoallergenic and developed by people who work hard out in the elements.</li>
    <li> My wife and her mom really like it.  They have tried many other products, which did not have the same positive results.  Works to calm the itchiness and helps restore healthy skin.  My wife is a licensed health professional, and she says this really works.</li>
    <li> This is my third container. I love the stuff ! It sinks right in with no slime. Makes skin feel goooooood!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the nutrition business and received this product direct from the manufacturer, even though I never ordered it. The product itself is &#x27;so-so&#x27; at best. The ingredients listed are good, but it just doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do. But even worse is the company itself. They regularly call me to see if they can send me more, despite the fact that I have told them over and over and over and over and over and over again that I will NEVER buy their product and to stop calling me. I have stated it in every manner possible (from &#x27;sweet as pie&#x27; to rude), yet they continue to call (from a line that is designated as &#x27;private&#x27; by caller ID). So, buy at your own risk: not a product that I would ever use or sell.....and you&#x27;ll probably get bombarded forever with unwanted solicitations.</li>
    <li> This product was advertised for people with severe skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis, however this product did nothing to help my skin. I paid $39.98 for a 16.5 fl. Oz bottle at my local health food store. While this product did not irritate my skin, there was absolutely no change in my skin. I contacted the company twice by email, and neither one of my emails were returned. Also, I believe that this is the same product as the Tate&#x27;s Miracle conditioner. It has the same address and ingredients, however this lotion costs a lot more money. I would not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! DO NOT GIVE ANY CREDIT INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THE COMPANY!!! IT IS A FRAUD!!!&lt;br /&gt;Over the past years, I have spent more money on this company&#x27;s products than I care to admit. It wasn&#x27;t until I saw the recent reviews today that I even considered there might be a problem. I just googled their location and it came up as a place called Dura-Bilt Drapery &amp; Upholstery. Another reviewer said it is also the location for Kathy&#x27;s Family. Sure enough! Tate&#x27;s Natural Miracle claims to be a family business out of a home in Ohio? A home surrounded by nature and all the ingredients used in making this product? NOT! Something is very, VERY wrong here! In addition, the names are completely fictitious! No records can be found. I also googled the phone number and it came up on 800notes. There are comments on there from PAST EMPLOYEES! They say the \\&quot;owner\\&quot; is broke, a crook, and a slimeball. None of the ingredients are even natural!!! There is also an owner name given, but I couldn&#x27;t find records. Many complaints have been made to the BBB. I will be adding mine to the others soon, however, I feel that something with greater ramification must be done! This is unexceptionable, immoral, and against the law! I&#x27;m terrified about what chemicals I have been putting on my body for the past 3 years!!! A lawsuit is hopefully in this guy&#x27;s future. I can think of many, many charges he will be up against! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! DO NOT GIVE ANY CREDIT INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THE COMPANY!!! IT IS A FRAUD!!!</li>
    <li> This product is a great product and I love to use it.  The all natural ingredients are truly just that, all natural.  However, when working with the people in ordering the product, I have run into quite a few problems.  I&#x27;ve been sent product I didn&#x27;t ask for and when I was billed for it, all I could do was leave a message and wait for someone to get back to me in regards what to do with the extra product.  After a week or longer, they called back and I thought I had everything figured out.  Then I ended up with even more product I didn&#x27;t order.  So I sent back what I didn&#x27;t order, paid for product I didn&#x27;t want in the first shipment and I have now again received another invoice.  Just not a good way to run a business.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion we&#x27;ve ever used. No smelly chemicals and no greasy residue.</li>
    <li> Check Better Business Bureau before dealing with this product. Product is watery and does not moisturize for a long time. Listed as organic but it is not. Very bad business practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
