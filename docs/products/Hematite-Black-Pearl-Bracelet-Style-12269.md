<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Got this because i liked how it looked. First time wearing it, within five minutes it started to rip my hair on my wrist. Very painful. Never wore it again.</li>
    <li> I wear it all the time. It helps so much to kept my thumb from hurting when I&#x27;m working all day.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product it&#x27;s a very nice bracelet made of good quality, it fits my arm perfectly!! I love my Hematite bracelet!!!</li>
    <li> Love this bracelet great value very pleased with this purchase will buy more and will recommend to others for sure</li>
    <li> My wife uses these bracelets and neckless. for arithiritis and she swears they do what they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Attractive and Effective. I enjoy wearing these bracelets notice the stiffness and pain in my hands has diminished...plus I just seem to be relaxed overall.</li>
    <li> This bracelet is nice quality and it&#x27;s light weight. It looks great on a woman or a man. It got to my house quickly and in great shape. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the speed of how fast they got to object out. I had it 3 days before it said it was going to arrive. WIll deffantly shop with them again.</li>
    <li> I would have gave it 5 stars however the lifetime of the elastic is not the greatest but other than that it seems great. Bought it for my father and he says its amazing and the aches and pains in his wrists and hands are nearly gone. So even with the short lifetime for price this product is worth it.</li>
    <li> I love theses braclets.</li>
    <li> It broke the first time I wore it</li>
    <li> Got this for my uncle great fit</li>
    <li> This bracelet is fun to wear, plus helps the pain in my hands. And blood pressure is down. I bought one for my mom and she wears it and likes it also.</li>
    <li> Poor stretch bands. Loved the look and feel but it fell apart not long after I bought it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000KE40ZW Wide Hematite Powerful Magnetic Bracelet for Arthritis Pain Releif or for Sports Related Therapy]]  Wore it a couple days and the elastic broke spreading black pearls everywhere.  Don&#x27;t buy this item.</li>
    <li> I love hematite and this bracelet is just the way it looks onscreen.  It arrived right away.  I wear it every day and get lots of compliments on it.  I have a small wrist but it could easily fit a much larger wrist.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the therapeutic properties of Hematite (I have a chronically sore wrist). Can&#x27;t wear for very long as it is too small and digs into my wrist. After wearing for two to three hours, when I remove the thing, there are indentations left on my wrist. I have small wrists for a guy (7\\&quot;) and it still does this.  They could have made the thing a little bigger and not so tight.  The elastic that holds the thing together is pretty flimsy as well. I don&#x27;t think will last that long.</li>
    <li> I loved this but the string that made the bracelet broke and I had to throw it away just make sure if you by one your really gentle with it it&#x27;s not as tuff as it looks.</li>
    <li> Product contains virtually NO magnets.  It is of no use to those looking for magnetic therapy for whatever purpose.  Do your homework.  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did!</li>
    <li> Was given to me as a gift. Big and bulky. Nothing like I would usually wear. Very masculine. Looked ugly on my tiny wrist. Anyways my review is totally based on personal opinion. It seemed well-made and sturdy, just as pictured. Good quality bracelet if that is your style. I just wish it was something I actually liked. :(</li>
    <li> I had no problem with my bracelet, it came fast and there was nothing wrong with the item at all.</li>
    <li> Nice polished stones. Looks good with any black or grey outfit. But Not Magnetic.   The Description does not say it is, but it looks exactly like the ones that are magnetic.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself initially. Not really sure if it helps with aches and pains from arthritis, but really can accent your style.</li>
    <li> This is a nice looking bracelet. It&#x27;s very inexpensive. I&#x27;ve had it for a month now and can&#x27;t vouch for any health benefits from its magnetic qualities.</li>
    <li> I herd about this type of bracelet from a friend and was curious on how it worked so I ordered one.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I found this bracelet to work very well as a stylish bracelet and pain reliever. with in two days I started to notice the difference, i felt more energized and rested, but sometimes it makes my arm tingly so i take it off. It also helps me sleep. some people react differently to the bracelet so you might not notice the effect at first i didn&#x27;t and was upset but im telling you wear it for more then two days! its awwwsome. as for arthritis i dont know if it helps because i dont have arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  bottom line I like it and plan on buying some more for my mother and father.</li>
    <li> This bracelet is nice looking,easy to wear, and really works if you have back problems. The magnets are strong and the bracelet may have to be worn at intervals.</li>
    <li> I bought this bracelet as a fun gift for my teenaged son. Don&#x27;t know about any of the medicinal qualities, but my boy sure likes the bracelet; it looks great on him. Only negative comment is that his arm hairs get caught between the magnets!</li>
    <li> Very good looking bracelet.  Don&#x27;t know if it works for whatever purpose it is for because I have an iRenew bracelet on also.  Shipping time was great and merchandise was not damaged.</li>
    <li> My son really liked this bracelet,  BUT it broke very soon after he started wearing it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Hoped that it would help, like a magnetic braclet. Wrong pinched my wrist, no relief at all. Eye appealing if that what you are looking for. In Summary \\&quot;crap\\&quot; shame on me, for not spending more. Now I Have to pay shipping again.. For the real thing..Magnetic titanium Bracelet....Merry Christmas to all.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because I like way Hematite&#x27;s looks and although I am not sure of its medical benefits, it is a very good looking bracelet.  It fits well and I have small wrists.</li>
    <li> This bracelet is nice. I wish it would have been a little thinner but over all I am satified with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loved it and says it works very well as far a healing.  I don&#x27;t know what that means but she likes it lol.</li>
    <li> Not bad, looks cool and if you&#x27;re looking for a blk bracelett,this is the one. Runs a little small though.</li>
    <li> Items look as attractive as $25.00 similar item.  I have received numerous compliments on the appearance, which tickles me for a $5 investment.  The seller shipped the item quickly and communicated well.  Good buy as usual, on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is a solid bracelet that fits great and looks very masculine. I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase and others seem to like it also.  It&#x27;s gotten a little loose on me as I&#x27;ve been slowly losing weight so I don&#x27;t think it is truly \\&quot;One size fits all\\&quot;. If you think you have very skinny wrists, it may be a problem.  The polish on the hematite isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s close enough that you will be the only one who notices any imperfections. I expect the stretchy string to break at the knots in a year or two of daily wear, just by looking at it. But that&#x27;s just a gut feeling - I don&#x27;t have any evidence - and most of us will be wearing something else before then, anyway.  I&#x27;m a skeptic and don&#x27;t believe the arthritis stuff, so that won&#x27;t factor into my review. Besides, I don&#x27;t see anything about \\&quot;healing powers\\&quot; on the product page.</li>
    <li> These bracelets seem to be made well, although they seem a little big, but  a good price and they are attractive.</li>
    <li> The bracelet is very nice looking. the stretchy stuff seems sturdy. The bracelet beads look like hematite. It&#x27;s as heavy as a man&#x27;s plain chain-link bracelet, but not uncomfortable. I&#x27;d buy it again. And the PRICE is FANTASTIC.</li>
    <li> This item uses stretchy elastic not thin stretchy cord, so it&#x27;s better suited for my older mother whose skin is more fragile. She cannot tolerate anything tight on her wrist. This is perfect for her. She has a larger wrist than I do. Hers is about an 8 inch and mine more a 7 inch. I prefer the stretchy cord. It fits snugger.&lt;br /&gt;I also like this bracelet because it does not have a top or bottom - back or front - if you will. All the beads are shaped the same - not flat on one side and barrel on the other. The round beads between are, of-course, round. Wears with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable for my mother.</li>
    <li> This bracelet is beautiful, and well made.  It fits perfectly on my wrist.  The texture is rich, and the item looks like it is worth more than I paid for it.  I am very happy with this purchase, I already have something like it with white pearls, now I have it with the black pearls, it gives a totally different look with the darker pearls, but just as pretty.</li>
    <li> I bought 5 of this bracelets and the first one I tried on broke after two trials. Maybe I pulled rubber much to put it on my rest. Well I bought the rest for friends as gift and told them to wear carefully and not to pull rubber much. Cool thing is that its magnetic ;)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this does an amazing job controlling arthritis pain. I never take it off!</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels.  Very smooth surface and really comfortable to wear.  I like the design and receive compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken.  Never worn.  Very cheap and you get what you pay for.  Save the money and place it toward shipping on a quality item.</li>
    <li> I have small wrists but never had any trouble buying hematite bracelets that fit, normally the saints bracelets. But in order to protect the saints from falling off my other bracelets and wasting money I decided to buy this to wear casually. This bracelet, for me, had one hematite stone too many, since I like my bracelets to fit tightly on my wrist to minimize movement. Because of that I had to take a stone out and restring the bracelet in order to make i fit the way I wanted. It&#x27;s not an expensive item, so the extra work I put in is not an issue. The only thing is, if you don&#x27;t have a craft background or ability, you may not be happy with your purchase.</li>
    <li> The elastic on which it was strung  was frayed &amp; sticking out in 1 spot, but for the price, it was ok.</li>
    <li> I love the bracelet. I has another piece of hematite jewelry, a ring. Just a warning to all who purchase this kind of jewelry. DO NOT drop the piece on a ceramic tile and concrete type floor as the stones will break. My ring split in 2 pieces and really flew around the room. I am hoping I can fix it but I thought customers should know the stones can break when dropped. I will be VERY VERY careful with the rest of my pieces.</li>
    <li> nice stopped the pain...</li>
    <li> These splendidly crafted ornamental jewelries might not suck your blood, but if they do, put a sticker on your shoulder, a Zombie Outbreak Response Team Green Skull Vinyl Decal Sticker, but get the Bracelet&#x27;s first cause they are in limited supply.  A bracelet that is out of this world.  Gobble em up why you can, they won&#x27;t be around long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Jersey Devil</li>
    <li> This is a good quality bracelet that look pretty on my arm. I had a hermite necklace that needed a bracelet and this bracelet goes well with it.</li>
    <li> Very nice looking, but very fragile and break easy.  The sting that holds the pieces needs to be stinger and larger.</li>
    <li> I like this very much, in fact, I got two of them.  I wear them every day.  I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> She likes it for tendon pain at her wrist and thumb. Says it does help relieve some.&lt;br /&gt;I order this one and The sport bracelet and found them to be the same thing. Called the seller and was told they are the same product just a different description.</li>
    <li> I love hematite and i have no idea why but a bracelet like this is perfect for man or woman. It was a great price and delivery.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t neatly done but for the price don&#x27;t expect it to be. Over all an ok buy just for the look...</li>
    <li> Arrived just as pictured.  Unfortunately the elastic holding together broke.  Too small for my manly wrist.  Thanks for the great service.</li>
    <li> This is better than physical therapy! My wrist feels great every time I wear it. Also it looks very trendy and it does not scratch.</li>
    <li> I had severe wrist pain and moderate forearm pain. I wore this bracelet for two weeks and slowly noticed the pain subsiding. I don&#x27;t have pain any longer unless I remove the bracelet for 2 days, then the pain returns. I am pleased with this item, it was shipped quickly. Go to a crafts store and buy some extra elastic stringing as in time, the elastic will break.</li>
    <li> although this product looks very nice it does&#x27;nt do what i hoped it would do for me. advertised to help arthritis, it seems to do nothing of the sort. too bad that i intend to believe anything. if you just like the looks, it is very nice.</li>
    <li> Its a very cool bracelet however i wore it 2 twice and its falling apart. first one of the stone got chip on the corners and second on the stones whole top came right off.</li>
    <li> Just like in the picture!  It&#x27;s beautiful and I get complements on it.  What a bargain!  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp; Service!</li>
    <li> I like the way it looks but it does not fit my arm they should always say how many inches something is</li>
    <li> I love this bracelet so much. It goes with everything and the magnetic properties of the hematite are awesome. Word to the wise, though;  hematite is very brittle, so be gentle with it.  It does break easily.</li>
    <li> This is actually a stunning piece, however as other customers have commented the hematite is soft. One of my pieces is cracked already. I still like the bracelet and would pay double if a stronger material. Truly its not the sellers fault. Hematite is not a strong stone naturally. I had a ring and it broke shortly after purchase and it cost more than this bracelet. The stone needs reinforcement when set in jewelry. So its certainly priced low and adorable. It will however not last long (as for the 4 instead of 5 stars).</li>
    <li> I had only had this bracket less than a week and was setting at a party when it broke. Elastic holding it together poor quality.</li>
    <li> Nice Heavy piece.  Love the mixture of the pearl and hematite.  Looks great for day or night wear</li>
    <li> it fell and broke i want a refund full and i slip on it never buying again ok gift warehouse</li>
    <li> I purchased this bracelet because I had a hand injury years ago and it started to act up again. Probably arthritis forming but I don&#x27;t want to start taking medicine or do surgery. I looked at other reviews and it does work.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband, but way to tight....very nicely made and stylish enough for a lady, so I plan to keep it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Inexpensive AND effective! I have RA and I&#x27;m a cashier at a grocery store. All the repetitive motion I do really hurts my joints. But since wearing the bracelet, my pain has greatly subsided. A deffinite for arthritis sufferers!</li>
    <li> I do like it.  Dont know if it works or not, probably doesn&#x27;t but it looks ok.  I would have give it five stars had the beads been a little smaller.</li>
    <li> My hematite magnetic bracelet arrived today, one day sooner than expected which is a good thing. The early arrival is the only reason this product got an extra star, I would have only given it 2 stars, not 3, but the early arrival helped saved its rating. I know the old adage \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; and I guess I will have to learn to deal with that in regards to this bracelet. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s attractive, very masculine and has an awesome color. But the quality of it all, it would have been nice for them to put a couple more hematite pieces onto the bracelet. I&#x27;m not a very big guy, my family jokes about my girl looking wrists all the time. But even with my petite wrists the black stretchy bands that make up the bracelet are showing. I have like a half inch gap of missing material, meaning a half an inch of my skin and those two black cords are showing! It would have been great for them to put at least two more of those block shaped pieces and maybe 4 more pearls into the bracelet, then I wouldn&#x27;t have this embarrassing gap on the back side of the bracelet. Oh well, I will wear it from time to time, but not as many times as I was was planning to before making this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If you got big wrists, this bracelet may not be for you, choose another one from Amazon.com, maybe one this is bigger!)</li>
    <li> This bracelet looks great and was available at the right price.  It&#x27;s a little on the snug size.  I have very small wrists and it&#x27;s barely big enough for me.</li>
    <li> My son loved it.  Great price. It was a Christmas present.  He wears it constantly.  I would recommend this purchase. Good quality. Good value. Everyone is happy!</li>
    <li> Great product. Has really helped my strength, flexibility and attitude. I do not know if it will work for you but since I have started wearing this bracelet, I have played the best golf I have ever played in my life!</li>
    <li> Good stretch bracelet for those that like the feel of a smooth heavy metal feeling bracelet. Tie off can be improved</li>
    <li> The hematite is smooth and nice but I have a small wrist, and this looks pretty awful on it.  Just too big and clunky.  It might look better on a larger wrist.  Plus, I have to say I was on vacation and came across a whole barrel of the exact same bracelet in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown...selling for $2, so I feel like a chump.</li>
    <li> I like this bracelet. The only semi-negative thing I can say is that it is a little heavy on my delicate wrist, It fits nicely though and works as well as my sporty looking magnet bracelet. It helps my arthritis and helps with balance too,  Of course the price is right too. Only $2.77 before shipping costs. Not bad. I wish everyone knew about magnetic bracelets.</li>
    <li> While the bracelet arrived on time, after only 3 days of wearing, one of the elastic bands broke and I just trashed it after this.</li>
    <li> This was delivered with a huge chip in it.  It looks like it would be a great product but the chip is so big it is not wearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted if a piece was in the package I would assume it broke during transport but it was empty, so it was obviously shipped to me purposely.  The chip is huge so I can&#x27;t see how it would have been missed.  It came in a black cloth bag, so maybe they just grabbed the bag to ship it?  The broken piece was also not in the bag however.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do to much to help, but honestly my wife doesn&#x27;t wear bracelets and may not have given it a fair chance</li>
    <li> Love mine!  I wear it all the time!</li>
    <li> i love this bracelet. i have one and bought several others for friends. it looks great and the craftsmanship is perfect too. i wear it pretty much everyday and it&#x27;s the perfect touch!</li>
    <li> A Nice Gift For A Younger Man. It&#x27;s Dressy but Also Casual. it&#x27;s Very Easy To Clean. i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Since using this product, I have noticed a difference in the way I feel and little aches and pains have eased or gone.  Easy to wear and looks good with almost anything.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 13yr old son for his birthday.  He absolutely loves it.  It is sturdy and quite an eye catcher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my brother whom loves Hematite items. I got this for a gift for him and he really liked this collection.</li>
    <li> This item is sooo &#x27;rich&#x27; in appearance. I love it. I feel &#x27;wealthy&#x27; on a limited budget. It is definitely worth the $$$. It looks nice with casual attire yet it stands out with a really dressy outfit. Very nice item.</li>
    <li> these are very neat expandable and eye catching, it&#x27;s not over the top screaming &amp;#34;look at me&amp;#34; it&#x27;s classy and subtle.</li>
    <li> Have not seen or felt the &amp;#34;relief&amp;#34; that I have felt with other bracelets.  I feel nothing with this. ??</li>
    <li> This bracelet is a little magnetic and it is seriously distracting. Other things I like about this bracelet are that it is nice and heavy, and it&#x27;s hard to make it look bad because even if it gets scraped or something, there&#x27;s more black metal underneath. It will always look clean and well taken care of. The thing I don&#x27;t like is that it pinches arm hair because of the elastic that holds it together. Quick solution: turn it inside out. It looks almost the same if the rounded edges are facing inward but it is much more comfortable! Still distracting, because magnets work on that side too.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought it is a matching gift for my father and I...Now I am debating on what to do with his gifts..</li>
    <li> I received this Hematite Black Pearl Bracelet much quicker than the anticipated date.  It looked exactly like the picture, so no surprises there.  I wasn&#x27;t really \\&quot;sold\\&quot; on the idea that it would work, but to my amazement, I put this bracelet on and felt relief almost instantaniously.  I was shocked, and the next day when I woke up, I hadn&#x27;t felt that good in Months.  It really is amazing to me that this bracelet helped my joint pain, and all over discomfort.  I&#x27;m Not saying it took every ache and pain I have away, But the relief it has given me is remarkable.  I plan to order a couple more to give away as gifts, to my loved ones.  I would definately recommend to all to give it a try.[[ASIN:B000XRR7N8 Hematite Black Pearl Bracelet - Style 12269]]</li>
    <li> This is great, it looks nice and feels nice on the wrist. I had on before that broke but this one is so much nicer. Good deal.</li>
    <li> was a little tight fit a first, but for the price, I really like this bracelet, and I wear it often, so far, no breakage, and after stretching a bit, wears comfortably.</li>
    <li> They were late upon arrival, but are a good product. Fit well and have good energy. Good price for bracelets..</li>
    <li> Its a ok product. Didn&#x27;t really had a chance to wear it for long time. Can&#x27;t say much about it.</li>
    <li> wear it all the time and it really works. this one has good skin contact as well. like it a lot</li>
    <li> This bracelet was definitely made for a smaller sized man.  Although the product looked nice, it was just too small and I ended up giving it to my kids to play with.  One more link would have made the difference.</li>
    <li> it replaces another hematite bracelet that was broken.  Very comfortable and looks nice.</li>
    <li> Well made item and has held up well with everyday use.  Can&#x27;t sat for sure if it really works but I think it has.  Looks good too!</li>
    <li> It comes very small. Although it says it is one size, it seems much smaller. Not worth for the price and the wait.</li>
    <li> Perfect looks nice easy and easy off!! definitely notice a difference when its off and arthritis has been less painful</li>
    <li> I bought for myself and it look just like the picture, unique and interesting. I nice&lt;br /&gt;fashion look for something different thats made for a guy!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife and she just loves it. She also likes that it is &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; so it stands out as different.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a magnetic bracelet and this on looked JUST like them, but it was the cheapest one and there was no shipping fee. Lol turns out its plastic and not magnetic!  Be careful when buying products and make sure it is what you are looking for</li>
    <li> Really can&#x27;t tell that big of a difference.  Was hoping for better balance.  Don&#x27;t know if I would recommend or not.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who has a lot of ache and pains because he does a lot of physical work.....he wore it to bed has not taken it off, and he said he has not been hurting in his shoulder and even his back.  He use to take Bayer Back And Body pain pills constantly...hasn&#x27;t taken one since...Very strange....but something sure worked!  lol  thanks!</li>
    <li> nice beads but string breaks in 2 months</li>
    <li> I work if an office all day, so after long day of using the mouse I would get a slight pain in my wrist that would bother me a bit. I picked up this item just wanting to give it a try and was very surprised in the results. The pain almost instantly stopped why I wore this on my wrist on my right hand. Wear it every day!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this bracelet is not very sturdy.  It broke the very first time I wore it.  It is a beautiful looking bracelet, but not at all durable.  Not only did one of the links break immediately, but the elastic stretched out immediately.  I would not recommend this purchase.  I am a firm believer of the magnet bracelets, but I was not able to wear it long enough to say if this particular one would work.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the product delivery. But....here is MY Cons story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my friends and his wife are wearing the hemetite magnetic band for over 3 months and he told me that feels better than before, so I purchased one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started wearing the band on my right wrist on a Thursday (10 days ago from today) and removed the band on Saturday, because I started getting body aches on Friday and slowly by the night of Friday I had severe headache and intensified by Saturday morning, I realized that this band could be the reason and I removed on Saturday evening and was back to normal by Sunday. By the way I was sleeping East-West, head on east.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why it happened to me and if there is a prerequisite for wearing,</li>
    <li> Grwat value. Wife believes in them,  and if you do this is the right bracelet. She is tiny and thisbisvte first bracelet that ever fit her. Feels strong and is heavy. So far so good !</li>
    <li> It came and its a gift</li>
    <li> Very good cheap magnet. try these before you buy the more expensive ones. because if these give you any relief at all than buy the more expensive one. You will want to look for 3,000 goss or higher for the best results.</li>
    <li> A little ugly and not sure how well its serve it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> I have a small wrist and this fits perfectly.  A great value&lt;br /&gt;and it looks great with a black and white outfit.</li>
    <li> This is going to be a nice gift, I ordered two and I like them. They are just as the picture looks!! :-)</li>
    <li> Got this for my eleven year old son.  He thinks it&#x27;s so cool!  It really does look good on him.  Great gift for tweens/teens.</li>
    <li> I actually liked this</li>
    <li> I am not sure if its the bracelet or my stopping all medications that have made my joint pain go away.  It is a nice looking bracelet and feels good to werar.  The shipment was very fast.  I would purchase from the seller again.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> the bracelet was uneven, defective - should not have been sent to me. I did not return it because the shippeing would have cost me what I paid for it if not more. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I wish the knot wasn&#x27;t showing between the links so soon but it is what it is. I really like it. Good price too.</li>
    <li> Love this product. fast shipping and great quality. looks great The deep blue of the bracelet match with the ring that I bought with this item.Thank you</li>
    <li> I wear it everyday.It fits my wrist just right.also like the color,and the great price .I would recommend it to .</li>
    <li> I wear my bracelet to relieve pain in my hands and fingers.&lt;br /&gt;This helps so much.  The size was just right.</li>
    <li> Not a great deal. For the price is just ok, kinda heavy though since I was expecting something a little bit lighter.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Grandson will feel good wearing this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an interesting bracelet, I like it, except I ran into a small issue, I&#x27;m a rather large guy, 220 lbs or so? It didn&#x27;t fit on my wrist too well without digging into my skin enough. Not enough to hurt, just noticeable enough, I gave it to a friend instead. They loved it, heck they won&#x27;t stop talking about it. My friend says he always gets people asking about it, it&#x27;s interesting enough to get attention apparently,if that&#x27;s your thing, go ahead and pick this up :D</li>
    <li> A little mix up with the mail but definitely worth the wait. Beautiful and fits like a glove on me.</li>
    <li> My wife would not be without it! From time to time my wife might delay in putting on the bracelet and very soon she notices familiar pain. After donning this attractive piece of jewelry the problem quickly goes away. WOW I&#x27;m a star!!</li>
    <li> I have several on my Christmas list that will love this gift.  I also wear one almost every day.  It helps my arthritis in my wrists.</li>
    <li> I wear this bracelet a lot.  No clasp on a bracelet is quick and easy.  The style is attractive and goes with almost anything.  Great price.</li>
    <li> although this is nice i found better stuff at [...]&lt;br /&gt;more in tune what with something i would wear.not too bad though</li>
    <li> Nice bracelet, I use it for arthritis, hope it works! Somebody told me you have to put it on the opposite site of you affected area.</li>
    <li> If I could get you to try this I would. It not only works (as a magnetic bracelet is supposed to) but it is inexpensive and beautiful on top of it! I have gotten many compliments on it . I bought one for each of my friends and they love them too. I know because I see them wearing them.</li>
    <li> the bracelet has a nice look to it. the problem is that the string shows through and hangs off to the sides of the bracelet where it is knotted.  this makes the bracelet look cheap.  it would have been better to have had a clasp closure in the back instead of the bracelet being knotted.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my bf - it&#x27;s manly enough not to be &amp;#34;jewelry&amp;#34; lol. The magnets allegedly help with arthritis...we&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> when I bought this bracelet was very bad because my bracelet was broken.I recommend that you do not buy this bracelet</li>
    <li> I swear by these magnetic bracelets. I wear one around my ankle and it helps with my knee pain from the two surgeries I have had. I bought this bracelet as I have been having a lot of muscle tightness in my shoulders. Ever since I started wearing this around my wrist, I have not had a single issue with my shoulder. I would HIGHLY recommend these magnetic bracelets to anyone!!</li>
    <li> This bracelet can be worn for work or play.  Dress it up or down and you can notice the relief from arthritis pain just fade away.</li>
    <li> It´s a strong product. I liked it. The item is not too light, so It is not too confortable. If you don´t matter, buy it.</li>
    <li> This product was just as described and arrived in perfect condition. Looks even better in person and I like the magnetic effect.</li>
    <li> I ordered this bracelet for an awesome price and it looks amazing</li>
    <li> It is an attractive piece, though it runs a little small.</li>
    <li> Gets a little tight  at times but look very nice and great quality</li>
    <li> Fell apart after maybe a week.</li>
    <li> bought for healing and protection.  it has held up nicely.  I wear it a lot.  good value.</li>
    <li> one size fits all? My wrist is around 7 inches in diameter. It was a pain to keep this on my wrist. Buy only if you have small wrist</li>
    <li> Looks nice but scratches easily!</li>
    <li> Very nice equipement I been looking for, Fortunately I found it here and I like it very much. I will recomend it.</li>
    <li> Not 100% convinced that it works but it is cute and masculine. I gave it as a gift to my son.</li>
    <li> It is pretty and nice bracelet. I will buy again for sure as gifts for other friends later. Love it.</li>
    <li> This magnetic bracelet is great really seams to help. If you have stiff soar joints I recommend you give it a try.</li>
    <li> Not claiming any medicinal usage is being done but it is a neat looking bracelet and easy to throw on with some jeans and a t-shirt for guys and girls</li>
    <li> Extremely attractive jewelry for the price. Sent it to me ahead of schedule and it is most usable.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making such nice costume jewelry. I am sure to get compliments on this. Do not hesitate to&lt;br /&gt;order from this company. They do a super job. Your Alabama fan, Doris Jones</li>
    <li> For the money it was okay. tarnished on one or two beads, but my brother still loves it. I would say its worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought 2, and my partner talked me out of one.  It helps her with pain in her thumb, and it helps my hand not to hurt as much.</li>
    <li> Thies item is the same as the Hematite Bracelet I ordered for Arthritis and Pain Relief.  I thought it was a fashionable item.</li>
    <li> The description of the bracelet needs the size of the pieces. They are small. Disappointingly small. Or the design needs to change. Larger pieces, large enough to show their lustre and texture</li>
    <li> did not like it it was to small if yu are a healthy thick big person please dont waste ur money I gave both away pure junk</li>
</ol>
