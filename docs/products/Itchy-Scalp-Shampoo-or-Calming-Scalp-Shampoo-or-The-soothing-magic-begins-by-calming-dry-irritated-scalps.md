    <li> Really works for itchy scalp.  I love all Just Natural Organic products.  I&#x27;ve tried many itchy scalp products and this has been the only one to give me relief.</li>

    <li> It is o.k., but expensive</li>
    <li> I continue to order this for my scalp and it really calms my scalp. I will continue to buy this in the future. TY</li>
    <li> This product was helpful in decreasing the itchy scalp issues.  It was beneficial when used in combination with the conditioner and the vinegar rinse cleanser.  Would recommend usage by anyone with this itchy scalp issue.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything it claims to do, but it lather well, and smells nice.</li>
    <li> It does lessen the itching by quite a bit. But for it being a shampoo, I was disappointed with how it applies. It does not sud. You have to use a lot just for it to get on entire scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome.It completely saved my scalp from a crazy skull cap situation. I went to the hairdresser recently and she told me that my hair is waaaay more healthy. The willow bark is great for scalp health. 1 bottle has lasted me about a year and I am about to get another one.</li>
    <li> This is my 4 or 5th bottle, so love the product</li>
    <li> Works great with conditioner. It&#x27;s a must have for my itchy scalp! Leaves my hair felling clean and itch free...without the medicated smell!</li>
    <li> I guess I put to much emphasis on thinking that this product was my savior for my itchy scalp, but to no avail. It feels good when shampooing, but later on the itching returns, as  for me, I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This does not stop scalp itch. All the stuff about organics may or may not be true but it doesn&#x27;t stop scalp itch and it is definitely not worth the price. See a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Using this along with Itchy Scalp Conditioner and Itchy Scalp Vinegar Rinse Cleanser for about 1 week, and I&#x27;m flake and itch free for the first time ever.  Will keep reordering. Thank you Just Natural!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells good and it has helped with my scalp itching and hair loss, too. I will be buying more of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> 0000 wasting money for me</li>
    <li> Helped a little.  Hair feels dry after use, but when my hair gets oily it itches more.  I used to have really good hair and it changed over night and never changed back.  I eat what I consider a good diet, but hair continues to look unhealthy.</li>
    <li> Works well for me.  After using the product for a week, my scalp itch is gone.  I will reorder this product.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  I have the vinegar rinse and conditioner and they are work great.  However, this makes my scalp even more itchy.  I&#x27;ve tried shaking the bottle and even mixing with a spoon.  But it still dries out my hair and scalp</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  It does not get rid of all my dandruff, but it makes it manageable.&lt;br /&gt;It does help reduce the itching quite a bit, and in fact it is mostly eliminated now.&lt;br /&gt;I find you have to try a lot of different shampoos to find one that works for you as far as getting rid&lt;br /&gt;of scalp itch and dandruff.</li>
