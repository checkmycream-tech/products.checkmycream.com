<li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel dirty at the end of the day like some hair sprays do.</li>
<li> Sprays like water, smells terrible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used this product for over ten years.  The \\&quot;light hold\\&quot; label is misleading.  I drive a convertible and even in 35 mph winds plus driving, my hair retains it&#x27;s shape. I don&#x27;t even have to comb it when I arrive at my destination, other than a quick finger comb and the spray still works. I have thick, wavy hair that has a mind of its own.  This spray helps keep the shape I want and at the same time looks natural and uncontrolled.  People who feel my hair don&#x27;t believe I use hairspray.  This is a must for anyone who wants controlled, happy hair.</li>
    <li> i love this product. if you need a holding product for your hair, you need to try this one. much better for your hair than traditional hairsprays...good firm hold, and you actually use less product.</li>
    <li> This hairspray has everything you would want in a hairspray -- lightness, no scent, and great holding power in a convenient pump spray bottle.</li>

    <li> Awesome hair spray &amp; kind to your hair.</li>
    <li> this product didn&#x27;t did well on my hair! I have a thick and curly hair and it&#x27;s just let my hair so super hard</li>
    <li> A little pricey in my opinion but works well</li>
    <li> Sprays like water, smells terrible.  Not effective at holding hair...I threw it out.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for many years. Recommend it for those with fine textured hair. No build up and you can comb through it easily. It keeps your hair style in place.</li>
    <li> Aveda Witch Hazel hair spray provides adequate hold and smoothes fly aways without looking like you used hair spray. The texture of my hair remains unchanged after using this. There is no gunky, sticky mess left behind. I have fine hair that is prone to being oily and this is hands down the best hair spray I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair type. A bottle of this seems to last me forever because a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve used this spray for a long time and have only positive things to say about it.</li>

    <li> This is an awesome product, I was looking for some thing to enhance my curls when blow drying, this is it!! My search is over!! Thanks Amazon:)</li>
    <li> Iv used this hairspray for probably 20 years and it is still my fav! I&#x27;m lost when I run out of it:)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Aveda hair spray.  I used to use Firmata, but eventually I found it to be too stiff for my fine hair.  This &amp;#34;light hold&amp;#34; spray works great on my thinning hair - never gloppy or wet-looking no matter how much spray I use.  The trick there is to wait until the first application of the hair spray dries, then spray again.  I would recommend this hair spray for anyone looking for a decent-hold hairspray.  Not cheap, but then no Aveda product is.</li>
    <li> Aveda is one of my favored hair sprays. In high humidity it helps a little in reducing frizz as well. Otherwise, it smells clean and fresh but dissipates quickly.

    <li> Great hair spray for Flroida weather.&lt;br /&gt;No Aveda supplier located near our home...being able to purchase on line is super!</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry, mountain climate that is often windy. I am also in my mid-50s, so it is work to keep my hair from becoming a dried-out, frizzy mess lacking body.  I swear by Aveda products to help me get by; phomollient and volumizing tonic. After blow-drying,  I also rub Alterna Kendi Oil on my palms, then through my hair before using a flat iron.  I have been very happy with both the light scent, workability, and staying power of the Witch Hazel Hair Spray. There is no perfect solution, but this is close. Fabulous product!</li>
