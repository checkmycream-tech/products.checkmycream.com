    <li> I get a lot of compliments on this scent</li>
    <li> small enough to toss in my purse...love the smell.....one bottle leaks a bit but 2nd one i purchased is fine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always concerned for buying perfume online. I checked it out to see if it had been tampered with or diluted. I was happy to see it wasn&#x27;t.</li>

    <li> No, it was not the correct scent. It was falsely advertised.</li>
    <li> The perfume does not smell fresh. Smells off, like it has been sitting around for a while. Wish they still sold it in their store.</li>
    <li> Perfect condition, perfect travel size.</li>
    <li> Because my daughter brought the package in and I could smell some cheap, fake vanilla smell coming from the bag. I thought the contents had been spilled and thought &amp;#34;Please tell me that horrible scent is not what I paid for!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I opened the package to investigate, everything was intact and the fragrance inside the bottle is very lovely.  Did someone play a little holiday prank on me? XD</li>

    <li> This product is &amp;#34;just okay.&amp;#34;  Next time, will plan to try fragrance at store prior to purchase.  Great pricing, however, makes it okay!</li>
    <li> Of course, Victoria Secrets products are always a superior item to purchase. Just mention the manufacturer&#x27;s name and that tells it all. I&#x27;ve always had great reviews of how good the perfume smells and excellent size to carry with you wherever you go. Thank goodness for Victoria Secrets</li>
