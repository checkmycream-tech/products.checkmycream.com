      <li>but it is by far the best Cleansing Tissue I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I have to say I love these wipes, by far the best wipes I have tried.</li>
      <li>so that could be a major player in my awesome skin quality as well,</li>
      <li>The package has a clip closer top</li>
      <li>love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>After this, I go wash my face with a cleansing oil or foaming wash just to be sure and remove all leftover makeup.</li>

      <li>Ok for a cleansing tissue, but didn&#x27;t like the oily feeling afterwards.</li>
      <li>Leaves a lovely oily residue</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>, oil is the better option.</li>
      <li>Each towelette is very saturated and smells great.</li>
      <li>Takes the makeup right off with a  very gentle scent of beautiful olive oil.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin and gets all of my makeup off.</li>
      <li>Tried the innisfree olive cleansing tissue, I have to say it was pretty nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle but effective at removing makeup.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, is thinner than other wipes, but still does a good job of removing makeup.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed this product and the shipping was very fast to Anchorage, Alaska which is always a plus.</li>
      <li>These are better for the first step in washing your face at home; they probably wouldn&#x27;t work as an on-the-go wipe or to freshen your face during the day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Korean skin care products, but these are by far the best make-up wipes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>After using this cleansing tissue, your skin feels clean and does not feel stripped of moisture.</li>
      <li>Overall for use at home, I loved them.</li>
      <li>I always feel so fresh and clean after using them.</li>
      <li>I thought these would be great for a lazy night where I wanted to just use a cleansing towel instead of a full on face routine.</li>
      <li>Very gentile and the oil leaves my skin feeling smoothe and clean.</li>
      <li>After using these cleansing cloths along with my new skincare routine, I have radiant dewy skin - free of dryness &amp; redness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They remove my makeup easily and completely.</li>
      <li>It has a nice almost citrus like scent and removes makeup really well, especially waterproof mascara.</li>
      <li>One wipe removes all of my make-up at the end of the day and the wipes don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry or like there&#x27;s some kind of residue on it.</li>
      <li>Very gentle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I read the back of the package!</li>
      <li>I will be buying more soon, because 30 days is only a month.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s just a replacement for the first step.</li>
      <li>I wish I had bought more before I left Korea, I can&#x27;t even describe my relief when I found them</li>
      <li>Any kind of makeup comes right off without scrubbing, and you only need one to take off a day&#x27;s worth of makeup on your entire face.</li>
      <li>I tend to be on the more dry side</li>
      <li>It feels gentle on my super sensitive skin and every trace of make up comes off.</li>
      <li>They make your face feel super soft and they really get all the makeup and dirt from the city off your face.</li>
      <li>I have seen inprovement in my skin and I am very thankful for that.</li>
      <li>I got the wipes to use for travel, but I like them so much</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>has too much alcohol</li>
      <li>Gentle and gets all the makeup off.</li>
      <li>It is so gentle on the skin and it takes off all my waterproof makeup.</li>
      <li>They are also gentle on your skin and don&#x27;t cause breakouts - and the oil keeps your face moisturized unlike a lot of the makeup cleansers (or if you just use soap).</li>
      <li>Overall the product is good, I guess I expected the wow and didn&#x27;t really get it.</li>
      <li>There is absolutely no need to scrub the face with this wipe; the makeup is easily removed with a gentle sweep.</li>
      <li>For full disclosure, I have also added an ampoule essence to my skincare routine (back when I started using these)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of drugstore makeup removal wipes before and really have found most of them extremely harsh on my skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I love this cleansing tissue, though it&#x27;s a little bit too oily and always requires a wash because of the oil.</li>
      <li>I have normal skin with no acne.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes, either, so its not hard to get eye makeup off either.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few brands and this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>I have oily, sensitive skin and these</li>
      <li>But, it&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
      <li>It wipes off makeup completely without scrubbing the skin.</li>
      <li>I am prone to dry skin patches and these were very gentle on my face.  </li>
      <li>I have not had any dry skin on my face this winter for the first time in forever</li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel cleared and fresh especially after a long day.</li>
      <li>I follow with a gentle foaming face wash, and then my skin is left super soft and not tight or dried feeling at all, as has happened with other products.</li>
      <li>If you have dry skin, these will remove all makeup and leave you with soft, hydrated, and nice-smelling skin.</li>

    <li> Gentle and gets all the makeup off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if all my makeup comes off completely after this but it is by far the best Cleansing Tissue I&#x27;ve used. After this, I go wash my face with a cleansing oil or foaming wash just to be sure and remove all leftover makeup. I definitely see all the foundation or concealer I&#x27;ve used comes off. I use waterproof gel liner so when removing it, it does spread a bit. But, it&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed. It&#x27;s not drying at all, usually the ones I have tried has too much alcohol, oil is the better option. Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing tissue, though it&#x27;s a little bit too oily and always requires a wash because of the oil. It wipes off makeup completely without scrubbing the skin. The oil isn&#x27;t a problem because it washes off well with a good foaming cleanser.</li>
    <li> I usually use store brands cleansing tissues which I can get around the corner. My mom always have a box in the house but I didn&#x27;t like the ones she uses because they were for removing makeup. Tried the innisfree olive cleansing tissue, I have to say it was pretty nice. Was soft and the scent was not overwhelming. Very gentle.</li>
    <li> Takes the makeup right off with a  very gentle scent of beautiful olive oil.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  Will never go back to Aveeno makeup remover wipes again, it left my skin slimy and uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Love this. It&#x27;s gentle but effective at removing makeup.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend ordered these and almost used them all up now. She loves them! Each towelette is very saturated and smells great. She uses them every night before she goes to sleep. Guess I should reorder soon. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Korean skin care products, but these are by far the best make-up wipes I&#x27;ve ever used. I have oily, sensitive skin and these don&#x27;t break me out. One wipe removes all of my make-up at the end of the day and the wipes don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry or like there&#x27;s some kind of residue on it. Will definitely be purchasing these again once I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I read the back of the package! I thought these would be great for a lazy night where I wanted to just use a cleansing towel instead of a full on face routine. The directions say it&#x27;s an oil cleanser and to wash off with water or a foaming cleanser. So it&#x27;s just a replacement for the first step. Still totally useful to have in the routine and work GREAT as makeup remover cloths!</li>
    <li> Overall the product is good, I guess I expected the wow and didn&#x27;t really get it.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of drugstore makeup removal wipes before and really have found most of them extremely harsh on my skin. I have not used any high end wipes making it difficult to compare these wipes to the high end wipes. I have to say I love these wipes, by far the best wipes I have tried. It is so gentle on the skin and it takes off all my waterproof makeup. There is absolutely no need to scrub the face with this wipe; the makeup is easily removed with a gentle sweep. The instructions does say you have to rinse off with cleansing foam or lukewarm water afterwards. I never do. Initially, there&#x27;s a slight oily feel to the skin but within minutes, my skin is back to normal and does not feel drying. I definitely recommend these wipes and would purchase them again!</li>
    <li> These are the best cleansing tissues I&#x27;ve ever used! If you have dry skin, these will remove all makeup and leave you with soft, hydrated, and nice-smelling skin. My mom loves them too!</li>
    <li> After a visit to Korea, I am a Korean skincare convert.  I was at a department store and couldn&#x27;t  help to ask the lady behind the counter what she did to get her skin as radiant as it was. She was more than happy to share her intense regimen with me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the products in her skincare arsenal were these gems, so I bought a pack.  I wish I had bought more before I left Korea, I can&#x27;t even describe my relief when I found them here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are soft, remove makeup and dirt without leaving an incredibly oily feeling and have a wonderful scent.  I alternate using the cleansing oil as well, love the way it makes my skin feel.  I am prone to dry skin patches and these were very gentle on my face.  After using these cleansing cloths along with my new skincare routine, I have radiant dewy skin - free of dryness &amp; redness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the rice cleansing oil sheets from The Faceshop, but the olive oil ones from Innisfree are my fave!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with these. They remove my makeup easily and completely. I follow with a gentle foaming face wash, and then my skin is left super soft and not tight or dried feeling at all, as has happened with other products. I&#x27;d consider my skin &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, not oily or dry, for reference. I got the wipes to use for travel, but I like them so much I think I&#x27;m going to have to buy the bottled version.</li>
    <li> These are the best ever! I LOVE these cleansing tissues! They make your face feel super soft and they really get all the makeup and dirt from the city off your face. I always feel so fresh and clean after using them. They are also gentle on your skin and don&#x27;t cause breakouts - and the oil keeps your face moisturized unlike a lot of the makeup cleansers (or if you just use soap). I got these about 2 months ago and I have been totally converted. I don&#x27;t know how I went 24 years without ever using these.    EDIT: I just would like to add that it is now December and I am still using these religiously. I have not had any dry skin on my face this winter for the first time in forever and I feel like it has at least a little to do with these wipes helping to add moisture to my skin during the cleansing process. For full disclosure, I have also added an ampoule essence to my skincare routine (back when I started using these) so that could be a major player in my awesome skin quality as well, but I still swear by these tissues.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin and gets all of my makeup off. Doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes, either, so its not hard to get eye makeup off either.</li>
    <li> These wipes are great! Any kind of makeup comes right off without scrubbing, and you only need one to take off a day&#x27;s worth of makeup on your entire face.

These are better for the first step in washing your face at home; they probably wouldn&#x27;t work as an on-the-go wipe or to freshen your face during the day. Overall for use at home, I loved them. Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I truly love this product! It has a nice almost citrus like scent and removes makeup really well, especially waterproof mascara. After using this cleansing tissue, your skin feels clean and does not feel stripped of moisture. I have tried other cleansing tissues (not by choice because this product can be hard to find) but keep coming back to Innisfree.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin so this has been a miracle. It wipes all of my makeup off with out my skin feeling dry and tight, I use waterproof makeup all the time and this removes it all with out having to tear at my face and scrub my skin off. Very gentile and the oil leaves my skin feeling smoothe and clean.</li>
    <li> Good to remove my eye makeups</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product and the shipping was very fast to Anchorage, Alaska which is always a plus. I have seen inprovement in my skin and I am very thankful for that. I have normal skin with no acne. I tend to be on the more dry side and I do not wear make-up. I hope that helps for anyone wanting to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also came with a simple for another product. I have yet to try the simple that was sent with this product. I will be buying more soon, because 30 days is only a month. I must restock fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves a lovely oily residue</li>
    <li> My skin feels cleaner than it has in years by using these wipes before my cleanser.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, is thinner than other wipes, but still does a good job of removing makeup. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This goes great with the innisfree olive oil cleanser. Use this product to remove your make up and use the cleanser afterwards. It makes your skin feel cleared and fresh especially after a long day. The package has a clip closer top so it can last quite some time.</li>
