      <li>If you are used to most grocery/drug store brands then you will find yourself using less and getting better results.</li>

      <li>/&gt; Highly recommended !!</li>
      <li>I use the same ingredients for my kids baths and when they got to their dad&#x27;s I get to enjoy it too!</li>
      <li>and I will do it several more</li>
      <li>in a hot bath for detoxification</li>
      <li>A pretty large bag.</li>

      <li>Very Recommended.</li>

      <li>Thank you so much for this gift!&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
      <li>Really helped my aching body after a work out.</li>
      <li>I love how it immediately makes my skin feel super soft and smooth, and it just adds that little something extra to my bath.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are many other uses for them</li>
      <li>I used them to soak my feet, for bath time for my 2 year old and even for myself on those rare occasions when I have enough time for a bath and not just my daily very quick shower.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>My feet are relieved and feel much more relaxed and not so stiff and sore.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy that aspect because other Epsom Salts that I have tried have left a gritty or grainy feeling on the bottom of my bath tub which I didn&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
      <li>you must first add about 1/2 cup baking soda to neutralize chemicals in the water,  wait several minutes for it to dissolve, and then add 1 to 1.5 cups epsom salts (for adults) or 1/2 cup epsom salts for children.  </li>
      <li>This Epsom Salt is completely unscented</li>
      <li>I also use it if I&#x27;ve had a particularly long day of standing, I fill my foot tub with hot water and add in a bit of this soak.</li>
      <li>not sure I buy again, ill look best price</li>
      <li>I mainly use it in my bath after a long day and it helps soothe my achy muscles.</li>
      <li>I have severe keratosis pilaris, and using this in a bath is the only thing that makes my skin feel soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s particularly amazing to soak in a hot bath with this Epsoak when you are sick or feeling a bit under the weather.</li>

    <li> Great quality stuff, gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for mixing scrubs, soaking feet, adding to bath water. Provides a wonderful, detoxifying effect. Excellent pricing and fast shipping, too. You can&#x27;t beat this deal. Note: This is a small-medium grain size, just in case fellow crafters want that information for cosmetic and therapeutic preparations.</li>
    <li> Common sense would tell me that Epsom Salts are all the same -- HOWEVER, common sense is not so common these days.&lt;br /&gt; My wife of 34 years has had problems with aching feet and ankles for over 40 years, and soaks them regularly and religiously in Epsom Salts to relieve the achiness.&lt;br /&gt; Tried every brand we could find, with the same results, regardless of brand or dosage.&lt;br /&gt; Then, we stumbled on the \\&quot;Epsoak\\&quot; brand, in the convenient 5-lb. re-sealable plastic pouch.&lt;br /&gt;  BINGO!!, we have a winner !!&lt;br /&gt; Using the same 1-cup-per-gallon-of-water, the results were(and are) wonderful !! Quicker, longer-lasting relief every soak, and she sleeps so much better -- it&#x27;s a blessing for both of us !!&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended !!</li>
    <li> Great product with many uses!!</li>
    <li> Nice big bag works great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Used this for the Peppermint bath salts.  It was great.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and quick shipping. Very pleased.:)</li>
    <li> There is no better place to buy Epsom Salt!!  They have the best prices, the best service and the best quality.  I am very happy I chose San Francisco Salt Company for my Epsom Salt needs.. I will be a regular customer!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Loved the consistency for our bath salts, much finer than most so didn&#x27;t cause clumps. Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Great Product and Great Packaging. Has a vent to remove excess air from the bag once opened. The price can not be found anywhere else for a product made in the USA. This product works awesome for Detox or Epsom Salt baths. Very Recommended.</li>
    <li> Good quality product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this item!</li>
    <li> This made the nicest foot soak!</li>
    <li> I love this company. These dissolve fully and mix well with essential oils.</li>
    <li> I love this salt mainly because it relieves the pain my mother has In her knees and feet all the time. She is an arthiritis patient, and she works at home all day while running a day care. By nightfall she has terrible pain in her feet and back. I asked her to try this for me and she went in skeptically. After an hour I askef her through the bathroom door how was she feeling and she happily chided &amp;#34;never better.&amp;#34; It made me so happy that she finally felt relaxed and her pain calmed down. Thank you so much for this gift!&lt;br /&gt;She even uses it to soak her feet when shes relaxing in her chair. No matter how you use it, it helps!&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided.</li>
    <li> Wonderful foot soak..</li>
    <li> A study carried out in February 2015 found that Epsom salt minutely raises magnesium levels in those who bathe in it regularly. Therefore, although Epsom salts may help relieve some muscle tightness, Epsom salts are less beneficial than once thought</li>
    <li> This product is a good quality.  I  used about 2 lb. in a hot bath for detoxification and I will do it several more times.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Epsom Salt baths for decades.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 5 lb bag, but next time I will get the 10 lb bag. Great quality crystals that dissolves well in the bath. I mixed them with other ingredients for a muscle relief soak. They were packaged in a heavy duty, resealable bag. I&#x27;m very happy with the quality and the price.</li>
    <li> Would recommend for anyone with an aching body to sit in a tub with some of this. You will step out feeling a lot better than when you stepped in. Enjoy...</li>
    <li> it came looking like the picture and I think it will just fine</li>
    <li> If you are in the market for Epsom Salt that is free from additives then look no further. If you are used to most grocery/drug store brands then you will find yourself using less and getting better results. I used them to soak my feet, for bath time for my 2 year old and even for myself on those rare occasions when I have enough time for a bath and not just my daily very quick shower.</li>
    <li> After a long day at work there is nothing I love more than coming home and relaxing in a hot bath. Now with the Epsoak Epsom Salt by San Francisco Salt Company I am able to soothe my aches and pains as well. This Epsom Salt is completely pure, and makes you feel like you&#x27;re having a spa service right in the comfort of your own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the features?&lt;br /&gt;Premium US Pharmaceutical grade&lt;br /&gt;Soothes aches and pains&lt;br /&gt;Detoxifies the body&lt;br /&gt;Improves absorption of nutrients&lt;br /&gt;To use this Epsoak I simply run a bath of warm water and add in a handful or two of this Epsom Salt. I love how it immediately makes my skin feel super soft and smooth, and it just adds that little something extra to my bath. This salt is a medium grain, but it dissolves almost immediately without leaving any residue at all. I really enjoy that aspect because other Epsom Salts that I have tried have left a gritty or grainy feeling on the bottom of my bath tub which I didn&#x27;t enjoy. This Epsom Salt is completely unscented so it&#x27;s great for anyone that has sensitivities to scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the fact that this Epsoak has so many different uses. I mainly use it in my bath after a long day and it helps soothe my achy muscles. I also use it if I&#x27;ve had a particularly long day of standing, I fill my foot tub with hot water and add in a bit of this soak. My feet are relieved and feel much more relaxed and not so stiff and sore. This soak is also great for soothing cuts, drawing out splinters, detoxifying your body, or whatever you can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely everyone needs this in their home. It&#x27;s particularly amazing to soak in a hot bath with this Epsoak when you are sick or feeling a bit under the weather. I can&#x27;t wait to stock up on more of this! I received this product for evaluation, but these are my own opinions.</li>
    <li> Can hear the tomatoes grow</li>
    <li> Great product except packaging should have been much better.  It broke open in the box while in shipment.</li>
    <li> I really like this brand. I order the 5 pounds bags and they last me a while. Worth the price for the quality</li>
    <li> Luxury bath salts! No odor. I soak in these almost every night to relax, and to relieve muscle aches. I highly recommend that you give epsom salt a try!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great I love it.</li>
    <li> I really like it. Somehow it feels much better than the cheap ones from supermarket. Just be careful when you use it in the tub, it will leave a stain mark all over. Better to use a bucket to relieve your feet.</li>
    <li> I wish I had more time to use it. If I had one complaint, the bag was popped open along the seam about an inch, so I was left to wonder why salt spilled in the box. But once I discovered the problem, I just dumped it into a gallon size Ziploc bag. Other than some vacuuming, it wasn&#x27;t too unpleasant.</li>
    <li> A pretty large bag. I ordered it for my tomato plants and will have plenty for them.</li>
    <li> This was a good price on salts, and the resealable bag is always a plus. I&#x27;ll be buying a larger size next.</li>
    <li> My physical therapists have recommended Epsom salts in hot tub soaks and this is the best I&#x27;ve tried. It dissolves quickly and works well. The price is impossible to beat for this quality. This is terrific stuff!</li>
    <li> Good product easy to order and not worry about driving to the store</li>
    <li> Not clumpy. Costs much less than brand sold in Walmart.  Happy and will order again</li>
    <li> This is a large package. It almost broke the Amazon shipping box it came in. It did survive and I do love it! Good stuff to relax having a very nice warm bath.</li>
    <li> These epsom salts are great. Excellent to put in a bath to relieve body ache, muscle tension, detox, relieve stress, and for flu/cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before putting these in your bath you must first add about 1/2 cup baking soda to neutralize chemicals in the water,  wait several minutes for it to dissolve, and then add 1 to 1.5 cups epsom salts (for adults) or 1/2 cup epsom salts for children.  You may also add essential oils of your choice. Minimum of 20-30 minutes soaked in this bath is necessary. The point of this type of bath is to induce a sweat so that the epsom salt, aka magnesium sulfate, flushes toxins out of your body through the skin. You may feel a bit light headed afterward but that is simply a sign of the detox process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many other uses for them but these are the ones I find most helpful for my family, especially when the flu and cold goes around.</li>
    <li> We love this stuff. I use the same ingredients for my kids baths and when they got to their dad&#x27;s I get to enjoy it too! These Epsom salts are great, with a little baking soda and your favorite essential oil. The water is so healthy, full of magnesium which absorbs through your largest organ - your skin.  We buy this product often. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great packaging. Arrived as described.</li>
    <li> Really helped my aching body after a work out. Great product from a respected company, I will be purchasing from them again.</li>
    <li> Nice big bag, just what I needed.</li>
