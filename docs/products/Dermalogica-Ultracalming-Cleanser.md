      <li>I was ordering another tube for her and saw this large container.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to wash face with.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive, hormonal, Rosacea prone skin.</li>
      <li>Finally a face cleaner that is &amp;#34;actually&amp;#34; gentle to my skin.</li>
      <li>(although I still get the occasional post fast food/chocolate binge pimple).</li>
      <li>I apply it to my eyes (about a dime-sized squirt that I then divide between both index fingers) while they are dry and gently rub on my lashes.  </li>
      <li>Last year, I bought this big bottle and it lasted a whole year for me.</li>
      <li>She loves it, my wife can easily refill small plastic bottles for traveling and refill a larger one she uses at home.</li>

    <li> Finally a face cleaner that is &amp;#34;actually&amp;#34; gentle to my skin. I have been using this for several weeks now and absolutely love it. The redness is gone and no more irritation. My skin has improved in appearance as well. I also was pleasantly surprised how quickly I received the product. Excellent job. Thank You.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, hormonal, Rosacea prone skin. This cleanser has obliterated my redness and it seems to have cleared up most of my random acne (although I still get the occasional post fast food/chocolate binge pimple). It&#x27;s a cleanser that takes some getting used to as it doesn&#x27;t foam like soap does and you need to apply it with dry hands to your dry skin. After rubbing it around you rinse it or wipe it off with a tissue. When I first started using it, I still felt as if my skin was still somewhat dirty afterwards, but I kept at it and it eventually changed after a week or two. I feel like my skin is perhaps less oily now since adjusting to this cleanser. Now when I am away from home and I use any other regular type of cleanser I feel like my skin is overly stripped and out of balance. This cleanser takes off most of my makeup except it leaves some mascara behind so you will still need to use a makeup remover with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can save big time on this with subscribe and save and save btw! I hope they keep it on subscribe and save forever!!!</li>
    <li> Dermalogica is perfect for any skin type.</li>

    <li> I did not know that they came in this size but I&#x27;m really glad that they do. It&#x27;s cheaper this way and last twice as long</li>
    <li> The price is good for this large bottle of cleanser. I will definitely reorder when I completely used this product.</li>
    <li> Anyone with sensitive skin would be well-advised to use this gentle cleanser. It is gentle while still being very effective.</li>
    <li> I received this 32 ounce bottle, but was very skeptical about it. The bottle was not sealed and it appeared to be 2/3 filled. I do not feel comfortable using this particular bottle. Since this is my first unsatisfactory purchase and it did not come with a packaging sheet, I am not sure of a return protocol. I will look into how to return it or just toss it.  I even showed it to my esthetician  who said that her professional bottles do not come that empty. She then admonished me for purchasing the product on-line!</li>
    <li> So glad there is an option to buy online, as it much more economical than buying at an overpriced spa.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Esthetician &amp; I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a long time now. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing! Highly recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!  this is not the same product  you would find in a salon.  This must be a knock off.  Clearly not the same smell, or consistency of soap...am returning.</li>
    <li> Good for cleansing light makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to get the liquid out after using about 3/4 of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I appreciate the fact that Amazon carries it.  The larger size is so convenient and cost effective.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash! Great for my sensitive skin. Great price.</li>
    <li> I have used Dermalogica Ultracalming Cleanser for at least 12 years now.

    <li> I bought this for my wife who tired this product is a smaller size. She said that it works great. I was ordering another tube for her and saw this large container. She loves it, my wife can easily refill small plastic bottles for traveling and refill a larger one she uses at home. She said that this cleanser works great and I have heard her tell her sister and friends about it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about four years now. Last year, I bought this big bottle and it lasted a whole year for me. Doesn&#x27;t take much to wash face with. If you have any sensitivity on your face, you need this. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. I have tried everything else and this is the best there is so far.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and is a very good product for sensitive skin. I would recommend this is you have dry or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This line has done wonders for my skin! It&#x27;s softer, more vibrant, brighter. I love the way the products smell! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have used it for years.</li>
