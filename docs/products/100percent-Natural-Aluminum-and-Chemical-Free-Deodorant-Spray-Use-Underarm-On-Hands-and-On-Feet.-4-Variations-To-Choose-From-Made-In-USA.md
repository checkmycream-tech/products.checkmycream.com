<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I never thought I would buy a spray deodorant but this one is Awesome!!! I have tried natural deodorants and can&#x27;t lift my arms because of the odor but with this one you are 100% confident it works !!! I am a zumba instructor and it requires a lot of sweating well I smell really good even tho water is just pouring off me please try it it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! I have a friend who is really into natural, and organic products, very health-conscious. Myself, not so much but of course being around someone like her all the time does kinda grow on one eventually. I do know that she was using some type of deodorant that was quite costly, and not too comfortable on. So, when i saw the ad for this one, i thought it was worth a try. And i&#x27;m hooked! I was concerned because the info sent to me did say that this product does not prevent sweating, and i have a very busy and active career and home life. But i have had no issues with persperation and i think the scent is pleasant. For those who may not care for the scent, kind of a light patchouli, it fades quickly while the deodorant still does it&#x27;s job. I have been having issues with my feet lately also, being on them all day long. I usually change my shoes half-way through the day before i even get home. So i decided to try this deodorant on my feet, as well and it works! I just use a small squirt and then spread it around, a little goes a long way. I am so happy to have stumbled across this product. Going to get some for my daughters too! And also, the fact that this is an American made product, from a small business, only makes it all the better. I am all for supporting our own entrepenuers.</li>
    <li> daughter and granddaughter swear by it now.  Guess I will have to order  more</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;m the kind of person who&#x27;s under arms sweat in the middle of winter. The only thing that truly works for me is REAL prescription deodorant, but it makes me feel like I have a chemical burn under my arms if I use even slightly too much. This comes about as close to prescription that I can get, and it&#x27;s good for my body! I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the smell, it&#x27;s like a lavender with a minty smell, but it works great. I even worked out after working all day and did not have to reapply. Best natural... No best deodorant period, that you can buy over the counter.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep me dry at all and only masks the sweat smell with patchouli oil.</li>
    <li> Works very well on odor and dryness for me.  Pleasant scent, easy to use.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i like to be fresh with it but its no strong smell coming after 4 hours</li>
    <li> Ordered two day shipping and didn&#x27;t get til 3 days but the product works and am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I was sick of chemical deodorant and wanted something better. This natural deodorant smells good and works good!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Am thrilled to have found this after hundreds spent trying numerous non toxic deoderants that didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve been using it for around 2 years and I will NEVER use anything else ever. I used to have BO even with the strongest deodorants on the market and I had terrible allergies as a consequence. Not anymore! With &amp;#34;100% confident&amp;#34; I am safe of BO and awful cancer causing chemicals.</li>
    <li> so far, so good. I have been looking for an all natural deodorant spray since &amp;#34;New Earth&amp;#34; discontinued theirs.&lt;br /&gt;I think this might be it!</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST thing since life&#x27;s bread. I thought I would never be able to find something to keep me from sweating and smelling. I swear by this stuff and have passed down the information to many others who experience what I do. And it smells great!!</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve used in 69 years. (That&#x27;s a long time-;) ) The oils are a real plus.</li>
    <li> I really love this product It actually works but not completely for my armpits, I will buy this soon again!!!! just because I haven&#x27;t found anything like this before that truly works.</li>
    <li> As a deodorant, it works fast, works great! The smell of the product is natural, and 5 min after applying, the smell of the spray is not strong anymore. I love this product, will def. buy again!</li>
    <li> This came fast and will make a great gift to my all natural, all organic, vegan sister</li>
    <li> I am one of those individuals who&#x27;s allergic to many ingredients and I have to search for products that are hypoallergenic. Most deodorant&#x27;s do contain aluminum that is harmful to your body and finding one without the ingredient and actually work is something all together different.  There are very few!  You only have to use a small amount of this to work and boy does it work!  I have to say I&#x27;m not a big fan of the fragrance but its definitely better than horrific body odor.  My hope is they will come out with a more pleasing girly smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best all natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve tried way too many to count. I can smell fresh for most the day on days where it&#x27;s not too warm and on other days all I have to do is re apply it. This company also has amazing customer service as I emailed them about a pump issue and they quickly got back to me and resolved the problem. These are the companies that keep customers for life-thank you!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe this spray actually worked.  I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the odor.  I have a sensitive olfactory and the scent is very strong.  Also, it&#x27;s not a girly scent.  I don&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing it regularly.  Aside from smelling it all day (and hurting my head at the strong odor), I feel others would smell it too and it&#x27;s just too masculine.  Even when I spray it on my feet (another of its uses), I still smell it through my shoes...&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want a product that works, is environmentally friendly, cruelty-free, and don&#x27;t mind the masculine scent, BUY IT.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. Smelled great all day with 3 spritz on each pit. The smell is wonderfully pleasant and clean without being overbearing.  Stings a tiny bit if you put it on after shaving but not too badly. No rash or any unpleasantness.  Been using for about 2 months</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m used to wearing a musk smelling deodorant, I have really enjoyed using this product  The odor protection last much longer than other natural deodorants that I&#x27;ve tried.  Often time one spray under each arm is all I need for the whole day.  The smell is sort of a pine scent.  A little tough to describe, but not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t linger.  I was skeptical at first, but it has really grown on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this if you are looking for a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum and is effective at fighting odor.</li>
    <li> I love that there are all natural ingredients in this product.  It really seems to work. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, though. &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> This has a pretty strong patchouli smell when applied however it works wonderful!</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of the scent but love the odor control. I have used many many every organic  / mostly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products and had to reapply several times a day. I am a mom of an active toddler and work FT out of the home - I don&#x27;t have time to reapply or worry about smelling and this take care of those concerns. If this came in a scent other than patchouli I would buy stock...</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks (odor) and stings.  So gross I had to take another shower immediately upon spraying it.  eeewww.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is great!  I love essential oils and this spray has several of the in it.  I have been using natural deodorants for years....some did not work all that great, but I did not want the chemicals that come with most deodorants.  So I am very happy that I found this one!  It has worked excellent for me - doing all of my normal activities, doing my workouts, running all over the place doing errands, cleaning house.....I am sold on it!  If you like to stay away from unnecessary chemicals also, give this a try.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful without all the harsh chemicals</li>
    <li> i love the smell ,very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; is very important that why i choice it ,especially  i have 2 yang kids.&lt;br /&gt;my kids also like it .</li>
    <li> This smells awful. I&#x27;m sure it works just fine, but the scent is so overwhelmingly strong I couldn&#x27;t bear to use it.</li>
    <li> I have a big problem with sweating and living in AZ well it can get real bad. This stuff has helped me quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lasts a long time through heavy activity. Impressive. Only the outrageous price keeps it from getting 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this!  People always ask what I&#x27;m wearing ....will definitely re order</li>
    <li> smells like a thai curry</li>
    <li> like it but cannot afford to buy it again!</li>
    <li> After trying many other alternatives, finally something that works amazingly well and does not irritate my skin. I was getting desperate!</li>
    <li> I just started using this deodorant and I love it. It has a nice smell and keeps odor at bay for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;Surprising for a deodorant that does have modern day chemicals.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. I ilke the product.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a natural deoderant that smells good.  Altho this one seems a little better, I do not like the smell of this one either.</li>
    <li> It says it&#x27;s for Men and Women but I can&#x27;t imagine a man wanting to smell like this. Since I was home when I tried it I decided I just wouldn&#x27;t use it the following morning and I&#x27;d give it to my wife. Then a few minutes later I got a burning sensation in my arm pits. I showered to scrub it off. Most of the burning stopped but not entirely. Also the shower would not remove all of the oder. When my wife came home an hour later as soon as she came through the door she asked what the smell was. She could smell me from across the room after trying to scrub it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  asked her if she wanted it and she thinks the smell is even too strong for her. Looks like a bit of an expensive waist of money since it will go directly to the trash can.</li>
    <li> So far, I love it!  Smells fresh and earthy, lasts all day; even my son and husband love it as well!  No irritation what so ever.  I am extremely impressed and happy with the product.  Always hated buying and putting on deodorant because of the nasty chemicals.  Tried a few natural ones and they either didn&#x27;t do the job or I broke out in an itchy rash.  Love that this is a spray; so easy, and the whole family can spritz without contamination.  It&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a new deodorant to try and like to stay away from aluminum but find most without this do not work as well.  I have not been able to truly test it yet on a hott arizona summer day but I have used it on some warm days and it has worked without issue.  Does not smell the greatest when applying but you do not stink by any means afterward and as long as it works that does not matter to me.</li>
    <li> Works very well. I have been looking for a deodorant that is aluminum free for a while. I am super pleased.</li>
    <li> When this product was delivered, I opened the box and immediately could smell this produce.  I thought it smelled kind of mediciny.  I wondered if I was regretting my decision.  I took it home and tried it the next morning.  It is a wonderful product.  I do not feel like I smell funny, and it seemed to work well as a deodorant spray.  It does not contain aluminum, and it is not an anti persperant.  I am not a heavy sweating person though.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often like a product so much that I want to write a review, but this product is the exception.  It is great!  It is very easy to apply, dries pretty quickly, smells very pleasant and, most importantly, prevents perspiration odor.  Best of all, there are no harmful ingredients whatsoever.  I was expecting a lot more &amp;#34;wetness&amp;#34; when I switched from an antiperspirant to just a deodorant.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference at all.  I will definitely keep using this deodorant, and now my husband is using it, too, with the same results.</li>
    <li> I received this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant spray yesterday and tried it this morning.  It has a super strong smell which lingers on forever, a cross between a menthol cough drop and Lysol spray.  I thought it would fade after a while but it is still smelling as strong right now 4 hours later.  It is making me nauseous.  I&#x27;ll try it again tomorrow after my shower, but use less.  Maybe that is the trick.  As for its odor eliminating properties, I can&#x27;t tell because all I smell is overwhelming.  It was pretty pricey to toss in the trash.  So, I will give it a couple days more.  If I still can&#x27;t get used to the smell, I WILL toss it.  I&#x27;ll go back to the Crystal spray.  It says &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; and it smells very soft and you don&#x27;t reek like you do with this one.  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but since I&#x27;m so nauseous, I had to tell someone!</li>
    <li> I am sure that this is a very good product........I used a couple of times but find that the fragrance will not work for me.  I tend to like fragrance-free products anyway or very light ones.........this one is too strong and smells like after shave......I am a female.  I am returning the 2 bottles for this reason as I cannot use them.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! I have tried other all natural deodorants but they did not seem to last and had a not so pleasant smell. This spray smells more clean and definitely holds its scent. We also use it on the husband&#x27;s feet. It eliminates his foot odors. *sample provided to review</li>
    <li> Excellent product, exactly as described. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  It even survives hot yoga!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t smell good and did not work, I use oils all the time but this didn&#x27;t smell right and it gave me a rash</li>
    <li> After years of trying every deodorant and antiperspirant I ran across in the vain hope that one of them would work, one of my coworkers happened to recommend this spray to me after I mentioned my struggles. None of the over the counter, clinical strength, or natural alternative deodorants had ever worked for me, but this one does! I am completely impressed and grateful. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and it hasn&#x27;t failed me once. I live in the south, where it is incredibly hot during the summers, and this product is going to finally solve my problem! No more smelly pits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t leave many reviews on Amazon, but I had to review this one because I&#x27;m so happy to find a deodorant that works. Totally worth the price, it lasts for a long time, and it only takes a few spritzes on each side to get you covered. Even after sweating profusely, once dry there is no lingering unpleasant odor. 100% confident, indeed!</li>
    <li> Finally, a &amp;#34;no-stink&amp;#34; natural deodorant.  I live in Florida, where it is very hot and humid.  This makes it hard to use only deodorant.  I finally made the decision to give up anti-perspirant but then couldn&#x27;t find a deodorant that worked hard but was gentle on my sensitive skin.  I LOVE Vi-Tae - it is an excellent product that really works.  This is it - the only deodorant you will ever need again!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Anyone looking for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product, this is a great choice.  2 sprays under each arm and I am ready to go for the day.  There is no residue, it dries quickly, is not greasy and is not sticky.  To me the fragrance is just perfect...I have even received some compliments...&amp;#34;Boy, you smell really good.&amp;#34;  Definitely will be coming back for more!</li>
    <li> smells good still under testing to see if it can handle AZ heat</li>
    <li> Something in this spray irritated my asthma terribly!</li>
    <li> This works very well, although I really DON&#x27;T like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This deodorant rocks, And has the perfect name 100% Confident that I will not stink.  Be sure to follow the directions that the company gives you. I will be telling others, and even let them smell cause this product rocks. I have been using another natural brand and it did ok, but this product I don&#x27;t have to reapply unless I am sweating buckets out gardening. And even then it&#x27;s still working. Thanks for a Great product Vi-Tae!</li>
    <li> Did not enjoy smelling like a pine forest all day, plus it doest work that well.</li>
    <li> The odor of this deodorant spray is very strong. I smelled it all day long along with what I was trying to cover up!</li>
    <li> GREAT name -- I am 100% confident when using this product ... it is important to follow the instructions dealing with &amp;#34;dry time&amp;#34; to be most effective.  Overall: Gentle AND Effective!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Works great. One of the better natural deodorants.  Last much longer than other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands.</li>
    <li> I had been using thai crystal spray for a couple of years without issue. I thought I would try the Vi-Tae product because it was described as a natural product with a pleasant smell for a man as the thai crystal product has no odor. After three days of use I developed a rash under my arms, Obviously I will be discontinuing the use of the product. Hopefully this will help other prospective purchasers.</li>
    <li> if you can get past the smell</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Although, I still sweat, there is never any odor.  I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> THE most awesome deodorant I have ever used! Does just what it says with no build-up on your underarms like other ones that don&#x27;t work anyway. I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IT!</li>
    <li> As a man, I found it to have an unpleasant perfume quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spray for about two weeks now and am pretty happy with it. I&#x27;ve been using natural deodorants for over four years and have always struggled with finding one that actually works for me. Between homemade recipes and store bought, I&#x27;ve probably tried over a dozen different natural deodorants. I&#x27;m a heavy sweater and workout about 4-5 days a week, so I need a deodorant that I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying ever few hours. Vi-Tae works really well. On occasion I&#x27;ll have to apply it at the end of the day, but usually not. Two sprays under each arm in the morning is enough to last me all day. I&#x27;ve also found that I can apply it right after shaving and it doesn&#x27;t sting at all (which I can&#x27;t say about the Weleda spray). Another bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes like many of the coconut oil  based deodorants do. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of the scent. Like others have stated, the scent is really, um, hippy. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the patchouli. I solved that by adding about 20 drops of lavender essential oil and that helped a lot to even out the scent. Also, give your body time to adjust to the deodorant. After the first couple days, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to work for me, because I felt like I had to keep reapplying, but after about a week, I&#x27;m only using it once a day and it&#x27;s working perfectly.</li>
    <li> When I first started using it the scent was very strong.  But the more I use it the scent doesn&#x27;t seem so overpowering, in fact I hardly notice it all.  It definitely does work very well and lasts the entire day.  I plan to order it again and keep using it as long is it&#x27;s available!</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations and I love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Works great, provides me with all day protection.  This natural product works even where other more harsh and chemical latent products fall short (8+hrs).  While it does not provide antiperspirant qualities, it does deodorize all-day, even through extreme workouts.  I just ordered my second bottle and will continue to use this product for my everyday go-to deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only desire from Vi-Tae would be to make available a TSA travel compliant size for flights, so I could this deodorant in my carry-on luggage.</li>
    <li> This is the third natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried -- the other two being Lavilin cream and Queen Helen Mint Julep stick -- and it is the best one so far.  It keeps me fresh for most of the day.  By evening time I am a little funky; however, it is not much worse than the result I would have with an aluminum-based products, so I am satisfied.  My only complaint with this product is the patchouli scent.  To my nose, patchouli is very musky, and it makes it difficult for me to tell if I&#x27;m starting to smell bad or if it&#x27;s just the product. I would love if the company came out with this product in a different scent, but in the meantime, I will continue to buy this. I have found it works best if I spray twice under each arm, let fully dry, then spray once more and let dry again before getting dressed.</li>
    <li> probably works, but strong fragrance,don&#x27;t use it too smelly</li>
    <li> Amazed with this product! I have tried literally countless natural deodorants per my doctor&#x27;s request. I am chemically sensitive and can&#x27;t have aluminum in my deodorant/antiperspirant and this product has been wonderful for me so far. I have used this product consistently for several months and still love it. I am already sharing my find with friends and family.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! Works better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. Two sprays under each arm and I&#x27;m good to go all day. Even after working in the stable during the Summer when it&#x27;s super hot and humid. Customer for life!</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical when I bought this, and I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it in the first place if I didn&#x27;t have a 50% off coupon code. I don&#x27;t ever pay $18 for deodorant.  But I absolutely love it!  I&#x27;ve been on a long search for a natural deodorant that actually works, and this one works!  I highly recommend it!!  I will buy it in the future at full price!</li>
    <li> Never thought I would say that about a deodorant. I mainly have an odor issue with one underarm and of all the products I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many including clinical strength, this is THE BEST...almost perfect.  And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin! I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> It works, even after hiking all day in the hot sun.</li>
    <li> This stuff WORKS and smells great. We live in Palm Springs, CA. Summers here range from 110 - 118 degrees farenheit. Hot. Despite the heat, there&#x27;s no body odor at the end of the day. That&#x27;s nothing short of a miracle. This has a wonderful smell, too. Maybe they&#x27;ll make a fragrance out of it (are you listening, Vi-Tae??). The only downside is it&#x27;s kind of pricey.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with Vi-Tae Natural Deodorant Spray. It is a little heavy on the patchouli but it works.</li>
    <li> Second time I bought it, below is my first review. My second is not good at all. I can&#x27;t even use it because it won&#x27;t spray. So I put it in the original bottle thinking it was a sprayer issue. It is not the product must have been changed and it will not spray. If it doesn&#x27;t spray it is useless, sad because I really liked my first purchase. I will be looking for something else.    Going through menopause stinks, literally. I never had an issue with underarm odor even dancing all night in the clubs when I was younger. Now, OMG the worst part of getting older. I hate being smelly. This stuff works great. I do apply 2-3 times. Once when putting on my makeup, before I start my hair and before I get dressed. Not a lot. 3 sprays each time. I may not need that much but I am paranoid now. I have applied once and been just fine but I like the extra assurance of a few applications when I go out, especially in the warm weather.</li>
    <li> I wanted to stop using antiperspirants. I had tried several natural deodorants. Non of them worked until I used this product. This smells nice and really works. I work outside and it&#x27;s a hot sweaty job in the summer but ViTae works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the original and loved it - I work outside in the south and it works!  I received the &amp;quot;new unscented&amp;quot; one and was up north it was cool and it did NOT work and I was&#x27;t sweating.  I had highly recommended the &amp;quot;original&amp;quot; but would not recommend the unscented version.</li>
    <li> I am DONE buying other natural deodorants, this one WORKS!!!! I have tried many, and spent a lot of money. A couple can be read in my other reviews. Various cancers run in my family so I am very conscious of what I put on and in my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Vi-Tae Deodorant Spray due to all the fabulous reviews. As a test I did not shower for 2 days over the weekend. Not something I normally do, although I do think a lot of Americans are overzealous and sometimes wasteful in terms of showering. Each day when I got dressed I sprayed 2 times in each pit. Absolutely shocked and amazed that I did not smell any body odor after those days were over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mist is light and dries quickly, and I love the light woodsy/musky/sexy scent. The truly amazing thing is that I seem to sweat less while using this. Normally I sweat enough that I can have damp underarms on my t shirts, and would need to reapply whatever other deodorant I was wearing halfway through the day. Not any more!! Yes the price is higher than a lot of others out there, but what you are paying for is natural ingredients that actually work. And at only 2 sprays per pit once a day the large bottle will last a long time. Probably several months. This can also be worn by both men and women, very universal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that my husband said once, &amp;#34;Why does the truck smell a little like patchouli?&amp;#34; after I picked him up from work. Everyone else has said they like the smell, and it is light, not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this amazing natural product. Please don&#x27;t change the formula Vi-Tae!!</li>
    <li> Great product - love the robust smell personally!&lt;br /&gt;However the hydrogenated oil was confusing? As we are trying to get away from the toxins and bad ingredients in things why would they use a hydrogenated oil instead of just the normal &#x27;natural&#x27; oil. I disliked that  and that only.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!! I&#x27;m a beverage server and the last thing I need is stinky arm pits and this doesn&#x27;t embarrass me at all. The smell doesn&#x27;t stay long after you spray it..kind of a woodsy smell, but I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but with 2/3 of my bottle left its not spraying anymore...I don&#x27;t have the option to request a refund anymore either &amp; I don&#x27;t want to waist it. Any suggestions because if I buy an aftermarket spray bottle it won&#x27;t spray the same.</li>
    <li> Nice subtle fragrence. As ViTae states it is not an anti-persperant but it a very effective deoderant; no trace of body odor even when used in a very warm (90+) and humid environment.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great product for small kids.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural deodorant, but I don&#x27;t like the smell of this one. It worse then to be sweaty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments on the smell.  I was leary of using a deodorant with so much of a patchouli smell, but I like it. And it works great for a natural deodorant. Although I do have to reapply most days. I bought it to get away from commercial deodorants, but if I get a whiff of BO the I will lightly apply the old &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34;. Four stars for that.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Very mild to the skin but works wonders. I use it as my daily routine with a cotton swab. For those who have sebaceous glands that work over time this product  is for you. I love the scent and the fresh feeling you get after each application.  Use it multiple times if you are a sweater like me. Love love love it!</li>
    <li> Returned, the smell was way too strong for me.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of things this bottle doesn&#x27;t contain, there is one fantastic thing it does contain - a great smelling effective deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most unusual deodorant I have ever used. One little pump under each arm and I&#x27;m good to go for the day. Initially the smell is somewhat strong, like a tea tree oil and citrus mixed with other good smells. Within a few minutes that smell is gone and I&#x27;m left with just a nice smell that&#x27;s kind of just me, not a perfume or strong cover up smell. I have actually heard, you smell nice, what is that? Yes the smell works for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever this contains or doesn&#x27;t contain, I don&#x27;t really care. The ingredient line sounds wonderful, it smells good, my arms feel fine (no rash from the product) and I don&#x27;t pit out, even on hot days and I&#x27;m working hard. If it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals other deodorants have, well that&#x27;s just great, a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the plastic bottle - it is narrow and easy to hold. I really like the idea of a pump spray instead of an aerosol. Aiming the pump took a little practice. I also like the idea that it is a spray and not a gel - I can use the deodorant in other places where I wouldn&#x27;t use a stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A clear light liquid that dries quickly, what a fantastic concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Works as stated.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I live in humid Texas weather and this is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far. I had to get used to the fragrance but it dissipates after being worn for a bit.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully! The smell gets some getting use to but it has worked great for me. I have sensitive skin and usually get armpit rash but I didn&#x27;t with this product!</li>
    <li> Works pretty good, but you&#x27;ll smell like a hippie.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this spray.  Was not satisfied with the natural roll-on deodorants because they did not seem to hold and had a odd smell.  This spray smells more refreshing  and holds for eight hours. I also use it on my feet sometimes.</li>
    <li> I have tried many natural deodorants over the years and this is by far the best.  Yes it does have a stronger earthy scent, so you won&#x27;t smell like flowers or fruit.... but you also won&#x27;t smell like a stinky armpit either!! ;)  It does work and for the most part I am really pleased!!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This deodorant spray is AMAZING, and only product on market that works for me.</li>
    <li> As everyone else, I was skeptical about trying this deodorant.  I can&#x27;t describe how in awe I am of this deodorant!!  I have used it on the hottest days, or doing things I know always cause me an odor problem.  So happy with it that I shared it with my husband, and he likes it as well so I had to buy a second one for him.  I am telling everyone I know  how great this product is.  You will be amazed.</li>
    <li> Claiming to be free of Aluminum in one form, while containing it in another is misleading.  I fell for it until I looked at the ingredients:  Ammonium alum (as in aluminum).</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I have tried several organic deodorants (all solids, some special-order, some from the store) with no luck. They either didn&#x27;t hold up to the amount of sweat I create by living in the Phoenix heat, or they caused severe skin irritation in my armpits sometimes with a constant, irritating itch (even after I washed it off). As for this product, I have gone 24 hours without reapplying and no odor coming from me (even running around in the heat) - woohoo! It does have a very earthy smell, which I love (reminds me of herb shops), so I think it can work for both men and women. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great deodorant. Makes me feel fresh for a while.</li>
    <li> I have tried every natural deodorant on the market , unhappily, and many of them either stink, don&#x27;t work or give me a rash…. this one is almost as good as my homemade and ALOT less hassle than making my own I Love it!</li>
    <li> I only used it a couple of times before I just threw it away, because it smelled so bad, it reminded me of what Patchouli smells like.</li>
    <li> VERY IMPRESSED!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Louisiana, and am going thru menopause. I wanted to try this because I have found that other deodorants have failed me. I don&#x27;t have an issue with body odor, but I do have a problem where I just don&#x27;t feel quite right. I have a problem where, as soon as i get the slightest bit warm... it seems as though i go straight into spontaneous combustion. I usually keep re-applying thru-out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product this morning, sprayed each armpit once and under each boob. (it came in the mail yesterday)Well, I have not felt the need to re-apply. I can say, though, that I think I used too much. No one said anything but I just think that I used too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not worked in the yard.... but the weather today was  a high of 88 (feels like 92 at 82, with a low of 72. I will re-post when it gets hotter to give an idea of how it works. So far, I am impressed.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using this for very long but so far I like the results. It is lightly scented and smells refreshing.</li>
    <li> I have bought 3 of these. they work wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of physical requirements to my job, and need a deodorant that will work.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really conscious of anything that I put onto or into my body, and research products out really well.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first week of trying your Natural Deodorant, and am shocked at how well it stands up to physical activity.  I read the reviews on here that mentioned it had a lavender scent -  I&#x27;ll, admit I was wondering if it would smell too girly or flowery.  But it smells a bit different on me than it did on my wife (she wanted to try it, too).  Maybe it works with your individual pheromones or something, because it had a muskier scent on me, and a bit of a lighter scent with my wife, which I was digging.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;All I know is that if a Natural Deodorant can get me though my rugged work days, it gets a thumbs up in my book.  Job well done.</li>
    <li> Nice, non-overbearing scent that works for a guy, good anti perspirant strength.</li>
    <li> The scent is earthy, the product WORKS!!!!  We love it- I can&#x27;t say it stops sweat maybe..... but it sure stops order.</li>
    <li> I DO love this all-natural spray deodorant!  I tried other similar products but didn&#x27;t like them at all.  So glad my sister introduced this to me.  It keeps me dry and has a nice clean scent.  It doesn&#x27;t stain or leave residue.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a deodorant that is all natural, aluminum and paraben free that actually does what it claims to do - well, I have finally found it!  100% Confident from Vitae delivers.  At first, I was a bit skeptical because I have tried SOOOO MANY but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it actually works!  My hunt for an all natural deodorant started when I became pregnant and started to educate myself on everything I was exposing my body to. There are TONS of terrible chemicals in ordinary store bought deodorant/antiperspirant products - quite frankly, they are pretty scary and are being linked to breast cancer and several other diseases.  So I am really thrilled to have found this wonderful product on Amazon. Before I used 100% confident deodorant spray, my underarms would easily get really irritated and quite frankly smelly (like most!). I live in a very hot climate so I really rely on my deodorant working, 100% confident has been just wonderful. Its also great that it has essential oils that have been very moisturizing for my skin.  I am definitely sold on this, it is totally worth it, and can&#x27;t wait to try the other products Vitae has to offer!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this, and learned that it had patchouli in it after the fact. I waited a few months before reviewing, because I really wanted to live this. The spray is wonderful, doesn&#x27;t sting, even after shaving. I guess it&#x27;s just me; patchouli and I do not seem to mix. I give it 5 stars for the formulation. If I could have tried this without patchouli, I&#x27;m sure this would have been my forever friend...</li>
    <li> In my opinion, Natural Deodorants can be a hit or miss....for me, this was a complete HIT, and here&#x27;s why....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a very annoying, dramatic journey with attempting find a deodorant that worked for my horribly sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Since college, my underarms had sensitivity to the point of getting really red, itchy, and eventually sometimes (because of the itching) opening up and breaking the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the deodorants that I had tried, the ONLY one that I could use was Dove Sensitive Skin.  But it was boring and had no scent, and didn&#x27;t really do the job as well as other deodorants.  Then I started educating myself about all of the harmful ingredients that most deodorant brands have...  including Dove.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother is a breast cancer survivor -  I know that putting harmful deodorant substances right next to my lymph nodes, and then TRAPPING those toxins in through an antiperspirant is a bad, bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began my search for something Natural, and that&#x27;s when I found the 100% Confident spray through Amazon.  Not only do I have rash-free armpits to the point where I can where a sleeveless shirt, but I finally get a nice lavender scent with my deodorant!  I haven&#x27;t gotten a scent in years...MAKE SURE YOU LET THE SPRAY DRY FOR A BIT, and you&#x27;ll get a nicer lavender smell.  I can&#x27;t tell you what a difference this has made.  To some people it is just a deodorant, but for me this was a HUGE step to improve my quality of life, and ease my underarm pain.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve completely switched from the harmful Dove stuff, and switched to the 100% Confident spray, which is so so so much better for my system.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t thank this company enough.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical about a &#x27;spray on natural deodorant&#x27; but THIS WORKS! And it works pretty effectively.. As someone who sweats a lot due to bad anxiety,I usually have to get super strength deodorant to keep it under control.. So you can see why I&#x27;d be skeptical about this.. But I have to say it&#x27;s kept me dry and odor free for at least 24 hours. Some might find the scent a little off putting.. It&#x27;s a mix of tea tree oil and lavender in my opinion.. Both pretty pungent essential oils.. However I found the scent fades after a few hours and I barely smell it. Also works on other areas of the body too.. hands, feet, groin.. Oh and as a bonus I&#x27;ve found it keeps razor burn/in grown hairs to a minimum when I spray this on after shaving. Love it.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t stand the aroma, threw it away.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell of this deodorant. It works if you want to smell like lavender/medicine all day. The smell is very strong.</li>
    <li> I was struggling with some chronic body odor, which drugstore deodorants were not completely effective in stopping.  Beyond that, my underarms often felt itchy and uncomfortable.  Some deodorants were worse than others, of course.  But the point is that I never found one that I just loved until I did some research on Amazon and discovered Vitae.  Darn it!  I was traveling and didn&#x27;t notice that I was low.  Thank heaven for quick shipping from Amazon.  This will be my second bottle.  I just love it.  Honestly, I know it&#x27;s more expensive than drugstore or supermarket deodorants, but it lasts about 3 months, and is completely worth it!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love absolutely love your great product (Ha, I even use it for my stinky shoes)! Thank you, Yahushua (Jesus) loves you and He&#x27;s coming back. Don&#x27;t leave this world without Him! I pray all might ask Jesus Christ into their heart and follow Him to know God&#x27;s plan for our salvation and to know His boundless love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings!</li>
    <li> I like the smell of natural oils and this product seems to fit the bill. For those jaded by strong artificial scents, might not find this suitable.</li>
    <li> I love this! Would buy it again. Works really well.</li>
    <li> I tried out other natural ways to deodorize: baking soda and also a couple of other natural deodorants which shall remain nameless..lol. Anyway just wanted you to know that your product is everything you said it was. It keeps me dry and does not give me a weird grassy smell unlike the other natural deodorants. I was looking for an aluminum free product and I&#x27;m glad that I decided to try this out. I believe that this is my deodorant from now on. Thanks for living up to the hype... :)</li>
    <li> Purchased based on the product&#x27;s reviews.  I was anxious to try it out, as I&#x27;ve been searching a very long time to find something that will work for me.  At first, I didn&#x27;t like the smell, but I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a week now and I&#x27;ve noticed that the smell fades a bit and it&#x27;s growing on me and not at all unpleasant.  I also didn&#x27;t realize how bad my regular deoderant was effecting my skin after shaving - the bumps have disappeared...woo hoo!  I have only one problem with the product...it&#x27;s suppose to be hypoallergenic, however, I have noticed that it&#x27;s making my under arms very itchy.  Since I&#x27;ve spent so long searching for a product, I&#x27;m going to deal with the itching for now.</li>
    <li> I have tried 5 years ago to using only natural deodorant believing it is healthier. Some products work for odor control and some don&#x27;t. This product works so well thus far that on some days a spray is not needed. Deodorant is one of those products you don&#x27;t think about if it is working for you. There are more important things in life. So thank you for excellent product.</li>
    <li> I waited and tested this for some time prior to rating this. First, it is NOT an antiperspirant, so if you want that...this is not that. I do not like the smell of lavendar personally, but many natural products come in this smell. If they had this in cherry, I would be more pleased. Overall, I&#x27;ve found the product to work as far as odor. It works longer than the crystal kind that I have purchased and quite frankly longer than secret does despite the chemical that secret has in it. I don&#x27;t know that I can give up my antiperspirant though (I use degree). The product as well takes a little bit to dry and I find myself waving my arms. A little price to pay for a natural product like this though. I would rate this 5 stars except I&#x27;d like more a cherry smell. I realize a lot of people like the smell of lavendar. I do in nature (the actual flowering plant), I just don&#x27;t outside of that arena. Make another scent please!!! :-)</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an all-natural deodorant spray for YEARS! I have tried them all and none have ever worked . . . until 100% Confident! I was so happy with the results, my husband started using it and now he loves it!  It works beautifully for both men and women. We are hooked and will never use another deodorant.  In addition, I keep receiving compliments on how good I smell! I never could have imagined that an all-natural deodorant existed that worked perfectly to keep me smelling good and feeling fresh and confident.  Thank you Vi-Tae!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST deodorant out there!</li>
    <li> I like deodorant sprays that are all natural. This one makes me feel that I am using a homemade spray - and I like that! I don&#x27;t think the smell is overpowering, another plus.</li>
    <li> Like you, I&#x27;ve tried quite a few natural deodorants. My most - favorite spray was discontinued, and this one else has been a close second. You can sweat/stink your way through it, but that&#x27;s to be expected (you&#x27;re wanting something safe enough to stick under your arms and not cause a rash or fear of worse, right?). Reapply when you&#x27;re having a hot or active day.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good sized bottle, my husband and I both use AND like this one (we both like scent, it works ok for both of us, neither of us have had bad reaction). We each use about 2 sprays in the morning and on lower key days, that&#x27;s plenty. The bottle lasts a good while, with 2 people using we still have 1/3 of bottle left after 2 or so months (even with us both being active outdoors this hot summer).</li>
    <li> I wore this a couple times and my friends said I smelled like a hippy. Man it&#x27;s got a strong odor. It&#x27;s not unpleasant, just powerful and smells like patchouli. It&#x27;s actually kinda good for long hikes or skipped shower days.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but needed to for this product because after trying absolutely EVERYTHING including prescription medication - this product finally resolved my underarm odor problem.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine. Love patchouli.</li>
    <li> I bought this product last weekend and received it Tuesday.  When I took the plastic off the bottle the smell was overpowering.  I did not try it until today, Friday, because I worked from home...I did not want to wear it to the office because of the overpowering smell of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on this morning, and still at 4:00 in the afternoon, I smell like I just bathed in perfume.  Mind you, I only did one squirt under each arm.  It is difficult to say if it has eliminated the odor or if it just masks the smell. It is not altogether a bad smell, but it is like being around a man or woman that wears way too much cologne or perfume.  It is just too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product because of the natural ingredients and I love that it is a spray, but I won&#x27;t wear it again.</li>
    <li> Horrible. DO NOT buy this. DID NOT work at all :( very disappaointed. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this one to replace the Original version which was incredible so I thought Id try the mens version. I ordered it about 2 months ago or so anticipating that Id be running out of the original version and unfortunately waited too long to try it out. Ive been using it for about 2-3 days and not only does it burn slightly when I put it on, I have severe odor after 3-4 hours and have to wipe my underams because its so bad. Ill be going back to the original version. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Small is not very pleasant</li>
    <li> I have been waiting to see how well it works down here on the Mississippi Gulf Coast in the middle of summer.  Even thought not middle of summer, I find it does not work for odor.  Sorry, because I really wished it did.  I been trying everything. It is okay during winter, spring months.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is amazing works even in the 100 degree heat. I have searched for years for something that works and doesn&#x27;t make me smell this is it. I can feel good about this product knowing I am not putting harmful things on my body.</li>
    <li> Love this and it works really well for like 48 hours!</li>
    <li> Having had breast cancer twice  I have been switching as many items I use to organic.  I have been searching for a natural/organic deodorant that works for me.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple that weren&#x27;t bad but, didn&#x27;t meet my needs or expectations.  The search is over!!!!  This is the best deodorant in any category I have ever tried.  I love it.  I will definitely be checking out more products from this company.</li>
    <li> I stopped using deodorants and was using baby power, then I realized that I was having health issues because of the Talc that&#x27;s in the powder. So u researched and found this product and I Love it! I have my teenage daughters use it too.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: They changed the formula and it has baking soda in it which causes a reaction on my skin, the smell is much different and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as I didn&#x27;t leave my house or do anything today while wearing it and my armpits smell. I&#x27;ve had to return it unfortunately. It&#x27;s too bad they changed the formula because this was my favorite thing!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Alright let me start off by saying I live in the absolute armpit of east Texas. The humidity is unbearable and when you walk outside in the summer it&#x27;s like you are simultaneously drowning and burning it&#x27;s incredible. I&#x27;m a sweaty person and living in this climate means I need a good deodorant or I won&#x27;t have friends hanging out around me. I have tried I think...6? Different types of all natural deodorants because I refuse to not let my body do its thing and sweat plus the chemicals are horrible. After my last failed deodorant I finally decided to try this. I had seen its high ratings and said &amp;#34;what the hell, summer is almost here&amp;#34; and ordered. I tried this for two months to make sure my review would be accurate.  The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and smells like patchouli. Yo, two sprays on the pit and let it dry and you&#x27;re good for the DAY. I workout in this, wear it to work, and no odor. I have extremely sensitive armpit skin and this has not caused any irritation. Cannot recommend this enough! I mean, everyone&#x27;s body is different but you should give it a try.</li>
    <li> Totally enjoy this Natural Deoderant Spray. It also works very effectively, even during the summer heat.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance can seem very strong for some at first. Shake well try one spray first. Fragrance fades pretty fast. I have family who also use this product. We all smell the Lavender, tiny bits of other natural scents. Really nice to use a natural deodorant that works great. Price seems high, yet I believe you will find that this product goes a Long way,&lt;br /&gt;Making it well worth it.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of switching over to using more natural products, from toothpaste to shampoo/conditioner...face wash, etc.  I found this on amazon, read the reviews, and decided to give it a whirl.  First, the size is quite large.  I have had it for a few months now and still have a quarter of the bottle left.  Second, smell.  I happen to like the smell of Patchouli...it is one of the ingredients in this deodorant..if you don&#x27;t like it, dont buy this deodorant.  I have gotten several &amp;#34;you smell like a hippie&amp;#34; comments from coworkers. hahaha.  Third, it is a spray...i spray it on and kind of flap my arms around like im doing the chicken dance to get it to dry faster...once it is pretty much dry, i finish getting dressed.  It does not cause any discoloration or staining on clothing, and has also not caused any skin irritations.  I live in the South...it gets HOT and HUMID as all get out down here.  I also work in professional kitchens...a double whammy.  I do sometimes have to put a second &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; on during my work shift... but I would have to do that before using the &#x27;clinical strength&#x27; versions.  I already purchased my second bottle...love this product!</li>
    <li> It seems more of an essential oil cover up it is just an add on to my swapping routine of products</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product, it is everything that I read and more!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just learning about organic products and wanted to give this one a try. Came in a easy to use spray bottle. The deodorant work&#x27;s very well. It has a very strong smell so you really don&#x27;t have to use a bunch of this but it does work.</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but a good product.</li>
    <li> The smell is awful to me and my boyfriend as well. It does, however, overpower the body odor smell if you can tolerate smelling like a hippie.</li>
    <li> For the past several years I have not been able to use the common deodorants found in markets as they have caused great irritation and rash.  After searching for and finding this product (Vi tac), there is no more rash and it works better in controlling body odor than any of the deodorants used throughout my life.  No other product comes close to giving me the comfort and confidence that this product does.</li>
    <li> This used to be an amazing product, then they changed the formula.  It doesn&#x27;t work now. I have never been so sad.</li>
    <li> I am sure this is a great product, it just did not work for me.  There are some positive things about this product.  #1 it has a nice scent. #2 It sprays on rather than it be a roll on, and it does not leave a stain on your clothes.  I suggest that you give this deodorant a try because it may work for you.</li>
    <li> Love all natural products.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible! I had to shower again to get the smell of me!</li>
    <li> Cute and useful size.  Love it~</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was very skeptical of products like this that say they can do the job of a normal deodorant, but I was definitely surprised. I sweat a lot and it&#x27;s embarrassing but this product worked wonderfully on my daily excursions. I only had to reapply once towards the end of the day. I wouldn&#x27;t use this on my trips to the gym just because I would not want to reapply during my workout sessions but for everyday use it works! I had my friend smell my armpit and he said it smelled like flowers. Works for me and it&#x27;ll work for you too!</li>
    <li> I previously posted a rave review about Vi-Tae&#x27;s 100% Confident deodorant. I bought it 3 times when the label looked different than this red label you now see in the product picture. I originally found this product because I needed a deodorant that didn&#x27;t use baking soda, which 1) irritates my skin and 2) does nothing to stop my body odor when I perspire. The ACTUAL &amp;quot;original&amp;quot; formula worked very well. So the last time I bought it I bought 2 because I was a true believer. And Vi-Tae, in a timely fashion, sent me two bottles of this crap with the red label. The scent is the same because the essential oil blend hasn&#x27;t changed, but the product is no longer effective against my body odor. So I took the almost empty bottle of the original stuff that I keep in my desk drawer at work and compared ingredients--they&#x27;re very different! When I have time I&#x27;ll make a spreadsheet of the differences and post them here. This new crap didn&#x27;t even keep my stink away for an hour. AN HOUR! Yesterday I did a test of putting the new crap in one armpit and the good old formula in the other, and the armpit with the old stuff was stink-free until my workday ended. The armpit with the new crappy formula was stinking well before lunchtime. I&#x27;ll never buy this product again, and I un-recommend Vi-Tae as a company. Any company that changes its product formula with no indication is unethical and unworthy of my dollars. Too bad--the original product was QUITE good.</li>
    <li> I feel as if I sweat for 3 people and the other two have never thanked me.  I thought it would be a harder transition from anti-perspirant to plain deodorant....or at least removing the aluminum from any products used.  I am very happy with this product.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> I was determined to stop using products with heavy metals.  I&#x27;ve tried a few natural items and wasn&#x27;t ever satisfied until this product.  You do need to get used to sweating.  Luckily you won&#x27;t smell bad though!  It works.</li>
    <li> The first all natural deodorant spray that actually works. Some of the others I&#x27;ve tried may have worked slightly, but something was turning my armpits a dark color. So far, this one has no side effects and is holding up to the 95F degree days with 100% humidity.Once winter arrives I will be using only 1 spray instead of the 3 (on each armpit). This bottle should last a couple of months. My first 2 bottles were the Original spray. I think it worked slightly better than this, &amp;#34;ladies&amp;#34; version.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of natural deodorants; that end up failing. I am really happy with this. it works and I think I will re purchase</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME! It definitely kills the bacteria the creates the funky smell. I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Loving the Vi-tae 100% Confident Deodorant Spray. It has a nice fresh scent and sprays on nicely under the arms.  Note it will not prevent sweating (it is not an anti-perspirant - our bodies were meant to sweat!) So if you are a heavy sweater this might not be for you. I love using this for the natural non-nasty ingredients.  Have been using it for a few weeks and have not had one day of odor when using just this for my deodorant. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> I was really surprised this actually works for me. Used to use secret and men&#x27;s deoderant. I&#x27;m premenopausal so a lot of deoderant  didn&#x27;t work for me anymore but I want to get away from the chemicals and I can say I like the smell too. I don&#x27;t get headaches.</li>
    <li> Best all natural deodorant EVER!!!!</li>
    <li> It does seem to stop the odor, however, it has a very outdoor, pine, not feminine fragrance.  I do hope they will come up with something for women.  But I do have to say that the original fragrance tends to disappear shortly after applying it, but it does cope nicely with any body odor, my husband even likes to use it.  It does not irritate his skin as other deodorants in the past have, so we are both very satisfied.  P Pratt</li>
    <li> THIS DEODORANT WORKS!!  IT SMELLS GREAT !!!!  IT CONTAINS ALUMINUM !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;YES, YOU HEARD CORRECTLY. I FINALLY DID SOME RESEARCH ON ONE OF THE INGREDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;NAMELY : AMMONIUM ALUM !! IT IS LISTED AS A MINERAL SALT, BUT TYPE THE FOLLOWING INTO GOOGLE:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; WHAT IS AMMONIUM ALUM &amp;#34;, AND WAIT TO YOU SEE WHAT THE ANSWER IS!!&lt;br /&gt;AMMONIUM ALUMINUM SULFATE ( NH4 )AI(SO4)2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I THOUGHT I HAD SOMETHING GREAT HERE!! I GUESS NOT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SEARCH CONTINUES !!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an aluminum free deodorant that actually worked.  I have tried other products on the market and they simply don&#x27;t last.  This is perfect.  and don&#x27;t be fooled by the price.  I have had one bottle for 3 months so far and only 1/3 of it has been used.  I bought it for both my daughters as well.</li>
    <li> This works, smells good and it&#x27;s natural.  I&#x27;m dumbfounded that more people are not using a natural deodorant.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I have a very sensitive palate and a strong sense of smell which only gets heightened around the time of my menstrual cycle. This product really is not for me. I was drawn to it due to the fact that most deodorants have  aluminum which has been thought to contribute to cancer. I don&#x27;t like the Tom&#x27;s deodorant so I thought maybe this would be something to try. I am not saying that this is a bad product but for me it just isn&#x27;t what I am looking for or want. When I spray it on I get tingly and cold and I hate that feeling. Usually I don&#x27;t really sweat a lot and most of the time when I do it is more of a cold sweat, this product makes me feel like I am going to actually break out in a cold sweat. Because I have a sensitive palate and strong sense of smell, this product is way too overwhelming to me and I feel like I am just making awful faces the whole time I wear this. I do not like the smell of patchouli and I feel like I just walked out of the body shop after trying all the oils as a kid  circa 1990 causing nothing but a foul confusing stench. When sitting on the couch after a long day my boyfriend was able to smell it from a few feet away and asked what the smell was, I just didn&#x27;t have it in me to tell him it was me and my new deodorant...I will not be using this again.</li>
    <li> Works well, strong essential oil smell but lessens after awhile and works for a long time, no sting, works for me!</li>
    <li> (Full disclosure: I received a free product in exchange for an honest review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing to consider about Vi-Tae’s Deodorant Spray is that it’s solely a deodorant, NOT an anti- antiperspirant – it won’t prevent you from sweating, but it will counteract the smell produced by the fats and proteins emitted during the process, and target the bacteria that hangs out in your armpits. If you don’t like sweating (and I admittedly fall into this club), this might not be the right hygiene product for you. But when Vi-Tae offered me a free bottle for review, I just couldn’t resist. Affordable and effective vegan deodorants/antiperspirants are hard to come by, and I’m always on the lookout for better options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vi-Tae’s Deodorant Spray does an excellent job of blocking/masking odors. It has a very strong, distinctive scent that’s dominated by patchouli, with hints of sage, tea tree oil, and lemon. I’m not a big fan of patchouli, but it’s tempered somewhat by the other scents, making it at least tolerable to my senses. That said, it would not have been my first choice for a scent. Those who are sensitive to strong odors might find themselves overwhelmed by this deodorant.  It’s anything but understated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray goes on clear, but with a clammy feeling that I couldn’t shake. And of course this sensation was made worse when I began to sweat. I tested this product during the late summer, with temps in the 70s and 80s; I think I might try this deodorant again in the winter, when I keep the thermostat set to the low 60s and don’t perspire quite as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don’t mind sweating but don’t want to stink while doing it, Vi-Tae’s Deodorant Spray is an affordable and effective option. It’s also vegan, as are most of Vi-Tae’s products, and is not tested on animals. Additionally, it’s hypoallergenic and proved gentle on my sensitive skin (even immediately post-shave).</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells like essential oils so if you don&#x27;t want to smell like this through out your day then do not purchase!!! I haven&#x27;t gotten to test if to see if it does indeed help with body odor when sweating or working out so I&#x27;m not reviewing on that just yet. I will update review once I have had enough time to try it out for a while. I have wore it today and after while the smell doesn&#x27;t smell as strong maybe it&#x27;s cause I&#x27;ve gotten use to it....overall it&#x27;s an okay product!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product and would happily make it a staple in my morning shower regimen. The smell is fresh and clean and I feel good about the naturalness of the ingredients. I stopped using anti-antiperspirants a long time ago, due to the fact that I think it&#x27;s unnatural and maybe even unhealthy to thwart a natural bodily process, and this product makes me feel good about continuing to use a deodorant (because I have to face the fact that I do need it, especially on days when I run). It&#x27;s all natural and I highly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a natural alternative to commercial deodorants.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product. I like to use a natural / not harmful deodorant and this one really works great.  The scent is such that I think both men and women could happily use it!</li>
    <li> I have tried countless all natural/organic deodorants--any and everything you could buy from Whole Fds plus more, I&#x27;ve tried it.  And one consistent trend with every single one has been the need to re-apply at least once throughout the day or I have a subtle to strong body odor. No bueno!&lt;br /&gt;This is the FIRST one I&#x27;ve ever used that I can say is AMAZING.  Let all those who can hear, hear me when I say this is the best. I apply once after showering and it lasts ALL day and night--shower to shower there&#x27;s ZERO body odor.  I cannot say enough good things about this stuff. I have been on a tireless search for a non-aluminum deodorant that can handle my chemistry and sweat issues for YEARS. I have bad stress sweat which causes me to have even worse b.o. than some men. This deodorant is the rare gem that can handle it.  My husband has been on the same quest for something that&#x27;s natural, fast drying, and not oily/runny after his workouts. He says this works well for him also.  Whatever the formulation is, you all have a winner with this. Every time I sniff to make sure it&#x27;s still lasting after a workout or long day, I am amazed that my underarms still smell good--not just odorless, but they smell good.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but the scent is a little too woodsy for me....</li>
    <li> Note: If you get multiple products from Vi-Tae, read the labels carefully b/c the bottles for the spray deodorant and Psoriasis/ Eczema relief are exactly the same. That could get problematic if you keep them in the same space and don&#x27;t wake instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way they name their products too. \\&quot;100% Confident\\&quot;, Soothing Relief, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent seems more suitable for a man even though it&#x27;s billed as unisex. I guess this will just swing on personal preference. I&#x27;m sure it will last quite a while as you don&#x27;t need much to get good results. I could smell it a good 4 hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: If you like strong deodorant that could double as cologne, check it out. If you&#x27;re not so much into superstrong scents still check it out but use sparingly. (I think I sprayed it 2-3 times. Definitely could have gotten away with one spray.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while, loved it and had posted a very positive review.  I reordered recently and decided to try the Her scent along with the original scent.  It seems that the quality dropped.  I didn&#x27;t like the Her scent but neither is working at all.   Sorry that I can no longer support my initial review: Tried a spray deodorant at the gym and decided I liked it better for avoiding marks in clothes. I ordered about 3 different ones from Amazon and this one was best by far. It had a spice/herbal scent when first applied but once dry no residual scent. Have had other deodorants wear off even the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; ones. But this one lasts entire day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m brand new to the natural product world, and definitely wasn&#x27;t looking for something to be this amazing right out of the gate. I spray once under each arm once a day, and this stuff holds up. I go to work all day for 8 hours, then hit up the gym for an hour or two after. This stuff lasts, and you hardly know you have it on.  The smell isn&#x27;t even something I can really smell after the initial spray. Smells like a nice incense for a few seconds, and then unless you stick your fingers into your pits and pull them out to smell, which I know some of us do (raises hand cause he&#x27;s sure).....that is pretty much the only time you get a whiff of anything. Get it , love it, and good luck fellow pit sniffers!</li>
    <li> Too strong for me, but it does work.</li>
    <li> Stains white shirts really badly.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this a try becasue it is all natural. It seems to work but we are in winter. The true test will be summer. That being said. It&#x27;s good so far.</li>
    <li> Stinks and stays in the clothes after washing.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant spray, it is so pleasant, no musky odor and it works.</li>
    <li> I first bought it on 11/4/2013, and I bought two of them. I like the fact that it&#x27;s aluminum free, and it&#x27;s fragrance is good too - not too strong but strong enough to de-odor. It&#x27;s economical too. One to two sprays for each side everyday, and it lasts for a whole day. The second bottle is running out today (1/24/2014). Considering its affordability, economy, efficiency and healthiness, I think I would stick to this great product for a very long time.</li>
    <li> It really works!  I&#x27;ve been trying to transition from anti perspiration products to deodorants but many leave me dissatisfied.  This doesn&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t smell at the end of the day!  One thing I noticed though was that the first time I used it, my underarms burned a little.  After day one,  no burn.  Definitely going to continue with this product.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I found this product. It have changed my life, and the way to use deodorant, in simple works, an amazing product for my skin type. As a Latina woman I love to smell clean and fresh snd the deodorant does it&#x27;s job! amazing!! I will purchase it away and I do recommended it.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s working for me. I receive the product sooner that I expected, and I started using it immediately, and it&#x27;s working for me!</li>
    <li> Works well and smells nice.  A little goes a long way but I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this item again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! Being in the skin care business, I am familiar with ingredients. Using the Laminaria seaweed extract for its antibacterial properties is genius. I know it has a slight smell, but by the time it dries, the smell is gone. I am not a big Patchouli fan, but it is an antiseptic and bactericidal essential oil. I get why it is used in this deodorant. I love that this deodorant doesn&#x27;t use synthetic perfume to mask body odor. It uses natural ingredients to prevent odor. I have worn so many anti-perspirants and deodorants over the years. None stopped my odor like this one. I live in a humid climate, so in the summer, when I take off my blouse and the underarms smell good, i am happy!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this product but I decided to try it and I no longer have any doubts. I live in Florida, outside! It works just as well as deodorants I&#x27;ve been using for years. It&#x27;s pricey but I&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for about a month; and I must say it seems to get the job done.  I usually work 12 or 15 hours a day and at the end of the day, I still don&#x27;t smell bad.  I like that it&#x27;s all natural and not man made chemicals.  And the little bottle appears to last a long time, as it&#x27;s only used about 1/4 of the bottle, and I probably use more sprays than necessary each time.  Is made for men or women, but doesn&#x27;t have a real manly scent.</li>
    <li> Good smell. Not an antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, Get it!. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Definitely a nice and healthier alternative. You have to get used to the smell but I like it.</li>
    <li> Good product. Does what was advertised,  although after a couple of weeks of daily use, the effect wore off. Also the pump stalls after one squirt.  Then you have to shake it A few times and wait for a minute before trying fir a second squirt.</li>
    <li> Best product I have found. No irritation and it works great. It is long lasting and very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Despite what I&#x27;ve read from other&#x27;s reviews, this product smells great.  It is not a strong scent; just right.  I stay fresh all day long and the aerosol is set to not overspray and be wasteful.  I imagine this will last me a few months at least.  I will reorder this product again and again.  It is also priced very reasonably.  Great product and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating it as two stars simply because the smell is overwhelming.  It smells very strong and I was embarrassed at work while wearing this. I could only imagine what others were smelling if I couldn&#x27;t stand how *I*smelled.  That said, I guess it does control body odor since the scent is so strong. I immediately came home from work and showered and now I have a headache from smelling like I was at a hippie festival all day long..ugh.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it has done a good job of keeping me smelling fresh too.</li>
    <li> I love that this is an all natural product, however, it smells horrible!  I think I&#x27;d rather give off body odor than this scent.  Please, please, please do something about the scent and this product will be perfect!  Let&#x27;s be clear, this product does fight body odor but the smell totally defeats the purpose!  I don&#x27;t know about anyone else but I wouldn&#x27;t mind a few chemicals added to make it smell better if that&#x27;s what it takes.  I am not against chemicals just harsh chemicals and/or chemical levels that are toxic.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased my second bottle of this deodorant spray so you can tell I really like it. This is the first deodorant that I never have to wonder if it is working. Yes, in hot weather and in stressful situations I do perspire but there is not any odor. The protection lasts all day long and through the night.  Once I forgot to use it and  had no problems as it still lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;While the price per bottle may seem expensive at first glance, it is worth it since it doesn&#x27;t take a lo of product to work. I have used my current bottle for more than five months and I still have a bit left.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers complained about how it smells. When using an all natural product there is no perfume used and this is one of the reasons I purchased it in the first place.  (I got used to the scent after a few days and now I hardly notice it.)&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this deodorant spray.</li>
    <li> The ingredients really organic, but i can&#x27;t stand the smell. It smells like men deodorant :(</li>
    <li> This product has great ingredients. I have been looking for an aluminum free deodorant that actually worked. It eliminates the body odor. It is paraben free. The spray works great as compare to roll on deodorant. The smell is cool. It keeps me odor free whole day. I am really impressed with this deodorant spray.</li>
    <li> Hard to describe the smell. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t smell like a loud perfume. It&#x27;s a good buy. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Natural deodorants that actually work are hard to come by.  This product lives up to its name.  I appreciate all the natural ingredients and feel safe using it.  Thank you for making something that actually works.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  No irritation at all.</li>
    <li> I really happy I discovered this natural deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried lots of types of deodorants in my search for an Effective aluminum-free option that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation. That includes commercial organic deodorants &amp; even homemade recipes.  The homemade one was the most effective, but caused me to have a rash. This one is almost as effective, but no rash &amp; no skin irritation at all. I&#x27;ve even managed to get my husband using it too &amp; I could never get him to stop using mitchum deodorant before,  so that is saying a lot. The only thing I&#x27;m not overly happy with is the patchouli oil smell. I&#x27;m sure that is a personal preference,  as I was actually complimented on how I smell.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me now,  since I use it every day,  but if someone says you smell like patchouli,  it isn&#x27;t usually meant as a compliment. Regardless, I still highly recommend this product &amp; I will buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Works, but this deodorant is not for me.  I read the reviews and wanted to like this, but the scent is too strong.  Overpowers my perfume.  It goes on easy, and seems to work, I&#x27;m just personally not a fan of the strong scent.  I will be returning but purchasing something else in its place because this company --Vi-Tae makes great products that I do love.  This was a personal opinion, but I can see how some would like this.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s natural an aluminum free. I wasn&#x27;t so sure it would really work, but it does! The spray has a nice pleasant scent and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I purchased two bottles again.  This spray is wonderful.  First, no propellant in a can.  Second, no can!  Third, it smells very good.  Oh, yeah, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.  The aluminum in most antiperspirants wreaks havoc with my skin.  Not this deodorant  At first look, it may seem expensive.  On a per-use basis, it is actually cheap.  One bottle lasts me and my wife for a long time.  Kudos. Vi-Tae!</li>
    <li> I am a 62 year old woman who has had a perspiration odor problem since my teens. Menopause has taken care of the wetness problem but I had persistent odor that the usual anti-persperant/deodorants just could not cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been wonderful, odor is caused by bacteria and this product works when it says it kills bacteria. At first the patchouli scent was distracting but I have quickly gotten used to it. It won&#x27;t control wetness if that&#x27;s your issue but it will help with odor.</li>
    <li> This states several times on the amazon page that it does not contain aluminium. However, if you look at the ingredient list, it contains Ammonium alum. Ammonium alum is another name for Ammonium aluminium sulfate, which is an aluminium compound.</li>
    <li> I would be happy to try this product except for 2 reasons: a) patchouli and b) nearly $10.00 for only 4.5 oz? Yikes. Thanks I&#x27;ll continue looking.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many natural deodorants and this one is honestly by far the best I have tried. I did not like the smell of it at first and thought how could this help, but it does. I love it!</li>
    <li> Works well. I like that there is nothing harmful (to my knowledge) in it. I tend to go for natural products. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*DISCLAIMER: I purchased this specific product at a discount. This review contains my honest and unbiased feedback. All thoughts/opinions are my own entirely. Everything written above is the result of my time testing the product and my personal opinion on it. I have no affiliation with this brand or company; The product was simply purchased and received by me as a tester. Thank you for reading, I hope I helped you make an informed decision. :)</li>
    <li> I am becoming obsessed with this product. It smells so good and lasts all day long. I have even caught my husband using it. I feel so great about using this all natural product. I couldnt be happier with it. I will most certainly reorder when I run out!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Compared to other natural deoderant homemade and not, this one takes the cake! Compared to non natural ones this one doesn&#x27;t last as long. Will work like an antiperspant for 6 hours before needing to be replied. This is the best NATURAL deoderant, and I have tried them all! Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Having a natural product with no aluminum in it is very important to me. So far it is working wonderfully! Have yet to have a really heavy work day but it has worked so well for normal use I have no fear.</li>
    <li> We bought this for my wife because so many people said that it smelled wonderful and worked great.  Unfortunately, my wife has only been able to wear it once because the scent is so strong, it causes her to get migraines or for an existing migraine to get worse.  In our opinion, it has a very strong scent similar to patchouli.  Unfortunately, patchouli is one of our least favorite smells on Earth.  My wife still plans on attempting it on a day when her head isn&#x27;t hurting, but use a very, very small amount to see if it is effective and if the scent is less over-powering.  She is very disappointed, she had really counted on this stuff being wonderful for her.</li>
    <li> It smells very &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a very effective product. Really controls odor and is gentle on skin, no irritation. Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for an all-natural alternative to aluminum and paraben-filled commercial deodorants. I am a fit young woman who eats well and bathes regularly, but for some reason I was smelling strongly of unpleasant body odor when going sans-deodorant or even when using products such as Crystal Clear, Now, Desert Essence, and Jason natural deodorants. I would apply in the AM and be able to notice BO only a few hours later, which another application would not completely mask. I do not have a labor-intensive job, though it can get moderately stressful and the building temperature does reach above 70ºF at times, which is warm when you wear a polyester smock over street clothes, sometimes paired with gloves, a mask, or both. So, normal amounts of perspiration with uncomfortably noticeable body odor not touched by most natural deodorants lead me in the search to find a better product. I&#x27;ve tried arrow root powder and I do like the way it neutralizes odor, but it&#x27;s messy to put on in most situations and leaves an obvious white residue on the arm pits which isn&#x27;t that attractive. The other downside to most products I&#x27;ve tried is the irritation and itchiness that occurs, which other reviews have mentioned. This deodorant however does not irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d normally use a stick, so making the switch to a spray was a little different, but the Vi-Tae All Natural Deodorant Spray dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on me or my clothes, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or anything. I was a little skeptical of the &amp;#34;mineral salts&amp;#34;, but have been pleasantly surprised as this deodorant lasts me through my 10 hour shifts and even into bed where my boyfriend compliments me saying I smell nice. I only need two sprays right after washing and that lasts me. The only cautionary statement I have is the Vi-Tae All Natural Deodorant does have patchouli oil in it, which can be a controversial scent for some and it is one of the more noticeable scents of this product.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a fantastic product and I would highly recommend you give it a try!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! It&#x27;s the only kind that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash under my arms. It really works! It smells fresh and it keeps me smelling great!</li>
    <li> This has worked great!</li>
    <li> I love, love , love this product!!! I am worry free now that I&#x27;ve converted to this natural product. I have hot flashes almost daily now due to menopausal phase I&#x27;m in now and this can lead to smelly underarms! I feel good knowing that I&#x27;m not spraying chemicals and metals into my underarms and absorbing them into my system. I had tried the crystals and other natural deodorant sticks and I didn&#x27;t like the results. They seemed to wear off and not provide me with the confidence of knowing they were working. This product is easy to use. Just a few spritzes under each arm after getting out of the shower and it is with you all day long! The scent is pleasant and clean smelling. Highly recommend you try this! It is worth the cost!</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I need - a non-aluminum spray deodorant.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong, all day strong. Even if you had body odor you would not notice it due to the overwhelming smell of patchouli. The smell does come of when you shower, well mostly.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it so far!!!  Very good product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using 100% Confident for the last month and I LOVE IT! Finally I&#x27;ve found a deodorant I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin!</li>
    <li> love it works great..</li>
    <li> This spray does what it claims to do but be prepared to smell like a man if you are a woman. I don&#x27;t mind it at all since I am familiar with essential oils and natural products but my boyfriend does not like how I smell like a man fresh out of the shower. However, he did say &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike others who have left reviews for this product I do not have an excessive body odor problem, so I cannot speak from that stand point. But I do not like to wear regular deodorant because of the residue it leaves behind and how it gets all over my clothes and often hard to remove in the shower. This deodorant spray can easily replace my deo but I must spray it on throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Really awesome product! Love the fragrance, and it does a great job!</li>
    <li> I am very happy to find this deodorant. At first I was skeptical because most natural deodorants do not really work well. This one was a nice surprise. The only minor problem is that the spray bottle does not always spray well and I have to shake the bottle between each spray but I can live with it.&lt;br /&gt;I think that it is stronger than Lafes Natural Crystal Natural and Organic Deodorant Crystal Stone.</li>
    <li> This deoderant spray is wonderful. It really works, and without all the nasty chemicals.  I like the EO&#x27;s that are used for fragrence.  This lasts all day, and honestly I find that I am not perspiring much either. I use 2 pumps and I am good to go.  If you have a big problem with smell, then I would suggest possibly using it 2x/day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to conventional deodorants so over the years I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every natural deodorant on the market.  Most of them don&#x27;t work at all, some of them work a little, but this is the first I&#x27;ve tried that actually works!  It works and it doesn&#x27;t make my armpits itch or break out after a few days of use - that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been looking for all this time.  Yay!</li>
    <li> I was really hopeful due to other peoples reviews.  I have strong underarm odor, and wanted something less chemical.  But this stuff smelled very musky and masculine to begin with, not feminine or fresh, and within 15 minutes I could smell my own underarm odor on top of it.  I would definitely not recommend this to anyone else.  Sorry I bought it.  More money wasted.</li>
    <li> excited to give this a try</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. I am a nurse and stay pretty busy for about 10-12 hours. I have used this deodorant for about 6 months and it keeps me dry and odor free. I love the fragrance of this product..not too overpowering. I also like that it is paraben free as well. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a deodorant without all of the unnecessary ingredients but one that will work. Five stars from me!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product...all natural, subtle and it works.  It is in a glass bottle, not plastic, which I also appreciate.  The supplier was very conscientious and courteous with follow up too.  This is really a lovely, effective and natural product.  I would recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great value!  Does not take long to dry.  I only need two sprays per arm so I expect it will last a while and it keeps me dry and odor-free.  I LOVE that it&#x27;s not tested on animals and does not contain harmful chemicals!  Pleasant odor, too.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for more than a year and am very satisfied with it.  So.e do not like smell, but I find it disappears quickly and is no problem.  It also seems to work even better the longer the product is used.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> It seams like this product works well as antiperspirant, although I just got it couple days ago and used it twice, but definitely can feel the difference . The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is the smell of it . I absolutely hate the smell of it . I did notice that it goes away after short period of time and basically  your arm pits don&#x27;t have any smell which is good (that&#x27;s the goal :) ), but at the moment that I apply it it&#x27;s just disgusting . It&#x27;s just my subjective scene of smell, that&#x27;s all . It would be nice if it smelled better... well at least different . I will recommend it to my friend that especially concerned with aluminum in antiperspirant. That is a good non invasive alternative, since it&#x27;s the only one so far that I could find .</li>
    <li> This item works, but it&#x27;s a bit high in price. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be buying again, unless there&#x27;s a price change.</li>
    <li> The smell is so powerful and reminds me of bug spray or something.  I cannot bring myself to smell like this all day long.  Maybe on my feet or inside shoes, it&#x27;ll be great, but not on my body.  It does not control sweating either, of course - no antiperspirant. Was rather disappointed in the smell of this product.  I would like it more if it smelled like a baby powder or vanilla.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says.  If you are sensitive to strong aromas you will want to purchase the unscented version because the Patchouli has a strong scent.  Works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great smelling/working body spray. Definitely going to order again. I love the faint patchouli smell and the all natural ingredients. Well done.</li>
    <li> Since moving back to Florida, I&#x27;ve toggled between deodorants as nothing seemed to keep me fresh. Vi-Tae solved this issue.  I workout sincerely and I was often smelly after my sessions...No longer is this an issue.  I am confident all day long! This is a staple in my house!</li>
    <li> If you like to pamper yourself with excellent products that use natural oils and smell wonderful, this deodorant is for you! When I first used this deodorant, the thing that wowed me (and my daughter) is the scent. I love lavender and it has a relaxing effect. The smell to me, is heavenly. The other thing I love about this product is that it makes your skin nice and smooth, a beauty product for your underarms! No white deodorant marks, just smooth, soft skin that you can actually touch after putting on deodorant and no worries applying this after shaving as I believe it is beneficial to skin and soothes razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is full of wonderful, natural oils and plant extracts that make it stand out as a very top notch product especially if you like using products with natural ingredients. I normally use a strong deodorant and only one or two commercial deodorants really work for me but this one truly does work surprisingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of pluses for Vi-Tae 100% Confident - It smells and works great. It comes in a pretty spray bottle that produces a nice refreshing spritz to your pits. It makes skin soft and it&#x27;s hypoallergenic for people with sensitive skin. The spray from the bottle is a light, refreshing burst of natural extracts and oils that fully covers your underarms making the amount that you purchase in this sized bottle long lasting. This contains great stuff like Tea Tree oil (no overpowering scent) Patchouli (one of my favorites) and sage and seaweed extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked for a sample and was supplied one by Vi Tae. I really like this product and the way that it surpasses commercial deodorants by miles. I will purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your product.</li>
    <li> She likes it!&lt;br /&gt;My Mother in Law is allergic to most deoderants and when I saw this I bought it for her.  She is thrilled with it to say the least.  It is comfortable and does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> it contains aluminum it is real scam don&#x27;t buy and please amazon block this scam seller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;people don&#x27;t buy this harmful deodorant SCAM SCAM SCAM</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good deodorant that doesn&#x27;t ruin clothes or make me break out in a rash. Unfortunately, a lot of choices in-store suck. Didn&#x27;t really run into many great choices online either..    Not crazy about patchouli, but it&#x27;s not too strong and it blends well with my man-stink. Works better than the menthol-scented cancer that was my last aerosol deodorant.    --------    UPDATE: This did work better than my previous deodorant, but after using it for a few months I&#x27;ve come to realize it doesn&#x27;t stop the breakouts. I&#x27;ve since switched to a crystal hypoallergenic deodorant that&#x27;s fragrance and paraben free. We&#x27;ll see how that works out..</li>
    <li> This deodorant looks promising, but has to many chemicals that could be harmful to my body. I tried many natural deodorants that did not work and or irritated by armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a cancer survivor and since have eliminated all toxic chemicals that use to fill my daily life. I purged all household chemicals from; laundry detergent, to perfume, to beauty products, to skin care (including deodorant) and replaced all of them with toxin-free, organic choices and have never been happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently found an organic deodornat that actually works perfectly all day. The deodorant I use is face naturals organic grapefruit cream deodorant. Face naturals deodorants have zero harmful chemicals and they are made with food grade ingredients. Face naturals deodorant ingredients are so good, you can even eat them. If you are looking for a non-toxic, alcohol-free deodorant, you should consider skipping this one and try face naturals organic deodorants.</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it goes on as a light mist and it is clear.  The smell is really earthy which I like and the best part is it works.</li>
    <li> Product smells great and is very clean. Will be using this deodorant from now on</li>
    <li> There should be warning for those of us that have airborne allergies and asthma.  The smells are so potent my husband smelled it the moment he came in the house at 5pm, even though I had put it on at 9am in our master bathroom three rooms away from our front door.  The smell was so strong that after an hour of hoping it would dissipate some, I changed my shirt and washed my armpits with soap.  All day long I could taste the smells, and even after trying to wash it off, I spent the rest of the day with the smells making me sick to my stomach along with a bad sinus headache and difficulty with my sinuses and lungs!  So if you are sensitive to strong smells such as cologne or perfume, have allergies or asthma, you might not want to try this.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!!!  I have become immune to regular deodorants and they flat don&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants and this is not only the first one to work, it completely exceeded any expectations I had about a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many reviews claim the scent is very strong, even too strong; this is only temporary and goes away within a few minutes once the product dries.  Once dry, a soft lavender scent remains that is very very pleasant.  Additionally, many of the reviews I&#x27;ve read claim it isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant; the salts function as an antiperspirant and it is quite effective for me.  In fact, I haven&#x27;t noticed any more wetness using this product than using any other normal antiperspirant. As we get closer to the summer, I will be willing to put up with a little more sweating to know I&#x27;m not using the aluminum in a normal deodorant that&#x27;s absorbed into my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a fantastic natural product that is completely effective and it is 100% worthy of replacing your normal deodorant and its better for your health; its a win, win!</li>
    <li> After years and years of switching through various drug store deodorants - Suave, Secret, Dove, Tom&#x27;s, Mitchum, you name it - nothing has worked quite like this. It smells nice going on and dries quickly. No residue or sticky-ness. I still get a bit of wetness under my arms on hot days but no body odor! And the customer service...oh my goodness. The PRESIDENT of the company personally responded to my question about the money-back guarantee - and yes, it&#x27;s a promise! Wonderful product, awesome feedback on Vi-Tae&#x27;s part, so pleased. I hope it works just as well for you too! :)</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant.  I like that its in a spray bottle - less messy to use.  No worry about nasty ingredients.  It really works for  - I use 2 sprays.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Just a couple of sprays and No need to reapply all day - no smell or odor even after extremely hot sweaty day of yard work!</li>
    <li> Has been pretty hot, but not complete humidity so I might be revising this review later on, but so far I love, love this spray. It really does keep you dry &amp; feeling secure that you are not absorbing poisons &amp; toxins into your body through your skin. I look forward to trying out more of their line for myself &amp; for my family. The scent is very clean, but does smell like the lavender oils so don&#x27;t expect flowery. I just love everything about it except the price lol...but will pay for our health.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for this product, I&#x27;m so pleased and also impressed with the results. Great deodorant. I used to be a smelly person but with this product I discovered that you can sweat wihout smell bad.</li>
    <li> This is a very High Quality product, I as many others have tried various natural deodorants and they just don&#x27;t last long . The Smell is extremely pleasant for me, it adds a depth to my cologne, I work at FedEx and I sweat allot , I normally use &amp;#34;arm and hammer essentials&amp;#34; which is a very good natural deodorant,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now I combine this Vi-Tae deodorant spray with arm and hammer essentials and it works great, that being said I also have tried it by itself, i recommend 2-3 sprays if your working a hard job, and 1-2 if your just at a desk job....Its so good you will wish you had bought two!</li>
    <li> Update 12.8.15  Vi-tae recently changed their packaging... They also changed the product (just received a new bottle).  The product doesn&#x27;t smell like it used to and it does not work anymore!  Within 2 hours of showering and heading out for my day I noticed the deodorant wasn&#x27;t working.  This product used to be great.  Why change a perfect product?!?!  This is the best product I have used thus far.  I have HS a condition with the glands/skin in the axilla area  (underarm)  this is the only item I have been able to use.  The smell is nice, a mix of lemongrass and lavender with citrus.  All the junk in conventional deodorant exacerbated my condition... This is gentle on my skin and works.</li>
    <li> Fabulous! This smells good, and you don&#x27;t smell like a skunk 3 hours later! I can go all day and still smell good! and it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes!</li>
    <li> I have been using this once a day, right after bathing and drying off. It does have a woody scent, but it is not over-powering. I am a female, and it isn&#x27;t overly masculine to wear. It smells clean, but not overbearing. Even once the scent has worn off, there is no sweaty odor after a long day of being a mom. I am not a fan of masking odor. I&#x27;d rather just avoid odor altogether. This prevents odor. Job well done. With all of that said, I love the natural smell of sandalwood and patchouli. This doesn&#x27;t have any sandalwood, that I can tell. The patchouli is there, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like you just exited a VW  bus with flower power painted on the exterior. It&#x27;s muted. I wear no perfumes, but I do use coconut oil with my favorite EOs added. I smell clean, not perfumed. This deodorant fits right in with my personal hygiene regimen.</li>
    <li> I simply could not get past the smell.  And it&#x27;s way too expensive.  I love organic, and no aluminum, but given the crazy high price and the super strong smell, I&#x27;ll pass.  It would be nice if there was a good quality organic, aluminum free deodorant for women with breast cancer.  Chemo often makes folks very sensitive to smell, and they could use something reasonably priced.  Even not being sensitive to smell, this just is overbearing.  The price per ounce is just outlandish!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have always had a problem with underarm odor and have tried many different deoderants. This is by far my favorite. I will buy again! 3 sprays under my arm and I can go all day without odor. 8) I&#x27;m a happy user of  this Vi-Tae product!</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used in along time.  It lasts longer than most.  Really like it.</li>
    <li> I did some research on how harmful regular deodorants that have aluminum in them are and decided to switch to something natural. I tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine first since that was the only natural deodorant at Wal-Mart but that one left me with a rash after a few days so I must have been allergic to something in it. I then went on Amazon and found this product by a company I had bought from in the past (try their bath products, they are awesome!). . I waited a couple weeks to try it out before writing a review and I can now say that I have found the one I will use from now on. The smell is strong at first (very herby) but it tames down after awhile. I work on a loading dock with no AC so the fact that I wore this and at the end of the day I can still smell the deodorant tells you that this product really works.&lt;br /&gt;If you do research you will discover that when you first switch to a natural deodorant you might notice you have body odor. That is natural and will go away after a few days. It is simply your pores clearing themselves of the bacteria harboring in your armpits. To speed up the process I simply used a cotton pad with witch hazel under my arms after a shower. I already used it on  my face after a shower so it was a simple add on to my routine. **Update 9/17/15** I saw that they came out with a natural deodorant that is made for a woman and I love the smell so much! If you like Jasmine, Lavender and Rose you will love this!</li>
    <li> The best all natural deodorant that actually WORKS.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. The girlfriend can&#x27;t keep her hands off of me :)</li>
    <li> Smell takes a bit to get used to. Does its job.</li>
    <li> Indeed this all natural deodorant does work! Finally...I have tough body odor and no over the counter deodorants have ever worked like this one does. It&#x27;s a little on the spendy side; but, for the effectiveness of this spray, I&#x27;ll pay it. The scent is a little on the strong side, but I noticed if I only spray twice and allow it to dry it&#x27;s perfectly fine. The best part is...I don&#x27;t have pungent under arm odor anymore. UPDATE REVIEW - This past weekend I traveled for business. Due to TSA regulations I couldn&#x27;t take this deodorant with me as it is over the 2 ounce limit and I didn&#x27;t check any bags. Instead I took my standby natural crystal stick knowing that it would keep me smell free....NOT. Oh my word, NOW I know this deodorant spray works and so do the other passengers on the plane (sorry guys)!</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t like waiting for my pits to dry.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> I can give an honest rating on the product, because the spray bottle I received doesn&#x27;t work properly. It smells good though.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great ,no allergic reaction. Very nice scent . My wife is in love with me again . Like being on a honey moon after 21 years of marriage .This spray is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have been on a search to find an all natural deodorant that glided on well and did not smell weird. This spray has an unusual smell that I was not sure about. My fiance and hair stylist told me I had a funky old lady smell... I definitely knew it was the deodorant and not my Chanel perfume. The search is on or I will try to add a liquid lavandar scent to see if it smells better.</li>
    <li> This works. I was beginning to think that there was nothing I could do because I&#x27;ve become allergic to antiperspirant because I had tried everything at the health food store. I was pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ve even got my husband to use it and he&#x27;s addicted as well. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I was concerned that without all the harmful chemicals added to most commercial deodorants,  it would be strong enough to take care of&lt;br /&gt;my odor problem when perspiring. I am happy to say that I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I have allergies so its great to find a hypoallergenic natural deodorant!  Which is hard to come by. Its not sticky or too dry. Works well!</li>
    <li> Nice smell, feels comfortable on.  It lasts all day</li>
    <li> I will never buy this again. It smells very bad and it does do anything that it claims to do.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but this stuff really works!! A few sprays and you&#x27;ll be good to go!!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product.  It comes very well secured.  I gave each armpit 4 sprays and didn&#x27;t sweat.  I&#x27;ve never tried a natural deordant but this works quite well!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I read a review that said of all the all natural deodorants out there, sprays usually work the best. I could not find the brand that was recommended in the blog I read by a lady who had personally tested 12 different brands of all natural deodorants each over and extended period of time (at least 2 weeks) and in both moderate and very active conditions. The blogger noted that she typically sweat like a pig and was especially stinky after being very active. In her experience, she said that sprays usually worked better than solids, but made recommendations for both based on her experimentation and resulting experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I could not find the #1 brand that she recommended on Amazon, I did find the one in the #2 spot, this one was not even mentioned. Her top 3 all natural deodorants were all sprays by the way. So I came across this deodorant spray by Vi-Tae and decided to give it a try after reading the number of positive reviews and the noting the moderate price point. I also read every negative comment and Vi-Tae&#x27;s response to those that complained. In every instance, the negative reviewer was either uniformed, misunderstood, or did not contact the company personally to try and resolve their complaint. In every instance, Vi-Tae responded to the complaints they left in their negative reviews attempting to resolve the issue or inform the reviewer of proper information to resolve any misunderstanding on the part of the reviewer, and even reminded them of the 100% satisfaction guarantee. So it was obvious to me that this company is actively involved in their customer experience and provided outstanding customer service, and that the bad reviews were almost always based on misunderstanding on the part of the reviewer. There were so few of them anyhow. I always read the bad reviews on products to see if the complaints were legitimate problems or if the bad reviews are by people that lack common sense and it became apparent to me that it was obviously the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have not had very much experience with all natural deodorants, having only tried one other brand that was a solid. The solid I tried caused me to break out in a rash the first 3 or 4 times I used it, even though it was all natural, hypoallergenic, and aluminum and all the other bad stuff...free. I later determined that it was a reaction between the Arm &amp; Hammer aluminum laden deodorant I had been using that was still clogging the pores in my pits and the new all natural deodorant I was trying for the first time, even after vigorous washing and scrubbing with a loofah. I made this determination through simple deduction. You see, I was still using the Arm &amp; Hammer when I was going to work because I was afraid that the all natural deodorant was not going to be strong enough under the active conditions I have when I am at work, as I had often heard this was a complaint among all natural deodorants. So I would break out in a rash when I was using both and switched back and forth for several days thinking that maybe my system needed to get used to the all natural deodorant or something, but it never seemed to stop until....I completely stopped using the chemical and metal laden deodorant I was using and switched to the all natural one solely, so problem solved. But that was when I noticed that the all natural deodorant was not working as well as it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging said it would provide 48 hour protection from odor, wrong. I would last about 8 or 9 hours and then I would start to smell, but not bad enough that others would notice, and I only noticed because I did a test sniff when I came home and changed out of my work cloths. So that was rather disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried this one and have made it through an entire day all the way till now, and it is almost 1 am! Already I am very impressed, this has far outperformed the other all natural deodorant I tried. The smell is pleasant, but not strong and diminished quickly after it dried. I have not perspired at all either, so that is a plus. There is not even the slightest detection of odor, I smell as fresh as if I had just showered. I will give this an extended field testing and update my review after some extended use and more active conditions, but already, I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a good all natural deodorant.</li>
    <li> It gave me an instant headache. The scent of marijuana does the same thing and this reminds me of it. I bought it because of the great reviews it got from other people but I guess everyone is different. I would not recommend it to my friends but if other people do not mind this kind of scent, you can go ahead and buy it. I received it on the estimated date. I had a problem but when I contacted customer service, I received the help that I needed. This seller is great so please go ahead and purchase their product.</li>
    <li> I love this, so much better than my roll on deodorant!</li>
    <li> This is by bar the most effective natural deodorant I have ever used. I am impressed.</li>
    <li> Good product. Good smell. Does what was advertised, although after a couple of weeks of daily use, the effect wore off.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is now a part of my morning routine. Easy to apply spray bottle, and fresh, subtle scent make it simple to apply and enjoy. I never realized what was in my usual deodorants until I looked closely thanks to this product. Now, I get all of the benefits and the peace-of-mind. Give it a try and compare it to what you currently use.</li>
    <li> Not for me.  The smell is awful!!!!!!  I sprayed it on my hand and couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough.  My son stopped over and asked me what was that terrible smell?</li>
