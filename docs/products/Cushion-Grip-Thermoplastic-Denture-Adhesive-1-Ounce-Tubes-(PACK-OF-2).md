      <li>hope that ANOTHER company takes heed &amp; develops a similar product, &amp; sells it at a REASONABLE price!!!!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need anything to hold my upper dentures , but Cushion Grip  is perfect for hard to hold lower dentures.  </li>

      <li>The Cushion Grip is OK for cushion, but the Adhesive part sucks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very upset that this product was taken off of the market as it is the only product that works.  </li>

    <li> perfect. works really well. Better than anything else we have used.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me, WISH it did..........</li>
    <li> Great product, I have used it for 40 years. I don&#x27;t understand why it is so difficult to find. I used to recommend it to people I know with dentures.</li>
    <li> Fast service, Fast delivery. Just as described. I love this product! It works so easily and cleaning is simple.</li>
    <li> I just love it! Helps my bottom dentures fit so much better.</li>
    <li> Soft thermoplastic adhesive is a BIG improvement over the older zinc paste stuff.  I recommend it highly.  Best if rinsed after fitting.</li>
    <li> The best denture adhesive I have found to date. Really holds my dentures in place.</li>
    <li> very happy with all the services quality and price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Sure wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued.</li>
    <li> I have used various dental adhesive products before using Cushion Grip. All either oozed out and/or made me ill. Since I tried Cushion Grip I found that it also oozed no matter how thinly I applied it. With that said, this product does hold up to it&#x27;s claim of lasting for four days, As a point of fact it lasted a full week even after taking my dentures out for nightly cleaning and putting them back in the next morning. For this I&#x27;m pleased, though I can&#x27;t bite solid food which may be in part of my dentures not fitting properly but it&#x27;s so much better than other brands which are just horrible to use.</li>
    <li> Used it for years. So glad to have found it again!</li>
    <li> I have seen using cushion grip for the last ten years and it does a very good job for me.</li>
    <li> Great product but too expensive and hard to find.</li>
    <li> Used this for several years, have Zero  complaints.</li>
    <li> It does what no other can concerning your comfort.</li>
    <li> excellent product and I am devastated that they are no longer making it!</li>
    <li> I love this product have to have it I&#x27;ve lost weight it&#x27;s the only thing that works will be looking for cheaper prices</li>
    <li> The product was what I expected I have used it for a long time , could not find it at my local store. The product was priced very high twice the price I was paying but it is the only product that works for me</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff, if you use it like the instuctions</li>
    <li> I would not be able to eat or even go out in public without this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;I will be a lifetime fan.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It is the best for my lower denture comfort.  The extreme price is due to the company stopped making the product.  Sure hope some company will make it in the future at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Happy to find it, but the cost is outrageous for an item that was 7 times lower!</li>
    <li> My mother in law and my husband love this product. Just wish we could find in stores. but the speed in getting thru Amazon is good.</li>
    <li> Its great  stuff and should never been taken off local shelves...........</li>
    <li> Item as described.  New in package.  Excellent product!!!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Love love love this product however the price is totally high way robbery!! Why was it taken off the market?? I use to get it at cvs for 7.99 for a six inch tube.</li>
    <li> Thought this was going to be a fix till I was due for my Soft Reline... But it gets SOOO hard it hurts!</li>
    <li> i can not imagine why the maker decided to stop making cushion grip.  it is big demand and i can not believe that the day will come when i can no longer find it.  what big mistake.  if only they would have put it many more stores, they would have sold it by the truck loads.  i just hope somebody will see the need for it and  start making it again  I LOVE IT:::::::::::::thank amazon for making it possible to get i. even tho the price was way over the top.  i had never paid  that much for it. the most i ever paid for it was about 5.OO TO 6.OO DOLLARS per tube.&lt;br /&gt;thank goodness i found more on ebay.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years but is getting hard to find in some areas  Great product will buy more online as needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Dan Smith</li>
    <li> I have always used cushion grip since I have had dentures and it was getting hard to find,so I chose Amazon and they had it.I rely on Amazon as I can always rely on them as they usually have what I am lookiing for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had sore spots on my bottom gums for years and this wonderful product has cured my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to let it set for 10 minutes or so before putting them back in your mouth as the flavor of the grip is not pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have been using for years and it never has failed me yet...better than other denture adhesives on the market.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as good fixodent and costs a lot more. I tried it three different times with no luck.</li>
    <li> Great stuff  too bad the seller has to charge a arm and a leg for a product that should only cost $10.00&lt;br /&gt;Instead I had to pay $130 for 2 tube&lt;br /&gt;My poor grandma has used this for 20 plus years had no choice  ...</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband, he loves it&lt;br /&gt;thank you! It works just as described.  He says it works better than normal adhesive</li>
    <li> Excellent and interesting material . . .it&#x27;s easy to work with, and allows a fast job.  The Cushion Grip solved a problem with a lower denture.  It is definitely a satisfactory purchase.</li>
    <li> cushion grip works okay with secure</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed that this did not work for my husband. I followed directions exactly and tried it three times. It never lasted through a day.</li>
    <li> The Cushion Grip is OK for cushion, but the Adhesive part sucks.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Hard too find, Super!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very upset that this product was taken off of the market as it is the only product that works.  I&#x27;m also upset that the price is so incredibly inflated over drug store prices that I used to purchase it for.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, I have used it for a number of years.  It creates the best and most comfortable fit for my dentures of any product out there and lasts the longest.  I&#x27;ve tried every single, similar product on the market, but Cushion Grip works the best and in my opinion is by far the best there is.</li>
    <li> This is the best way to relieve denture pain and I can&#x27;t afford to have my dentures religned, so this is an acceptable quick fix.</li>
    <li> excellent for making dentures comfortable....no irritation....I recommend cushion grip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 60-year-old semi-professional singer. For years I had battled with the insecure feeling of dentures that seemed to be wobbly, and I was using globs of Poligrip. No longer! Cushion Grip has been a lifesaver. This stuff really works! The trick (I have learned) is to get a good impression, and then leave your dentures out in the air for as long as possible (even overnight). This will cure the plastic and the liner will last much longer. Then, pop in your dentures with a bit of Poligrip and you&#x27;re good to go. When they loosen up as the Poligrip degrades, remove and immediately rinse with COLD water. This will let you scrub away the Poligrip without destroying the liner. Also, when the Cushion Grip seeps over the top edges of your denture, do not trim it away. If possible, leave it in place. This will make the seal - and the Cushion Grip liner - stay in place longer.</li>
    <li> Just a day later than promised but well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Please delete this review as the copy I saw has my full name on it, not the FM that should have been published. I do not want my full name on any review. Thank You !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Ok but to expensive for me to buy will have to look elsewhere for cheaper price</li>
    <li> This product works, don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
    <li> This is really great stuff, I use it all the time</li>
    <li> This is the best nothing else works as well</li>
    <li> Cushion Grip is the only denture product I have found that really helps not only keep my dentures in place but it reduces mouth soreness immensely.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome and absolutely works as stated. When we run low, will be buying more. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> works very good this is my 2 order will buy again..</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT AND WOULD LIKE IT TO BE AVAILABLE IN LOCAL RETAILERS.</li>
    <li> I does work but it is so expensive!  It doubled in cost since I bought it!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and it the only thing that works for her! She was sad when she could not fine it in the store anymore. So we were glad to find it on Amason.</li>
    <li> Works so much better than any of the other products. When you use it, less is more. It expands a bit after you use it</li>
    <li> This item was ok for the $25.00 price,BUT it sure isn&#x27;t worth $75.00 an ounce. Keep it!!!</li>
    <li> Sure help,s me  appreciate being able to get it</li>
    <li> I gave &#x27;cushion Grip&#x27; the highest rating, because it&#x27;s the easiest to use. it&#x27;s NOT like denture Glues, or cloth liners. it FEELS like a good reline, and lasts a good long time before you have to do it again. I don&#x27;t know WHY it&#x27;s getting to be so hard to find. hopefully I can keep getting it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> No,I was very disappointed. This product did not work for me. And it was so expensive.</li>
    <li> I love how well Cushion Grip works but you more then doubled the cost which is just wrong!!</li>
    <li> best product for loose dentures</li>
    <li> No  mess , ,no goo squeezing out, just plain gripping power for lower dentures. It will hold even after soaking overnight in denture cleaner. They say it works for up to four days, well how about lasting a full week or more? I&#x27;ve heard some complaints about the fact that it requires heat to get it out of the tube. I say, that&#x27;s small price to pay for something that really works.. All the other brands of denture adheisive fill your mouth with goo or some such slimy stuff. Cushion Grip works perfectly and stays where you want it.. You may consider it a bit expensive, but when you think of how long an application can last, it is really rather cheap. I don&#x27;t need anything to hold my upper dentures , but Cushion Grip  is perfect for hard to hold lower dentures.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.  I&#x27;ve heard rumors that the company is going out of business, so I advise you to stock up while Amazon still stocks it. I just ordered several tubes as back up.</li>
    <li> I used it quite a few years ago and I liked it then.  I don&#x27;t know why more dentists don&#x27;t use Cushion Grip.  It seems to me it would solve a lot of their problems with ill-fitting dentures.</li>
    <li> I love this product! But when I went to purchase it, the price had gone from $6.00 a tube (Oct.2013)---to $80.00!?!?!?! Talk about GOUGING the Public!!!!---I hope that ANOTHER company takes heed &amp; develops a similar product, &amp; sells it at a REASONABLE price!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works....just with I could find it locally.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years.  Cannot find localy.  It has become very expensive.</li>
    <li> It is a bit pricey but works very well to cushion dentures</li>
    <li> This product was for my father in law. He was thrilled to find it, and used it immediately. Sorry to see it is being discontinued.</li>
    <li> Your product has always been good. It can only be purchased online now as it has been pulled from local drugstore shelves and now is 4 times the price! BUMMER!</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM COST 5 TIMES GREATER THAN WHEN I WOULD BUY IT AT  WALMART IN CANADA . EXPECTED A LOT BIGGER TUBE. Not WORTH THE COST&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Little late getting here but once it made here ( product was perfect. )</li>
    <li> This is in my opinion the best</li>
    <li> Bought for my mom and she really likes it!</li>
    <li> I have used Cushion Grip for many years, it is the best thing I have found to keep my lower plate usable.  Hope you keep it on hand.&lt;br /&gt;forever...</li>
