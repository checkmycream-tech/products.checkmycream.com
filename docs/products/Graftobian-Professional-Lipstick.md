### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>this is literally the best lipstick ive ever had the pleasure of using.</li>
      <li>I used it for my Harly Quinn cosplay and it looked great!</li>
      <li>lipstick but it isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
      <li>pigment is wonderful.</li>
      <li>I was impressed!</li>
      <li>Great for finishing touches on a Halloween costume.</li>
      <li>more than happy about my purchase!</li>
      <li>this is the most oily lipstick ive ever experienced.</li>
      <li>I wish it wasn&#x27;t so shiney, but otherwise I love it!</li>
      <li>Well, the color and gloss that this lipstick gave me was pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>and I had seen people talking about how amazing this brand is, so</li>
      <li>It is creamy and comfortable to wear and I am super happy with it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not messy and it looks great!</li>
      <li>I was really excited to use this lipstick because it has generally good reviews.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly moisturizing, which is good, but doesn&#x27;t really work out with one coat.</li>
      <li>The color looks great and is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>When I bought it, I wasn&#x27;t sure that it was  going to cover</li>
      <li>Went on nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>I figured it&#x27;d be better than the drugstore</li>
      <li>like I said, it&#x27;s not terrible, and may work for you.</li>
      <li>The lipstick that was actually soft had an oily application that did not layer incredibly well, and smudged way too easily.</li>
      <li>It was decently cheap &amp; comes off GREAT, wouldn&#x27;t advise for &amp;#34;serious&amp;#34; use mainly for costumes &amp; things f that nature.</li>
      <li>Also, wipes off fairly easily with just a tissue.  </li>
      <li>The lipstick comes off way to easily, making it easy to smear and prone to bleeding.</li>
      <li>smells strongly like a crayon.</li>
      <li>Probably need two max for a perfect black lip.</li>
      <li>On the very first stroke!</li>
      <li>The color is great goes on smooth &amp; solid.</li>
      <li>It is really bizarre, I&#x27;ve never had lipstick like it.</li>
      <li>cheap.</li>
      <li>Fantastic lipstick.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad lipstick per say.</li>
      <li>I can use it, but now it sticks to one side or the other, but it&#x27;s still a great choice.</li>
      <li>over my teeth, i was /constantly/ having to reapply, and the lipstick diminished /very/ quickly.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t apply that smoothly unless lip balm was applied first.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this l product due to the good reviews.</li>
      <li>only thing I liked was the packaging...</li>
      <li>I was expecting far better results than I ended up receiving.</li>
      <li>I have another use for it, but I will look elsewhere for a good black lipstick.</li>
      <li>Even better, it arrived in only 4 days!</li>
      <li>I thought this was waxy at first</li>
      <li>Came on time , was super smooth ,didn&#x27;t crack or dry lips, would buy it again.</li>
      <li>I was super excited after reading the reviews and thought I had made the right choice after comparing other reviews of products...</li>
      <li>Kind of dry, goes on kind of smeary, doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>It does not go on smooth at all, and you need multiple layers to get it looking opaque.</li>
      <li>and... it is, but not by as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
      <li>It is very sticky once you have it</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>Being a guy that&#x27;s never worn lipstick before, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but this stuff goes on like paint and stays on really well.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I did not expect such speedy shipping but it definitely was a nice surprise.</li>
      <li>It is definitely higher quality than most of the black lipsticks that come out around Halloween.</li>
      <li>The color goes on opaque, only taking one or two swipes to create the full color, and when I went to wipe it off, it came off without smudging everywhere.</li>
      <li>The 99 cent black Halloween lipsticks at drug stores work a million times better than this.</li>
      <li>Bleeds a bit and it a little more glossy than matte but there are tricks to fix that.</li>
      <li>I wish I was satisfied with this purchase, but it was a waste of money.</li>
      <li>i give it a 2/5 only because the product came on time and was a nice shade of black.</li>
      <li>Even after much effort you are able to get some on your lips, it is so thick and tar like that your lips will stick together</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it, the entire stick crumbled and broke off.</li>
      <li>With a lipliner it&#x27;s better, though the color is rather bluish rather than solid black.</li>
      <li>Stayed on pretty well all night long, it was a bit dying on my lips</li>
      <li>Sometimes it leaves my lips a little purple/black after wiping it off but a little warm water and a paper towel or tissue and it is like it was never there.</li>
      <li>Quality product that does last, but touch-ups must (always) be applied for maximum vivid color display.</li>
      <li>Although, the color is of a true black but not until several applications.</li>

<li> Please find another black lipstick; this product is worth less than the paper the ingredients are printed on.</li>
<li> looks like grey lip gloss</li>
<li> Overall, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed because it was kind of expensive for the level of craftsmanship.</li>
<li> It only needed like two coating so that it could be totally black.</li>
<li> This lipstick was not as expected.</li>
<li> This item is not worth it.</li>
<li> The top part of the lipstick was hardened, like a sticky crayon, and the base was oily and sticky.</li>
<li> does not go on black.</li>
<li> I needed black lipstick for cosplay and makeup reasons</li>
<li> I got the black lipstick, and ended up needing to put on three coats just to get my lips</li>
<li> I ordered the black because I&#x27;ve wanted to try black lipstick for a while now.</li>
<li> I recieved my black lipstick, one stroke on my lips</li>
<li> I should have saved my money and just went with the cheaper black lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Although, this lipstick has a nice color application that is opaque and thick, I was disappointed by how hard it is to put on and by the little amount of the product that came in the lipstick tube.</li>
<li> Also, it is a little too shiny in appearance for my taste (I prefer matte-</li>
<li> it was black!</li>
<li> but I usually just combat the over shine with translucent powder).</li>
<li> Unfortunately, when mine arrived it instantly broke.</li>
<li> But when I received it, it was broken in half.</li>
<li> and when I swatched it on my hand, it actually tore my skin and made it red and painful!</li>
<li> HARD TO GET ON, HARD TO TAKE OFF</li>
<li> It was rock hard</li>
<li> to get it off, which means that it&#x27;ll totally stay on for a measly day&#x27;s use!</li>
<li> The lipstick was very hard to apply and broke immediately.</li>
<li> Sticky and gummy, yet tough.</li>
<li> When I opened the tube it smelled like a crayon and it was impossible to put on due to the tar-like texture.</li>
<li> It is ver hard and difficult to put on because of the texture.</li>
<li> To make it worse, the lipstick does not apply well because the tube is not well made and the lipstick shifts around.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t know if it is just the black color, but it is one of the worst black lipsticks I have used.</li>
<li> Perhaps I got a bad one, not sure.</li>
<li> It is so extremely thick that it is virtually impossible to get any pigment on your lips.</li>
<li> It is not waxy, it is almost like rubbing silly putty on your skin.</li>
<li> It is wax- like and also has a bad smell.</li>
<li> The ingredients in this lipstick are really really bad also.</li>
<li> Quite disappointed, but</li>

    <li> Went on nice and smooth. It only needed like two coating so that it could be totally black. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. The lipstick was very hard to apply and broke immediately. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Terrible terrible product! I returned it! It was rock hard and when I swatched it on my hand, it actually tore my skin and made it red and painful! There was no way I was putting something like that on my lips. The ingredients in this lipstick are really really bad also. This item is not worth it. Please find another black lipstick; this product is worth less than the paper the ingredients are printed on.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it leaves my lips a little purple/black after wiping it off but a little warm water and a paper towel or tissue and it is like it was never there. The color looks great and is exactly what I needed. It is definitely higher quality than most of the black lipsticks that come out around Halloween.</li>
    <li> Fantastic lipstick. I ordered the black because I&#x27;ve wanted to try black lipstick for a while now. The color is great goes on smooth &amp; solid. Stayed on pretty well all night long, it was a bit dying on my lips but I would totally recommend for anyone looking for an &#x27;alternative&#x27; color.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, the entire stick crumbled and broke off. I could use it again if I wanted to get it all over my hands I guess. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> this is the most oily lipstick ive ever experienced. it got /all/ over my teeth, i was /constantly/ having to reapply, and the lipstick diminished /very/ quickly. i give it a 2/5 only because the product came on time and was a nice shade of black. not something i would buy again.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this l product due to the good reviews. When I opened the tube it smelled like a crayon and it was impossible to put on due to the tar-like texture. I had to call Amazon the same day and ask for my money back.</li>
    <li> I was expecting far better results than I ended up receiving. It&#x27;s not a bad lipstick per say. It&#x27;s fairly moisturizing, which is good, but doesn&#x27;t really work out with one coat. I got the black lipstick, and ended up needing to put on three coats just to get my lips *close* to what I was hoping for with maybe two coats. Quite disappointed, but like I said, it&#x27;s not terrible, and may work for you.</li>
    <li> It was decently cheap &amp; comes off GREAT, wouldn&#x27;t advise for &amp;#34;serious&amp;#34; use mainly for costumes &amp; things f that nature.</li>
    <li> I needed black lipstick for cosplay and makeup reasons and I had seen people talking about how amazing this brand is, so I decided to give it a try.

    <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so shiney, but otherwise I love it!</li>
    <li> Came on time , was super smooth ,didn&#x27;t crack or dry lips, would buy it again. I brought it for a night out on the town and it was a hit.</li>
    <li> cheap. doesn&#x27;t apply well.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I bought this to use for Halloween and I&#x27;m amazed at the quality.  Being a guy that&#x27;s never worn lipstick before, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but this stuff goes on like paint and stays on really well.  Keep your lips away from your teeth, though!!  Also, wipes off fairly easily with just a tissue.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, when mine arrived it instantly broke. The top part of the lipstick was hardened, like a sticky crayon, and the base was oily and sticky. The lipstick that was actually soft had an oily application that did not layer incredibly well, and smudged way too easily. Perhaps I got a bad one, not sure. I have another use for it, but I will look elsewhere for a good black lipstick.</li>
    <li> HARD TO GET ON, HARD TO TAKE OFF</li>
    <li> Kind of dry, goes on kind of smeary, doesn&#x27;t last long. I figured it&#x27;d be better than the drugstore and... it is, but not by as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> this is literally the best lipstick ive ever had the pleasure of using. i tried it out to see if i was allergic on my inner wrist and it took *4 days* to get it off, which means that it&#x27;ll totally stay on for a measly day&#x27;s use! more than happy about my purchase!</li>
    <li> Smears and falls into lines around your lips after about twenty minutes (without a lipliner). With a lipliner it&#x27;s better, though the color is rather bluish rather than solid black. Goes on glossy and dries matte.</li>
    <li> AWFUL. It is so extremely thick that it is virtually impossible to get any pigment on your lips. It is not waxy, it is almost like rubbing silly putty on your skin. Sticky and gummy, yet tough. It is really bizarre, I&#x27;ve never had lipstick like it. Even after much effort you are able to get some on your lips, it is so thick and tar like that your lips will stick together and if you pull them apart it forms goopy strings of product between them. It also settles into the corners of your mouth uncomfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it is just the black color, but it is one of the worst black lipsticks I have used. The 99 cent black Halloween lipsticks at drug stores work a million times better than this.</li>
    <li> I thought this was waxy at first but it&#x27;s not. Its creamy and matte. No need for chapstick before applying.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this lipstick because it has generally good reviews. Although, this lipstick has a nice color application that is opaque and thick, I was disappointed by how hard it is to put on and by the little amount of the product that came in the lipstick tube. To make it worse, the lipstick does not apply well because the tube is not well made and the lipstick shifts around. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed because it was kind of expensive for the level of craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t apply that smoothly unless lip balm was applied first. smells strongly like a crayon. pigment is wonderful. could be easier to apply.</li>
    <li> does not go on black. looks like grey lip gloss</li>
    <li> When I bought it, I wasn&#x27;t sure that it was  going to cover but it did! It&#x27;s not messy and it looks great! I used it for my Harly Quinn cosplay and it looked great!</li>
    <li> Color turned out as described, and as shown online for advertisement. Quality product that does last, but touch-ups must (always) be applied for maximum vivid color display.</li>
    <li> The lipstick comes off way to easily, making it easy to smear and prone to bleeding. Also, it is a little too shiny in appearance for my taste (I prefer matte-but I usually just combat the over shine with translucent powder). Although, the color is of a true black but not until several applications. All in all it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; lipstick but it isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
    <li> One application and it was black! Probably need two max for a perfect black lip. Bleeds a bit and it a little more glossy than matte but there are tricks to fix that. I was impressed!</li>
    <li> This lipstick was not as expected. It is ver hard and difficult to put on because of the texture. It is wax- like and also has a bad smell.</li>
    <li> Great for finishing touches on a Halloween costume.</li>
    <li> I was super excited after reading the reviews and thought I had made the right choice after comparing other reviews of products... I should have saved my money and just went with the cheaper black lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I recieved my black lipstick, one stroke on my lips and it broke! ... On the very first stroke! It smells like crayon, and feels like a crayon when your putting it on. It does not go on smooth at all, and you need multiple layers to get it looking opaque. It is very sticky once you have it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I liked was the packaging... I wish I was satisfied with this purchase, but it was a waste of money.</li>
