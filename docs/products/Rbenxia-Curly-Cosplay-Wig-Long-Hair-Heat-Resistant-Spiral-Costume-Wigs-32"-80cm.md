<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Would have been a 5 star rating if this wig was a thicker in the back. Everything else however was to cool!</li>
    <li> I love the color but tangles very easy</li>
    <li> Worst wig ever. How can you use white net to fix a wig, black works all the times . Too bad. Thumbs down</li>
    <li> Perfect wig for my My Little Pony, Rarity costume for Halloween and Comicon!!</li>
    <li> Its one of my favorites. I have about 7 now. But u can tell its a wig. And hair falls out super easy. Its a bit thin. Otherwise a great wig.</li>
    <li> awesome color but gets tangled so quickly</li>
    <li> The wig is really beautiful, it&#x27;s really soft and also it arrived on time as promised! It&#x27;s my first wig and I really love it!💜</li>
    <li> Really nice looking wig, a little tricky to maintain for multiple wears due to it being synthetic, but overall a great choice.</li>
    <li> not impressed by the quality.  needs more layers too</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect if you have a really small head.</li>
    <li> Our community theater ordered this for our sassy wicked witch for a production of Shrek the Musical. While it is somewhat skimpy on the thickness, the color (true purple) and the silkiness of the curls is so fun. To get the fullness this photo shows of the front, all of the back hair must be pulled forward and vice versa. Perfect for our show. Definitely a costume wig.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good quality.</li>
    <li> Got here in a quick manner, brighter than I thought but eh</li>
    <li> Nice wig. well made. fit is very good. Lots of fun.</li>
    <li> It was too long for me and got knotted quickly, but it is a very nice wig, I&#x27;m more active in wigs because I wear them all day, so this was easily knotable. But I do really like it</li>
    <li> Wore this out as an incognito outfit under a hat, LOOKED GREAT. Make sure you use a WIG BRUSH to brush it out and look more natural. Most people thought I had dyed my hair completely since they last saw me. For the price and texture, this WIG was a STEAL and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a long textured purple wig. The fit was also excellent, not too heavy.</li>
    <li> So soft and perfect !!</li>
    <li> Great wig, good price and great costumer service.... It&#x27;s long and the color it&#x27;s pretty purple... didn&#x27;t like to much the curls is easy to mess them up...  Take a good care of it and will be amazing! Great for costumes and had fun!</li>
    <li> The color is gorgeous and the hair doesn&#x27;t tangle too easily like some wigs. My only issue with it is that the volume of hair is a bit thin and the wig cap is a stark light color so trying to style it or even just wearing it while moving a lot is an issue as the wig cap frequently shows through and is very obvious. I wish the wig cap was either a dark color and/or that there was more hair tied into it. But it&#x27;ll be fun for conventions or halloween where it doesn&#x27;t matter as much if people see the wig cap since most will assume it&#x27;s a wig anyway</li>
    <li> the wig came a date later than promised but at least i was able to track it. The wig itself seems fine but the bangs are a tad long. I bought it for my wife since she knows I love her with long hair. Its a great product for cosplay and roleplay</li>
    <li> Looks nothing like the picture, I was very disappointed! I can&#x27;t go outside with it on cause it looks very fake,  Only looks realistic in pictures with filter!</li>
    <li> I used this wig as some fun in the bedroom. My boyfriend REALLY liked it as well. I have to say, I looked really cute. Just make sure when u purchase the wig, you also purchase a wig brush</li>
    <li> I ordered the dark purple wig, and it ended up being a fairly bright purple. I was hoping for it to be dark.</li>
    <li> GREAT COLOR. Very fun. Super silky and good curl hold. i sewed in clips for a stronger hold. But its a great wig for the price.</li>
    <li> this wasnt a wigg i got a book instead about kkk crap i just want a wigg and they cant tell the diffents in the two</li>
    <li> Good pice but wouldn&#x27;t stay in place and looked fake</li>
    <li> amazing hair for the price, the wefting does show through a bit , and the wig does get tangled easily but overall i got a month wear out of and it think that&#x27;s amazing for such a price</li>
    <li> wore it for halloween , i cut/ styled it loved it , it made me wantto go purple i wore it one night again with a scull cap it was cute, it sheds a little but not too bad , good wig for price definitly</li>
    <li> It was really pretty and shiny, the curls were nice and loose</li>
    <li> Awesome wig! I bought this wig for a bachelorette party in Tahoe. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect as I had never bought a wig before. I loved it. It was not itchy or bothersome at all. It doesn&#x27;t come with a net for your hair so it&#x27;s a little difficult to get on, but if you get a net it&#x27;s much easier. After a few hours of dancing it started getting a little heavy and hot but that&#x27;s because it is long. I falls just below your shoulders and the curls stayed in the whole time. Great color, great fit, and long lasting.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s starting to separate on the top and looks like crap. Not the highest quality, but for 12 bucks I didn&#x27;t get robbed too badly.</li>
    <li> Loved it! However it did get a bit tangled n&#x27; knotted, but overall really pretty. Wish the color was a bit darker since I&#x27;m a darker complexion. May buy a black one since I really enjoyed this one</li>
    <li> The bangs have gotten in my way too many times and the wig was too small for my head.</li>
    <li> Very nice wig! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it this winter, when it gets cold. :)</li>
    <li> Got this for a &#x27;Wigging Out&#x27; party... worked great, lots of compliments and I can still use it for Halloween!</li>
    <li> looked adorable on my daughter&#x27;s costume.</li>
    <li> I ordered the dark purple wig, and it ended up being a fairly bright purple. I was hoping for it to be dark.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I am a wig person.  I bought this to wear in a cancer walk in memory of someone whose favorite color was purple.  I loved the wig, but I think I looked silly in it.</li>
    <li> Fast prime shipping, wig was not quite as pictured but still worked for my purpose.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful the hair is as soft as is claimed</li>
    <li> It is beautiful.  The length is right as well as the color.  Loved It !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> awesome quality! Easy to wear</li>
    <li> I order this product for my daughter</li>
    <li> Love! Its so full and better than some of my real hair extensions I have. Not as curly but has a beautiful wave which I actually think I like better! Does knot up but that&#x27;s an easy fix.</li>
    <li> Sorry I made a review saying its sucked, I  apologize</li>
    <li> This wig came exactly as pictured, it was what I was looking for and it really delivered. It was perfect for the price and I got several wears out of it. This is a costume wig, it wouldn&#x27;t hold up for daily or extended wear but for a certain outfit or event it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I really like it, it works with my jersey i wear</li>
    <li> I am completely impressed with this wig. First off, it came way earlier than expected, second it looks so much better in person, although it is not as full (you just have to separate the curls). It is comfortable and long! Also, it DOES come with a wig cap, at least mine did. I know other reviews say it didn&#x27;t come with one, but mine did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend buying this product to anyone, I am so happy I purchased this.</li>
    <li> I wear this for Halloween  everyone thought I dye my hair :) lol</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good quality hair, but it&#x27;s too small for my head. It&#x27;s hard to keep on. If you ha e a big head like me, you will need wig caps and lots of clips.</li>
    <li> It was really fantastic, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Not at all like pictured. I thought this wig was going to be a great deal, as from the shop I normally buy from something similar was going to be about $40. I should have picked quality over cost, as I ended up with something barely usable. I bought it for a costume, because the picture made it seem like a great quality wig for such a low price, but boy was I wrong. It&#x27;s too close to my event to return it now, so I&#x27;m hoping a few wig styling tricks will help me out, but the wig itself is definitely not wearable right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Wrong Color: Calling it dark purple is a flat out lie. It&#x27;s bright purple.&lt;br /&gt;- Shiny: It&#x27;s got the same kind of shine to it as a $5 wig from a party store.&lt;br /&gt;- Thin: The netting completely shows through at the top. It&#x27;d be less annoying if the netting wasn&#x27;t off-white, which makes it horribly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I wanted this wig to look like the picture, not only would it require extensive styling, but I&#x27;d have to dye it and sew in additional wefts as well. It&#x27;s probably fine if you want something to use once for Halloween or for a costume party, but if you&#x27;re looking for something high-quality definitely look somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I love it just what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> Poor quality of hair.. It sucks</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shade of purple! wig looks amazing! :)</li>
    <li> Super cute wig.  Only flaw is no combs</li>
    <li> Great fit -- gorgeous curls. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on this wig. There was even a person or two who asked me if the hair dye was permanent. Lol... they thought it was my real hair!</li>
    <li> The purple just arrived. Not only is it poorly trimmed in the front bangs area, but it smells incredibly bad. Would not wear in public.</li>
    <li> Love this wig and so happy it fits, I have long thick hair so when I could fit it under the cap I was happy. The color is fun and bright. The hair is long. Just wish it was more thick but it is still fun to play with.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig because I need a purple pony-tail for Comic Con next week (I&#x27;m going as Menopausal Hit-Girl, since I&#x27;m too old to dress as regular Hit-Girl, lol) and the only thing I could find were small, thin straight clip-ons that were even more expensive than this wig. So, I ordered the wig, figuring there would be enough hair to make a pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;There is enough hair on this wig to make about TEN pony-tails!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I was stunned by the quality of this wig, especially at the price. Thick, long, glossy, curly and a beautiful purple! I would wear it if hot-flashes weren&#x27;t cooking me alive. (Hence the &amp;#34;Menopausal&amp;#34; before Hit-Girl)&lt;br /&gt;VERY NICE WIG! :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig. Had to put it on immediately. But hair wants to stay in one direction.</li>
    <li> This was better than I expected. The curls were beautiful and just right. Not too tight and not too loose. The bangs fell directly in my face but I pinned them back is a side swoop way and the style still looked great. The packaging was in an envelope but this didn&#x27;t ruin the item or create weird kinks. I pulled it out from the package inside the envelope and the hair hung long and tangle free. Definitely will buy another color in the future.</li>
    <li> Arrived super early for Halloween and is everything I hope it would be!</li>
    <li> I got this for my granddaughter as a sort of gag gift for Christmas. We have all had so much fun with it. Totally worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t look like the picture, but I still liked it. Got it before the time it said so I liked that but it didn&#x27;t come with the wig cap.</li>
    <li> This wig is such a pretty color, but it&#x27;s uneven, one side is Inches longer than the other and its very thin all around, a good Wig for cosplay or Halloween, but not really anything else.</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time! The wig itself was nice for the event I had to wear it to (a wig and mustache party). Some hair from the front fell out and it was a tad bare on the top so you could see the netting, but it was overall a great product. My only complaint was that it tangled/knotted quite a bit throughout the night and you can&#x27;t brush it. It&#x27;s also not as curly as the picture, but the curls were nice and it was neatly packaged. The top of the wig bulged a little oddly so it didn&#x27;t look like the shape of my head, but I was able to maneuver it to look decent (at least in pictures). The quality was great for the price, even my hairdresser thought it was a good quality wig. I definitely recommend this product and seller!</li>
    <li> So I just got this wig today and it does not fit!!&lt;br /&gt;It is not curly it is frizzy and tangled, really regret buying this, really bad choice!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little more purple then expected, but I really like how it looks on me. Hilariously enough the lighter purple actually matches the accesories better then the purple in the picture. All in all I feel it was a good purchase, and I may come back to get the other colors in the near future.</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price! it is synthetic fibers but it is decently soft, however I can tell that it is synthetic when touching it. It is full like a real head of hair and looks amazing! no thin spots. Comes pre styled and is wearable straight out of the packaging! No tangles or anything! looks realistic in person, will be posting pictures soon! :) Will be buying from them again and have already recommended. Also I received this in two days after ordering it.</li>
    <li> i love it!!! it brings out the color of my green eyes :) picture added to show how good it looks :)</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful!! it looks in the pic like an ombre&#x27; but its not its just all purple but it does look real! It did say that it came with a hair cap to put over your real/natural hair first before putting on the wig, but we did not receive one!</li>
    <li> My wig just came in the mail today and I was so happy. My expected delivery date ranged from October 23rd - November 10th and I am so glad it came way earlier than expected. It is exactly what I wanted. Couldnt have been more satisfied. Looks so real it can be worn more than just for Halloween.</li>
    <li> Sent as Christmas gift. No feedback has been received.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and realistic looking.</li>
    <li> BREATHTAKING! Inexpensive, yet great quality.</li>
    <li> LOVED this wig, until  the second day I tried to wear it. It made me super itchy and I had to remove it :(</li>
    <li> So today is the 2 of feb I was not supposed to get it till the 5th I really love it .. I can&#x27;t wait to go out for club or a photo shoot with this ..for sometthing under 20dollar it&#x27;s good .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how you can call this wig dark purple. It&#x27;s more like bright Crayola purple. The picture makes it look like a blackish-purple, but it is not that. I ended up giving it to someone else that wanted a bright purple wig. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received the wig in a timely manner, but it was much brighter and shinier than pictured. The wig is long, but relatively thin, so most of the hair wants to stay on one side of your head. Lastly, the styling (which is also different than pictured) falls out of the wig as soon as you take it out of its net, so I would suggest leaving it in the netting until you have to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite pretty, just not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I love the wig it&#x27;s very good quality for the price, and it work out great for my party.</li>
    <li> I received this order faster then I expected so I was very happy about that! Very happy with the quality and I loved the color of the hair :) I wouldn&#x27;t classify it as a &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; purple, just a purple. I would make future purchases from this seller if I wanted another wig. :)</li>
    <li> But like many other things I buy online it lacks any practical use XD. The color is roughly what&#x27;s displayed but it&#x27;s not quite as curly as the one shown. It also has a tendency to become frizzy so store carefully</li>
    <li> I love the wig the color is cool and it looks nice on.</li>
    <li> The wig cap was smaller then expected. But could still wear it as a part of a costume if I had too.</li>
    <li> it fits and feels amazing, so surprised for such a price.</li>
    <li> I got mine in yesterday. I paid through the nose for overnight shipping because I need it tonight for a party. It arrived on time and I really like the color. Unfortunately there was a pretty large tangled rats nest in the back. I washed it when I got home and was able to get the tangles out. It held it&#x27;s curl really well so that&#x27;s definitely a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty thin except for the bangs which are SUPER thick. that makes it a little awkward. For the price (assuming you don&#x27;t pay $20 to have it overnighted) I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it. It&#x27;s definitely a cheap wig, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s $13! I&#x27;m wearing it tonight and will update as to how it held up after several hours of wear.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly full for a &amp;#34;just for fun&amp;#34; wig.  Super long. Does tangle quite easily, but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these wigs. For some reason one had black netting and the other had an off white netting...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;~The synthetic fibers felt like real hair!&lt;br /&gt;~The color was exactly what I wanted&lt;br /&gt;~The netting was not obvious or showing when I parted the hair in different ways (on the wig with the black netting)&lt;br /&gt;~The curls were well in tact&lt;br /&gt;~The wigs were put into their bags neatly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;~The netting obviously shown through no matter how I parted it (wig with the off-white netting)&lt;br /&gt;~Since the wig is long it tangles easily (which can&#x27;t really be helped unless you cut the wig shorter&lt;br /&gt;~The bangs went past my chin, but they can easily be trimmed&lt;br /&gt;~When the wig was on it was a little bald in the back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all these two wigs were good quality for the price. (I actually plan to splice them together in order to make it one really good wig!)</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig. Didn&#x27;t like the way it had been packaged, but once out of that this is a nice product.</li>
    <li> very pretty and I like the curls !!</li>
    <li> Came earlier than I expected and was exactly as described.  Very happy with the purchase.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Beautiful, so real. High quality. I love it!</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful. It was very nicely packaged and the curls were perfect. I did not have to make any alterations to it, and it fit perfectly without any pins.</li>
