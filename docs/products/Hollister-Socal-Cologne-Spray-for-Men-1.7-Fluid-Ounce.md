      <li>I love the smell so much, that I soak our furniture and beds in it</li>

      <li>I foolishly didn&#x27;t check the price &amp; was very surprised to see that it was $50!!</li>
      <li>haha.</li>

      <li>This particular brand wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>I am familiar with Hollister cologne, but next time I shall definitely smell before I buy.</li>
      <li>definitely give this 5 out of 5 stars, within the first day of wearing it I received countless compliments, but I recommend you buy it at a Hollister store near you, hence the fact that it&#x27;s much cheaper there than it is on Amazon.</li>
      <li>an this smells same but fades fast as well complete difderent box.</li>
      <li>I purchased for my 16 year old son.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out what cologne or perfume exactly that it was, since they have a few options.</li>

    <li> I love this perfume! Its sweet but strong at the same time. And the wood scents feel harmonical to your nose.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s favourite cologne and with all the perks of not having to traipse over to Hollister to get it!</li>
    <li> very sexy and autumn smelling  colone * its for men ..... but I use it all the time and I am female **  .. I get compliments everytime I wear it</li>
    <li> This SoCal is a perfect fragrance for young men. I purchased for my 16 year old son. The smell is young, clean, fresh and compliments without being overpowering!</li>
    <li> Nice can not keep good looking chic away?-------------------------JRUIZ?  ( Try IT )</li>
    <li> Not convinced cologne is legit have been wearing same brand since trip to a mall in so cal in june 2008 an this smells same but fades fast as well complete difderent box.</li>
    <li> Grandson loves this, me to.  Love it on him and my son.</li>
    <li> EVERY SINGLE TIME that I walk through the mall, I know when I get close to Hollister, because of the smell. Well, I am IN LOVE with that smell. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what cologne or perfume exactly that it was, since they have a few options. So, I went with my gut, and am SO pleased with it. IT&#x27;S THE ONE. I love the smell so much, that I soak our furniture and beds in it haha. So, now, when our friends/family come over, they say &amp;#34;Your house smells like the mall!&amp;#34; Lol... So, I&#x27;m going to be stocking up... ;)</li>
    <li> my son likes it, Jake is his favorite.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great. Both of my teenage sons like the SoCal as well as the Hollister California and use them on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Good price for the best smelling cologne.  I was lucky to find it at a reduced price and of perfect quality.  I worried that it might be spoiled because of the low price but that was not the case.</li>
    <li> My teenage son loved it and it was a lot cheaper than anything I could find here at home in the department stores</li>
    <li> this product is ok, i recomended, the service is fast, all rigth, the price is the exact. very very good</li>
    <li> Smell great, and my son enjoys wearing the product almost daily.  The price was reasonable and it came quickly by mail.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells absolutely amazing and my bf loves it too!</li>
    <li> I find it very interesting that this cologne traveled its way to me from California. I am familiar with Hollister cologne, but next time I shall definitely smell before I buy. This particular brand wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for about $30 compared to the $50 that they were charging at the Hollister store. I was a bit concerned  since they did not offer shipment tracker, but my order arrived in time. Also, this perfume is not meant for optical use. I tried using it before an appointment with a very attractive and very single optometrist, and I ended up irritating my eyes and crashing my vehicle. Although, I did meet a very nice lady in the E.R. who is now my beautiful girlfriend.</li>
    <li> My grandson loved it!</li>
    <li> was a gift, he loves it!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this cologne at Hollister; It caught my eye as I was paying for my clothes, so I smelled it &amp; instantly loved it. I foolishly didn&#x27;t check the price &amp; was very surprised to see that it was $50!! Luckily, I had a bank roll on me that day. But it is without a doubt the best scent I&#x27;ve ever smelled, therefore I have no reason complain about the price. In other words, the shaky price is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely give this 5 out of 5 stars, within the first day of wearing it I received countless compliments, but I recommend you buy it at a Hollister store near you, hence the fact that it&#x27;s much cheaper there than it is on Amazon. I got the 2.5oz bottle for $50 at Hollister, as opposed to $80 for 2.5oz on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 16, although I believe this can be worn by anyone, regardless of your style, age, or even gender (caught a girl at the grocery store earlier today wearing the same fragrance.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: Keep the smell unique, don&#x27;t tell your friends/family what you&#x27;re wearing!!</li>
    <li> Smells so good, just like the store</li>
    <li> This IS the smell I was looking for! Just like the store. :)</li>
