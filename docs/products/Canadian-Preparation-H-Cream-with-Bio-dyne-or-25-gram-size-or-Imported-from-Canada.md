    <li> I use it for puffy bags under my eyes...it helps reduce the appearance better than anything I have used....I put it on after I shower and it helps my eyes look fresher after sleep and double shifts....</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, but does not really do too much to tighten the skin, except under they eyes a little bit.  Not sure if I will buy more.</li>
    <li> used it only a couple of times the reason i bought it was i was told that it helps with wrinkles well i better get on it...good product need to use it more..thanks for the reminder (lol):)</li>
    <li> Preparation H cream did not reduce the bags under my eyes or reduce the appearance of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Canadian formula with yeast shrinks!  Wiastline slims right down!  Slop it one, wrap with saran wrap and go to bed...in the morning take the wrap off and shower.....EASY</li>
    <li> I am using this salve to stop itching from an old scar.  It works GREAT!  The first time in years that I have complete relief.</li>
    <li> I think all this reviews were paid reviews.I bought the canadian preparation H with Bydine.It did not do the wonders they talked about.I only used it for about a month.n no difference on my skin.Are some superior to others?I will not recomend</li>
    <li> Altho it did remove some puffiness from under eyes. It did nothin for small wrinkles like some people have claimed. And it smells very bad.</li>
    <li> I saw a slight difference. I use it everyday, twice a day. It was not like I expected from reading the reviews. I did get the product as described and it was from Canada. I don&#x27;t think it would shrink a hemorrhoid or under eye bags because it was weak. It was like a cream with not effect. Like in the past I could feel Preparation H work. I must have received a brand that was EXPIRED or lost its shelf life, so it was ineffective. There was no expiration date anywhere on the box or tube. If the seller can send one with the expiration date I would change my post as well as send the remainder back. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the cream made the itching worse and it did not stop the pain of my scars. Had to discontinue it. grahamcracker</li>
    <li> After about 10 days I can really see the difference. it&#x27;s worth its weight in gold too bad they don&#x27;t sell it in United States I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Used this around my waist to shrink it for a measurement. It worked like a charm. I&#x27;m sure it is great for hemorrhoids too!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Hard to find....Thank you!!  A+</li>
    <li> As tempting as it is to believe that using the long lost Bio-dyne ingredient will relieve under eye bags, it just isn&#x27;t true. Under eye bags have to do with the mechanics of your sinuses and a variety of health factors that are not going to be altered in any way by applying a topical creme. Bags may show on the outside, but the problem is internal and a creme on the surface of your skin just isn&#x27;t going to penetrate to the real issue. Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I use this to tighten my skin, I do notice a temporary effect</li>
    <li> Happy with the results! Highly recomended</li>
    <li> I bought it to try and reduce eyelid swelling. I looked like I had been stung by a swarm of bees. It took 3 days for my eyelid to return to it&#x27;s normal swelling. I used just a little of the product on one eyelid as a test.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, why is it not available everywhere..good for bums, better for wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Package was smashe and the tube was punctured throught. : -( did not secure the package good at all.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, tried it for wrinkles.  Can&#x27;t say it does a thing.</li>
    <li> I really did not see any positive results from using this product I will not purchase again</li>
    <li> My husband has had a terrible itchy rash from medications and this temporarily helps more than some prescribed creams that will cause more problems in the future, such as thinning of the skin.  I&#x27;ve just ordered more.</li>
    <li> I use this product to the opposite pole of it&#x27;s intended use...lol. It works beautifully to remove bags under the eyes! Use caution not to get any in your eye or you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
    <li> I think my expectation of this product was too high.  It worked a little bit but was not much better than the american version</li>
    <li> So, I decided to try this stuff with plastic wrap to lose inches on my waist before a body fat measurement.  Unfortunatly I did not have a tape measure, so I can&#x27;t tell you how much I lost, but I can tell you that the next morning the plastic was noticibly looser, and I came in an inch under the measurement needed.  I will be using this again next year.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for the eye bags.</li>
