<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing value. You would pay double at Planet Beauty!</li>
    <li> BEST DUO OUTSIDE OF THE LUXURY SET...I LIVE TO ENJOY ALL THE GREAT PRODUCTS THEY DELIVER.  Who would have thought in these days a Brand would do what it says and not cost you arm/leg!  LOVE IT &amp; WORTH EVER PENNY!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair always feel soft, silky and smooth when using this set.</li>
    <li> Really good products, they do a good job.</li>
    <li> They only shipped the shampoo. Also bottle was not in a bag or anything. Lucky that it did not leak! Pain that I have to ship it back and that they can&#x27;t just ship the other bottle. Reading through other reviews it seems that people are receiving a watered down product, I do not have real bottle from a salon to compare directly, but the bottle I received did seem a bit thin for a high quality shampoo.</li>
    <li> Product was watered down.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this shampoo and conditioner.  Recently I moved into a house with really heavy water that destroyed my hair.  This is the only shampoo I can use now! Also it is such a better deal to order these large bottles. They are going to last lik 6 months! A little goes a long way with this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite shampoo and conditioner. These sulfate-free products leave my hair feeling hydrated and soft and my hair smells like green apple! Yum!</li>
    <li> Fantastic shampoo and conditioner! Best price as well. I have been purchasing Enjoy from Amazone for going on 4 years now. Excellent projuct and fast delivery if you have Prime!</li>
    <li> (I am a product junky.  I have medium length, normal dyed hair.)  I really like this shampoo and coditioner.  It smells great and leaves my hair feeling clean and moisturized.  My hair tends to get used to hair products within 2-4 weeks so I change them often to maintain soft silky hair. I have been using this product  for over a month now and it still feel great!  The shampoo is a bit thin, therefore it can slip through your fingers if you are not careful but a little bit goes a long way.  Also the smell is amazingly yummy... a fruity smell.  When you get a chance to splurge on hair care products, Enjoy is a must try.      Follow the links to other great Enjoy products:  [[ASIN:B000II9BK4 Enjoy Straightener]]  [[ASIN:B000O2KACM Enjoy Enjoy Shine and Smooth 4. oz]]</li>
    <li> What a deal one bottle at the beauty supply was $45 for one bottle this was $40 for two bottles!!</li>
    <li> I tried this brand when I was swimming everyday.  My hair was taking a beating from the chlorine.  Once I started using this product, I really noticed a difference in my hair.  I used for quite a while before I moved and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere I looked.  I&#x27;m excited to find in here and will try it again.    I gave it 4 stars because I worry that my memory of how great it was may be faulty.</li>
    <li> Really good for my hair, conditions so well</li>
    <li> I ordered the Hydrating shampoo and conditioner, but received the Color Holding instead. Frustrating to have to do all the return and wait for new shipment when it wasn&#x27;t my mistake</li>
    <li> The conditioner is the consistency that it should be, but the shampoo is watered down. I made this purchase for my disabled mother and had it shipped to her since she cannot make it to her salon anymore to purchase it. She has been a faithful Enjoy user for years and was highly disappointed in the watering down of the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I get dandruff with most other shampoo/conditioners. I don&#x27;t have that issue with this and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. I am a guy -&amp;#62; I use this on my beard too, I don&#x27;t know if it helps but it sure feels nice!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used on my hair.  I am a hairstylist 25 years, have used alot of professional products on my hair, this makes a noticeable difference when I use it.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Hair feels great. My color looks great longer.&lt;br /&gt;(I have long thick wavy hair and dye it a dark auburn color)</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this brand since she used it on my hair last time. I love how it gave me soft and silky hair so that&#x27;s why I purchased it. It&#x27;s concentrated but I use a little more than a quarter size amount since I have long and thick hair. Price was a little expensive since I don&#x27;t normally spend much on shampoo but the duo set price for the amount was better than others and I know will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  It really gives my hair the moisture it needs at this point in my life.  My hair is shiny, and clearly healthy looking!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and it has always been difficult for me to find a shampoo and conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave me with limp hair. These do an outstanding job and my hair looks great all day. My daughter who has very curly dry hair and my mother with short thick hair have both started using them and have both had similar success. This is my third time purchasing these.</li>
    <li> I had only used Enjoy one other time and it was another product from their line. The conditioner is great if you comb it in, but the shampoo  is difficult to rinse out and liked my other brand of sulfate free shampoo better and for the price of these products, I should love it. That wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
    <li> Great Product, my hair is wavy and I get it colored, and this product tames it and makes it manageable. I love Enjoy hair products!</li>
    <li> Watered down!!! This is not the same shampoo &amp; conditioner as what you buy in the salon! It has been watered down and changed. It actually damaged my hair making it really brittle and frizzy.</li>
    <li> Great for colored blondes with fine hair.  This product smells great, is light and leaves your hair feeling soft, shiny, and healthy.  I highly, highly, highly recommend it.  My stylist couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair after using it for only 1 month.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the wife and she loves it, as long as it makes her happy its alright by me</li>
    <li> Excellent products is all I can say!  My daughter who cuts and colors hair had recommended this product.  The shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel silky and look shiny.  (I have very thick dry hair,)  One of the main reasons she recommended this is because the color in my hair seemed to be fading very quickly with other products.  Quick fading is not an issue with ENJOY color holding shampoo and conditioner.  I will definitely reo-order these product.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Makes my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this product on Amazon and cheaper than anywhere else!!  I love this product and i recieved my package within a few days!!! I will recommend this product to others as well as purchasing it on Amazon.......</li>
    <li> Excellent product for my very curly hair !  Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down,  curls are soft and bouncy.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Best price I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected!!  Left my hair a mess.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  I&#x27;ll stick with WEN thank you very much.  Plus, WEN is more cost effective.</li>
    <li> amazing clean and so easy to comb out your hair after !!</li>
    <li> UPDATE (3/13/14): I have noticed more reviewers giving this product a lower rating because they are receiving a watered down version of the shampoo. That I can say is true because I myself have ordered a set and received a watered down shampoo that almost falls through your fingers. I was upset that I had spent money on this and the product didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. However, it really depends on what SELLER you choose to order from. The last time I ordered this set I purchased it from the seller: APPEAL. I received the watered down shampoo and was very disappointed because this set really is great for my hair! After I had run out, I decided I&#x27;d give them one more try, and if I received at crappy product again I would try and find this set at a local salon (even though the price would be much higher than here). I chose a different seller: NY Supply and this time the product I received was exactly how I remember the shampoo to be, nice and thick! It works just like I remembered it to and made my hair feel healthier after just one wash. My advice to anyone trying to purchase this product is to search through the sellers that carry this product and go with one that has a really good review. I can at least vouch for NY Supply, they sent me the product I was expecting without any disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best Shampoo and Conditioner set I have ever used. I saw the reviews online and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m sure glad that I did because I will never switch products again. I have extremely fine hair which gets very oily and requires me to wash it everyday. This stuff is really great, I can now go without washing my hair for a day and it still looks fresh and clean without the oil. My hair has never looked healthier. Usually my hair just falls flat and looks very dried out and dull. This product brings your hair to life and gives it tons of volume. It may be a bit expensive by a little goes a long way. One bottle has lasted me a few months and I&#x27;ve used maybe half a bottle. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a build up residue on your hair. Not to mention it&#x27;s made in the USA and doesn&#x27;t use the harsh chemicals other shampoos and conditioners use. I would recommend this product to anyone whose hair is flat and dried out. A must buy.maybe half a bottle. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a build up residue on your hair. Not to mention it&#x27;s made in the USA and doesn&#x27;t use the harsh chemicals other shampoos and conditioners use. I would recommend this product to anyone whose hair is flat and dried out. A must buy.</li>
    <li> This has helped my bleach blonde fried hair tremendously!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and took a chance . . . . my salon stopped selling Enjoy and I love this product.  I tried to buy direct from the company, unfortunately, they do not sell direct.  I bought the ENJOY hydrating shampoo and conditioner from One_Love.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with getting the product.  It arrived timely and packaged well.  However, after using the product just once, I felt a difference.  I compared packaging and the shampoo and conditioner look and smell the same.  However, the results are not the same and my hair always felt like it needed to be washed, again.  Plus, I couldn&#x27;t get it to style - at all.  I finally found a stylist in a neighboring community and bought the ENJOY hydrating shampoo and conditioner from this salon. After one use, my hair is finally back to normal  . . . I am so glad.  However, I am most likely going to change brands because of the hassle to get the product.  Final Feedback - more likely than not, this is not the real product and you will be throwing away your money.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo/conditioner.  Smells great too</li>
    <li> Love Enjoy!  Have yet to find any product that compares to this to manage my natural curl.  Great for chemically treated hair.  Have been using this for about 10 yrs now.  Love the straightener product for styling, too!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice a difference in how my hair felt.. the shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell as good as my normal product.. I think I may have wasted my money on this expensive shampoo.. at least I found it cheaper on amazon.. the bottles did last a very long time but it was annoying to pick up the huge bottles in the shower every time .. they were so heavy and awkward</li>
    <li> Bought for my mom. She claims this is by far the best shampoo and conditioner she has ever used in her life. Will definitely be buying again for her.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product it is so watered down I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s authentic at all! I&#x27;ve used enjoy products for years and this was definitely not a thick quality product!</li>
    <li> I love this product;it wourks great for my Bezilian Blow Out;FYI, I purchase the shampoo at the salon $20 and the size was one third of this size. It is great product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Enjoy products!  My daughter and I have very dry course hair and the shampoo and conditioner works wonders!!!!</li>
    <li> the shampoo is great the delivery had the product come in broken and the shampoo was all over in the box.</li>
    <li> Not such a fan of this shampoo and conditioner. It leaves my hair dry, and the smell of it nauseates me. Not so great in my books. I have used other Enjoy products before and loved them. Who knows, maybe its just me.</li>
    <li> I have been using Enjoy products for a number of years. This dynamic duo adds to my reasons of why I like this product. The conditioner adds a good amount of frizz control/moisture to my hair, without weighing it down. There have been few conditioners that meet that requirement!</li>
    <li> I was using Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s sulfate-free shampoo, but this is just so much better and cheaper! It smells better and feels more like regular shampoo while protecting my keratin treatment.</li>
    <li> By far the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. I have oily hair so if I don&#x27;t shampoo every single day it looks like I&#x27;ve not bathed in a week! With Enjoy I can skip a day and my hair still looks great. I also noticed my hair has more volume than usual. I will never use another brand again. I&#x27;m not sure what to say about people getting fake products, but mine was def not fake as I still have some from a local salon and carefully compared the two. (Btw the salon was the same price for 1/4 the amount!)</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner!  Awesome!!</li>
    <li> I highlight my hair and have very long, thick hair. I have tried many other shampoos and conditioners but most of them left my hair really hard to comb when I got out of the shower. This product makes it easy to brush through after the shower and smells great and leave my hair looking shiny and healthy! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Price is so good compared to buying in salon supply store. Love enjoy products for my hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. This time the shampoo was extremely watered down and runny.  I felt like it was either beyond its shelf life or had in fact been watered down. I bought a small bottle at a local beauty supply store and it was much better. Won&#x27;t be ordering from Product junkies again.</li>
    <li> The shampoo does not lather, and the conditioner does seem similar. Don&#x27;t buy it here. A fake!</li>
    <li> Enjoy shampoos and conditioners are absolutely amazing!!!! I switch up the formula I get just to keep my hair guessing but generally speaking, I couldn&#x27;t possibly ask for better!</li>
    <li> Love this product and the price is soooooo reasonable compared to the salon price!</li>
    <li> I had an issue with my scalp breaking out.  This Sulfate-Free Shampoo corrected the issue and I have great looking hair too.</li>
    <li> This is certainly watered down product. It still produces a lather but you have to use more than you should if you bought it from a salon. Find another place to get it from!</li>
    <li> The shop my hairdresser works in uses this product.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I have always loved how our hair felt and smelled after going to the shop.&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased to pumps to go with it so I could help my daughter control how much she uses.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!!</li>
    <li> Love Enjoy products, and it&#x27;s hard to find it without hemorrhaging a ton of cash.  This was the best price I could get on my favorite sham/cond., and the big size lasts forever.</li>
    <li> The product feels like it&#x27;s been watered downed. I have bought this before and i don&#x27;t remember it being so running.</li>
    <li> Honestly I never felt like it is really cleaning my hair ... Felt defective or expired ... I constantly do Brazilian blow out on my hair and must use sulfate fee products ... This product seemed so weak!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it works really well on my hair.  I&#x27;ve also ordered the shampoo in the past and it was watered down.  I don&#x27;t know who the sellers were, but I gave One_love the last shot.  The product was as I remembered, thick and rich, and the price is great as well.  Will continue to order from them.</li>
    <li> Enjoy shampoo is really good for hair but not this one because this is not real or probably is expired. Never ever buy it.</li>
    <li> Purchase was for shampoo and conditioner. Only received the shampoo. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Product is exactly what is found in Salon&#x27;s and NOT watered down as some have indicated in their reviews...</li>
    <li> Best shampoo &amp; conditioner ever!!! My hair loves it! 😍 also... My bottles did come sealed from this seller. The large bottles are great. Next time I will order the pump recommended. Compared to my hair salon I received twice as much product for half the price.</li>
    <li> Great deal and keeps my dyed hair colorful and healthy.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this shampoo/conditioner online in the past. I must have used a different seller.  This shampoo is watered down big time.  I had it for too long to return it by time I actually used it or would have.  The conditioner seems ok though.</li>
    <li> I too have been using this product for years and have been purchasing it off of Amazon for the past two.  I noticed my last bottle of shampoo being very thin and watery and not lathering like normal.  The conditioner also did not leave my hair as soft and silky as I am used to.  I did use the entire bottles, but when I came back to re-purchase I though I&#x27;d read the reviews to see if others were experiencing the same problem.  Seems as though I am not alone.  I would recommend buying in-store - there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s so much cheaper here!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for man years but stopped because it was so expensive. The price for this item cost me about half of what I use to pay PER BOTTLE. Now I can finally go back to the product I love at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Enjoy shampoo &amp; conditioner is my all time favorite - I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 5 years and I love everything about it !  I&#x27;ve used other expensive ones before - Pureology another favorite but this is my absolute favorite - it is expensive - but finding it on Amazon is helpful.  I buy 33 oz each time and it lasts me at least 6 to 8 mths - so it does last a long time.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo in a large amount!  I am an active swimmer and this shampoo/conditioner does a great job keeping my hair clean of all the chemicals along with re-hydrating it after my long swims.  The bottles when full are somewhat heady or just large and hard to manage - so may want to consider purchasing a pump or one of the shower shelves with a hole in the bottom to have it placed upside down.</li>
    <li> I have used Enjoy products for the last several years and wouldn&#x27;t be without them. Got them at a great price and didn&#x27;t have to run all over town to find them.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product makes my hair look and feel, it adds body and makes my hair smooth and it looks healthy. Love it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Light smell. A great deal for the size. I am allergic to sulfates so I am always hunting for a good deal!</li>
    <li> I only use the Enjoy shampoo and conditioner, The shampoo does not strip the color and the conditioner makes my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and I love it. Its a bit pricey but if you care about your hair then you&#x27;ll buy it. I do tons of damage to my hair with heat and dye. This product makes it look like i have virgin hair. I will continue to buy it year round</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!  Even though the shampoo is runny, it still works awesome. It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Always purchase the duo from Amazon and very happy with the Shampoo/Conditioner. Been using product for about 1 year now and it has my a world of difference in my hair. The bottles seem to last forever and I love that it is sulfate free. Great packaging, fast delivery and recommended product.... fair price as well!</li>
    <li> Not the real stuff--very liquidy compared to when I bought elsewhere. Previous bottles lasted me a VERY long time. I just opened the shampoo 2 weeks ago and a good chunk is already gone.</li>
    <li> Fantastic price for a fantastic product mad by a fantastic company. :)</li>
    <li> the shampoo doesn&#x27;t foam up like it should. I&#x27;ve had this product before and it wasn&#x27;t this crappy. Not sure if I got jipped or what</li>
    <li> This is a Great product and great pricing. I highly recommend to anyone. Best to get pump to go with it.</li>
    <li> Awesome semi-natural shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> My shampoo was more runny than normal like it was old or watered down or something. Conditioner was normal.</li>
    <li> its my favorite!  Works perfectly for my fine/processed hair. Also helps with the humidity since I work down by the coast.</li>
    <li> We were recommended these products, and have bought them before.  They do wonders for your hair.  But the shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem right. Its a sulfate shampoo so its not suppose to lather at all and it does.  It makes me feel like the product is not up to par.</li>
    <li> I read the previous reviews and thought, maybe I&#x27;ll get lucky because the real shampoo really works great.  However, the shampoo from this seller (sold by APPEAL) is completely watered down.  You can&#x27;t even pour it in your hand without it trickling through your fingers, and it barely lathers up.  The conditioner, on the other hand, seems fine, smells as it should and does the job (which is why this review got an extra star).  It&#x27;s hard to tell though if you don&#x27;t also have the right shampoo.  I would not recommend buying from this seller.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever! I have very long hair, which is very brittle and dry, I use the whole line from this brand!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell just as much as i loved the price!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner! My hair has never felt so great.  For a while i tried the green bottle \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot;  (i think or volumizing?) but this is the clear winner especially for those winter months when your hair gets dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also you can beat this price so much better than buying it in the salon!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, and this shampoo and conditioner made my hair frizzy</li>
    <li> This product is completely counterfeit and fake!&lt;br /&gt;I figured it out because my Enjoy Keratin Smoothing treatment was just not lasting!&lt;br /&gt;I narrowed it down to this shampoo being a fake product.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and as your salon stylist that carries Enjoy to order you bigger bottles - avoid this store on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I really am not a fan of spending a lot of money on good shampoo or conditioner, only because I don&#x27;t like my family using it since they don&#x27;t have hair color they deal with.  That means I have to buy separate shampoo and conditioner for the family and it just makes things complicated.  (Family of 6, half girls and half boys.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist turned me onto this shampoo and conditioner some time ago but I did not want to spend the money on it so I never reordered.  However, I did really like it.  I was once again in the market for affordable shampoo and conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t strip my hair of its color which is pitch black.  I was searching online and had no idea that this shampoo and conditioner was sold on amazon (I never thought to look) and I was stoked to find not only was it available but it was more affordable in a bigger bottle.  I went ahead and purchased and remembered why I liked the shampoo and conditoner to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You absolutely do not need a lot, so the large bottles I bought (33.3 oz) will last forever being that my hair is really short.  I have confidence in knowing it won&#x27;t prematurely strip my hair of its color that I pay a lot of money to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good product, nice moisture without overweighing hair. I did not give it a five star because I have noticed that may hair has fallen out more since the use of product.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, it smells great.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommend using this combination. Hair color lasts about 2 weeks longer.</li>
    <li> Exact product I buy at the salon! This shampoo / conditioner is the best!</li>
    <li> Great to buy this at a reduced price. Just need to find a better way to ship it so it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> I usely buy my hair products from the salon and this is a fake! It doesn&#x27;t work like the one you buy at the store</li>
    <li> My hair is soft &amp; not dry!</li>
    <li> A salesperson turned me onto Enjoy products and I won&#x27;t use anything else now.  I color my hair light blonde and the hair tends to get really stiff when I wash it.  This shampoo and conditioner gives a fantastic end result.  The biggest plus is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp like other over-the-counter shampoos do.  I will never use an OTC highly advertised hair product ever again.  They destroyed my scalp and created a high degree of self-consciousness of dry flakes on my shoulders.  Enjoy products do not dry your scalp.  Excellent products and highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  I always get compliments on how healthy my hair looks.  I have lots of long  thin hair, and these product do not weigh it down.</li>
    <li> This is awesome product, and hard to find locally. I paid more for 10oz bottles in a salon than I paid for these 33 oz bottle.Great product, even better deal. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product must be old or something because the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a quality product.</li>
    <li> I accidently ordered this item.  I usually use the luxury item.  Anyhow, this shampoo was very watery and I didnt like it.  It doesnt go a long way like the Enjoy Luxury.  This item is ok if you have fine colored hair and dont need alot of conditioner.</li>
    <li> They have changed their product and it now contains both soy and wheat. I suffered a terrible painful rash on my face for about 10 days before I figured out what the problem was. Unless they change it back I can&#x27;t use this product anymore. It does make your hair very pretty and healthy, but now due to it&#x27;s allergens it is off limits.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Seemed to last a very long time.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it.  Left my hair very manageable.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It&#x27;s twice the price at a salon. Large bottles last a long time. A little goes a long way. Very nice fragrance as well. I&#x27;ve been using for several years and was very happy to find on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase the Enjoy Lux, but purchased this because it was on sale.  I don&#x27;t like it as much. It doesn&#x27;t clean my hair as well and my hair feels dryer.</li>
    <li> So far I love it... my hair is starting to look and feel a lot healthier, especially after I almost burnt it all with a flat iron.</li>
    <li> Best decision ever. I have the softest hair right now. There is no buildup. My hair is light and soft. It is so easy to brush. A little goes a looonnnng way!! I use just a little dab and my hair is halfway down my back. I will never ever ever buy store brand again. I love how my hair feels!!</li>
    <li> Love these products. My hair looks and feels great after using these. Great shine and manageability. An investment for your hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased this from Malin&#x27;s Beauty after receiving a gift sample set from a friend.  The product was junk! Shampoo ran through my fingers like water and conditioner was a little thicker but not what I had in the samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the comment on using NY Supply next time, which will probably be soon as this is flowing like water down the drain!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoot and conditioner after experiencing it at my hairdresser&#x27;s shop.  She recommended it and I liked how it made my hair shiney and bouncy.  It has a pleasant fragrance and foams up nicely for a sulfate-free product.</li>
    <li> Buy it all the time, great stuff! Especially in this dry Colorado weather..</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever . I have blonde hair and this gives me the moisture I need with out getting greesey .</li>
    <li> I always use good shampoo/conditioner but have never used Enjoy. I bought for my guest bath when my 3 sister and mother visited. They loved it so much...I tried it and my hair is softer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this shampoo or conditioner before, but there&#x27;s no way the shampoo is supposed to be as thin and runny as this bottle is.  Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but it seems to be watered down. The conditioner is fine, and I like that. Even as thin as the shampoo was, though, it still made my hair look and feel nice. I don&#x27;t think I would buy again, though.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite. At least it smells good.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair that usually frizzes up and becomes unmanageable and tangled with any other shampoo.  I noticed a huge difference just after one wash with Enjoy.  My hair is never tangled and is so soft and smooth now!!!  And the shine is fantastic!  Such a great product, worth the money.</li>
    <li> Arrived with one bottle (shampoo)partially open.. Thank goodness it came in a bag... Some wasted.. :(</li>
    <li> Great price for this product, smells great and works good. I  Don&#x27;t know if I would pay full price though.</li>
    <li> Perfect if you have oily hair. I like the Shampoo it cleans very well. After about 2.5 weeks washing daily the conditioner is not moisturizing enough for normal hair.</li>
    <li> As with some of the other reviews posted, the shampoo sent to me was watered down and smelled bad.  Who knows what they are putting into it.  I mean, really watered down.  Like it slips through your fingers before you can get it on your head watered down!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had listened to the other reviewers!</li>
    <li> I have long colored hair, and i swim a few times a week, so it is hard to keep my hair looking healthy. My stylist recommended this product and this stuff works! It smells great, and leaves my hair easy to comb through, soft and really healthy looking. I would totally recommend</li>
    <li> One of best shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used. De tangles and hydrates well. Wonderful apricot scent too. Gentle on hair. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair super shiny and really subdues any frizziness associated with wavy thin hair!</li>
    <li> As a person with curly hair, this is the only shampoo/conditioner that works for me!  When I use other products my hair is dry.</li>
    <li> Supposed to be hydrating but leaves hair feeling dry.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Awesome results on first use. Pleasant scent. Concentrated consistency so do not have to use much of product. Highy recommended to rejuvenate dried and lifeless hair!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product and a great price</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for a year, when I got this shipment it was runny and watered down. Did not even smell like the shampoo is supposed to. I don&#x27;t know if it was the seller or if the company made a bad batch, but I will not be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Hands down the best I&#x27;ve tried! It&#x27;s not drying on my processed hair. Leaves my hair soft and smells great!</li>
    <li> I received Enjoy products quickly and no leaks or breakage. Great products. I will order again!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner...and no sulfates!  My hair stylist turned me on to this, and Amazon has the best price!</li>
    <li> daughter in law loves this product</li>
    <li> this shampoo and conditioner was recommended to me by a great friend who is a cosmetologist, i was hesitant to spend the money but decided to give it a shot and I absolutely love it.  My hair is so soft and hydrated now~! I love the scent of the shampoo too its a light orangy smell. Totally awesome!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Good price.</li>
    <li> I normally LOVE this shampoo and conditioner-- but the other reviews are right. These are not the same as the salon, they&#x27;re watered down.  Also, the pink &amp;#34;Luxury&amp;#34; bottle is one type, the orange the &amp;#34;Hydrating&amp;#34; -- I like the pink luxury conditioner best, but it doesn&#x27;t come in a two pack.  Would love to hear from someone who got this, the REAL stuff online for a decent price.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is definitely watered down. The conditioner is fine, and considering what you pay it&#x27;s not a bad price, but... you&#x27;ve got to use a lot of shampoo to get your hair clean. Probably not worth it in the long run.</li>
    <li> Bottle had a crack in it and spilled on other items. Other than that, it was delivered on time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Enjoy for about 10 years.  I know how this stuff is supposed to feel in my hands.  I&#x27;ve ordered it from a Amazon sellers before and had good experiences.  This was my first time ordering from APPEAL.  When I opened the shampoo and used it for the first time, it felt really runny.  It was running off my hands before I could even get it on my head.  But it smelled fine and washed my hair normally so I thought maybe I was imagining it.  I have travel-size bottles of the shampoo and conditioner that I bought from a brick-and-mortar store and I compared the consistency.  The conditioner seems the same but the shampoo that I bought from a store was definitely thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it was cleaning my hair and the price was cheap, I decided to just use it as normal and not make a fuss.  It was definitely a learning experience; I now know that when I buy a bottle of the unaltered product in the future, I can water it down a bit myself and make it stretch a little further, if I feel the need.  The difference?  I&#x27;ll be doing it with full knowledge that I&#x27;m watering down my own shampoo and I&#x27;m the one who will have shampoo that lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, that&#x27;s the problem here, seller.  You were dishonest.  You said you were selling one thing but you delivered an inferior product.  Not cool. Nobody likes feeling taken advantage of by a shady business transaction.  I won&#x27;t be doing business with you anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I just ordered this from seller NY Supply (as recommended by another reviewer) and both the shampoo and conditioner seem fine.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is watered down with something!!!  I have the travel size of this product and have used another type of shampoo by this brand for years - and it is much thicker.  Beware!</li>
    <li> My package came faster than I thought. It was exactly what I wanted. So I&#x27;ll definitely shop with them again.</li>
    <li> I have used other enjoy products and this one is not one that I would buy again. The shampoo is a little watered down.</li>
    <li> I love it, should have made the switch long time ago.</li>
    <li> Nice! Cap was open so some conditioner got everywhere. But washed it off and kept it!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It really holds my color! Just an fyi, my stylist told me that the reason it doesn&#x27;t lather as well is because it is a sulfate-free shampoo, and sulfate is partly what creates that rich lather we&#x27;re used to. But it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a great product! It just had a different consistency.</li>
    <li> Dried out my hair. Every time I used this my hair felt crispy. Will not re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I do love this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is softer and shinier than ever.  This is a great price, much less than in a salon.</li>
    <li> I  open the shampoo and it was really water down the conditioner was good. I haven&#x27;t both this shampoo before t don;t know if I will again</li>
    <li> Just love this stuff.  Leaves my fine, straight hair soft.  The conditioner does not weigh my hair down.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Smaller shampoo whoud be paired up with larger conditioner, somehow would run at at the same time.</li>
    <li> made my hair super dry</li>
    <li> I love ENJOY&#x27;s Luxury shampoo &amp; Conditioner, but the Hydrating line seemed to dry my hair out. It didn&#x27;t want to lather and my hair didn&#x27;t feel really clean after washing. I have thin, fine, naturally curly, straightened every day with a flat iron hair. I&#x27;ll stick with the Luxury shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> I Love Enjoy but I ordered hydrating and received the luxury line</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner! Best bang for your buck! Makes your hair feel so soft.</li>
    <li> I really Enjoy this product! I highly recommend it! It was shipped when promised. My hair is silky and does not get tangled.</li>
    <li> Holy cow! First night of using and it was amazing even with wet hair. My hair has never felt better. I use to use s factor and I loved it used it for years. I decided to switch it up and I have never been happier. I recommend this to anyone who has fine, colored, tangly hair! I have blond, fine, long hair and it tangles really easy. It is sometimes hard to comb when wet but with this duo it was like combing through smooth butter.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! AND YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT THE PRICE!</li>
    <li> I really made a mistake in ordering.  I meant to order the luxury one.  I like the luxury  much better.</li>
    <li> This hair treatment is very good for all hair but especially color-treated, processed hair.  I&#x27;ve used it for years with good results.</li>
    <li> These do hydrate well but my hair gets limp fast with every other day use of them. I have to alternate with a volume shampoo and conditioner. I do have semi-fine hair though and it&#x27;s always hard for me to balance shampoos and maintain moisture without getting limp hair.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years.  Keeps my hair healthy and soft even with continual coloring.  Great product - great value!</li>
    <li> Seems watered down. I have been using enjoy for over a year when I started to use these my hair dies not seem as soft and vibrant and the shook and conditioner aren&#x27;t as thick and concentrated</li>
    <li> This product was great and exactly what I was wanting</li>
    <li> When I received my package the Shampoo was opened and spilled all in the plastic.</li>
    <li> I had bought this Shampoo and conditioner in the past from professional hair Salon and it was amazing. Having that in my mind I decided to give it a try here since the price was much cheaper, but the quality was horrible and I ended up to toss it away since it was damaging my hair worse and worse. It makes my hair so dry, however I have a oily hair originally, itchy and coarse. I do not recommend this product at all because it is way different from the original one.</li>
    <li> This product was definitely tampered with. I have been using Enjoy products (particularly their shampoo and conditioner) for several years. What I received is a watered down version of the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. I would suggest ordering from a more reputable source.</li>
