      <li>This is the best looking tan I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
      <li>Glad I did the research before buying this product.</li>
      <li>I have been pleased with all of my purchases from this brand.</li>
      <li>i love this tanning line</li>
      <li>but I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I love everything I have ever purchased by Swedish Beauty and this is no exception.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THE CHERRY SCENT &amp; LOVE</li>
      <li>I love this line of lotion.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>this is a good tanning bed lotion, so-so on the moisturizing, rubs in well and it gives you some color right away</li>
      <li>Price is amazing and totally worth every penny!</li>
      <li>It smells just like sweet tarts candy and leaves a nice scent on you after tanning.  </li>
      <li>cherry smell is light and refreshing, lingers for a while</li>
      <li>Came sealed in plastic and the cover the top had the silver secure seal as well.</li>
      <li>smells good and is a great new line from Swedish beauty, i have purchased aprox 7 total Swedish beauty  products and have liked them all.</li>
      <li>But the smell is a bit strong to take throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It can be used for indoor tanning as well as outdoor tanning, a huge plus for me as I prefer to tan outdoors.</li>
      <li>Takes a while to apply but overall I&#x27;m always happy with the results.</li>
      <li>but it is a nice bronzer, got decent color.</li>
      <li>I use this indoors and out doors, Don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;Salons&amp;#34; talk you into high priced tanning lotions, Swish Beauty is always honest and delivers quality so, tell your Salon owner you buy</li>
      <li>So, that was fun!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tart and sweet and doesn&#x27;t stink after tanning.</li>
      <li>Smells VERY cherry, not bad just strong.  </li>
      <li>so we know it&#x27;s fresh...</li>
      <li>I love that this has natural bronzers and not that stuff that can smear and stain your clothes and hands.</li>
      <li>I never really see anything from tanning lotion, but the Botanica line always smell good, so I use it anyway.</li>
      <li>The price was right too.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s given me a dark Tan and smell&#x27;s good too</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>There is no &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; skin smell with this lotion, at least not that I have experienced.</li>
      <li>The smell is pretty fruity but not overly powering.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and leaves skin feeling pretty soft.</li>
      <li>It smells great &amp; is very thick.  </li>
      <li>burnt kool aid hahaha.</li>
      <li>I am really liking the color it&#x27;s producing.</li>
      <li>and then I tan very well.  </li>
      <li>For as much as i could use it..</li>
      <li>My boyfriend even mentioned to me how much softer my skin has felt since i&#x27;ve been using this bronzer.</li>
      <li>so dont wear white right after tanning in it.</li>
      <li>i do however like this line of tanning lotion, but as far as this one, i just am not a fan of the smell...</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>and they almost always turn my orangy, but this just gives me that basic brown that looks natural and beachy</li>
      <li>Not too thick and glides on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Unlike the other lotions in this line, this one is really watery.</li>
      <li>This smells a little like cough medicine when you first open it up</li>
</ol>

    <li> Great smell - works fine.</li>
    <li> I love this line of lotion. Great for sun, tanning or just all around body lotion. I had been using it for awhile and was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> GREAT SCENT!! LOVE THAT IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE THAT REGULAR SCENT OF TANNING LOTION. LOVE THE CHERRY SCENT &amp; LOVE HOW IT GOES ON NICE AND SMOOTHE BUT NOT TOO GREASY!</li>
    <li> I never really see anything from tanning lotion, but the Botanica line always smell good, so I use it anyway.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! love this and love the color i got and the glow! Price is amazing and totally worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I use this indoors and out doors, Don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;Salons&amp;#34; talk you into high priced tanning lotions, Swish Beauty is always honest and delivers quality so, tell your Salon owner you buy you&#x27;re tanning products on Amazon and and listen to the BS start.&lt;br /&gt;One girl at my salon said &amp;#34;Oh I wouldn&#x27;t buy that on line we get ours delivered cold so we know it&#x27;s fresh... I said to her and then what do you do with it? she said we put in on the shelf to sell, I said where it gets warm huh?...lol I laughed and laughed at her she turned beat red.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
    <li> Really strong smell!!! Like makes me not want to put it on, but if like that jolly rancher steong candy smell THIS IS FOR U!!!</li>
    <li> Not a strong bronzer and really runny.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the lotion and the results she achieves from the lotion. I like the smell and the price ;) We have bought several tubs and will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Best smelling product out there!</li>
    <li> The smell is pretty fruity but not overly powering. It goes on smoothly and leaves skin feeling pretty soft. There is no &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; skin smell with this lotion, at least not that I have experienced.</li>
    <li> This product gives me the results I seek in a tanning lotion. It can be used for indoor tanning as well as outdoor tanning, a huge plus for me as I prefer to tan outdoors. In addition, this product doesn&#x27;t contain parabens or other chemicals that I may be weare of. It also smells great and aids in achieving an even toned tan wherever it is applied. I recommend this product as well as other Swedish Beauty Botanica brand items. I have been pleased with all of my purchases from this brand.</li>
    <li> This smells like Strawberry Shortcake dolls from the 80&#x27;s. So, that was fun! But the smell is a bit strong to take throughout the day. Unlike the other lotions in this line, this one is really watery. I prefer the others.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works perfectly. Glad I did the research before buying this product. Very pleased. A+</li>
    <li> When I started to use this lotion I had not been tanning in over a year. My skin type has minimal burning in the beginning and then I tan very well.  I remember having a good experience with Fig Get Me Not and decided to try this one.  I love this lotion.  It smells just like sweet tarts candy and leaves a nice scent on you after tanning.  I have only been tanning for a few weeks now (tanning every other day or so) and I have a wonderfully dark color.  I love that this has natural bronzers and not that stuff that can smear and stain your clothes and hands.</li>
    <li> Smells good going on and still smells good after you&#x27;re done tanning.</li>
    <li> i recieved the package really fast, however i failed to read that it was a bronzer. i do however like this line of tanning lotion, but as far as this one, i just am not a fan of the smell... in the tanning bed it smelled like burnt kool aid hahaha. but it is a nice bronzer, got decent color. and again i only give it 3 stars because i personally dont like bronzers. and the smell of it.</li>
    <li> It smells great &amp; is very thick.  I like it a lot.  The price was right too.  Swedish Beauty is the best.</li>
    <li> great bronze. a nice alternative to a tingle or great if you don&#x27;t care for tingled tanning lotions. smells good and is a great new line from Swedish beauty, i have purchased aprox 7 total Swedish beauty  products and have liked them all. this product is a great starter or maintainer.</li>
    <li> i love this tanning line</li>
    <li> I love the smell and I think I get a great color out of it. I have $75 bottles with brozers, etc... and they almost always turn my orangy, but this just gives me that basic brown that looks natural and beachy</li>
    <li> Loved this tanning lotion!! For as much as i could use it.. Im pregnant now and cannot use an indoor tanning bed lol have to wait for summer now.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to buy this on line but I am so glad I did. It works so good. It&#x27;s given me a dark Tan and smell&#x27;s good too</li>
    <li> Smells VERY cherry, not bad just strong.  Not really any ATO with this lotion.  Takes a while to apply but overall I&#x27;m always happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 3 or 4 weeks. I am really liking the color it&#x27;s producing. This is the best looking tan I&#x27;ve had so far. I usually don&#x27;t like Cherry smells, but i&#x27;ve gotten used to and am beginning to like this one. It&#x27;s tart and sweet and doesn&#x27;t stink after tanning. The consistency is nice. Not too thick and glides on smoothly. I&#x27;ve never had streaking from this lotion. My boyfriend even mentioned to me how much softer my skin has felt since i&#x27;ve been using this bronzer. I have extremely sensitive skin and this has never irritated it. Moisturizes and tones. Arrived in the mail on time. Will be purchasing again for sure!</li>
    <li> This smells a little like cough medicine when you first open it up but it smells good in the tanning bed ANd afterward.</li>
    <li> Its a nice lotion &amp; smells good</li>
    <li> this is a good tanning bed lotion, so-so on the moisturizing, rubs in well and it gives you some color right away so dont wear white right after tanning in it. 4 stars cuz the smell is very strong and doesnt have a good &amp;#34;cooked&amp;#34; smell once youve tanned in a bed for 10 mins. it reminds me of cherry cough syrup and suntan lotion smell</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone seeking not only to have the best tan in town but smell soooooo good while doing so.&lt;br /&gt;The cherry smell is light and refreshing, lingers for a while and you don&#x27;t leave the salon with the usual odor from tanning. I love everything I have ever purchased by Swedish Beauty and this is no exception. Came sealed in plastic and the cover the top had the silver secure seal as well.</li>
