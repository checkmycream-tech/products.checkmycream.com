      <li>What else can I say, it does what it&#x27;s made for and is better than your units dragging on the table/counter or being piled up.</li>
      <li>This item is okay.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Thank you I will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>Can work on wig better with this stand than the shorter ones.  </li>
      <li>I just wish I could have gotten a better deal for my budget.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely perfect for long wigs.  </li>
      <li>I love this thing my wigs look fantastic on it</li>
      <li>i understand styrofoam can break easily</li>
      <li>I still kept it and just put some strong tape to hold the pieces together</li>
      <li>and it holds fine.</li>
      <li>The free shipping helped though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect it really works well with long wigs.</li>
      <li>It would be great if it had a little more weight to it.</li>
      <li>keeps my wig off the table top and allows the hair to flow straight down.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve moved with a van packed full of stuff and stayed in one piece</li>
      <li>The other one I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
      <li>Worth the investment.  </li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>However, I think next time I&#x27;ll shop around a little more and see if I can find a great deal.</li>
      <li>My daughter needed this for a Comic Con and it was the right head.</li>
      <li>but again, because I need these products immediately, I had to improvise and hot glue</li>
      <li>it was the exact head provided by the SE Flower Show.  </li>
      <li>The form is a little cheap quality and is starting to crumble when using the  t pins for the money it should be made better and more durable.  </li>
      <li>I love this long necked mannequin.  </li>
      <li>But my wigs hang nicely from this head and weigh it down.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and decided for the price I would give it a try, Its a little Flimsy on the light weight side, but really good for long wigs.</li>
      <li>but this still shouldnt have happened, it should have been packaged much smarter.</li>
      <li>It came in one piece and sits up straight to hold my wigs on my shelf.</li>
      <li>She looked at others but this was it it was also reasonably..</li>
      <li>Really sturdy.  </li>
      <li>I know I did not pay much for them</li>
      <li>They are cheap white styrofoam and don&#x27;t even stand up.</li>
      <li>I wish they didn&#x27;t cost so much</li>
      <li>When this item arrived, it was cracked at the neck/in two pieces like many other reviewers mentioned, and I couldn&#x27;t beleive how it was packaged.</li>
      <li>Nice long neck for your more glamorous units although if your unit is really heavy it does tend to tip over if you don&#x27;t set it down</li>
      <li>They arrived in a huge box and each one had a few layers of bubble wrap.</li>
      <li>Since this is taller than some stands, it is good to get the base because Styrofoam is light.  </li>
      <li>Base is good for smaller stands too because of their light weight.</li>
      <li>But both necks had cracks in them, one a little more severe than the other.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering another in the near future.</li>
      <li>This Styrofoam heads worked really well and without the cost of the other long neck heads.</li>

<li> This is ironic, as styrofoam is usually used to protect items during transit.  </li>
<li> I have a 36\\&quot; long wig and this is the key to styling, and storage for me.....</li>
<li> I need this one for extra long hair.</li>
<li> the item arrived bubble wrapped with so much tape stuck all around that in the process of just unwrapping it, the top snapped off from the bottom base.</li>
<li> But no worries, setting it down just right is not some big task, you just have to give it a few seconds and pay attention to how you set it down.</li>
<li> Really long neck.  </li>
<li> I needed this for my long haired wig.  </li>
<li> The seller saw fit to protect their product with a few thin sheets of brown paper.    </li>
<li> Not a very sturdy item.  </li>
<li> Even so, one of the foam heads did have a slight crack on the neck.</li>
<li> Because of my time restraint I am unable to send this product back to the company.</li>
<li> No more messed up ends dusting the closet shelf.!</li>
<li> Worthless.  </li>
<li> Wish the base was a bit sturdier.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The foam is so light-weight, I was worried the head would topple over. But my wigs hang nicely from this head and weigh it down. I went ahead and bought a second one.</li>
    <li> I bought a 2 pack. They arrived in a huge box and each one had a few layers of bubble wrap. Even so, one of the foam heads did have a slight crack on the neck. It eventually broke all the way about a week later. The other one I&#x27;m happy with. Most of my wigs are 10&amp;#34; to 14&amp;#34; and this is perfect to use while stying. I wish i could find this same item made out of a sturdier material.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid you can&#x27;t beat it.  I have a 36\\&quot; long wig and this is the key to styling, and storage for me.....</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect for long wigs.  No more messed up ends dusting the closet shelf.!</li>
    <li> I love this long necked mannequin.  She is perfect for what I need her for.  Light weight and great for display.</li>
    <li> Because of my time restraint I am unable to send this product back to the company. But both necks had cracks in them, one a little more severe than the other. I know I did not pay much for them but again, because I need these products immediately, I had to improvise and hot glue the cracks to keep them from cracking anymore &amp; breaking.</li>
    <li> When this item arrived, it was cracked at the neck/in two pieces like many other reviewers mentioned, and I couldn&#x27;t beleive how it was packaged. It was simply wrapped in one of those silver plastic sleeves... no bubble wrap or anything protecting it. Had the seller packaged it correctly I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The ones I received look nothing like the photo. They are cheap white styrofoam and don&#x27;t even stand up. I will be returning them.</li>
    <li> Thank you I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I love this thing my wigs look fantastic on it it may be Styrofoam but I&#x27;ve moved with a van packed full of stuff and stayed in one piece so i&#x27;m very happy i got this one of my best buys!!</li>
    <li> Not a very sturdy item.  When I opened the box, I found that the neck had cracked in two during shipment.  Worthless.  This is ironic, as styrofoam is usually used to protect items during transit.  The seller saw fit to protect their product with a few thin sheets of brown paper.    I would pass on this one.</li>
    <li> wife likes it.  if she is happy, then I am too!!!</li>
    <li> Really long neck.  Really sturdy.  Worth the investment.  I like the color.  I will be ordering another in the near future.</li>
    <li> It was perfect to store my large Halloween monster mask.  Quick shipping.  Great deal.  Love it.  Would order another if I needed one.</li>
    <li> I need this one for extra long hair.</li>
    <li> This mannequin head is the perfect height and is very elegant.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my wig off the table top and allows the hair to flow straight down.&lt;br /&gt;Very chic</li>
    <li> Great product!  It allows room for those longer hairstyles or for those who have to constantly adjust to the standard (smaller) foam heads.</li>
    <li> This mannequin head was very reasonably priced &amp; is perfect for my wigs. It would be great if it had a little more weight to it.</li>
    <li> This turned out perfect for me. Because it is Styrofoam you have to be carefull but it works great for longer wigs.</li>
    <li> This item is okay.  I just wish I could have gotten a better deal for my budget.  The free shipping helped though. I needed this for my long haired wig.  However, I think next time I&#x27;ll shop around a little more and see if I can find a great deal. Overall, it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect it really works well with long wigs.</li>
    <li> Very good for longer wigs.  Can work on wig better with this stand than the shorter ones.  However, for shorter wigs, one of the shorter stands are great too! Since this is taller than some stands, it is good to get the base because Styrofoam is light.  Base is good for smaller stands too because of their light weight.</li>
    <li> The form is a little cheap quality and is starting to crumble when using the  t pins for the money it should be made better and more durable.  Would I order another one,no I probably would not</li>
    <li> Speedy shipment. Wish the base was a bit sturdier.</li>
    <li> I wish they didn&#x27;t cost so much</li>
    <li> ive bought styrofoam heads before so i know what to expect, but i&#x27;ve never tried this color/brand. the item arrived bubble wrapped with so much tape stuck all around that in the process of just unwrapping it, the top snapped off from the bottom base. i understand styrofoam can break easily but this still shouldnt have happened, it should have been packaged much smarter. I still kept it and just put some strong tape to hold the pieces together and it holds fine. my issue isnt with the item, its with the company who sent it!</li>
    <li> Nice color,comes with 1 pin. Nice long neck for your more glamorous units although if your unit is really heavy it does tend to tip over if you don&#x27;t set it down just right. But no worries, setting it down just right is not some big task, you just have to give it a few seconds and pay attention to how you set it down. Not at all a deterrent. What else can I say, it does what it&#x27;s made for and is better than your units dragging on the table/counter or being piled up.</li>
    <li> Head was for testing a floral show entry.  Low and behold it was the exact head provided by the SE Flower Show.  Had to construct entry on site...aced it and won 1st place plus National.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided for the price I would give it a try, Its a little Flimsy on the light weight side, but really good for long wigs.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get why people are complaining about this product. It came in one piece and sits up straight to hold my wigs on my shelf. I have used it to pin, brush, as well as trim my wigs. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends!</li>
    <li> Perfect will get more</li>
    <li> I had the regular wig head and a longer wig that I would have hanging over the counter. This Styrofoam heads worked really well and without the cost of the other long neck heads.</li>
    <li> My daughter needed this for a Comic Con and it was the right head. She looked at others but this was it it was also reasonably..</li>
    <li> I put everything on this head...hats, wigs, ect.</li>
