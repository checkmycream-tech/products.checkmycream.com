      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Love it Love it</li>
      <li>Love these clippers.</li>
      <li>Everything was as expected, the price was perfect for me, and I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about these folks!</li>
      <li>and I do like how the blade heads can be swapped so easily.</li>
      <li>It is a make sleek product easy to handle and easy to control.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 5 months now, and it is still going quite strong.  </li>
      <li>My wife is a hair stylist and really liked this brand at first for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Blades glide smoothly with no \\&quot;drag\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I love this shaver, but the first one I bought wouldn&#x27;t charge and had to be returned.</li>
      <li>The spacer is just the right length for my needs.  </li>
      <li>Works fine so far without harming the skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smaller, lighter and better in every way to the Wahl brand one i&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>My wife is a hairdresser for many years and believes it does not cut close enough to the skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this thing performs better than regular hair cutters i&#x27;ve had from Wahl.  </li>
      <li>and then it would throw hairs, so i would have more hair all over my body and over a bigger location than the Forfex does.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was going to be smaller, but it is still easy to use</li>
      <li>Needed to replace snap on, cheaper to buy whole set than plastic parts.</li>
      <li>This cordless trimmer holds its charge very well.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely little machine.</li>
      <li>Well she almost died when she found out that I could get her a brand new clipper with the cord for $20.00  </li>
      <li>so asked me if I would look on Amazon for a new cord.  </li>
      <li>they work the  same and i am also supporting  breast  cancer....</li>
      <li>So far it has lasted 2+ years.  </li>
      <li>try and get my wife what she wants but after the 3rd item broke I bought for her, I told her</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;on/Off&amp;#34; switch for these Toys R Us quality &amp;#34;clippers&amp;#34; fell completely off.</li>
      <li>They wont hold a charge, dont cut close to the skin and are loud.</li>
      <li>you call to tell them that their product broke, they make you pay shipping to get it fixed while it may take weeks to get your product</li>
      <li>i used the one from Wahl, the battery never lasted long enough to do my entire scalp, but this Forfex model was going strong by the time i finished</li>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t what I expected,,, didn&#x27;t really look like a T-blade to me</li>
      <li>The Wahl model has always made a big mess of little hairs everywhere because i had to keep going over and over the same location before it would cut it how i liked it</li>
      <li>I purchased this little razor because it looked feminine, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>i am  a man and the same exact one in black  </li>

<li> They work very well when i have little boys I don&#x27;t want to scare with the noise of my peanut edgers, but the forfex isn&#x27;t as sharp as I would like.</li>
<li> It arrived at the expected date with the proper box.</li>
<li> /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t snag on hair, rip hair, and the battery lasts a long time as compared with other trimmer&#x27;s</li>
<li> i could  care less that it is pink  </li>
<li> Blades are very sharp.</li>
<li> Therefore it&#x27;s tough to use as an actual edger.</li>
<li> I am a stylist and this product is not cut out for my everyday use of it, plus it is not a close emit shave for my clients.</li>
<li> When i was done with the Forfex i hardly had any hairs on my shoulders and lap.</li>
<li> Not happy with it at all.</li>
<li> for 20 beans you  cant go wrong</li>
<li> wtf  </li>
<li> /&gt;Extremely disappointed.</li>
<li> Very unhappy.</li>

    <li> This product said to charge it for 16 hours prior to use. I followed the instructions and it has never turned on or even charged enought to turn on. Not happy with it at all.</li>
    <li> I bought the trimmer for my wife who just got her license and is starting in her cosmetology career. She said they work great and is very pleased with them. Thanks!</li>
    <li> for the price I guess I got what I paid for. They work very well when i have little boys I don&#x27;t want to scare with the noise of my peanut edgers, but the forfex isn&#x27;t as sharp as I would like. good price for what I bought though.</li>
    <li> the only thing is when is it say&#x27;s t-blade it isn&#x27;t what I expected,,, didn&#x27;t really look like a T-blade to me</li>
    <li> Love it Love it Love it Love it -&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for this item for some time now. Thx</li>
    <li> This is a lovely little machine. I use it to trim my beard and eyebrows.  The spacer is just the right length for my needs.  I&#x27;ve had it for 5 months now, and it is still going quite strong.  I only charge it intermittently.  I&#x27;ve heard that they last a lot longer when you charge intermittently, rather than constantly. My sister is a beautician, and leaves hers charging 24/7. So far it has lasted 2+ years.  She paid MUCH more for hers, than I did for mine!</li>
    <li> Needed to replace snap on, cheaper to buy whole set than plastic parts. What&#x27;s up with that?  Still use it to trim.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver, but the first one I bought wouldn&#x27;t charge and had to be returned. That is the only reason I gave four stars. The second one I bought has worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers, highly recommend</li>
    <li> It is a make sleek product easy to handle and easy to control. The charge as well and also plugs into the wall so can be used at any moment. My wife is a hairdresser for many years and believes it does not cut close enough to the skin. Therefore it&#x27;s tough to use as an actual edger.</li>
    <li> My friend loves these clippers and orginially paid $99 for them.  She ended up loosing the charging cord so asked me if I would look on Amazon for a new cord.  Well she almost died when she found out that I could get her a brand new clipper with the cord for $20.00  I&#x27;ve never used these clippers but she is a big fan.</li>
    <li> I purchased this little razor because it looked feminine, exactly what I was looking for. When it came in the mail it was even nicer and cuter than pictured on-line. It works exactly the way I wanted it to work, I am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am a stylist and this product is not cut out for my everyday use of it, plus it is not a close emit shave for my clients. But it is cute!</li>
    <li> Everything is as described. It arrived at the expected date with the proper box. Works fine so far without harming the skin. For $20 it&#x27;ts a very good deal. One of the best shaving machines I&#x27;ve ever had. The only disadvantage (not big) is that the comb attachments are not adjustable.</li>
    <li> This brand seems to be cheaper than anything you could buy at the Dollar Tree. My wife is a hair stylist and really liked this brand at first for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;I try and get my wife what she wants but after the 3rd item broke I bought for her, I told her it&#x27;s time to switch brands. The &amp;#34;on/Off&amp;#34; switch for these Toys R Us quality &amp;#34;clippers&amp;#34; fell completely off. I cannot tell you what amount of planets in the solar system would have to line up before I could ever be convinced to buy another one of their products again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you call to tell them that their product broke, they make you pay shipping to get it fixed while it may take weeks to get your product back then it breaks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed. Stay away.</li>
    <li> This cordless trimmer holds its charge very well. Blades glide smoothly with no \\&quot;drag\\&quot;. Blades are very sharp. Ergonomically styled,  very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be smaller, but it is still easy to use and I do like how the blade heads can be swapped so easily.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for her work as a beautician and she said it worked great.</li>
    <li> It was amazing. I ordered it on my phone and I know the thing was at my house within 2 days because when the box came I had no idea what it was until I opened it. I am completely impressed with this seller!  Everything was as expected, the price was perfect for me, and I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about these folks!</li>
    <li> for 20 beans you  cant go wrong it works great....i am  a man and the same exact one in black  was  35 beans so  wtf  i could  care less that it is pink  they work the  same and i am also supporting  breast  cancer....</li>
    <li> Very unhappy. They wont hold a charge, dont cut close to the skin and are loud.</li>
    <li> best trimmer i&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t snag on hair, rip hair, and the battery lasts a long time as compared with other trimmer&#x27;s i&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this thing performs better than regular hair cutters i&#x27;ve had from Wahl.  It&#x27;s smaller, lighter and better in every way to the Wahl brand one i&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i used the one from Wahl, the battery never lasted long enough to do my entire scalp, but this Forfex model was going strong by the time i finished so i think i could have cut someone else&#x27;s hair on the same charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also cleaner, for some reason.  The Wahl model has always made a big mess of little hairs everywhere because i had to keep going over and over the same location before it would cut it how i liked it and then it would throw hairs, so i would have more hair all over my body and over a bigger location than the Forfex does.  When i was done with the Forfex i hardly had any hairs on my shoulders and lap.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers. Will always use them!</li>
