      <li>Good formula doesn&#x27;t cake and has a ball in the bottle</li>
      <li>Mostly good.</li>
      <li>My favorite!</li>
      <li>i love this eyeliner!</li>
      <li>very nice, glides smoothly, no mess, and flawless application.</li>
      <li>Nice color options</li>
      <li>Yeah it&#x27;s vegan and they claim it&#x27;s hypoallergenic but use at your own risk.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s vegan and very natural, and it has a great price!</li>
      <li>I never have to reapply, and when I want to take it off, I just use some oil and water, and it comes off very easily.</li>
      <li>Perfect, I was looking for a natural eyeliner but was a bit skeptic.</li>
      <li>This is much easier to put on than my old eyeliner, looks great, lasts, and is vegan and not tested on animals :D</li>
      <li>This liquid eyeliner goes on very smoothly, and never falls off or runs during the day.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more like &amp;#34;black sparkle&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;black pearl&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I love this liquid eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Much better than the maybelline eyeliner I used before</li>
      <li>and it looks good as new.</li>
      <li>Keep it on the lid, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>Best nontoxic natural liquid eyeliner by far.</li>
      <li>, I think looking out for these signs over time and not ignoring them is important.</li>
      <li>It really stays in place and is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive eyes, applies easily no flaking, great price.</li>
      <li>all natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and stays put all day ,the color is really nice too</li>
      <li>Nice eyeliner, like that its natural.</li>
      <li>how good you wash your eyes until you actually run your finger along the line to wipe it off.</li>
      <li>I tried to apply it different ways but still experienced severe stinging that was worse than what I experienced with drugstore eyeliners.</li>
      <li>I also love that it is natural.</li>
      <li>I am stoked to have found this because most natural liners fade fast.</li>
      <li>to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it consistently for about 3 weeks</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, and it seems to last forever!</li>
      <li>If you want a super thin line, good luck.</li>
      <li>With how much I paid for it</li>
      <li>But that brush-type applicator is a real bummer.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner really lasts.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to remove it completely with a wet q-tip.</li>
      <li>Okay, so the tip of this is not exactly a brush.</li>
      <li>It is a lovely dark shade with lot&#x27;s of sparkle, but the sparkle is small enough to not be overwhelming and comes more off as pearlescent, as the name would suggest.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little thick but still the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>highly recommend</li>
      <li>I was excited the first time I put it on because I felt no uncomfortable sensations or stinging and because the tip was so fine, I could easily make the line as thin or thick as I wanted</li>
      <li>I made the mistake of not doing more research about all the ingredients as I usually do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m returning this back to Whole Foods and will just discontinue using eyeliner for now while researching a safer but still all natural eyeliner.</li>
      <li>My eyes are extremely sensitive (even Clinique makes my eyes itch)</li>
      <li>Goes on great - not watery and thin like some other vegan liquid liners.</li>
      <li>The other colors Zuzu makes are fun but run easier.</li>
      <li>For anyone looking for a new black liquid liner, I would really have to recommend!</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin &amp; multiple allergies, and this does not bother me.</li>

<li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; multiple allergies, and this does not bother me.</li>
<li> I had been experiencing discomfort with certain drugstore eyeliners (not all) and decided it was time to pick up an all natural eyeliner because it would be safer for my eye in the long run and probably wouldn&#x27;t be as irritating.</li>
<li> It takes a really long time to dry though.</li>
<li> And it is Black Pearl, which is not black black.  </li>
<li> ; the raven could get a bit cakey and was very dry, but it is meant to be a matte finish.</li>
<li> This seemed to make the corners of my eyes red and raw if I wore it for too long.</li>
<li> STORM metallic-y navy blue (a little patchy, needs a couple of passes)</li>
<li> I have been using mine for a few months on and off and still have plenty left!</li>
<li> Stays dark black all day long.</li>
<li> I use it less often now that my make up company came out with a powder eyeliner that can be applied wet too.</li>
<li> TAUREG dark brown matte.</li>
<li> I like the Black Pearl as compared to the Raven because it has the pearlescent quality</li>
<li> BLACK PEARL  is pewter with silvery shimmers.</li>
<li> I picked up this eyeliner at Whole Foods and was appalled at the price but bought it because I&#x27;ve been on a quest to use all natural</li>
<li> Sometimes, the dark line can be a little harsh</li>
<li> Once they dried, they don&#x27;t move until you remove it with oil.</li>
<li> My go-to black eyeliner!</li>
<li> It is stiff, so it is hard to get the thickness that you want.</li>
<li> and then I suddenly started experiencing painful stinging every time I put it on.</li>
<li> , I&#x27;m really, really disappointed</li>
<li> I do like the fact that there is not a bunch of crap in it and it does not burn my eyes if my eyes water a lot for some reason.</li>

    <li> It has a metallic look to it...it&#x27;s more like &amp;#34;black sparkle&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;black pearl&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> makes your eyes sparkle and shizzle. look like a hawt la la lady. work it girs. work it. boom. boom.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, and it seems to last forever!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay longer on my oily eyelids.</li>
    <li> I had been experiencing discomfort with certain drugstore eyeliners (not all) and decided it was time to pick up an all natural eyeliner because it would be safer for my eye in the long run and probably wouldn&#x27;t be as irritating.I picked up this eyeliner at Whole Foods and was appalled at the price but bought it because I&#x27;ve been on a quest to use all natural (don&#x27;t necessarily have to be all organic of course) makeup. I was excited the first time I put it on because I felt no uncomfortable sensations or stinging and because the tip was so fine, I could easily make the line as thin or thick as I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it consistently for about 3 weeks and then I suddenly started experiencing painful stinging every time I put it on. I tried to apply it different ways but still experienced severe stinging that was worse than what I experienced with drugstore eyeliners. With how much I paid for it and it&#x27;s claims, I&#x27;m really, really disappointed because I know over time this will probably damage my eyes. Yeah it&#x27;s vegan and they claim it&#x27;s hypoallergenic but use at your own risk. I made the mistake of not doing more research about all the ingredients as I usually do. Others might not experience stinging after while, some might but either way, I think looking out for these signs over time and not ignoring them is important. I&#x27;m returning this back to Whole Foods and will just discontinue using eyeliner for now while researching a safer but still all natural eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I love this liquid eyeliner. It does burn if it gets in your eye, but that&#x27;s not where it belongs! Keep it on the lid, and you&#x27;ll be fine. I have very sensitive skin &amp; multiple allergies, and this does not bother me.</li>
    <li> This liquid eyeliner goes on very smoothly, and never falls off or runs during the day. Sometimes, the dark line can be a little harsh so I soften it with a q-tip. It is very easy to remove it completely with a wet q-tip. My eyes are extremely sensitive (even Clinique makes my eyes itch) but this product hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation at all!</li>
    <li> Okay, so the tip of this is not exactly a brush. It is stiff, so it is hard to get the thickness that you want. If you want a super thin line, good luck.

    <li> Perfect for cat eye style.</li>
    <li> I picked up zuzu brand eyeliner over a year ago and have gone through 3 tubes since. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be switching brands any time soon... This color has glitter/ sparkles in it.</li>
    <li> Janet SteeleI  t&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> great liner, stays on all day. BLACK PEARL  is pewter with silvery shimmers. TAUREG dark brown matte. STORM metallic-y navy blue (a little patchy, needs a couple of passes) LUXORE metallic coppery/bronze. Once they dried, they don&#x27;t move until you remove it with oil. highly recommend</li>
    <li> My go-to black eyeliner! It is a lovely dark shade with lot&#x27;s of sparkle, but the sparkle is small enough to not be overwhelming and comes more off as pearlescent, as the name would suggest. Great application, the applicators in this line are great for precise and perfect lining, as you are able to apply! Good formula doesn&#x27;t cake and has a ball in the bottle so you can give it a good shake before using! I have been using mine for a few months on and off and still have plenty left! I like the Black Pearl as compared to the Raven because it has the pearlescent quality; the raven could get a bit cakey and was very dry, but it is meant to be a matte finish.

I never have to reapply, and when I want to take it off, I just use some oil and water, and it comes off very easily. My favorite!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. It really stays in place and is very easy to use. I also love that it is natural.</li>
    <li> Mostly good. It takes a really long time to dry though. I use it less often now that my make up company came out with a powder eyeliner that can be applied wet too. This seemed to make the corners of my eyes red and raw if I wore it for too long.</li>
    <li> very nice, glides smoothly, no mess, and flawless application. Is comparable to Dr Hauschka pencil liner. I will definitely reprchase again.</li>
    <li> Perfect, I was looking for a natural eyeliner but was a bit skeptic. This works great!</li>
    <li> This is much easier to put on than my old eyeliner, looks great, lasts, and is vegan and not tested on animals :D perfect! Much better than the maybelline eyeliner I used before</li>
    <li> This eyeliner really lasts.  It&#x27;s a little thick but still the best I&#x27;ve found.  The other colors Zuzu makes are fun but run easier.</li>
    <li> I use this one all the time with no problems. I can wear it all day and it lasts. I&#x27;ve worn this to bed several times and just had to touch up the corners in the morning and it looks good as new. (not that I&#x27;m suggesting you make a habit of this lol) You can use it in your water line and it will stay all day as well. Even when you wash your face it will stay in your waterline no mater how good you wash your eyes until you actually run your finger along the line to wipe it off. Goes on great - not watery and thin like some other vegan liquid liners. Highly recommended. I&#x27;ve never had burning or stinging from this one even when I sleep with it. Perhaps those who felt stinging were allergic to one of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Best nontoxic natural liquid eyeliner by far. Stays dark black all day long. I am stoked to have found this because most natural liners fade fast.</li>
    <li> i love this eyeliner! all natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and stays put all day ,the color is really nice too</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive eyes, applies easily no flaking, great price. Nice color options</li>
    <li> Nice eyeliner, like that its natural.</li>
