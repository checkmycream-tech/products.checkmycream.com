    <li> Not another product will do!  There is no substitute for this lotion.</li>
    <li> Addicted! This is by far the best hand moisturizer I have ever used. It is silky, smells fantastic, and doesn&#x27;t require re-application after washing hands. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it AND it is cruelty free!!! For those of you that have not tried it and think it might be too expensive..you only need a very small amount each time so it lasts a long time It is worth every penny! Was so happy to find on Amazon because it isn&#x27;t easy to find at retail in US.</li>
    <li> I loved this at first, because of the wonderful smell and how quickly it absorbs. But, when I saw that (over time) it was making my hands DRYER, I stopped buying it. Now, I stick to l&#x27;Occitane, which is expensive but works super well.</li>
    <li> my mother has always had rough hands from housework. we have tried every hand cream out there. well this cream I received an email from my mom about a month after Christmas. &amp;#34;where did you get that hand cream? omg that cream is amazing.&amp;#34;  Then I tried it. and wow is it nice. no greasy feel at all and the loveliest cinnamon scent after wards. Ive used this cream on my heels as well and it helped them a lot. I recommend this cream to all</li>
    <li> Awakening Hands works extremely well at treating &amp; preventing dry hands. It is a light, greasless product that is easily absorbed by your skin. The fragrence is light &amp; slightly herbal (pretty neutral in that it is niether masculine or feminine). This hand cream stays on even after your hands get wet &amp; can withstand one or two light washings. Doesn&#x27;t stain clothing. I received a small container for a gift a few years ago. My hands chap quickly and my fingers tend to crack &amp; bleed in the winter. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products in comparison. Awakening hands will repair this &amp; then, if used daily, will prevent it from happening again. It is somewhat expensive &amp; I used to get it directly from Amazon.com for two 3.5 oz. bottles for around [...], which was a great price. So, I hope amazon.com brings that back. You could probably find it locally for around the same [...] price and avoid the shipping &amp; handling that this vendor will most likely charge you though. I do recommend this product to friends &amp; family.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!  It is the ONLY thing tht helps my hubby&#x27;s hands get sorta soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;He is a contractor and his hand gets chewed up most of the time so I love&lt;br /&gt;to have it in the house as well!!</li>
    <li> This may be on the expensive side but it is worth every dime you spend.  However, I have found it for less money, of all places, the local shoe repair shop!!</li>

    <li> I have used this product for many years ever since my daughter got for me one year for a gift.  This year I have received treatment for breast cancer, including radition which badly burns your skins and needed to keep the area moisturized.  I used this cream successfully durning the many months of treatment.  It actually has healing qualities and the area affected by the treatments, NEVER got infected and after treatments healed quickly.  I showed the cream to my doctor and he said he would recommended it to other patients going through such treatments.  I will continue to use this cream on my hands, face and any part of my body with peeling, skin.&lt;br /&gt;Joanne</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. It smells wonderful  a bit spicy, but very subtle. It is non-greasy. Many products will say non greasy but this one truly is! I have very dry hands that can crack and be quite painful due to washing them may times a day at work (vet tech).  This lotion quickly heals, sooths and moisturizes without making a greasy slippery mess.  I stocked up since this was not avaliable for a while. This is great lotion and a little dab is all that is needed.</li>
    <li> great product, only a tiny bit goes a long way, you hands aren&#x27;t the slightest bit greasy as the product absorbs nearly instantly, my wife loves it too</li>
    <li> this is wonderful hand cream .  it helps keep my hands and feet smooth and lovely. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;You will love it.</li>
    <li> Thanks, something new to me.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and smells great!</li>
    <li> a good moisturizer not oily or sticky without a strong scent</li>
    <li> A very effective hand lotion. Only a little needed to keep hands moisturized all day. I&#x27;ve been very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This product is Absolutely Amazing. Not just for hands .... works wonders on feet (better than Awakening feet cream) Has a really nice cinnamon scent.</li>
    <li> I suffer from pretty dry skin and this product is the answer for me. It was originally developed for gardeners. I put it on 3 or 4 times a day and it stays on through light hand washing. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This is VERY moistening handcream and keeps my hands feeling good for a long time.  Nice stuff! I would reccomend.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hands.  My manicurist says I need to stop using them as tools.(Yep, gardening, cleaning, painting with art.)  This stuff works great for me and I love the fragrance!</li>
    <li> This is the best daytime hand cream! I have tried them all, and what I like best about this cream is that it absorbs instantly so you can get right back to what you were doing without leaving greasy hand prints everywhere. I use a richer hand cream at night, but this is my daytime go to. I&#x27;ve given it as gifts to people who hate hand cream, and they approved too.</li>
    <li> I order this for my mom, she loves it!</li>
    <li> Not greasy so you can go about your business without leaving marks on whatever your doing!  It also is so soothing...feels great on your hands.</li>
