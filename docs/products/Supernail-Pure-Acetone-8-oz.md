      <li>:D</li>
      <li>very good acetone</li>
      <li>And product was great</li>
      <li>works great.. great deal</li>
      <li>I have found this is amazing to remove glitter polish as well!</li>
      <li>I bought a really good nail polish remover in EU that I can not find online.</li>
      <li>really happy with it :)</li>
      <li>Pretty good!!</li>
      <li>the smell is very strong.  </li>
      <li>Pure perfect non-denatured Acetone, arrived in only three days and in perfect condition, would purchase again!</li>
      <li>Sure it is a bit drying, but that&#x27;s what nail and cuticle oils are for...</li>
      <li>But its good and strong and takes the polish off quickly.</li>
      <li>Pure Acetone polish remover on time and finely packaged.  </li>
      <li>also, the time savings is worth a bit of drying IMHO.</li>
      <li>Acetone is by far more powerful than traditional nail-polish remover, so it takes glitter polish (specifically why I purchased this) off very easily.  </li>
      <li>I would not really reccomend this if your looking for something very strong that makes removing nail polish a quick task.</li>
      <li>I also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t remove polish easily with cotton pads, but instead requires a more textured surface w/ traction like heavy duty paper towel.</li>
      <li>It is very overpriced....</li>
      <li>Works Very well, will buy again</li>
      <li>This product really does the trick when removing gel uv nail polish.</li>
      <li>Very helpful with getting the acrylic off the brushes and my nails.</li>
      <li>Amazingggggg finally the nail polish remover is with one quick swipe and its gone</li>
      <li>Other than that package came fast....</li>
      <li>Typically glitter polish takes forever to take off, but the pure acetone makes it a breeze.</li>

<li> It will do other things that acetone does.</li>
<li> Uses less so lasts longer!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the price.....</li>

    <li> Amazingggggg finally the nail polish remover is with one quick swipe and its gone&lt;br /&gt;This acetone is the best&lt;br /&gt;I will keep repurchase it again</li>
    <li> Supernail delivered my 8 oz. Pure Acetone polish remover on time and finely packaged.  I would order from them again.</li>
    <li> Needed this to remove my gel nails at home. I have found this is amazing to remove glitter polish as well! Typically glitter polish takes forever to take off, but the pure acetone makes it a breeze. Sure it is a bit drying, but that&#x27;s what nail and cuticle oils are for... also, the time savings is worth a bit of drying IMHO.</li>
    <li> Acetone is by far more powerful than traditional nail-polish remover, so it takes glitter polish (specifically why I purchased this) off very easily.  I felt like this left my nails with a film on them and the smell is very strong.  I don&#x27;t use it as a replacement for the standard 1-2$ nail-polish remover, but when I do have some stubborn polish/detail/glitter, I bust this out.</li>
    <li> Pretty good!! Uses less so lasts longer! :D really happy with it :)</li>
    <li> Very helpful with getting the acrylic off the brushes and my nails.</li>

    <li> I like it! I don&#x27;t order it online because I found it cheaper in stores by my house. But its good and strong and takes the polish off quickly.</li>
    <li> This product really does the trick when removing gel uv nail polish.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s acetone.  It took off my gel nail polish, which is why I bought it.  It will do other things that acetone does.</li>
