      <li>But the brushes are excellent!</li>
      <li>An excellent brush.</li>
      <li>It feels great and tames the beard</li>
      <li>Works great on distributing the beard oil.</li>
      <li>Great brush.</li>
      <li>Great product...</li>
      <li>Works great with balm.</li>
      <li>Great brush, feels good and does the job.</li>
      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>Great brush that helps spread beard oils without causing static</li>
      <li>Nice brush for a nice price.</li>
      <li>Nice that it comes with a bag.</li>
      <li>My husband liked it :)</li>
      <li>Well-made, comfortable in a size XXL hand, and even the included cotton bag is handy for the one I keep in my travel Dopp Kit.</li>
      <li>This brush feels great and seems to be very well constructed.</li>
      <li>The finish could had been better on the bamboo and the  brush hair straighter, but that just being petty over an 8 dollar brush.</li>
      <li>Better for longer beards.</li>
      <li>The brush has not continued to shed any more than my girl&#x27;s over $100 boar bristle hairbrush sheds.</li>
      <li>So overall I have been very happy.</li>
      <li>Fits in the palm of your hand for easy beard grooming.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a good feel and a high level of quality on the brush and bristles.</li>
      <li>Comfortable in the hand and on the face.</li>
      <li>Great product and quality, definitely helps the control of the hair and straightens out the curl.</li>
      <li>manufacturing process doesn&#x27;t include a good scrubbing of the brush before packaging, therefore there are lots of cut bristles hanging on and perhaps some that just didn&#x27;t make it solidly enough into the holes that hold the group&#x27;s of bristles.  </li>
      <li>In addition it is very compact and easily fits into your pocket if need be.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy, but relatively light weight.</li>
      <li>The beard brush was priced right</li>
      <li>For the price its a very high quality brush!</li>
      <li>Overall, it is ok for the price.</li>
      <li>Bag could be higher quality though</li>
      <li>Very please with product</li>
      <li>Came in a cute little bag.</li>
      <li>I believe there are a few brands with the same set up (bag, bamboo, and real boar hair), but for more money.</li>
      <li>So it is not really small.</li>
      <li>Cute little bag... will try it on our next trip.</li>
      <li>Then gently wash it and it&#x27;s ready to use now either wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This brush came and so far it had tamed my beard and made it softer.</li>
      <li>Def soft boar bristle.</li>
      <li>He likes both brushes, but thinks the soft rectangle shaped beard brush should have the same comfortable round palm shape as the stiffer brush.&lt;br</li>
      <li>To avoid getting the loose bristles in your hair, beard, or all over the counter, just wipe your hand across the brush (over a garbage can saves you clean up later), until there are no more bristles coming out.  </li>

<li> The only negative is the logo is printed on and has faded away.</li>
<li> /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I bought the round palm size stiffer brush for my husband&#x27;s hair.  </li>
<li> examined the brush closely and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have hardly any broken bristles, so I think my assessment that the bristles were loose from manufacturing is correct, versus them being broken off or sub standard quality.</li>
<li> Almost didn&#x27;t buy them because of the term &amp;#34;Hipster&amp;#34; (Hipster Market) and the negative image that conjures.</li>

    <li> It is palm sized like a hair brush. So it is not really small. I believe there are a few brands with the same set up (bag, bamboo, and real boar hair), but for more money. The finish could had been better on the bamboo and the  brush hair straighter, but that just being petty over an 8 dollar brush.</li>
    <li> Almost didn&#x27;t buy them because of the term &amp;#34;Hipster&amp;#34; (Hipster Market) and the negative image that conjures. But the brushes are excellent! Well-made, comfortable in a size XXL hand, and even the included cotton bag is handy for the one I keep in my travel Dopp Kit.</li>
    <li> An excellent brush. Very sturdy, but relatively light weight. Comfortable in the hand and on the face. Cute little bag... will try it on our next trip.</li>
    <li> Edit, Feb 2016: husband likes so well we bought another as a gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I bought the round palm size stiffer brush for my husband&#x27;s hair.  I also bought the soft brush as he complained the stiffer brush was too harsh for his face/beard.  He likes both brushes, but thinks the soft rectangle shaped beard brush should have the same comfortable round palm shape as the stiffer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturing process doesn&#x27;t include a good scrubbing of the brush before packaging, therefore there are lots of cut bristles hanging on and perhaps some that just didn&#x27;t make it solidly enough into the holes that hold the group&#x27;s of bristles.

    <li> I just started growing out my beard and decided to purchase a brush to help take my &amp;#34;scruff&amp;#34;. This brush came and so far it had tamed my beard and made it softer. So overall I have been very happy. In addition it is very compact and easily fits into your pocket if need be.</li>
    <li> The beard brush was priced right so I bought it. It&#x27;s got a good feel and a high level of quality on the brush and bristles. It feels great and tames the beard so I&#x27;m not walking around looking like an arctic fisherman. The only negative is the logo is printed on and has faded away.</li>
    <li> Came in a cute little bag. Brush seemed to look  well made, but it wasn&#x27;t. As soon as my husband began to use the brush, the bristles were falling off. Something that is well made should not have those minor imperfections. Overall, it is ok for the price. You pay for what you get. My husband liked it :)</li>
    <li> Great product and quality, definitely helps the control of the hair and straightens out the curl. Would defiantly recommend to others. Works great on distributing the beard oil.</li>
    <li> I realized i paid all of that for just a basic brush yayyyy</li>
    <li> Great brush that helps spread beard oils without causing static</li>
    <li> Great brush. Works great with balm.</li>
    <li> Great product... Bag could be higher quality though</li>
    <li> For the price its a very high quality brush! (minus the logo which rubbed off within a week)</li>
    <li> Def soft boar bristle. Good quality. Nice that it comes with a bag. Better for longer beards.</li>
    <li> Great brush, feels good and does the job.</li>
    <li> This brush has ben a godsend. I use it for my beard and my hair. It works wonders, I finally don&#x27;tworry about how my hair looks anymore</li>
    <li> Nice brush for a nice price. Fits in the palm of your hand for easy beard grooming.</li>
    <li> Very please with product</li>
    <li> This brush feels great and seems to be very well constructed.</li>
