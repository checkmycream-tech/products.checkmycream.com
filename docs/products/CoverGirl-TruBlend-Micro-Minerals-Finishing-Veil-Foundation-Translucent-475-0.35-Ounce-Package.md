    <li> Flawless look. I love this, it works just like the bare minerals product, but for a lot cheaper of a price.</li>
    <li> Love it as a finishing powder</li>
    <li> This is a great powder for those with fair skin.  I have an exceedingly difficult time finding powders that match my light skin tone, and this powder gives me a matte finish without any makeup lines.  I normally just wear powder because my skin is so fair and everything turns orange on me, but this powder is even light enough to go well over foundation.  It feels weightless and lasts well.  The brush that comes with the powder isn&#x27;t wonderful, so I use a separate one instead.  The powder is easily dispensed, which can be an issue with other loose powders that have smaller holes in the top.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I was looking for a replacement for a more expensive finishing powder. This one works even better at a fraction of the price. I gave it 5 stars because it does the job beautifully. However, it is a bit messy. But if you know how to apply it correctly or look it up if you don&#x27;t then it is not a problem. The item also arrived before schedule. Overall, it was a great buy and nice transaction.</li>
    <li> Before buying this product I read all the reviews written here. I decided to try it out. I really like the finishing touch of this product on my face although I am really disappointed with the mess that it leaves whenever I apply it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying more CG trublend minerals any time soon.</li>
    <li> I like the shade! it leaves a smooth finish! and you don&#x27;t need a lot to put on, just little dabs here and there, then use the brush to spread it. What I like about this is the amount of actual powder you get. The brush is a very good size, not too small at all. You get a good amount of powder to work with that will you last you for a while, compared to Loreal&#x27;s powder foundation where the brush is bigger than the container of powder itself. You should definitely try this!</li>
    <li> was very good, came quickly and is a great product, yeah not much else to say was a good buy,</li>
    <li> The powder works very well with the Loreal mineral foundation. It helps seal it for a flawless look. However, the coverage ( even when combining products) is minimal. The skin looks smooth, but all dark spots are very visible. However, I love the look and feel of it. Completely weightless.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mineral finishing powder with a bronzer and a foundation. Unfortunately, my foundation was not delivered with this order... the bronzer made me look like a tangerine the first time i applied it. I decided to take it off and the remix with the finishing powder. worked a lot better than i thought it would.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping recommend and good product</li>
    <li> I wish that it would keep my face from being shiny all day, but after a couple of hours, the &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish wears off.</li>
    <li> There is no way to dispense it without getting it all over the place.  I ended up putting it my empty Bare Minerals, Mineral Veil container that I was trying to replace at a cheaper price.  I did like it after I applied it, the 2 star rating is just based on the mess.</li>
    <li> This product is a nice finishing veil to use over other foundations. Don&#x27;t much care for the flimsy included application brush though.</li>
    <li> Messy, but gives me a pretty sheen on my face....I don&#x27;t mind the messiness.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cheap enough that if I didn&#x27;t like it I wouldn&#x27;t be at a huge loss. I ended up loving it, it controls the shine on my face better then the more expensive veils I&#x27;ve tried. My nose gets super oily and this controlled it. Love it</li>
    <li> this product is interesting and good product. good factory. this product help for complete anything. is important have this product</li>
    <li> i really thought this powder would set my makeup up but instead it made my face look pretty cakey and i didn&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> Great coverage with a light feel; this makes any foundation feel like silk! There&#x27;s a lot of powder and you don&#x27;t need much so be careful when you get ready to put it on.</li>
    <li> This is not the softest mineral veil I&#x27;ve ever used.  I do like the brush but don&#x27;t like the awkward packaging.  It&#x27;s hard to get the powder onto the brush evently and I want to apply and go, not apply, clean and go.  But the price was unbeatable and it does give a nice finish once on.</li>
    <li> looks awesome! i think this is a must have for everyones makeup arsenal.  i can&#x27;t even find this in my local stores which is why i ordered it online</li>
    <li> kind of messy, doesn&#x27;t work great, too much effort for the effect.  wouldn&#x27;t get again.  better to use just a regular powder with pad.</li>
    <li> The one from the store has sparkles in it this did not&#x3D;but still use it&#x3D;good finishing product!!! Good value price,also.</li>
