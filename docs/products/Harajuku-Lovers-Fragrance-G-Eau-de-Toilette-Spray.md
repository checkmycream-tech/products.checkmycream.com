      <li>It is such a perfect summer scent!!!</li>
      <li>:)  </li>

      <li>Love this perfume.  </li>
      <li>MY FAVORITE perfume.</li>

      <li>Look on line you can get a way better deal</li>
      <li>All I can say is I Love It.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the shipping and packaging.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite fragrance to date.</li>
      <li>Love this perfume.</li>

      <li>I love the hint of coconut in \\&quot;G.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will b back for more soon!!!</li>
      <li>Although I originally purchased the gift pack for the \\&quot;G\\&quot; perfume, I found the \\&quot;Love\\&quot; perfume to also smell nice.  </li>
      <li>Its fun, flirty and refreshing for all ages!</li>
      <li>If you love coconut scent you&#x27;ll enjoy this.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find this in the 1 ounce size I love the smell of G</li>
      <li>The parfum is fine and the bottle is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Concerning the perfume it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m overall very pleased with my order, wearing it right now! :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite smell after Ralph Lauren Hot.</li>
      <li>And the packaging is FUN!</li>
      <li>I smell like a warm summer day surrounded by newly sliced coconuts.</li>
      <li>fragrance is light and great for summer (but I love it year round!).</li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it smelled on her.  </li>
      <li>i havent opened the bottle and used it yet because i want to use it wisely since its only 1oz</li>
      <li>Another good thing is that you don&#x27;t need alot of this perfume to actually smell it.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it of you love the scent of coconut/tropical scents.</li>
      <li>Overall this scent is mild but sweet--- a super fun choice for the summer!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to feel like they r on vacation!!!</li>
      <li>Smart marketing ploy!</li>
      <li>I love this perfume and so does my significant other.</li>
      <li>Most likely not for coconut haters.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t recall what color those were when I first purchased them.</li>
      <li>While it smells miles better than most body-sprays, it doesn&#x27;t last much longer, and it comes in a TINY bottle.</li>
      <li>My order came quickly and the box was brand new.</li>
      <li>One or two sprays and your set, which is good because the perfume bottle size is quite small.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find a good beach coconut scent that isn&#x27;t too cheapy smelling.</li>
      <li>I was very disapointed that for $40 retail</li>
      <li>I paid way to much for it considering you can by it now for 9,99.</li>
      <li>and they where really helpful with the return</li>
      <li>So thanks so much.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I was debating if i should order the tester bottle from a different seller or the 1oz bottle directly from amazon because i didnt want to order the tester bottle without knowing if it was counterfeit or not so i just decided to do it the safe way and buy the 1oz bottle instead, because knowing that the seller is amazon itself</li>
      <li>Still highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this perfume, which is wierd for me, as I&#x27;ve never really found a scent I&#x27;d be willing to shell out the cash for other than shampoos and detergents.</li>
      <li>It can be hard to find because they keep releasing seasonal variations in cute new bottles.  </li>
      <li>This scent has been discontinued in department stores (as far as I can tell).</li>
      <li>I pretty much found it for half of the price that I was quoted in stores</li>
      <li>I was having such a difficult time finding this fragrance in stores for a reasonable price because it is so popular</li>
      <li>Gwens body on the perfume bottle comes off so the perfume is only what you see at the bottom ( the clear glass part ).</li>
      <li>Another con is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long, maybe about five hours depending on how much you put on.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast &amp; carefully!</li>
      <li>And with such a small bottle, you run out quickly.  </li>
      <li>Overall i think its definitely worth the 24 dollars plus shipping because its been hard to find in stores</li>

<li> One of my faves but does not last long.</li>
<li> i ordered it late night on saturday and received it tuesday evening, which i think is really fast delivery because i was expecting it to come later in the week.</li>

<li> Only thing is, the color looks different than the other bottles I have.</li>
<li> the $45 dollar price I paid, the amount of actual perfume in the bottle is very, very little.  </li>
<li> typically like coconut, citrus and vanilla type fragrances.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This smell is so enchanting. The coconut smell is enticing. Love it! One of my faves but does not last long. But then again it is EDT. Still highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought Harajuku Lovers EDT spray in G because my friend bought it and it smelled amazing. I received the product in the allotted amount of time and loved it! I was amazed that I got the 1oz. bottle for such a low price (It was cheaper than my friend paid for a smaller amount at a department store). I&#x27;m overall very pleased with my order, wearing it right now! :)</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Smells amazing!  :)  Most likely not for coconut haters. Another good thing is that you don&#x27;t need alot of this perfume to actually smell it. One or two sprays and your set, which is good because the perfume bottle size is quite small. Gwens body on the perfume bottle comes off so the perfume is only what you see at the bottom ( the clear glass part ).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume, which is wierd for me, as I&#x27;ve never really found a scent I&#x27;d be willing to shell out the cash for other than shampoos and detergents. I used to work at CVS, where we got a ton of perfume sampler bottles for customers, and every day I&#x27;d run over to the beauty department and spritz with this stuff.     I only have two problems with the product; the largest size it comes in is 1 oz., and after seeing the sample bottle (a hefty 4 oz) I was very disapointed that for $40 retail I could only purchase something I&#x27;d be finished with in a month.  Another con is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long, maybe about five hours depending on how much you put on. This also makes the size of the bottle quite frustrating. While it smells miles better than most body-sprays, it doesn&#x27;t last much longer, and it comes in a TINY bottle.</li>
    <li> I always find it hard to get this perfume in NZ. So thanks so much. I love the vanilla/coconut smell. The smell of the beach and summer x</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it smelled on her.  I even used it on myself a few times.</li>
    <li> Rumor had it (according to Nordstroms) that American stores would no longer being caring the Harajuku line which prompted me to look online. My order came quickly and the box was brand new. Overall this scent is mild but sweet--- a super fun choice for the summer! Can&#x27;t imagine a better way to spend 20 bucks!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend just loves this stuff! Purchased at her request, process went very smoothly, and I got a good deal on the product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this scent!! Its fun, flirty and refreshing for all ages! I get many compliments when I wear it!</li>
    <li> recieved item a described .only thing they ship it out with name of compay printed real big all over the box/even though i checked item is a gift.needless to say that suprise was blown.</li>
    <li> I just love this scent. It&#x27;s so hard to find a good beach coconut scent that isn&#x27;t too cheapy smelling. I am so sad it is discontinued. Only thing is, the color looks different than the other bottles I have. Could mean the older bottles are just old. I can&#x27;t recall what color those were when I first purchased them.</li>
    <li> Great transaction. I love it! Exactly what I wanted...cute packaging and great smelling perfume. Would definitely buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE perfume. I was debating if i should order the tester bottle from a different seller or the 1oz bottle directly from amazon because i didnt want to order the tester bottle without knowing if it was counterfeit or not so i just decided to do it the safe way and buy the 1oz bottle instead, because knowing that the seller is amazon itself is reassuring that the perfume is legit. i havent opened the bottle and used it yet because i want to use it wisely since its only 1oz but i believe the perfume is the way its supposed to be. i ordered it late night on saturday and received it tuesday evening, which i think is really fast delivery because i was expecting it to come later in the week. Overall i think its definitely worth the 24 dollars plus shipping because its been hard to find in stores AND if u DO find it in stores its actually 45 dollars. would def recommend others to order it from amazon instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume because it smelled close to a pina colada when I sampled it in a shop.  However, the one I received does not smell the same. I don&#x27;t even use it.</li>
    <li> I was having such a difficult time finding this fragrance in stores for a reasonable price because it is so popular so I decided to check for it online. I pretty much found it for half of the price that I was quoted in stores and I was obviously ecstatic! The projected arrival dates were 2 weeks from when I ordered it, but I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived a few days later. The perfume was packaged well and I have no complaints! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume in a gift pack which also included the Harajuku Girl&#x27;s \\&quot;Love\\&quot; perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;-  both perfumes smelled great.  Although I originally purchased the gift pack for the \\&quot;G\\&quot; perfume, I found the \\&quot;Love\\&quot; perfume to also smell nice.  I love the hint of coconut in \\&quot;G.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;-  the bottles are way cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;-For the $45 dollar price I paid, the amount of actual perfume in the bottle is very, very little.  After 2 months the perfume was gone.&lt;br /&gt;-The smell doesn&#x27;t last.  After an hour of spraying it, you can&#x27;t smell it again.  Which means you have to spray more.  And with such a small bottle, you run out quickly.  Smart marketing ploy!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  It can be hard to find because they keep releasing seasonal variations in cute new bottles.  The original G scent is the best though and worth going out of your way to find.</li>
    <li> The parfum is fine and the bottle is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;But I paid way to much for it considering you can by it now for 9,99.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and so does my significant other. I feel it lasts all day and is the best fragrance anytime...day or night, summer or winter. It smells like the beach and so fruity and lovely...but not teenager like or for kids. Its smells delicious !!!</li>
    <li> My favorite scent ever and they don&#x27;t make it anymore. I&#x27;ve not found anything even close to this wonderful tropical, coconutty scent.</li>
    <li> The product arrived well packaged and on time.  I received a nice note from the seller as well.  I wish all packages arrived this way!  The product is as promised; however (and this has nothing to do with the seller)  The bottle is more plastic doll than perfume.....what is there smells lovely.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so amazing. It&#x27;s a cross between gardenias, coconut, and a hint of musk. It&#x27;s my favorite smell after Ralph Lauren Hot. If you love coconut scent you&#x27;ll enjoy this.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for. It made my daughter&#x27;s Christmas. I would definitely buy this again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this  fragrance!! Smells like coconut. I think this is the best one of all the different harajuku scents.</li>
    <li> Very nice item.  Arrived in very good condition.  will be an excellent adition to the collection of these dolls that we have.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance to date. I was pleased with the shipping and packaging. I would recomend it to everyone, however fragrances are a personal thing. All I can say is I Love It. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!!! It is such a perfect summer scent!!! I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to feel like they r on vacation!!! I will b back for more soon!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this in the 1 ounce size I love the smell of G and I could wait to have more! but when I open the box they had sent me Gwen stefani Harajuku lovers \\&quot;love\\&quot; in the .33 ounce size so I called amazon and they where really helpful with the return and then they told me that they no longer had this :(</li>
    <li> This scent has been discontinued in department stores (as far as I can tell). I am so sad to see it go and I wish I had the extra money to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically like coconut, citrus and vanilla type fragrances. This is not a scent I would describe as floral or romantic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is light and great for summer (but I love it year round!). It may be described by others as wearing off but it is difficult to tell because you typically get used to your own scent.</li>
    <li> I smell like a warm summer day surrounded by newly sliced coconuts. Love her and her products. And the packaging is FUN!</li>
    <li> Wish this product was still on the market, as I absolutely loved this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Look on line you can get a way better deal then what they&#x27;re offering. I&#x27;ve seen this same perfume for cheaper like $23.00. Concerning the perfume it&#x27;s fantastic. It&#x27;s a great summer scent. Would highly recommend it of you love the scent of coconut/tropical scents.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to get this in the stores but, now you can&#x27;t find it any where so I was so happy to find it here! It has a wonderful smell of coconuts! I get so many complements when I wear it! Shipped fast &amp; carefully!</li>
