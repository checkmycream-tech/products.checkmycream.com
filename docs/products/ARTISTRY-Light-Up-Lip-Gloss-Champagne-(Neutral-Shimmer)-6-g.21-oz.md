      <li>For a lighter skin tone - like my own-</li>
      <li>I wanted a gloss that could stand on its own.  </li>
      <li>This is, by far, the best lip gloss I have ever used.  </li>

      <li>I love the look of lip gloss</li>
      <li>love the light and mirror.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy and smooth to apply.</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice that the mirror had something over it!!  </li>
      <li>I love how I can use it at night thanks to the light and mirror.</li>
      <li>I would still move to a lighted place with a full sized mirror.  </li>
      <li>It has a great zing of mint to it, which makes your lips feel pampered, and it leaves my lips feeling conditioned, rather than dried out.  </li>
      <li>Personally, when I apply it, it is done in the bathroom, which is lighted and has it own mirror.  </li>
      <li>This color, champagne, looks great with my pale skin.  </li>

      <li>If anyone would like to purchase this the right way and for the real price which is much lower</li>
      <li>As the  gloss is so washed out, you really don&#x27;t need to see where you are putting the applicator-</li>
      <li>light up lip gloss is different.  </li>
      <li>This might be adequate for someone with a different complexion-</li>
      <li>This lip gloss is highly convenient to have.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not thick or sticky either.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more in the near future.</li>
      <li>Nothing is less appealing then having your lips gloss end up on your teeth, outside of your lips, along with constantly leaving to reapply to avoid the fading look.&lt;br /&gt;Artistry</li>
      <li>Despite these little gimmicks that probably drive the price up, it is still worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> I can wear this lip gloss for about three to four hours without having to reapply, as long as I don&#x27;t eat or drink a lot.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do not understand is why Artistry puts so much advertising into the fact they have two or four LEDs in the cap of the gloss and a little mirror on the side of the bottle.  </li>

<li> The light/mirror is a waste of time for me.</li>
<li> It voids the guarantee, plus unethical to all Amway distributors who work hard with one-one sales</li>
<li> I was completely disappointed.</li>

    <li> Love this lip gloss! It has a soothing minty feeling when you put it on! It&#x27;s not thick or sticky either.</li>
    <li> This gloss is perfect!  It makes your lips feel refreshed and moisturized!</li>
    <li> I love that everyone loves this product but it actually is prohibited to sell their products online other than their website. If anyone would like to purchase this the right way and for the real price which is much lower let me know!&lt;br /&gt;mrs.miller.gaines@gmail.com</li>
    <li> It came quick and I love it !!! Ordering another one ♡</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t notice that the mirror had something over it!!  After taking it off I realized that the mirror is great!!!  Love it</li>
    <li> The product picture had me thinking this gloss had some amount of tint or color- even though it is described as &amp;#34;champagne, neutral&amp;#34;.  It is exactly that- champagne. For a lighter skin tone - like my own- it washes my lips out entirely.  It would need to be applied over lipstick to make it work for me.  I am not interested in a two-step process.  I wanted a gloss that could stand on its own.  This might be adequate for someone with a different complexion- I don&#x27;t know.  It has an odd minty taste.  Not Vicks, exactly- but it reminds of that.  The light/mirror is a waste of time for me. As the  gloss is so washed out, you really don&#x27;t need to see where you are putting the applicator- and unless you are sitting in a dark room (or a dark car), the light is unnecessary.  The little mirror along the side could be good for checking your teeth after a meal, I guess?  All in all- I was completely disappointed.</li>
    <li> This lipgloss is amazing</li>
    <li> This lip gloss is highly convenient to have. It&#x27;s so easy and smooth to apply. I love how I can use it at night thanks to the light and mirror. I will definitely be buying more in the near future. I always have my friends amazed with its features. I love it.</li>
    <li> love the light and mirror.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best lip gloss I have ever used.  In my lifetime, I have used tons of different lip glosses.  I love the look of lip gloss, its sexier, lighter, and  a glamorous look to it when compared to lipstick.  The reason why I never could stick with a lip gloss for long was the constant need to reapply along with how runny it is.  Nothing is less appealing then having your lips gloss end up on your teeth, outside of your lips, along with constantly leaving to reapply to avoid the fading look.&lt;br /&gt;Artistry light up lip gloss is different.  It is thick enough that it does not run.  It stays where you put it, just as well as a good quality lipstick.  This color, champagne, looks great with my pale skin.  It has a great zing of mint to it, which makes your lips feel pampered, and it leaves my lips feeling conditioned, rather than dried out.  I can wear this lip gloss for about three to four hours without having to reapply, as long as I don&#x27;t eat or drink a lot.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do not understand is why Artistry puts so much advertising into the fact they have two or four LEDs in the cap of the gloss and a little mirror on the side of the bottle.  Personally, when I apply it, it is done in the bathroom, which is lighted and has it own mirror.  But, I suppose, if you apply your lip gloss where there is no mirror and no light, it might be helpful.  I would still move to a lighted place with a full sized mirror.  Despite these little gimmicks that probably drive the price up, it is still worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I was given my Artistry lip gloss by a friend as a present.  The price is a little high--but it is worth it if you want a truly superior product.</li>
    <li> Could not see thru the mirror at all will not buy it again</li>
    <li> Amway products are exclusively sold from amway website and are backed by 180 days money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;It is not supposed to be sold on anyother portal. It voids the guarantee, plus unethical to all Amway distributors who work hard with one-one sales</li>
    <li> Love this lipgloss. It&#x27;s a staple to keep in your purse.</li>
