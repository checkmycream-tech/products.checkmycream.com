      <li>I just re-discovered the joy of waxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does great job, and I will never use salon for waxing again.  </li>
      <li>But their wax is good</li>
      <li>Customer service is good though.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fairly tall</li>
      <li>The wax is good and sticky, however using lotion or oil of sort is advices before applying wax.</li>

      <li>I dont know as for many, however for me this product works well!</li>
      <li>I love this waxer!</li>
      <li>With this plug-in waxer, I can wax my own legs in the time it would have taken me to just get to the spa.</li>
      <li>But it would be nice if they made a cartridge</li>
      <li>I had to use my own wax t remove it, and it was still sticky after I removed it.</li>
      <li>You need to warm it for longer</li>
      <li>Eventhough they say it&#x27;s warm</li>
      <li>I like this waxer because once it&#x27;s warm up I don&#x27;t have to touch the cartridge.</li>
      <li>shorter and warm wax gets inside of warmer a lot - this is inconvenience.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s very easy to take off using even the cheapest paperlike strips rather than muslin.  </li>
      <li>The wax which was given free not at all good</li>
      <li>it works wonderfully, but I suspect it is no different than baby oil.</li>
      <li>If somebody had already found a better roller, please advise.</li>
      <li>But I have many rollers to use up.</li>
      <li>The wax itself feels more like a glue then a wax.</li>
      <li>If you have a favorite brand of wax, this set up doesn&#x27;t let you use it.</li>
      <li>I came from Brazil and we have much better roll-on waxer systems there, but since I could not find here in USA the refil, I decided to buy this one.</li>
      <li>It works ok.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the wax product but the heaters are too cheap and inconsistent to do the job of melting and heating the wax.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t afford to get a full body wax, and this is the next best</li>
      <li>That should give you a good idea of how much you will need.</li>
      <li>Maybe if they used the original wax that get washed with water it would have been better.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s fairly economic and easy to use if you can stand the pain of tearing your own hair :)</li>
      <li>I loved the wax and how easy it was to warm it, but the roller head left something to be desired.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and you dnt have to worry about the heat</li>
      <li>I have a strong hair line.</li>
      <li>Generally, the waxer, roll head and wax product are great</li>
      <li>It is very easy to just pick up the waxer and repace because of the stand fitting it very well</li>
      <li>I love how easy, clean and efficient it is to wax with Clean &amp; Easy.</li>
      <li>I waited about an hour for the wax to heat up and tested it on a piece of paper-it rolled out fine.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and hassle free.</li>
      <li>The best way to get wax off is just by using a little baby oil.</li>
      <li>Product is good, has been working fine so far.</li>

      <li>I love that after it has heated it is super quick and easy to deal with.</li>
      <li>You can clean the applicator head by applying some baby oil or the clean and easy wax removing oil on one of the wax cloths.</li>
      <li>If I had known how quickly and easily I could wax my legs at home</li>
      <li>I found that even with shorter hair (I couldn&#x27;t wait for my hair to get longer because I was so excited to try it)</li>
      <li>I am still using the original applicator head I received when I purchased this over a year ago.</li>
      <li>The Clean and Easy brand tends to be a good brand for me overall anyways.</li>
      <li>Now I can save my spa visits for more fun stuff like facials ((((smile)))</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheaper here because you can get it paired with the Free Super Saver discount shipping option.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to see that they were described accurately for how much they will cover.  </li>
      <li>Maybe there is a special wax remover product that I should be using this with?</li>
      <li>The amount of time it takes to heat depends on how full the wax bottle is.  </li>
      <li>I used up one full cartridge on one lower leg.</li>
      <li>have read some of the reviews and it is true what they say about the limitations.</li>
      <li>I like to pour my 3/4 bottle into one another to make another full bottle (if you have the patience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>The money I save by doing my waxing at home instead of the salon is worth it.  </li>
      <li>The wax has always been the right consistency for me.</li>
      <li>When heated correctly it glides right on, and leaves no residue.</li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t a bunch of sticks to clean up or areas with too much wax etc</li>
      <li>I liked that it holds the \\&quot;large\\&quot; refills as the large size (as opposed to \\&quot;personal\\&quot; size) is the only size that I can buy in my area beauty stores.  </li>
      <li>Once I fixed the issue, I was able to wax without much pain-after I got used to it.</li>

      <li>I realized waxing is so much better than epilating, no in-grown hair, no bumps; also the hair growth is delayed and thinner than the earlier one.</li>
      <li>Use hot water to loosen the wax if you have to.</li>
      <li>I love it, no spending money outside...</li>
      <li>it really hot to the touch.</li>
      <li>Most importantly it removes the dead skin layer, leaving a soft and smooth skin after waxing.</li>
      <li>just as a general waxing tip: exfoliate before waxing and use baby powder lightly on your skin before applying the wax.</li>
      <li>The kit works ok even though has a long way to go to get close to the brazilian way!</li>
      <li>it takes 20-30 minutes for the wax to get hot enough to roll out onto your skin smoothly.  </li>
      <li>All the necessary refills are easy to find and buy and non-expensive.</li>
      <li>The wax is very sticky like duck tape, and when you try to wash it it will not come off with water.</li>

      <li>I think you can actually get 3 6-packs for the cost of a 12 pack AND get free shipping.</li>
      <li>The heater is good, but it doesn&#x27;t heat the wax enough, so I had to put 30 sec at microwaves.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;meets all expectations, is the product you use and expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you to all my friends to buy</li>
    <li> We tried this product and it was very bad, Hard to GET OFF. Sticky.  [[ASIN:B000VMFA0M Clean + Easy Personal Roll-On Waxer 120V]]  [[ASIN:B0007LU1RY Clean &amp; Easy Portable Rechargeable Roll-on Waxer]]</li>
    <li> The wax sent in this kit was horrible . It was so sticky that i took hrs for me to get rid of it.if the seller change the wax quality included in this kit then it would be gr8 .&lt;br /&gt;the rollon was convienient so planning to use other local wax in it.</li>
    <li> I would never write a review on anything but I am so disappointed of this, I have to. This wax is the worst thing that ever touched my hands. It is impossible to take off from your skin. In order to remove it, you will create redness on your skin. If you want that, go ahead and buy this trash. Please do not spend your money on that. Better use some other product or an epilator. If somebody had already found a better roller, please advise.</li>
    <li> I love it, no spending money outside...it&#x27;s easy to use and you dnt have to worry about the heat intensity.&lt;br /&gt;buying clean and easy  the wax remover liquid will probably make it work for people who find the wax too sticky. (I read some 1 star reviewers telling that&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0007LU1RY Clean &amp; Easy Portable Rechargeable Roll-on Waxer]])</li>
    <li> DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY CACHE BEAUTY!!  YOU BUY  SOMETHING AND DONT LIKE IT, WELL TOO BAD BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT  TAKE IT BACK AND REFUND YOU!!   IF YOU USED IT ITS YOURS..    HORRIBLE SERVICE!!</li>
    <li> I loved the wax and how easy it was to warm it, but the roller head left something to be desired. I was able to get the wax to roll on, but it was a little uneven and the roller head would tilt to one side or the other causing the wax to come out more on one corner than the other. It was still workable though.</li>
    <li> The heater is good, but it doesn&#x27;t heat the wax enough, so I had to put 30 sec at microwaves.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd waxing system I have had now and do enjoy this one the most.  It is very easy to just pick up the waxer and repace because of the stand fitting it very well and it continue to heat.  It is very efficient and really like it.  I do recommend this system to anyone looking for a home waxing system.  The Clean and Easy brand tends to be a good brand for me overall anyways.</li>
    <li> I like the portable part but it takes ridiculously long for the wax to heat up and it cools down pretty fast too. Dont buy this if you dont want to waste hours when you could get the sae job done in 15 minutes with another product. Definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S A LIL TOo MESSY to use AND got i got burn .</li>
    <li> It takes a little longer than my last one to heat up but once it does it really is awesome. I love that after it has heated it is super quick and easy to deal with. There aren&#x27;t a bunch of sticks to clean up or areas with too much wax etc</li>
    <li> I came from Brazil and we have much better roll-on waxer systems there, but since I could not find here in USA the refil, I decided to buy this one. It works ok. The strips are not very good. I will try to buy another brand next time.</li>
    <li> I took this roll on waxer and I like it,but only I don&#x27;t like the paper ,like no woirk for nothing.So I going to other shop and bouth other brand of paper.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful tool. All the necessary refills are easy to find and buy and non-expensive. Just wish it heated a little hotter.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like at all. The wax is very sticky like duck tape, and when you try to wash it it will not come off with water. I had to use my own wax t remove it, and it was still sticky after I removed it. I used extra virgin olive oil to clean the rest. Maybe if they used the original wax that get washed with water it would have been better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a month and a half now and I&#x27;ve only gone through not quite two of the wax cassettes.  I&#x27;m glad to see that they were described accurately for how much they will cover.  I wax my entire legs (and I&#x27;m tall) as well as my armpits.  It does leave a lovely thin film of wax that&#x27;s very easy to take off using even the cheapest paperlike strips rather than muslin.  If you&#x27;re looking to save tons by waxing at home this product is for you.  It gets four stars because it does take about an hour to heat up properly but by the time I walk my dogs in the morning it&#x27;s ready to go.  The wax is sticky but what wax isn&#x27;t?  I use a little baby oil on a cotton ball afterward to remove any residue from my legs and the wax picks up 95 percent of the hair.  I like this product and definitely will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this waxer for about 8 years now.   Generally, the waxer, roll head and wax product are great get the job done well and efficiently.  Only word of warning is this- it takes 20-30 minutes for the wax to get hot enough to roll out onto your skin smoothly.  The amount of time it takes to heat depends on how full the wax bottle is.  You also have to be careful about not over heating the wax, not because it will get too hot to use but because you&#x27;ll damage the roller unit.  Having said that I&#x27;m onto my 3rd device in 8 years which is not bad.  The money I save by doing my waxing at home instead of the salon is worth it.  In my neighborhood 1 leg&#x27;s worth of waxing costs more then the entire device!</li>
    <li> I have been using the clean+easy Personal Roll-On Waxer, so I realise I don&#x27;t use the small roll on from the kit. I like this waxer because once it&#x27;s warm up I don&#x27;t have to touch the cartridge. Eventhough they say it&#x27;s warm it really hot to the touch. Plus the refill cartridge is 2.8oz thats larger then from the kit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this waxer for a couple of years on my underarms, and I still have a little bit of wax left and I haven&#x27;t used all the strips yet, so it&#x27;s fairly economic and easy to use if you can stand the pain of tearing your own hair :)</li>
    <li> I love how easy, clean and efficient it is to wax with Clean &amp; Easy. I wish I had found this product earlier. I realized waxing is so much better than epilating, no in-grown hair, no bumps; also the hair growth is delayed and thinner than the earlier one. Most importantly it removes the dead skin layer, leaving a soft and smooth skin after waxing. I just re-discovered the joy of waxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish that all the wax in the bottle could be used, there is leftover wax which I cannot put to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that useful. It&#x27;s waste of money to buy it. The wax which was given free not at all good it took 4 hrs to take of the wax on my leg. I thought it won&#x27;t go forever. I wanted sue this product.</li>
    <li> It took hours to heat the wax. After 4 hours thee wax was not hot. It&#x27;s not worth the price or time.&lt;br /&gt;Returned the time</li>
    <li> Product is good, has been working fine so far. Easy to use and hassle free. Though need to be careful with roller head.. need to clean it well before second use else wax sticks to the roller head making it difficult to roll.</li>
    <li> The product was shipped promptly- I ordered it on Sunday evening and it shipped out around 2 am. I got it on Wednesday. I was so excited to try it because I&#x27;ve wanted to wax my legs for a long time after years of shaving, but I&#x27;ve never had the money to go to a salon. So I finally waxed today. A couple of things happened. I waited about an hour for the wax to heat up and tested it on a piece of paper-it rolled out fine. I started on my leg, forgetting that I needed to clean it and put baby powder on it first. Once I fixed the issue, I was able to wax without much pain-after I got used to it. I found that even with shorter hair (I couldn&#x27;t wait for my hair to get longer because I was so excited to try it) the wax still picked some up. It didn&#x27;t remove ALL of it, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to because my hair wasn&#x27;t as long as it should have been for it to work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I wish they made the product bigger so the cartridges could be bigger. I used up one full cartridge on one lower leg. I&#x27;m fairly tall so I wasn&#x27;t surprised, not to mention it was the first time I was waxing, so I didn&#x27;t expect to be proficient and economical about product use. But it would be nice if they made a cartridge about twice the size of the ones you get. I know salons can get the bigger bottles, but I can&#x27;t find them anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it is cheaper to buy the refills here on Amazon than it is to buy them on another beauty site. It&#x27;s cheaper here because you can get it paired with the Free Super Saver discount shipping option. I&#x27;d recommend buying the 6 pack vitamin E version of the wax and get 2. You get those cheaper than the official 12-pack. I think you can actually get 3 6-packs for the cost of a 12 pack AND get free shipping.</li>
    <li> I dont know as for many, however for me this product works well! Ones I got it I plugged it in and took only about 5 minutes to heat up. The wax is good and sticky, however using lotion or oil of sort is advices before applying wax.</li>
    <li> I have semi-course hair- and found that this home wax kit is not bad- it does take a long time to heat up-(40-50 min) but it does the trick.  I also find that it is definitely important to (buy) have handy the additional rollers and wax strips to do a great job.  it is not too bad to clean with some baby oil, a rag-and patience.</li>
    <li> Not good at all. It is hard to use , and gets very messy better off buying wax at Walgreens and applying on your own.</li>
    <li> I love this waxer! It does great job, and I will never use salon for waxing again.  You need to warm it for longer then they recommend - for 1 hour instead of 45 min, then it will work perfectly. So far I couldn&#x27;t buy replacement wax roll of correct size, I&#x27;ve got the one that is shorter and warm wax gets inside of warmer a lot - this is inconvenience. You need to buy solution to clean it too, and if wax leaks inside, it&#x27;s hard to get there to clean.  But other then this, I have no trouble with using this waxer, I love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clean &amp; Easy waxing products for over 10 years.  The wax itself is great....but only if heated correctly.  When heated correctly it glides right on, and leaves no residue. My previous experience was 2 different Clean &amp; Easy \\&quot;Personal\\&quot; Waxers.  I noticed one of them stopped heating well.  When the wax isn&#x27;t warm enough, it is sticky and pulls and is difficult to remove. So, thinking my unit was worn out, I bought another.  I noticed it stopped heating well within months.  Upon further examination, both heaters had one side that stopped heating.  Like a toaster where only one side works.  So for several years I used a microwave to heat the rollers instead.  This is 1) dangerous as the wax can overheat, and 2) make makes the roller difficult to hold.    So, sucker that I am, bought this \\&quot;Portable\\&quot; unit a few weeks ago.  I liked that it holds the \\&quot;large\\&quot; refills as the large size (as opposed to \\&quot;personal\\&quot; size) is the only size that I can buy in my area beauty stores.  This unit NEVER gets the wax hot enough, even after an hour of heating.  So, I&#x27;ve had to resort to putting the roller in the microwave for an additional 30 seconds.  I am SO bummed.  I love the wax product but the heaters are too cheap and inconsistent to do the job of melting and heating the wax.  I&#x27;m back to the microwave method.  Again, NOT recommended as the product is not intended for heating in the microwave.  But I have many rollers to use up.</li>
    <li> I did like the wax and the warmer works great. The problem is the roller head that is very difficult to clean so I had to replace it instead. The kit works ok even though has a long way to go to get close to the brazilian way!</li>
    <li> If I had known how quickly and easily I could wax my legs at home I would never have made appointments to go to have it done at the spa! With this plug-in waxer, I can wax my own legs in the time it would have taken me to just get to the spa. Now I can save my spa visits for more fun stuff like facials ((((smile)))</li>
    <li> Wax is leaking. And its super sticky that just peels off your skin. Its roller head is also not fixed properly on the wax refill. Still I tried to use to make it work but I am just fed up and returning this product. I got my Money refunded. Customer service is good though.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes!  I let the leg hair grow out to unwomanly lengths and this stuff still didn&#x27;t work.  It is very messy and sticky. Sent it back and got a refund.... then I went and shaved my legs with a razor!</li>
    <li> I agree with some of the other people that reviewed this item and complained about the wax itself. The wax itself feels more like a glue then a wax. It leaves a really super thin but sticky residue on the skin. On one hand, it makes it easier to pull the hair off, but on the other hand it is so hard to get the glue-like substance off your skin. It kind of looks like the residue after you have had a band-aid on for a long time, and you have to scrub and scrub in the shower to get the last bits off. After showering I scrubbed and scrubbed in the shower, got out and my legs were still sticky then all the lint from the towels and clothing stuck to the invisible like glue coating on my skin. I had to get back in the shower and scrub again. Maybe there is a special wax remover product that I should be using this with? Also I was hoping that I would be able to interchange other brands of wax such as depileve in the roller, but it seems ?? that only the same brand wax as roller is compatible.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who is on a budget and is frustrated with the messy waxing kits. I have been using the Clean and Easy system for over a year now and I love it. I can&#x27;t afford to get a full body wax, and this is the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read some of the reviews and it is true what they say about the limitations. Here are the cons and how I got around them:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The wax does not get very hot.\\&quot; The upside is that this way you will never burn yourself. The wax has always been the right consistency for me. The only time it gets tricky is when the wax bottle is more than 3/4 empty. When its down to the last 3/4 make sure to keep the applicator on the heating stand when you are not using it and hold it upside down (slightly tilted) for a couple of seconds before applying the wax. I like to pour my 3/4 bottle into one another to make another full bottle (if you have the patience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The rolling applicator head gets dirty and you need a new one each time.\\&quot; NOT TRUE. I am still using the original applicator head I received when I purchased this over a year ago. You can clean the applicator head by applying some baby oil or the clean and easy wax removing oil on one of the wax cloths. Wipe the head down with the waxing cloth with baby oil. Use hot water to loosen the wax if you have to. Wash the head with soap and water afterwards. Repeat if you find it necessary. You must wash it well with soap and water in the end because the next time you use it, you don&#x27;t want the wax to slip off and not stick to the roller. The roller head will be a little sticky but that is okay. I always store my roller head screwed on to a bottle in the applicator with the plastic shield over it. Doesn&#x27;t get dirty and works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The wax does not come off the skin\\&quot;. This is silly. If you have any experience with waxing, this is a typical problem. Wax is sticky... who knew! Do not scrub your raw skin red in the shower like other dummies. The best way to get wax off is just by using a little baby oil. I have purchased the \\&quot;Clean + Easy Remove After Wax Remover\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;and it works wonderfully, but I suspect it is no different than baby oil. Apply it to your skin after waxing and gently rub off the patches of wax on your skin. Wash your skin gently with warm water and moisturizing soup after. If you have a lot of wax sticking to your skin, most likely you applied too much, didn&#x27;t pull the strip off properly, or didn&#x27;t wait for the wax to heat up all the way. Baby oil should take care of it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also just as a general waxing tip: exfoliate before waxing and use baby powder lightly on your skin before applying the wax. And remember, always apply in the direction of growth and pull in the opposite direction. Never do an area twice and always make sure your hair is long enough to wax (check with a test patch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wax practically my whole body with it. I have a strong hair line. I use approximately one bottle for each leg (whole leg) and one bottle for both my arms (upper and lower arm). That should give you a good idea of how much you will need. The one annoying part is that your have to wait 30 min for each bottle to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great product for at home waxing. I have tried other waxing kits, and they are messy and clumsy. The down side is you are stuck using their wax. If you have a favorite brand of wax, this set up doesn&#x27;t let you use it. But their wax is good and I have not had any issues with it.</li>
