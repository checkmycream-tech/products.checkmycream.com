    <li> Works great. At 66, I had turned a ole lady gray &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;. Not enticing in the bedroom! This solves that problem. Lasts about a month and you can get three months&#x27; worth applications out of one package. Gentle to skin.</li>
    <li> I use it on my beard for a more uniform color. It works better than beard Color because it doesn&#x27;t stain your skin near is bad.</li>

    <li> Works really well. No permanent staining on the genital area and no irritation either.  Sure that a lot of women and men will really appreciate how easy it is to cover up a few white hairs...&amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Product is effective.  I mixed a little more than I needed this first time but I will know for next time--definitely will get several applications from this one purchase.</li>
    <li> I chose the five star rating as it covered my grey and made a rich dark brown color. I would definitely use and buy this product again. There was NO skin reaction.  The directions were clear and explanatory.  Who knows, I may try another color!  Great product.</li>
