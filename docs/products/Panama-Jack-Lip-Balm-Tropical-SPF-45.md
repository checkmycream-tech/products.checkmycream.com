<li> It is not glossy and looks matte when dried down.  </li>
<li> It has much more SPF than almost all lip balms on the market, and the other brands I&#x27;ve found that offer SPF 45 leave this horrible, bitter, chemically aftertaste that won&#x27;t go away, as if I had literally squirted sunscreen into my mouth (blagh).  </li>
<li> Yes, I am officially addicted, I can&#x27;t be without my vanilla Panama Jack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> when I cold a cold sore, it moisturizes it so it doesn&#x27;t go through the cracking phase.</li>
<li> Perhaps you&#x27;ve used a lip sunscreen before and it had a terrible taste which would get in your mouth</li>

    <li> Good product but i have been looking for the vanilla flavor since I ran out. It is my favorite flavor . I purchased it by the case and can no longer find it, so I settled for the tropical. I wish I could find it, I even went directly to the panama jack web page.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm I ever used but hard to find.</li>
    <li> wonderful coverage with a soft touch.  Makes my lips feel soft and protected.</li>
    <li> absolutely, love it, great seller, fast delivery, will buy again</li>
    <li> I have always used Bert&#x27;s Bees until I purchased one of these at Virginia Beach. I have not been able to find them so I ordered several. I keep one in every jacket and car. Highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> works great no bad taste</li>
    <li> I love this product....excellent transaction....everything as promised....</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I love this product, use it every time I go outside</li>
    <li> good scent and works great</li>
    <li> Great coverage.  Great taste.  It is not glossy and looks matte when dried down.  I use it often and also when I cold a cold sore, it moisturizes it so it doesn&#x27;t go through the cracking phase.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth chapstick. Stays on for a long time. Great smell.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this balm!</li>
    <li> Perhaps you&#x27;ve used a lip sunscreen before and it had a terrible taste which would get in your mouth then you couldn&#x27;t get rid of that taste. This one has a good but mild flavor. The two I bought is coconut. There are other choices but I&#x27;ve forgotten what they are. I have a tendency to get fever blisters and exposure to the sun can make my lips break out into a mass of fever blisters. This lip sunscreen lasts a long time and protects your lips well.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely my favorite lip balm of all time!  It is soothing and tastes and smells delicious!</li>
    <li> excellent product - excellent customer service</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite lip balm for the summertime.  It has much more SPF than almost all lip balms on the market, and the other brands I&#x27;ve found that offer SPF 45 leave this horrible, bitter, chemically aftertaste that won&#x27;t go away, as if I had literally squirted sunscreen into my mouth (blagh).  This one tastes (and smells!) delicious, like sweet, creamy vanilla, with absolutely no weird aftertaste.  It is incredibly smooth and does not leave my lips feeling dry or like I constantly need to reapply it.  And since I spend a LOT of time by the water on sunny days in the summer, I feel like I&#x27;m being sun-safe by using this regularly.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere around me (I originally bought a couple of these on vacation), so I have to order online, which stinks having to pay more in shipping than the stuff costs, but it is definitely worth it.  Yes, I am officially addicted, I can&#x27;t be without my vanilla Panama Jack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My boyfriend loves it too!</li>
