      <li>The scent seems to be most pleasing to her.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased too with the scent.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is fabulous!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance, but there&#x27;s something in there that triggers a headache for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very clean smelling</li>
      <li>Despite trying this on in the store and liking it, when I put some on today, I noticed just how strong the scent is.</li>
      <li>Not only is the coriander/oliver scent great</li>
      <li>Makes your hands feel smooth, not greasy.</li>
      <li>Great for a gift or to set by the kitchen sink for those who run into dry hands.</li>
      <li>I will certainly order more.</li>
      <li>I also enjoy the fresh clean scent.  </li>
      <li>This hand cream has a mild, agreeable scent and feels very nice on dry hands; in Colorado, we are all about moisturizers!</li>
      <li>They were quick to rectify the situation and they let my mom keep the refill.</li>
      <li>I also enjoy the liquid soap and highly recommend both.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is much thicker than most, it has a great smell and only takes a small amount for application</li>
      <li>It is so creamy rich, and your skin will immediately soak it in and give a sigh of relief......and oddly, for being so rich and creamy it absorbs quite quickly into the skin with a non greasy feel!  </li>
      <li>but it really moistures the skin and cuticles.</li>
      <li>Very classy-looking.</li>
      <li>I keep it in the kitchen and like it so much because it doesn&#x27;t transfer&lt;br /&gt;any taste or aroma to food.</li>
      <li>The product itself is very expensive and ebubbles has the best and cheapest prices.</li>
      <li>The cost is extremely high for this product.</li>
      <li>I have trouble with some scents giving me headaches, and thought since I tried it on the store, I&#x27;d be safe.</li>
      <li>It is not too greasy and it leaves your hands very soft.</li>
      <li>My old ( very old) container pump broke</li>
      <li>A whole year later I finally broke down and bought it :)    </li>
      <li>I have given several of the soap and lotion sets as gifts and they are very well received.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 7 years.</li>
      <li>this looks great next to the sink, but it&#x27;s pretty expensive for what it is: heavily scented hand lotion.  </li>
      <li>It is very watery and does not last long.</li>

<li> A little goes a long way, so they will last a while.</li>
<li> Though I received this as a gift, it was $24 and now feel bad since I won&#x27;t be able to use it.&lt;br</li>
<li> I like the hand cream but found it too thin</li>
<li> I ordered from ebubbles.com through amazon and had received the wrong item.</li>
<li> , this is insanely expensive lotion!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Liked the aroma of this product so I purchased the lotion. It is very watery and does not last long. The cost is extremely high for this product.</li>
    <li> Smells divine and I enjoyed it.  I&#x27;m always looking for a great hand lotion and I liked this one a lot.  I did not give my hands the relief I was looking for  but nothing else has either.  Its pricey so I didn&#x27;t purchase it again.  My search continues.</li>
    <li> Really good product. This hand cream has a mild, agreeable scent and feels very nice on dry hands; in Colorado, we are all about moisturizers!</li>
    <li> I found this stuff sitting about my best friends moms kitchen counter. Everytime I would go over I would make a point to get some.        A whole year later I finally broke down and bought it :)    And I love it.</li>
    <li> I gave the hand soap and the hand cream as a Christmas gift. Everyone is wanting to know where I purchased them. The coriander and olive are my favorite as well as my friends. A little goes a long way, so they will last a while.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  It is the perfect scent for kitchen/daily use.  It is not too greasy and it leaves your hands very soft.</li>
    <li> love this cream! love the smell, the feeling, the results! I will certainly order more. It&#x27;s great beside my bed, the bathroom, and the kitchen!</li>
    <li> Rated it 5 stars because it&#x27;s my favorite.  Use it myself and give it as gifts.  Not only is the coriander/oliver scent great but it really moistures the skin and cuticles.</li>
    <li> just what she wanted. The scent seems to be most pleasing to her. I&#x27;m pleased too with the scent. It&#x27;s very clean smelling</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes your hands feel smooth, not greasy.</li>

    <li> I bought this product for my mom because it&#x27;s her favorite thing in the world. I ordered from ebubbles.com through amazon and had received the wrong item. They were quick to rectify the situation and they let my mom keep the refill. I would use them again based on that. The product itself is very expensive and ebubbles has the best and cheapest prices. My mother loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> I like the hand cream but found it too thin but the smell is wonderful. Would I buy this again, no. It&#x27;s overpriced.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite lotion since discovering it many years ago.

I have trouble with some scents giving me headaches, and thought since I tried it on the store, I&#x27;d be safe. Not so. Within minutes of putting this on, I had a headache. I love the fragrance, but there&#x27;s something in there that triggers a headache for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is insanely expensive lotion! Though I received this as a gift, it was $24 and now feel bad since I won&#x27;t be able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ceramic jar it comes in is really nice though. Very classy-looking.</li>
    <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t like this product?  It&#x27;s perfect for cooks, as it doesn&#x27;t interfere with food item flavors.  The fragrance is fabulous!</li>
