<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a good thing for me...this scent brings back memories. I miss you Grandma!</li>
    <li> I remember this perfume being available more n the 1970s and &#x27;80s when I was a child and teen and liked it a lot and was happy to come across it again. I&#x27;m not a fan of the current perfume trend where everything is fruity or candy-scented, or has hints of black peppercorn and whatever else in it. I find those kinds of perfumes cloying and unpleasant, sickeningly heavy. So, to find this with its notes of jasmine and orange and touches of sandalwood (among other things) was a happy moment for me. To me it smells more like a perfume should, with the florals and ambers and a bit of vanilla throughout. It reminds me a lot of Shalimar -- a favorite of mine -- though not exactly a twin of it; this might be more subtle (and a lot more affordable). But it&#x27;s a lovely, feminine perfume with a nice warmth to it.</li>
    <li> Always my favorite, glad I can still find it</li>
    <li> My mom loves this cologne spray, it has a nice scent, and she gets a lot of compliments when she wears this. I will continue to purchase this from Amazon, very nice brand.</li>
    <li> old favorite....loved by the Mrs......is hard to find at any store....&lt;br /&gt;found it on Amazon....good price!!!!!.............thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Cologne for 60 years and love it and found Amazon gets me the best prices</li>
    <li> Price is great thru Amazon and wife has always like this product, but it is getting harder to get locally.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne. My friend uses it and I had to have some.</li>
    <li> Purchased every year at Christmas and Mother&#x27;s Day for my mom.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but I&#x27;m thankful it&#x27;s available because she loves it so much.</li>
    <li> My very favorite scent.  Just like when I was a teen!</li>
    <li> Needed this cologne for a gift and couldn&#x27;t find it locally...was very happy to find it at a good price on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> next to Tabu, this is also my favorite perfume. The scent lasts for a long time. Unlike other perfumes that are overly nauseating and musky. this is a timeless classic!!!!!</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift to my mom.  This is the only perfume she wears.  It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Emeraude!  My mother wore it and it&#x27;s just a clean fresh smell.  Not over powering like some perfumes.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear this.  It&#x27;s gotten hard to find.  Walmart and Kmart carry it, with Kmart usually being a tad cheaper.  But this is a good price on Amazon and the same high quality with fast shipping.</li>
    <li> EXACTLY AS I REMEMBER!! MEMORIES........LOL. LOVE THIS SCENT. I&#x27;M GLAD THE SCENT IS FRESH NOT THAT &amp;#34;SITTING ON A SHELF OLD SMELL&amp;#34;. SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED TO REVISIT WONDERFUL PAST SCENTS!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. FAST SHIPPING. ARRIVED IN A SMALL BOX WITH BUBBLE WRAP. FAIR PRICE.</li>
    <li> smells goood on special lady</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find Emeraude in stores.  This is exactly the formula I remember.  Love the scent, great price, arrived on time and packaged nicely.  Would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Great product and prompt shipping.  My wife loves this and I score many points getting it for her.  I;ll be back!!</li>
    <li> a gift for myself I love</li>
    <li> Is Mother in Laws Favorite Fragrance!!</li>
    <li> This my favorite cologne was so happy to find it</li>
    <li> I have loved Emeraude for years. Since my last bottle, however, something has changed in the formulation, or this bottle was very old?  As I spray it, the classic fragrance is there, but then almost instantly one of the spices overpowers the scent and the sweetness goes away. I don&#x27;t like the scent that is left. I may look into a return/exchange if that&#x27;s possible, in case it&#x27;s age, though I had bottles for years that were stable.</li>
    <li> This a great scent that is light but noticeable.  I have used it for years as did my mother.  Yes it&#x27;s been around for a while.  I have at times bought other scents but always return to Emeraude.</li>
    <li> This is one of my fav&#x27;s, glad I found it here, so inexpensive, I will order more..</li>
    <li> The product shipped to my satisfaction and the actual cologne is perfect.  However, I had to trade out the spray nozzle with another one I found in my cabinet because it would not spray correctly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother for Christmas.  It was actually a gift from my father to my mother.  This was my mother&#x27;s favorite perfume when she was dating my father in high school.  She was very happy to receive the gift and they both agreed that it smelled the same as it did 40 years ago and brought back memories :)</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, well-packaged, relatively fast shipping!</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance for 30 years! Hard to find but this is great and a good price, too.</li>
    <li> My husband and I were out with another couple, and she had this fragrance on.  I kept smelling it and I finally asked&lt;br /&gt;Her what she was wearing.  She stated Emeraude by Coty.  So I went online and I ordered it.  I will be buying more,&lt;br /&gt;In the future.  I am glad I bought it, it is a an old Cologne.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have worn Emeraude by Coty for many years.  It is the only fragrance I can use without a headache.  For the past few years it has been very hard to find in stores.  I am so glad that I tried Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Product is great, just didn&#x27;t know when it was coming.  No tracking.  But very, very happy it came. Thank you.</li>
    <li> not for me but my friend loves it</li>
    <li> Lovely scent---soft, romantic and unusual (not an imitation of anything). I&#x27;ve been wearing this toilet water since I was 16 years old and it never disappoints. Still my favorite scent. Quality of this bottle was outstanding!</li>
    <li> Terrible.  This perfume is not at all like the Emerald I have been using for years. Why would Coty change a classic scent.  Very disappointed. Smells awful.  Tossed in the trash.</li>
    <li> Wife thought was a little weak in aromatic. Wondered if old !</li>
    <li> Fragrance didn&#x27;t seem the same &amp; not like the real Emeraude.</li>
    <li> It came in time and my Mother loves this scent.  I recommend it and the vendor to others.</li>
    <li> Made my 83 year old mother very happy that I found this for her.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> wife (and I) love this discontinued product. Hope somebody picks up the formula</li>
    <li> It smells as wonderful as I remembered. Thought it was gone forever. So happy i tried my search engine. Gave one away as a gift to a good friend close to my age, and she loved it. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.</li>
    <li> My wife loves Emeraude.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find my most favorite cologne, which has been a trademark scent known to my friends and prior co-workers for years.  I was and still am complimented on its fragrance.  It is becoming more difficult to find it.</li>
    <li> This was always my favorite scwent from the past, and now I can still get it through Amazon. I love the fragrance and it is not too strong, but light and fresh smelling. I get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorites!</li>
    <li> This is an old fragrance but I love it</li>
    <li> LOVED IT...WAS FOR MY MOM FOR HER BIRTHDAY...CANT BEAT THE PRICE BETTER THAN THE STORE PRICE...THANKS</li>
    <li> I was so happy to see this on Amazon and for a fantastic price, too.  This is my favorite cologne and have used it for many, many years.  Glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Not my cup of tea but my Aunt loves it so she got it for Christmas. Could not believe we could still find this.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this cologne</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent. It has noted of jasmine and vanilla. I wish it was a little longer lasting. It does not arrive in a room before you do.</li>
    <li> THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAVORITE OF MINE. THIS SMELLED OLD. I REALIZE I GOT THIS AT A LOW PRICE.  OH WELL , WISH IT WAS NOT SO  OVERLY  RIPE.  I WILL TRY TO BE MORE CAREFUL NEXT TIME.</li>
    <li> IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND THIS IN THE STORES.  CVS has it at a very expensive price $26.99.  This is much better.&lt;br /&gt;MY FAVORITE perfume.  I just love it.  I don&#x27;t know why the stores don&#x27;t have this anymore.</li>
    <li> Have always loved the smell of this perfume and couldnt find it in most stores.  Would recommend it to others</li>
    <li> this is another  perfume my wife wore when we were going steady..brings back a lot of good memories.</li>
    <li> Received the order in a timely manner.  The scent seems slightly off.  Other than that I am pleased with the purchase overall.</li>
    <li> I used Emeraude many years ago and was happy to run across it again. This is cologne, not perfume so it will not be as strong nor as long-lasting as perfume. That said, at the end of the day I could still smell the two sprays that I applied in the morning. It is still the same old fragrance and this was a very good price.</li>
    <li> My grandmother used to wear Emeraude, so that is the reason I bought it.  It reminds me of my Grandma.</li>
    <li> The is a favorite in my family, for the women.  It&#x27;s classic and classy.  Want mystery?  Dab a little on the heat spots. Works well with all body chemistry.</li>
    <li> It is the BEST.!! I used it all my life, I am 82 years old. I would be disappointed if it was ever discontinued.</li>
    <li> This smells horrible!! I bought it after reading great reviews comparing it  with Guerlain&#x27;s Shalimar.. Serves me right for not doing a body spray test. I had smelled this at Walmart, but hadn&#x27;t tried it on my body.  Please do a test before buying.. You might regret it otherwise, like I did.</li>
    <li> It was fine.  Mom loved it.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, my daughter&#x27;s favorite fragrance.  She loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom - who is 94 - for her birthday.  She had mentioned it is no longer available in stores and was sad about that.  I ordered and it was delivered ON HER BIRTHDAY!!  Yippee!!  She cried, and I felt like a million bucks.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Emeraude is difficult to get now. Started using it in my 20s. Everyone always asks what I am wearing. Still get &amp;#34;You smell nice&amp;#34; at the grocery store and mall.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister-in-law and she loves it. She has been using this for years and still loves the way it smells. Not so easy to find in the stores any more so I was tickled to find it here. Great gift.</li>
    <li> This has always been a long time favorite of mine, but I could never find it.  I will admit I have found it for a better price on another website, but it is very good, the price is higher here. However it&#x27;s a wonderful cologne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this perfume since I was in high school. Just smelling it brings me way back. It was quite expensive locally so I did an online search and found a great deal here.</li>
    <li> This has the best scent, it is gentle while appealing. I have been told by many people that it has a pleasant fragrance  and they ask me what the scent is. I have been using Emeraude BY Coty for more than 30 years and find nothing comparable to it. I love Emeraude and you will too.</li>
    <li> This is SO NOT authentic Emeraude by Coty! Doesn&#x27;t even resemble the familiarly sweet, vanilla-note real thing. I bought TWO of these bottles as a gift for my sister, and was so disappointed when I smelled what was actually shipped. I have smelled imitations (so labeled) that were better than this knock-off.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to get here and its just okay.  Would not order again because the scent is light as if it lost its potency.</li>
    <li> It came in excellent condition thanks.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS !  WIFE WEARS IT.  MY FAVORITE !</li>
    <li> I like this perfume it arrived yesterday and I thought it would and it was packed very well I would order it again</li>
    <li> Fragrance from the past. Loved it.</li>
    <li> Recieved my order fast and it is exactly as i remember from 1959.. Love the smell of this perfum and would recommend anyone wondering yes it is exactly the same.</li>
    <li> My mom has been using this fragrance for like a thousand years.  This a fragrance you can wear for fun or when dressed up and going out.  Doesn&#x27;t over power either.  Nice fragrance... A real classic!</li>
    <li> My husband use to buy this for me and I loved it.  But this does not smell the same as what I remember, my daughter does not like the smell.</li>
    <li> perfume from the 50&#x27;s...very pleasant smell without being brassy</li>
    <li> This perfume has been my favorite for years and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in local stores. This was a great price for the sweetest scent I know.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and quick delivery on an old favorite!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this stuff because I have some Aunts who wear this and it has become a family thing because my great-grandmother is the one who came up with its&#x27; name! Combined with the powder, the scent is very lasting and wonderful.</li>
    <li> Emeraude smells very much like Shalimar, which some people think it was copied from -- an oriental fragrance.  But actually Emeraude is older.  I bought it for my grandaughter.</li>
