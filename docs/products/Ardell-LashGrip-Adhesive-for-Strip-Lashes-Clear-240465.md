<li> Long lasting.</li>
<li> It works amazing and its a little expensive</li>
<li> I am new to the world of false eyelashes and am very thankful that there is adhesive that is colorless when dry!!!  </li>
<li> It can be a bit messy but applied carefully, it dries clear.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not even sticky and it comes out far too thickly.</li>
<li> I let the 1st one set until I finish the other one.  </li>
<li> Its like any other glue.</li>
<li> I will never order any other eye lash adhesive.</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> put a small amount on the lash tray - size of a small button-maybe.</li>
<li> Using a lip brush (very small)  </li>
<li> This was a waste of my money!!!</li>
<li> never again will I waste my money on this horrible non lasting glue.</li>
<li> it dries like some weird strchy elmers glue type stuff</li>
<li> so people can&#x27;t tell you have and fake eye lashes on!</li>
<li> dont squeeze too hard or you will have a crap ton of it all over the place!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
<li> absolutely hate it</li>
<li> I hate this product.</li>

    <li> It came in a pretty big envelope, and when I took it out it&#x27;s little box was crushed, but the glue was fine. It doesn&#x27;t state it in the description, but on the box it says it&#x27;s known in the state of California to cause cancer. Haven&#x27;t actually used it yet, but I will tomorrow.</li>

    <li> It is exactly as pictured. it was even bigger than i assumed it would be - will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Do not buy, it does not work! Not worth the money. And it is very rubbery...once you get it in your lashes than you will be peeling it out for a week.</li>
    <li> Works fine for short term wear. I suck at putting lashes on so when I do get them on the glue works fine</li>
    <li> This is the very best eye lash glue I have ever worked with , sometimes hard to find so I was thrilled when I found on Amazon</li>
    <li> Works good and was a good price .Will buy this again,holds but comes off easily,I think this a very good product.</li>
    <li> o m g this si suppose to b clear. it dries like some weird strchy elmers glue type stuff absolutely hate it</li>
    <li> I hate this product. It&#x27;s not even sticky and it comes out far too thickly. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. I NEEDED EYELASH GLUE.</li>
    <li> Great glue. sticks really really well. Only problem is it leaves a white streak but thats expected since its white.</li>
    <li> So easy to use, and it dried quickly.  My lashes stayed on all day, I almost forgot I had them on.  At the end of the day the lashes came off easily with just a small amount of eye makeup remover!</li>
    <li> I will forever buy this lash glue. Its fantastic. It works amazing and its a little expensive but I love it</li>
    <li> It says on the box that it&#x27;s clear, but the content of the tube is white!  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again!</li>
    <li> this is the best lash glue iv used so far.i put it on once and it stays on for two to three days...i love it.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of my money!!! Never again shall I buy this.. No.. No.. I repeat never again will I waste my money on this horrible non lasting glue.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff for ages and I love it. It goes on white, dries clear, and dries quickly. I recommend blowing on it for a couple seconds after you have applied it to your lashes for the best results... dont squeeze too hard or you will have a crap ton of it all over the place! Its also handy for costume makeup... you can use it to apply gems/rhinestones to your face if the occasion calls for it hehe:P !</li>
    <li> LIKED THIS ADHESIVE BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff was perfect, it works really good it turns clear right when it drys like it said, i love how when you squeezed the tube only a little comes out :)</li>
    <li> Great, except be extra careful on how much you squeeze it unless you want a ton of glue. I&#x27;d reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I just wish it would STAY ON LONGER!! I was in the middle of class and it had only been 6 hours and my eyelashes stated coming off</li>
    <li> My lashes stayed on ALL day! The glue dries clear so people can&#x27;t tell you have and fake eye lashes on! Great product</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year now and I am so glad I found it on Amazon.  1 Tube does last awhile too.&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used lashes, please watch a you tube to get some idea.  I found what works the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;I put a small amount on the lash tray - size of a small button-maybe. Using a lip brush (very small)  I apply glue to the lash AND above my lash line and leave it until its tacky.  Not dry and rubbery. Using tweezers and my fingers I apply my lash to my eyelid- watching the start and finish to make sure I will get them even on both sides.  I let the 1st one set until I finish the other one.  Then I use the tweezers again after letting it dry some more to adjust them.  OK have at it!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE MY Lashes.</li>
    <li> Last Grip is the best eye lash adhesive and the only one that works for me. I will never order any other eye lash adhesive. Sold for decent price and also arrived quickly to my house. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the only last glue I use. I highly recommend it, also I got it a lot faster than I was expediting! Score!</li>
    <li> I love this glue so much. It can be a bit messy but applied carefully, it dries clear. They are great.</li>
    <li> Great adhesive, keeps the lashes on all day and goes on clear so you can&#x27;t see it</li>
    <li> the adhesive stuck but it left white goop on certain areas its ok but not really satisfied wont buy again</li>
