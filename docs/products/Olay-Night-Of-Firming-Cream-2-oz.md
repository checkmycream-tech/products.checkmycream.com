      <li>Use it nightly-very soothing, very  nice, rich feel.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I love, love, love Oil of Olay, have for 25 years.  </li>
      <li>Having used Night of Olay for many years, I knew it was the product I wanted and needed.  </li>
      <li>I really love this cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with results of using this  cream.</li>
      <li>I tried the Night of Olay cream and fell in love immediately.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
      <li>I love the creamy texture....</li>
      <li>Always love Oil of Olay products.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every night for two weeks now, and I can see a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>FOR HAVING THIS ITEM AVAILABLE...</li>
      <li>THIS IS SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT...</li>
      <li>It keeps my face feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>Lightly scented.</li>
      <li>Like it very much - but I am still looking for better Olay product for night cream.</li>
      <li>and it is absorbed quickly leaving a fresh sensation</li>
      <li>The price for this product was right, though, so I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try again...</li>
      <li>Fine lines and wrinkles are definitely fading, and skin is extremely smooth.</li>
      <li>Quality is consistent with store-bought product.</li>
      <li>Hi,    I have been using this cream for the past 6 months and have derived good results.</li>
      <li>So i keep searching for creams which are light on skin yet provide moisture especially at night.</li>
      <li>Every Olay product I&#x27;ve ever used has been fantastic and this one is no different.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping as well.</li>
      <li>This cream really disappoints.  </li>
      <li>THANKS AMAZON.COM</li>
      <li>Kind of sticky and heavy.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg for beauty products if you start early and find the right products.</li>
      <li>the whole, this cream is fine -- no real complaints, but no praise, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>will say, this product is slightly scented, which I don&#x27;t love, but you can&#x27;t smell it at all once you put it on.</li>
      <li>It has a decent scent to it</li>
      <li>I recommend this product for those looking for something reasonable and just makes your skin soft and supple.  </li>
      <li>This updated version is light pink.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give it a few more times</li>
      <li>I read some reviews before buying this cream, it&#x27;s true what they say after a week you skin feels firm with a nice glow in the morning, is a thick cream</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft and line-free now...</li>
      <li>you skin is still soft.  </li>
      <li>AND IT KEEPS MY FACE REALLY SOFT AND LOOKING YOUNGER,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick, hydrating, and keeps my skin line free.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s texture is definitely much thicker then the previous night firming cream I was using.  </li>

<li> The cream feels a little too thick and heavy for my personal taste, although if you have very dry skin or if you live in an area with strong winds, you might like that aspect about</li>
<li> This cream basically cleared up the dry, flaky-skin spell I had been having with only one application.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few nights so far.....  </li>
<li> Lasts a long time, since you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.</li>
<li> I see no difference still using it though to see if after a long period it would make any difference.</li>
<li> I can really see a difference in the firmness of my skin and the little lines on my forehead are less visible when i use this.</li>
<li> Next time I order, however, I&#x27;m going back to the Night Firming / Regenerist, which is a little lighter and not as heavy/greasy.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other skin products, but always come back to olay, just like my mother and grandmother.</li>
<li> the only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the smell, is like cheap baby cream I think, is not that bad probably is just me.</li>
<li> I did it as a last attempt to end the frustration of searching for something to eliviate these heavy wrinkles.</li>
<li> a few weeks ago I was starting to look tired and sallow from my long days in the office.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Olay&#x27;s Night Firming / Regenerist brand for years, and I thought I&#x27;d switch to this because its a little cheaper.</li>
<li> :  Update: Homeland Security has been restricting the shipping of this cream recently,  not available everywhere.</li>
<li> Seems very artificial and full of chemicals.</li>
<li> I am in my late twenties and have an oily skin.</li>
<li> The smell is also rather unpleasant.  </li>
<li> Its terrible.</li>

    <li> I see a difference when I use this cream.</li>
    <li> No, not kidding, and it wasn&#x27;t contents settle in jar, this jar was used, so tacky, never again Buyer Beward!</li>
    <li> Hi,    I have been using this cream for the past 6 months and have derived good results. I am in my late twenties and have an oily skin. So i keep searching for creams which are light on skin yet provide moisture especially at night. When i came across this cream i decided to try and after 6 months i am happy using it. My morning is no longer the same and i recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> This cream made my nasal folds deepen after just one use! Don&#x27;t buy this cream. Also the olay regenerist serum gave me a turkey neck!</li>
    <li> I bought this at the grocery store for 8$. I did it as a last attempt to end the frustration of searching for something to eliviate these heavy wrinkles. I had to think back to what I used before. Olay came to mind. What a relief. I immediatley saw improvement after application! Why search for anything different? This dramaticley lifted and erased those wrinkles. Its also doing some repair, I recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other skin products, but always come back to olay, just like my mother and grandmother. I really love this cream. I can really see a difference in the firmness of my skin and the little lines on my forehead are less visible when i use this. I recommend olay to anyone.</li>
    <li> Having used Night of Olay for many years, I knew it was the product I wanted and needed.  It arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> This cream has been a god-send for me. Last weekend I went home to visit my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day and went poking around in her beauty products and moisturizers. I tried the Night of Olay cream and fell in love immediately. This cream basically cleared up the dry, flaky-skin spell I had been having with only one application. I use it at night and in the morning. Great moisturizer to use before applying makeup, too. My skin stays hydrated all day and I wake up looking so refreshed! I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> always a win with Olay products!</li>
    <li> good product, have used for years now can get it at a good price and at my door. will order again. will also tell friends.</li>
    <li> faithful user as of age 11 thx deb</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few nights so far.....  It&#x27;s texture is definitely much thicker then the previous night firming cream I was using.  The smell is also rather unpleasant.  I&#x27;ll give it a few more times but if things don&#x27;t improve I will be going back to my former night cream.</li>
    <li> Lightly scented. This updated version is light pink.  Got it once about 15 years ago &amp; it was yellow.  Use it nightly-very soothing, very  nice, rich feel.  I&#x27;m pleased with results of using this  cream. Terrific value-great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.12.12:  Update: Homeland Security has been restricting the shipping of this cream recently,  not available everywhere.</li>
    <li> THIS IS SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT... I USE IT NIGHTLY AND IT KEEPS MY FACE REALLY SOFT AND LOOKING YOUNGER, AS I ALWAYS SAY, THANKS AMAZON.COM FOR HAVING THIS ITEM AVAILABLE...</li>
    <li> Every Olay product I&#x27;ve ever used has been fantastic and this one is no different.  Olay makes very good products.</li>
    <li> have used it for years</li>
    <li> great service, good stuff</li>
    <li> The cream feels a little too thick and heavy for my personal taste, although if you have very dry skin or if you live in an area with strong winds, you might like that aspect about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, this cream is fine -- no real complaints, but no praise, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Olay&#x27;s Night Firming / Regenerist brand for years, and I thought I&#x27;d switch to this because its a little cheaper.

    <li> I love, love, love Oil of Olay, have for 25 years.  This cream really disappoints.  I love the creamy texture....but the smell drives me away.  Its terrible.</li>
    <li> Quality is consistent with store-bought product. Works well on my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just OK. Kind of sticky and heavy.</li>
    <li> It keeps my face feeling smooth. Love it</li>
    <li> Always love Oil of Olay products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay for years and this cream is no exception. It&#x27;s thick, hydrating, and keeps my skin line free. You don&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg for beauty products if you start early and find the right products. Fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> I has a nice smell and a nice texture.  It is also a good moisturizer for the price.  Lasts a long time, since you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.</li>
    <li> I purchase this several time at Cosco and couple times here. It has a decent scent to it and it&#x27;s not too strong. After a while, I think it lays out too creamy for my taste.</li>
    <li> I used to be a Lancome girl, but Olay has won me over. Their product line is great. I put on the Olay night serum after I return from work and then use a liberal amount of this before bed. Fine lines and wrinkles are definitely fading, and skin is extremely smooth.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used Olay products for years because several years ago I had an allergic reaction to the foaming face wash.  The price for this product was right, though, so I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try again... on a weekend, when I could hide in my apartment in case it caused me to break out in a rash, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to take a chance on this product!  I&#x27;ve been using it every night for two weeks now, and I can see a huge difference.  My skin is so soft and line-free now... a few weeks ago I was starting to look tired and sallow from my long days in the office.  This product has totally rejuvenated my skin and made it look youthful, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, this product is slightly scented, which I don&#x27;t love, but you can&#x27;t smell it at all once you put it on.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The scent is wonderful. When you wake up in the morning your skin is moisturized. Will keep buying this. I use a lot of Olay products and like them all. The price is great for the quality.</li>
    <li> I see no difference still using it though to see if after a long period it would make any difference.</li>
    <li> I like this product and doesn&#x27;t break out your skin and in the morning you skin is still soft.  I recommend this product for those looking for something reasonable and just makes your skin soft and supple.  No big changes, just a softener.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews before buying this cream, it&#x27;s true what they say after a week you skin feels firm with a nice glow in the morning, is a thick cream and it is absorbed quickly leaving a fresh sensation the only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the smell, is like cheap baby cream I think, is not that bad probably is just me.</li>
    <li> Like it very much - but I am still looking for better Olay product for night cream.</li>
    <li> Seems very artificial and full of chemicals. Decide to throw it out.</li>
