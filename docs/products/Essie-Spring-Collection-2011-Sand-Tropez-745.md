      <li>Such a cute color.</li>
      <li>Essie can do no wrong in this buyers eyes.</li>
      <li>This is a great shade that offers coverage and a bit slight bit of color.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This polish is a great neutral/work-appropriate color. The formula was awesome too. Completely opaque in two coats. I would say that it leans slightly more greige in person than it does in the picture.</li>
    <li> OMG this seller shipped this product so fast and it was free shipping. Also the product was cheaper than at ULTA. I couldnt find this color anywhere so I had to come on amazon. Im so happy that I did. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I wore this amazing Essie Sand Tropez nail color,and I went to a family reunion party ,I saw some of my relatives which  they live in different States,the women in my side of family they notice everything about me specially my nails they all said what a pretty color,who&#x27;s is it and I said mine and they said the brand I said I know I was just having fun ,so I told them its Essie Sand Tropez nail color,and they went wow .also I told them get it at amazon.com better prices.</li>
    <li> This is a great shade that offers coverage and a bit slight bit of color.  Even when there are small chips they don&#x27;t particularly show.  Let&#x27;s hope Essie will continue to provide this shade.</li>
    <li> I love the color but i was expecting more opacity, it took me three cots to get this opaque but once it was i got so many compliments, i dont usually like nude but its the perfect nude polish and makes your hands look so elegant.</li>
    <li> Love this neutral color. Polish stays on for longer than most and paints on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Essie can do no wrong in this buyers eyes. I prefer muted or nude colors for my nail polish especially for work.  Essie hits a home run each time.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles and it wasn&#x27;t the one I wanted...  Unfortunately, I was not allowed to return it either.  $12. down the drain.</li>
    <li> I have a light skin tone and this still looks great and stands out. Not too brown or light. I think it is a great neutral or a coat to put below some Konad stamping.</li>
    <li> i ordered this on Sunday and the polish came today on Friday. Essie is always good the formula is great. I can get it perfectly opaque with two coats. The nude is a darker nude than i expected .. it looks a lit lighter in the picture than it does in person &amp; on my nails but still its good. If u are looking for a dark nude this is definitely your color.</li>
    <li> I am very glad I got this product. It goes on nicely, smooth, and last for a few days. Will be getting more Essie products!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and perfectly packaged to prevent any breakage. As for the nail polish it is a timeless nude color. Two coats are good enough. The formula is not too liquid-y and it lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I love this color so much I&#x27;ll be using it at my wedding in October! Doesn&#x27;t dry quickly, but it&#x27;s a lot better than many of the other Essie polishes. Looks great with a few coats.</li>
    <li> I have used only Essie polishes for years and had not seen this particular color.  It does take about three light coats to really get the full effect of the color.  I really liked it.  I have fair skin and I was leary about trying it, however, I really like it.  Love Essie polish.  It lasted on my nails for about 2 weeks (yes, I do housework and yardwork without gloves).  Did not chip off.</li>
    <li> love this color, casual, classy look, looks fabulous on my nails! Essie always has the best products. A+ + +</li>

    <li> Good Color is a little bubbly, might be a fake or just got a bad batch. However the color is the opposite more dark tan. Still looks good.</li>
    <li> A lot darker looking online than in person.</li>
    <li> Bad product .. Does not stick to nails properly and peels off as well within a day</li>
    <li> I really like this shade...a very light beige color.  And I always like Essie nail polish.</li>
    <li> I purchased this nail polish because the color looked classy and professional for the work environment. In the picture it looked liked a nude-pinkish color but when I received it, it was more of a palish nude color. I still like it and will use it but I would recommend this color for a more tan complexion. This was my first time purchasing Essie and so far the quality is very good. I used it with the Essie top coat and I have had it on for 2 days without any chipping. (My nails normally chip within a day using OPI)</li>
