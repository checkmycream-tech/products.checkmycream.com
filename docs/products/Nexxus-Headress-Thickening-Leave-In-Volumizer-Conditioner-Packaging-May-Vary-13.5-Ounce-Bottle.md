<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This seems to bring some volume to my hair but I think the trick is using a very little bit. Otherwise it seems to weigh down my hair and contribute to it looking greasy or flat the next day. I actually use the Nexxus Volumizing Shampoo and I think that is really enough. I am not sure this volumizer adds much more.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this product and I&#x27;ve been  using it for about 15 years.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in quality with the container change.  Very nice results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with relaxed hair.  After just one use, i noticed a difference in my hair. It was noticeably thicker and fuller. The product smells good and I just loved the results. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> If I could rate this product as a 10 I seriously would. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! I AM IN LOVE! Why?? Because this product does EXACTLY what it says it will do. I have relaxed medium thick/full hair and I wanted my hair  to become more thicker and more healthier. I am a lover for thick hair yes! I washed my hair yesterday and I applied this leave-in conditioner, rollerset my hair, and let me tell you I WAS AMAZED at the results I got. My hair was so THICK, BIG, BOUNCY, &amp; BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to leave behind their thin hair and achieve thicker fuller hair.</li>
    <li> Bad Service, t[[ASIN:B000GG193K Nexxus Headress Thickening Leave-In Volumizer Conditioner, Packaging May Vary, 13.5-Ounce Bottle]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They dont have good packaging with items,my item arrived broken to miami office.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed, dont&#x27;t spend their money.</li>
    <li> I was expecting my hair to be  fuller, not greasy. I am kind of disappointed because of all the good reviews I saw on here. O&#x27;well lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I see that Nexxus changed the formula from the one previously called the \\&quot;weightless leave in\\&quot; conditioner. I was hesitant to buy anything that said \\&quot;Volumizing\\&quot; on it for my curly 4A ringlet hair, but this stuff rocks!  It is much better than the old formula.  My hair is shiny, even less frizzy, and gorgeous.  Go Nexxus!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that lacks volume, but this product has worked wonders! I run about a quarter sized amount through my hair before I blow dry and VOILA! Instant sexy hair! I would recommend this to anyone with fine, lifeless hair.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Makes my hair really soft. And I can tell it actually gives my very fine, straight hair some volume and body. Its especially helpful when I don&#x27;t have time to condition in the shower, or when I want to wear my hair down but I&#x27;m worried about it falling too flat. Love it.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been fine, hairspray just makes it wet unless I get one that does a fine mist for thin hair. I blow dry my hair almost everyday. For the last couple of years it has caused a big problem by giving me lots of breakage and splitends. Right after I used this product there was a big change. Odd thing for me to feel was my hair tucked behind my ear for the first time. It made it fuller right away and has stayed that way for the last two weeks with once daily use. I do not curl my hair so have no idea how it effects that. My hair is smoother with less frizzies and feels wonderful. The bottle came full with tape over the lid to keep it from leaking out. Hoping this product will help me grow my hair longer for the first time without it looking like a broken, dry mess. Bought it based on other reviewers. Thanks :)</li>
    <li> The Nexxus products have instantly renewed my hair.  It is so soft and supple, and it felt like straw before.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, lifeless hair so I tried using this. Did not do anything, really. If anything, seemed to make my hair more dry.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses this.  I bought it for her.  She has tried several other conditioners to calm her wavy, frizzy hair.  She says it has made her hair softer.  It&#x27;s a little lighter and less greasy.  She likes the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This seemed to be a knock-off on the original. It had an awful scent, whereas the original (I still had almost used up bottle of the original) had a pleasant scent. I wouldn&#x27;t put it on my hair, it smelled so bad, so I didn&#x27;t even try it. Also, more than twice the price just because it&#x27;s discontinued? Not worth it for that price, even if it had been the original. I got a refund fairly quickly after I returned it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Headress for about a month now, and I am very impressed. It leaves my hair very shiny, and it does not weigh it down like some of the other leave in conditioners I&#x27;ve tried. I have significantly fewer fly-away hairs than with other products too. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve never used leave-in conditioners before, so i have nothing to compare this one to. but here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;1. it&#x27;s not as softening as an in shower conditioner that you rinse off. when i try to run my fingers thru my long hair after putting it on, my fingers get all stuck and i pull a ton of hair out&lt;br /&gt;2. it&#x27;s not really that thickening or volumizing, but i&#x27;ve always used volumizing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;3. it smells hecka good</li>
    <li> I love this leave-in. It smells nice and leaves your hair extremely soft, but be warned that if you use it daily, your hair may be limp and too soft to hold a curl, but I wouldn&#x27;t change the formulation. So, I only apply it lightly 1 -2 times per week. This is the best leave-in that I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> * Nexus Diametress, well it looks like the original was better for volume and people loved it.  * I thought this shampoo had a medicine scent, I think i would only recommend the leave-in conditioner only  * The volume gel works fine, but did not like the waxy feel of the volume mousse  * Hope they bring back the original or a Green product with no parabens</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful  product and i  have used it for 10 year&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, I have a good amount but still very fine. I always have to use product to get any sort of volume. I have had this for about 2 weeks now and I use it every single day along with a root lifter by redken and my hair has a lot of natural looking body. It doesnt fall by the end of the day and it doesnt make my hair greasy or feel dirty. I use it maybe 1 or 2 days in a row before washing and the second day of wearing it my hair looks even more full. And its great that its only 15 dollars on amazon, I&#x27;m sure a product like this cost a bit more in stores. Thanks amazon!</li>
    <li> I just recently opened this bottle to begin using it.I squeezed a little out into my palm it came rushing out. It has the consistency of water. It&#x27;s as if whoever I bought this from actually loaded a nearly empty bottle of the product with tap water and then sold it to me. It smells like the right stuff but it is DEFINITELY NOT the product I have paid for. It&#x27;s been too long for me to get my money back but I will NEVER order from this dealer again and STRONGLY advise others to steer clear!!!</li>
    <li> My nearly 40 year old head of hair has been getting drier and coarser at the ends every year despite regular trims, expensive salon shampoos and conditioners,  and no chemical treatments.  I&#x27;ve tried a plethora of products and found a few that keep it tolerably attractive, but THIS is the first one that really took it all the way to silky.  It looks so very good now.</li>
    <li> This condioner is the best leave in I have tried. I used Infusium 23 for the longest time, but then saw reviews for this. It is very light but protects my hair when I blow dry it. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews about this product. Product nothing like the original I huge waste of my money and would never buy again.</li>
    <li> I FOUND IT!  new name is DIAMETRESS VOLUMIZING LEAVE IN CONDITIONING CREME&lt;br /&gt;Ulta... $21.99&lt;br /&gt;I kissed it when the package arrived.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> After styling with this product, my relaxed hair was left feeling and looking like satin. This product imparts a nice rich sheen. My hair feels soft and well moisturized from roots to ends, even after using a blow dryer and flat iron. But it doesn&#x27;t really thicken the hair. If looking for a serious hair thickener, you&#x27;ll need to look further. This product does add some body. It won&#x27;t make thin hair look thick, but it will give some body. I found what it really does...is leave the hair feeling and looking healthy and fortified.  The hair feels and looks stronger after using. It really conditions the hair.  It also smoothes and seal the hair shaft similar to the way those dimethicone hair polishers work, but without the greasy look and feel. I didn&#x27;t use with the recommended Nexxus Volumizing Shampoo.  That may improve thickening result. I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is about 6\\&quot; long and I used a quarter sized amount. The conditioner has the consistency of a loose gel. It is not watery like some Leave In conditioners. No sticky or tacky feeling residue was left on my hair. It&#x27;s not oil based, so there&#x27;s nothing in it to weigh the hair down. From the result I got with this product, I highly recommend for anyone that has relaxed hair, and for wrapped styles, this conditioner really seals the hair shaft. Your wrapped style will look marvelous.  I only know how it works on relaxed hair, but I think this product will benefit anyone with frizzy fragile hair. People with already healthy hair may find this product helps maintain their hair&#x27;s beauty. This conditioner is to be used for blow drying or drying naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the best Leave In conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used....and I&#x27;ve used a lot. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this product for many years.  He&#x27;s convinced that this product is part of the reason why he has such a healthy head of hair.  He applies it after his shower and a good towel dry of his hair.  Then, he thoroughly massages a small amount into his hair.  It tames any fly away hair and does volumize.  I have tried to get him to try other products but he keeps defaulting to this one.  It is impossible to find this at local retail stores so, it&#x27;s great that it is still available online.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my sister uses it, so I wanted to try on natural hair. It is very light weight and non-greasy. It made my hair soft and full.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I felt and saw a difference the first day I used it. My hair was much softer, my curls looked better and my hair did not feel greasy or heavy. It controlled the frizz pretty well too, although I do use a light weight gel in my hair also. Not sure how it&#x27;ll be once I decide to flat iron my hair. My shipment also arrived fairly quick.</li>
    <li> It works a lot better than its a 10. The its a 10 leave in made my hair 2 dry. This you can see after bout 2-3 uses it makes hair fuller, breakage stops. Makes you hopeful you can get your hair strong &amp; growing again.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GG193K Nexxus Headress Thickening Leave-In Volumizer Conditioner, Packaging May Vary, 13.5-Ounce Bottle]]  This product works really well. Leaves hair very natural looking and  does not weigh down hair. Leaves hair looking very healthy and it is so easy to style hair ,keeps fly aways at bay. My hair looks so much better. I t does not build up on hair and washes out nicely. Highly recommend .</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in hair product I have ever used.  I can&#x27;t do anything with my very fine and very thin hair without it.  I have used it everyday for many years and it at least doubles the volume and thickness of my hair.  It makes a tremendous difference and is not greasy and does not weigh your hair down more.  It also helps to hold in curl, as fine and thin hair will not hold curl.  Anyone with fine and/or thin hair will love this product, it is the best !  Unfortunately it is getting hard to find it in the stores so have had to order it online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years simply for the reason it does what it says it does.  I have fine limp hair and it works great for me.  I recommend it for myself and would tell anyone else to try it.  You may like it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Very high price, but an excellent product that is no longer made.  Came with damaged container that was leaking.  Called the senders and they discounted the product by 50%.  Rate good.</li>
    <li> After all the good reviews I read on here, I thought I&#x27;d buy this hoping that it would make my hair look thicker and give it volume.  It did neither of those things, and in fact, it seemed to make my hair frizzy and greasy.  I would not buy this again, that&#x27;s for sure.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Smells good, works all right and great price. We just use a little bit of it so this should last long.</li>
    <li> I have not tried many leave-in conditioner&#x27;s, but decided to try this one due to a coupon code I had that lowered the price. It&#x27;s great. I have quite long straight fine hair, &amp; my comb slipped right through after applying the conditioner much easier than when using a normal rinse-out conditioner. It saves time not having to rinse it out, too. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, so it&#x27;s hard to recommend this conditioner to everyone, but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I used a shampoo that had a built in conditioner,but my hair still seemed to be fly away. This provides great conditioner, but be careful not to over apply it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I have fine hair. This gives it body and eliminates static completely. I recommend!</li>
    <li> If you have thinning hair or if the weather causes your hair to go limp, this is the product for you. I noticed a huge difference in my hair after using this product and as long as I can help it, I&#x27;ll never run out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a number of years and originally got it from my barber.  The cost is right and I still like it. It is soft not &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.  May mark furniture after repeated seatings if you lean back-we use a cover.</li>
    <li> a vey effective hair  product.  i will order more in the future.  it is easy to use and apply.  thank you</li>
    <li> This conditioner will leave your hair looking fuller and has some of the same holding effects as gel, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for the root of the problem (in my case, thinning hair). The conditioner hardens in your hair after a half hour or so, and after a ruffle of the crinkled hair, my hair does look more full and the style holds as if gel was used,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on nights out, but don&#x27;t expect this shampoo to help with a thinning hairline long term.</li>
    <li> I hate using gels. But after my wife introduced me to this leave-in conditioner, this is all I use. I use this after every shower and it makes my hair feel soft and shapes it at the same time.</li>
    <li> Smell good and leave the hair with a good sensation. Nexxus products are simply the best and knows how to bring the glamour out of your hair.</li>
    <li> Why, oh why did they stop making this?  I can&#x27;t find anything comparable.  Boo.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for thin hair, Great price, great quality, fast service, Great service, arrived quickly,  Just love this stuff in my hair.</li>
    <li> the worst conditioner I have ever bought. It is like a water putting on your hair. It did neither of those things mentioned on the page.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old and started experience hair loss after using the wrong kind of shampoo. I was using a shampoo for THICK hair - the same one I&#x27;ve been using since I was 14 or so and actually had thick hair. Through the crazy whirlwind that is life, I didn&#x27;t really stop and look at my self image a little bit. Lamesauce, I know. But when I did, I realized I hadn&#x27;t been taking care of myself very well and that I could see through the front part of my head into my scalp! The thick head of hair that once was now beginning to be the hair barely hanging on in whiffs. Thank god I decided to hit up Amazon and read reviews of hair thickening products. I ordered the Biotin Shampoo and this. This duo is better than Butch and Sundance, Phineas and Ferb, Batman and Robin, PB and J, all combined. The shampoo controls the frizz and adds essential nutrients to ensure the health of your scalp while the conditioner is actually tested and found out to be the best thickening product in the world- the most increase in diameter for your hair follicle. Look it up. Seriously. It&#x27;s a combo you can&#x27;t beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS VERY CAREFULLY. Incredible result. I MEAN INCREDIBLE RESULTS. My hair is almost back to what it was when I was a 14 year old boy. Yeah. That&#x27;s not a statement I would have said looking at my hair last week. It&#x27;s been only a few days and right now you couldn&#x27;t even tell I was once balding. Thank you Nexxus. This product is magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best. Here&#x27;s to not going bald!</li>
    <li> Good price on a great product I have been using for years. I like the fact it is dual purpose, a leave in conditioner and styling cream that holds my hair in place, lightly but just enough...just a little dab will do ya and it lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> Works really well in conditioning hair, but has a bit of a chemical smell.  All in all, a good product.</li>
    <li> Received the wrong item.</li>
    <li> This product paired with Nexxus Vitatress Biotin Shampoo is a great combo for fine/thin hair.  Conditioner is light and leaves my hair full and soft.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market to thicken, smooth and control.  No competition.  My hair looks thin and lifeless without it.</li>
    <li> I have dry eye. The strictures against getting this product anywhere near one&#x27;s eyes were enough to make me throw it away. I&#x27;d rather have thinning hair than lose my eyesight.</li>
    <li> This was an especially good purchase for the price. Hard to find at the price I paid for it. Love the product, have been using it for years!</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner and I have been using it for years.  It makes my hair more manageable providing easier drying and styling.  I can use it after I shampoo by itself; but, my usual procedure is to shampoo and condition and after I get our of shower, I top it off with this leave in conditioner for additional fluff and styling management.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S NEXXUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My poor 85 year old hair has taken a beating in this midwest summer climate,drooping,&lt;br /&gt;tangling, breaking, taking refuge in my brush and/or comb.  However, after a shampoo&lt;br /&gt;4 days ago I followed directions on the label with \\&quot;we&#x27;ll see\\&quot; expectations.  WOW!&lt;br /&gt;I still have soft, shiny, abundant tress with weighty substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, of course! It&#x27;s Nexxus!</li>
    <li> If you have thin hair, this product does the trick alone with diametress shampoo....i apply and comb through then style!</li>
    <li> I panicked when I could no longer find this in the stores. I&#x27;ve used it for years. I have natural platinum blonde hair, and keeping it shiny is a challenge. This works like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used. I dread the day I run out and can no longer locate any.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nessus Headress for at least 8 years.  I am 68 years old with a full head of hair and really like the way it keeps my hair in place without the pasted down look.  My hair also feels nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve kept my hair very short for many years, now that I have let it grow out I needed a good leave in conditioner.  I used this product for many years, and find it still leaves my hair feeling thicker than other products, and helps hold my naturally curls all day.</li>
    <li> The product leaves my hair fuller, smoother, shinier which is great. Unfortunately it does not work at all as a detangler.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  I would and have happily paid $30-ish for it.  However, at $60-ish it is too expensive.  I will be seeking alternatives as it will likely be even more expensive next time.  It seems maybe this line has been discontinued and so the shorter the supply the higher the price.  It is great stuff but it&#x27;s not diamonds.</li>
    <li> I was looking gor it all over and im very happy that I found it</li>
    <li> This Nexxus Headress Thickening Leave-In Volumizer seems to work well and does make my thinning hair appear to be more thick than it is however I wish that it was not  white in color as it takes time to dry on damp hair (I do not blow dry). If it was clear, I would not have the odd hour or so waiting for it to dry. Otherwise it does the trick for me and has a nice scent. I also feel good replacing my sculpting gel which was probably not so good for my scalp and hair with this more healthier conditioning option.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair and after I used this conditioner, my hair feels thick and voluminous.  I have keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, and have had some thinning of my hair in the past few years.  This product protects my hair from damage in styling anb hair color, and it gives it a thicker look with more body.  It&#x27;s another Nexxus success story.</li>
