    <li> Beautiful color, but chapped and shriveled my lips immediately. I even put on the accompanying lip balm and the color still shrunk off my lip line. My lips were so damaged I couldn&#x27;t even wear another lip color.&lt;br /&gt;Based on other reviewers&#x27; notes, maybe I was send an old package :( Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I wish there were other colors to choose from.  Otherwise I am satisfied.</li>

    <li> I have used this for a number of years and will continue to do so.  It truly does last all day, doesn&#x27;t smear (even at the dentist) and lasts through meals.  I have told many people about it and they are just as happy with it.  It is the only long-lasting product that doesn&#x27;t chap my lips.</li>
    <li> Best lip color ever.  The only one that will actually stay on and do what it says it will do.  I don&#x27;t bother with any other products now.  For my busy schedule, this is the only one I can rely on.</li>
    <li> Item was as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product.  A little dryer  and lighter than expected.</li>
    <li> The color lasts all day. Usually if I wear lipstick it seems like it&#x27;s off within half an hour, so I like to use lip stain, and this is a good one. It&#x27;s a cute color - pretty much looks just as it does in the picture. I don&#x27;t always put the glossy stuff on, but it adds a nice touch when I do. The gloss does need to be reapplied throughout the day.</li>
    <li> My go to lip color. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I love this color and Outlast.</li>
    <li> Received product quickly!  Product was new, as stated, and was exact color I asked for; applied excellently and only the top coat needed reapplied.</li>
