<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It worked just like the one I received by an aesthetician but for less.  Just follow the directions.</li>
    <li> Used it on an old biking scar on my leg as test and it took 5 applications to feel any tingling and two weeks later it started to peel. However, I used on my face in a small area and it frosted well and peeled 4 days later and stopped after 6 days. I am happy with small results but will wait 6 weeks and do it again on entire face. Don&#x27;t use on legs unless using higher % .</li>
    <li> It was my first time using a peel and to my surprise this product had everything I needed as a beginner. If it is used as directed, gives great results. Not harsh like others I&#x27;ve seen (my friends do peels) and leaves your face feeling great! Being a woman of color we usually have to worry about discoloration, but as I stated earlier, if you follow the directions to the tee, you&#x27;ll have no problems with that issue either. Will definitely use this again</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this because of all the reviews but to my dismay I didn&#x27;t peel like everyone else did. This is my 1st chemical peel at home, I followed the instruction to the tee. I applied the solution 5x. I even had a basin of ice with baking soda and some water yo cool me off as the reviews mentioned it will be needed. After each application I felt tingling sensation for about 20-30 secs but never achieved frosting. My face only turned shiny. The following 2 days I started to see some peeling but nothing like the reviews. Perhaps my skin is that thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, I contacted Jessner&#x27;s customer service and they were prompt to answer my questions and gave me advice about skin care. I may try it again in the next month or two.</li>
    <li> The Jessner&#x27;s chemical peel kit is just what someone like me needs.  I have spent too much money and have been more than inconvenienced going in for glycolic peels, a \\&quot;Dermalon\\&quot; peel, a laser peel, even \\&quot;Thermage\\&quot; (in addition to botox) and this product far exceeds any results I have gotten in the past. Not only was it a very reasonable $30, I still have plenty left and I was able to do it in the privacy of my own home, at my leisure and not have to rush home and hide afterward. The only recommendation I have is if you try it BE SURE TO FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS and possibly plan on doing it on a vacation when you have about 1 week (wintertime is perfect) to stay home and let your skin heal and get back to normal. It is VERY EFFECTIVE. WHAT A TERRIFIC VALUE!!!!</li>
    <li> Still not seeing major results but I am not using it as regularly as I should. Really need to buy an application brush when you get this product. The cotton or gauze recommended for application really does not give a even application. Directions are easy to follow and everything other then the brush cums in the kit. really like this as a first time chemical peel.</li>
    <li> Great peel. I have done other peels in the past. Be careful. I did perform two layers with frosting. Yipes. It burned like hot tar and I neutralized with baking soda. Thank God I did. I looked awful for work for 4 days. Felt inclined to tell everyone what I had done versus I was in a grease fire... Looked plain scarey... Peeled pretty good by day 6 without major redness. Give yourself a week off or at home for multiple frosting layers....I used organic coconut oil, emu oil, fresh aloe leaves and tea tree during the healing process. Gets very tight espcially on neck, and around mouth. Be very very careful around your neck. The skin is much thinner.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I just did this peel weds and today is friday and my face looks like I got burned which I already expected.I have to say I like the peel.The reason I bought it was for acne that I could not get rid of I have very oily skin and heard jojoba oil helps regulate oil production so I started washing my face with 100 percent jojoba oil this broke me out bad it clogged my pores and I couldnt get rid of the acne since im not working right now, I dont have money to get it done by a professional.At first I was scared this would burn my face well it actually did but in a good way.Im just waiting for my face to peel.I did 3 layers because I have thick oily skin.This peel is no joke it works,It burns like a motha but if you have past experience with peels you should already know what your in for.So now I just have to wait for my monster face to peel.Ill keep you guys updated with the final results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been paying so much money the past 2 years getting this done and then I was like what, I can do this. The only way you can screw it up is if you pick it off your face and only a monkey would do that...so.  So,the only thing I would caution against is using it on anyone other than yourself. Because for about 8 days after the peel, you look like complete hell, your face is all brown and crusty because the acids are working to eat away at the 1st and 2nd layer of skin. If you use it on a friend, they will be calling you every 5 minutes threatening to sue you or kill you. It&#x27;s really scary, especially the 1st time you do it. But worry not because you really can&#x27;t screw this up. I had the most nastiest sun damage, and my pores were ooc, after I used this Jessner at home, my skin was like cream, after the 1st time. I have like 5 more to go. I don&#x27;t even have to use foundation anymore.  3 more suggestions- Get a fan brush for application, get a huge tube of neosporin and lastly, do not pick at your face or pull the peeling skin.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this item and was extremely satisfied!  I did not like the idea of using acid on her face to remove a few layers of skin!!</li>
    <li> I used the reviews from amazon to assist me in my choice to purchase so I hope this helps you too.&lt;br /&gt;I used this with two 5 min sessions total time 10 min and each day for four days my face looked worse but knowing it was taking off dead useless old skin was amazing. Use the Moisturizer included it works do not pick off and your old skin will begin to flake off like a snake!  But I tell you i felt beautiful and look forward to doing it again. It did take away old brown skin and smooth a little fine lines and at 45 I needed it!&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add my boss who has spent 300.00 on one did it for me was amazed at how good it worked. If you are to vain stay in otherwise who cares as long as you know it will look better after!</li>
    <li> Love your Jessner&#x27;s Peel !!! You don&#x27;t have to be a rocket scientist to use this product. It is easy to use. Clears up all the things everyone says it will. I will be ordering this and other products in the near future. Thanks to you for saving me hundreds of dollars by offering this awesome product!!!</li>
    <li> I was not that impressed with this product. I read that people had to take days off and not go in public because the skin flaking was so bad. I didn&#x27;t have hardly any flaking. I followed the directions that were provided with the kit. It did help some acne that I had on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do a second peel only this time follow some directions off you tube. I left the peel on for 3 hrs and washed with only water. I used only emu oil but only the day after I applied the peel. I had more skin flaking than the first time but again it was minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t know if it is truly medical/professional grade peel. The peel has helped my face some but not like most reported. I&#x27;m going to finish the 6 peel cycle out of this bottle but I won&#x27;t waste my time taking days off work to use this product.</li>
    <li> I liked the jessner peel, it definatly is helping my hyperpigmentation. Im doing a second peel and this time around i did three layers, its been two days and im waiting to peel.</li>
    <li> It made a small difference, It was only 30 bucks compared to going to the doc and paying 80 per peel, so yeah i would recommend it</li>
    <li> I have experienced one chemical peel in a spa setting.  I do not know what type of solution they used, but I had phenomenal results, with peeling starting the day after treatment and had 4 good peels throughout a week from the one treatment, meaning very moist skin peeling off in sheets.  This is the type of result I was seeking with the Jessner peel I purchased from Skin Obsession.  The first day I tried just one layer (5 minutes) and rinsed.  The next day my skin was absolutely normal looking (no redness, no dryness, etc), so I decided to try again with two layers (5 minutes each layer).  I now have some dry spots around my nose and some browning dots here and there, ultimately my skin is kind of dry.  This is very different from the professional peel where it was almost like healthy moist skin was peeling off every day for 4 days.      Perhaps I need a few more layers because my skin is tough?  I&#x27;m not sure, but my skin looked much better when it was peeling off in sheets leaving raw (for lack of a better word) skin from the in spa treatment.  Right now, it just feels dry and doesn&#x27;t look fresh.    Any advice?</li>
    <li> I have been getting peels for years and thought I&#x27;d try to do my own to save money. I followed the directions exactly!!! My once beautiful well taken care of skin is now scarred with little purple burn lines and a few little pits!!! I have an appointment with the dermatologist tomorrow. I&#x27;m sure it will take months and a bunch of working overtime to fix this mess. I am convinced that the testimonials here are mostly written by the owner of this product. I believe she should be paying for the damage she caused. I never burn...and usually don&#x27;t even peel..even with the last jessners I had. I left it on for just over a minute and my face was purple, burning, and peeled twice!!! I was so stupid. I am pissed at myself for being so gullible. Arghhhh!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Jessner peel, this was my first at-home peel. I have been paying $395 per laser peel at the derm office. This peel is great! I had deep exfoliation and it removed the sun spots that I had on my cheek. The peel is very easy and you can make the peel as deep as you want by applying more coats of the peel. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this peel.  I have really done significant research to find the best home peel.  My dermatologist told me about 6 months ago that I would benefit from a Jessner&#x27;s peel since it&#x27;s a medium depth peel. I had asked for her advice as in my early thirties, I&#x27;ve experienced mild adult acne, acne scarring, mid-size pores, and fine wrinkles.  However, all the local dermatologists including mine charged north of $100 per treatment.  It just wasn&#x27;t priority compared to other things until.... I found and decided on this product.     The price seemed almost too good to be true, but I thought I would give it a shot.  A years worth of applications for less than $30? What?? Well, I applied the peel. It took two layers to frost.  The first layer I already felt an immediate intense stinging sensation.  Boy was I surprised but pleased (as I have had a peel before and I know what it feels like when it works).  This was a little more intense then the lighter peels I&#x27;d tried before like glycolic peels at the derm&#x27;s office. By the second layer, I was literally tearing as the stinging sensation intensifed.  A handheld fan I had did relieve some of the discomfort and as time subsided over the 5 min so did the stinging.  Redness, brown and light surface scabbing, and peeling occured in the first few days until now. I&#x27;m on day 4.  I&#x27;m pleased so far.  The instructions were very thorough.  The kit is fabulous as it comes with a full size moisturizer and a trial size cleanser. A little goes a long way.  I will update soon, but I couldn&#x27;t wait to add my two cents.  Oh and by the way, I did prep by using prescribed tretinoin two weeks prior which may be why I reacted quickly and sensitively.    Highly recommend!!    Update:   It has now been about 2 weeks since my peel was complete.  The peeling lasted 8 days.  I really think the tretinoin treatment helped which is why the 8 day downtime was longer than average. Believe me this is not something you can get by in public without being noticed.  It took an additional 2 days for the dryness and flaking to subside.      However, I can definitely say that this process has tremendously improved the texture and condition of my face. I did have some deep acne scars that have lightened 50% and should disappear on the recommended peel frequency.  My pores appear much smaller and less noticeable especially under primer and foundation.  I still have the occasional zit, but the instructions are clear that this is normal. The difference is night and day.  Even my husband commented that my skin looks really good.  My makeup applies and appears very fluid and almost flawless.  Before this, my skin&#x27;s appearance was dull and therefore so was my foundation over it.  The value is amazing, as are the results, and I plan to continue treatment through the remainder of the year.</li>
    <li> I paid $200 for this same peel at the doctor&#x27;s office. I paid that twice before I realized I could do what they were doing. Not that hard. Though I have to admit I was still scared I&#x27;d fry my face and do irreversible damage. The first peel I did I only did one layer to be safe. Now that I have done two more with some strength I am very pleased! I almost have my acne scars gone from my bad acne when I was pregnant. Yay!</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this product. I had a Jessner peel done in january and paid $200.00 for it. I was some what pleased with the results, but not 100%, thats why i went searching for something else. I read all the reviews for this product and gave it a shot. I am 120% pleased with my results. I could not believe how much better this product worked that the salon treatment. I had horrible looking skin from years of tanning beds and hyper-pigmentation from pregnancy and everyone was always asking my why my skin was so discolored. I have been self conscious for years about my appearance. Now I only wear powder for makeup, no more concealer or foundation. The instructions were awesome, it was like a real person is sharing information with you and your not just reading some boring piece of paper. I followed the directions exactly and my peel came out perfect. I want to thank you for such a great product and i have already told people where to get the same product i did. I would share pictures on here of my results but i don&#x27;t see an upload for it. I am a customer for life. Thank you for my awesome results.</li>
    <li> Used this peel for the first time on different area of my body where there was hyperpigmentation. With some of the spots I notice a 60 to 75 percent lightening effect. I am so impressed. I used it on a few spots on my face and it burned a little and frosted some but I don&#x27;t see much of a change yet. Just slight redness. This was just the first time. I am curious to see the future results with this peel.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Have been to the spa for years and have paid an enormous amount of money.&lt;br /&gt;Doing it myself at home was a breeze.  My face didn&#x27;t frost - so be sure to follow the directions.  I tried four layers for my first time.  I&#x27;ve done four layers at the spa and knew my face could handle that.  But when I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;frost&amp;#34; I thought I should do another few layers - but nervous to &amp;#34;ruin&amp;#34; my face I quit!&lt;br /&gt;I peeled within two days and am glad I took it easy the first time.  I was finished peeling in 5 days.  The peel was similar to every peel I&#x27;ve had at a spa or medical office.  I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be as strong because it was over the counter. But it worked like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;During the treatment I used my hairdryer on a cool setting to take away any burning sensation - I would recommend that to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the directions and take it easy the first time to determine how your skin will respond.&lt;br /&gt;My face looks beautiful and others have asked where I ordered my peel.  Can&#x27;t wait to do my next one.</li>
    <li> I have not tried this product, however, I am an Esthetician and I would NOT recommend doing a jessner peel at home, it can be dangerous! As a licensed Esthetician, we are not even able to preform a Jessners Peel without a physician present! Be careful, you could do SERIOUS damage to your skin with improper use!  That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it one star, jessner peels are fantastic, just use with caution if your not trained</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL, I DID NOT FROST NOR PEEL AT ALL, PLEASE, PLEASE, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS..AMAZON SHOULD PROHIBIT THIS PRODUCT FROM SELLING...SHAME ON THE PERSON WHO IS SELLING THIS...HOW DARE YOU FOOL PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN THIS KIND OF ECONOMY!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tan skin that has been acquiring freckles for the past 10 years, I&#x27;m currently 33.  I used this and saw dramatic results.  There was no real fading of my tan, and while I&#x27;m sure it occurred it was not noticeable.  I would say that about 70% of my freckles were removed, the majority those left were on and around the nose.  My advice to folks that use this would be to apply an additional layer around the nose area as it tends to withstand this peel much better than the rest of the face.  It&#x27;s very difficult to take time away from work and friends to apply this as the amount of downtime needed is 8-9 days, which means you really need to make plans to stay in the entire time.  As a male you can&#x27;t exactly apply makeup, so you&#x27;re just stuck with the noticeable peeling and trust me it&#x27;s brutal.  You should not be going out in public during this process, there is no hiding it.  But when you&#x27;re done it&#x27;s well worth it.  I&#x27;m already trying to figure out when I can get another one in to resolve the rest of my freckles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a buy, without question.  The instructions say not to pick at the peel and I&#x27;m telling you now, don&#x27;t do it.  I picked at one small area to rush the process so I could go and grab beers and just like picking at an unhealed scab it does leave a mark, a darker tanned mark than the rest of the skin.  Commit yourself and just leave it, or you&#x27;ll be like me, waiting the 6-8 weeks before you have a chance to apply the peel again in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best.</li>
    <li> I have been getting $100.00 chemical peels at the dermatologist several times a year. This peel gave me better results and I loved the exfoliating crystals that the seller sent as a sample. I would love to buy some of those! I am doing my peels at home from now on. Seriously if you can wash your own face and run a peice of gauze over it and use a fan you can do this peel. Make sure to follow the instructions exactly and I would do a patch test first if you have never had a peel before. So I was paying $600.00 a year for 6 chemical peels and this bottle for $27.99 has enough for 6 peels if not more. That is a savings of $572.04 a year!!!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try out this product but I was not impressed. The \\&quot;instruction\\&quot; manual is very confusing, the \\&quot;moisturizing cream\\&quot; is a very low grade cream that does not penetrate through the skin. After the peel your skin is very dry and the cream provided does not help at all! Its very cheap. The peel did nothing it says it will do, it only gave me rough nasty skin for about a week. I will never buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have used this peel two times now.  It is important to follow instructions as written.  Very good product.  I shall order it again!  It&#x27;s much less expensive that a trip to a professional&#x27;s office for treatment.  It helped to clear my acne and helped to dry my skin some.  Good for oily skin.</li>
    <li> Easy to follow directions, great results. However must warn you it does burn the 1st time around.&lt;br /&gt;I had large pores and deep lines on the forehead and frown area. I used the product 2x in one month. No more deep lines and pores are 90% smaller.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait and see my results before rating. First, I followed the directions EXACTLY. That is very important to note with this product as it&#x27;s very strong. I applied only 2 layers since it&#x27;s my first Jessner Peel. After about 2 days, my skin became very leathery and crusty looking and then began to peel off in sheets. (You cannot do ANYTHING to pull or crack the skin at this stage! It must fall off on its own!) This heavy peeling only happened in a couple of places (on my chin and around my nose). On my forehead and cheeks, the skin was sort of flaking off rather than peeling.&lt;br /&gt;It has been 2 weeks now since my peel and my skin is looking better and better every day. After my first peel, I am noticing smaller, tighter pores-more even skin tone-smoother texture to my skin and some of the fine lines are diminished.&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this peel. I can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s time for my next peel. So as not to damage your skin, you have to wait 4-6 weeks in between peels which will be the only hard part for me. I&#x27;m so excited about the results, i&#x27;m ready to do another one already. I don&#x27;t want to be a cautionary tale though, so I guess i&#x27;ll wait.</li>
    <li> Okay I just recieved my Jessners peel kit yesterday and decided to try it today, but after a minute my face was on fire and had to remove since I have never had a peel before . I was scared of my end results....But after just one layer and 1 minute my skin is much shinier and healthy looking, next time will try for 3 minutes .. Highly recommended .  I was a weiney , I know:)</li>
    <li> I have done three so far and gave two to a friend. I think I have at least four left. Just make sure you tightly close the bottle.</li>
    <li> Ok, it won&#x27;t exactly give you baby skin, but after one application to my arms and forehead I can see more of a difference than years of expensive products prescribed by my dermatologist - even though some of the acne meds were covered under my FSA.  The point is the Jessner peel has given me faster noticeable results in 2 weeks than I ever had with my old routine.  I used the products in the kit to cleanse my skin and applied 2 successive coats to my forehead and arms before they frosted.  I did have standing by and used a cool solution of baking soda and water to help rinse off the peel.  This was not necessary, but I will always have this prepared before I do a peel because better safe than sorry.  It took more than a week to see the peeling start - it&#x27;s more like a slight erosion than a huge peeling.  There is still peeling on my arms.  I can clearly see the line of demarcation between newly peeled skin and long term &amp; recent sun damage.  My plan is to use this peel every 3 weeks to get to the condition I want and then every 4-6 weeks for maintenance.  This is much better than the daily lotions my derm had me on that didn&#x27;t work.  I think he was too afraid to try anything stronger on my deep African American skin tone.  Permanent damage is always an issue when dealing with these types of products.  If you don&#x27;t use retin a or a glycolic product I suggest you do this for 4-8 weeks to see how your skin responds before trying the Jessner or any other professional peel.  After decades of using prescription and over the counter retin A &amp; glycolic products I had to face facts it was not going to give me the results I wanted. I kept thinking it was my inability to keep to a routine that caused the poor results. So I tried the Jessner peel and am ecstatic with the results so far.  Keep the skin clean &amp; moisturized after the peel.  There are detailed instructions in the kit.  Follow them.  I also tried at home \\&quot;pro\\&quot; glycolic acid peel and the salicylic acid peels - they give slightly different results and I am less confident about how to use them.  Will stick with the Jessner&#x27;s kit with its detailed instructions, moisturizer and cleanser.  It also came with a sample \\&quot;polishing\\&quot; crystals.  Have not used them yet on the areas I put the peel, but the crystals feel good and not like they are tearing at my skin.  Will wait one more week before using them on my peeled areas.  Will update you at that time.</li>
    <li> I did alot of research as far as what type  and strength chemical peel to use on African-American skin. I wanted to use the peel mainly to even out my skin tone remove dark spot from acne. I followed the directions and only did it for 2 layers(2 applications) I noticed the frosting and the burning with a minute or two but I used a neutrilizer(not included) then put on the moursirizer. After a few days I noticed that the old dead skin started to turn dark, which the instructions said it would happen. I am now in the peeling phase. And I see the changes. I will do another peel in about 4-5 weeks for 3 layers and hopefully i will see more serious changes. I do reccommmend this peel but you will have to buy an applicator brush and a neutrilizer seperately.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying a Jessner peel.  Once my skin healed from the peeling, I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the texture or tone of my skin.  In fact my skin looked rougher than it was before I applied the peel.  I also have a burn on the apple of my left cheek, which is slowly going away. It just didn&#x27;t work or me.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I just wish I would have purchased the stronger dose. Next time I will purchase the stronger of the bunch!</li>
    <li> Love this! Works great and is affordable. I love that I don&#x27;t have to go to an expensive spa to have good treatments. Comes with detailed instructions so that you wont screw it up.</li>
    <li> I have now tried this product twice with no results. The first time, (due to never having done a peel before I only put on two layers hoping they would frost.). The first time I had &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; frosting in between my eyebrows and it stung my face so I did not put on an additional layer. Five days past and nothing happened.. I waited a few months and tried it again this time I put on five layers waiting each time 3-5 Minutes to try and give it time to frost. Again I waited five days and my skin looked no different and did not &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;. The lotion is a nice thick lotion, so for that I will give it two stars..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I get the same peel as going to the spa but I do peel and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I am a fair-skinned women, late thirties, with hyperpigmentation on the cheeks and post-acne marks on the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years ago I had a Jessner&#x27;s Peel done professionally, and was left with soft, glowing skin, and so I looked online and found this peel by Skin Obsession.  I can honestly say that this at-home peel gave me the exact same results as I got professionally, just at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wiped my face with alcohol to remove excess oil, let the alcohol dry, and then applied a layer of jessner&#x27;s solution all over my face.  I frosted in less than a minute.  I washed my face with cool water after just two minutes and my face was bright red, which is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was red on day 2 and started to peel on day 3.  My chin peeled first, and my cheeks didn&#x27;t peel until day five. Maybe because my forehead is super oily, it didn&#x27;t start to peel until day 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the results I have gotten, and want to do another peel this summer to remove some of the more stubborn spots on my cheeks.</li>
    <li> I regret to buy this product is not works for me when I use it, all my face dark and I breakout. I will never introduce to anybody.</li>
    <li> I used entire bottle on my chest area for sun damage skin, followed directions and it did NOTHING. I emailed company and was just told that everyone has different skin. If it was as strong as it says, it would have done a little something, my skin is sensitive and this stuff didn&#x27;t even make my skin turn red.</li>
    <li> Awesome at home peel. My dermatologist told me to keep using it. It&#x27;s gentle enough for 1-2 x month use, but is truly effective</li>
    <li> it is not a dramatic improvement in my skin but definately smoothed it out some. I was nervous to use it at first but the experience was rough but worth it in the end. I get compliments on my skin all the time. this product helped. Of course I drink lots of water and eat tons of vedgatables. Nothing is magical but it is definately a big and fast result help!!</li>
    <li> I love chemical peels, they keep my skin clear, blemish free, and smooth. Be warned if you are not experience with chemical peels this may not be for you. Use with caution, you can burn and damage the skin and cause hyper pigmentation especially if you are olive or darker skinned. But if your a skin care pro. It&#x27;s worth your time and money. Downtime was minimal being that I only used two layers. It just looks like a bad sun burn that&#x27;s peeling so you can go to work, etc. Stay out of the gym while it heals because sweat will irritate it.</li>
    <li> A complete failure...caused a severe acne/rash on my face..would not recommend this product to anyone..buyer be ware..get it done professionally</li>
    <li> This was my first peel kit so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others. Seems to work decently so far. I think I&#x27;d have to do more than two applications to see significant results. I had a lot of redness in first few minutes of using but that faded. Follow the directions and you will be fine.</li>
    <li> Absolutely did not work for me!! Product looks and feel extremely cheap! I wish I can return this product but I honestly do not want to go through all the process of returning and dealing with the handler!! Do not waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> When using this product, be prepared to spend at least 3/4 days in the house. It will make you look like a badly burnt monster.... after the skin peels and heals. No doubt your skin is gorgeous. That is coming from an African-American with acne and hyperpigmentation.</li>
    <li> Great vesatile product does as it says. Clears skin and gives you a salon treatment at home. no down time if you use as weekly light exfolliator.  Adjustable to level by time. Great Kit most happy with results skin is dewy and has that glow of good care rosey complection.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work but willing to give it a try.  Over the moon pleased.</li>
    <li> I am a 30 something with a few fine lines, some brown pigmentation and red acne scarring. I applied three layers to my face, neck and hands.  No frosting.  No improvement. Only thing this junk, I mean peel, did was dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a true professional strength peel.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  My skin looked amazing (and I received compliments) when I used Peter Thomas Roth Anti-wrinkle peel pads &amp; Glytone&#x27;s glycolic acid creme.  I&#x27;m going back to using those and won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This product helped my acne, but was not spectacular. My acne returned shortly after.  My face returned to oily after a week.  I think my face would have been worse without the peel, but it didnt work as well as I wanted it to.</li>
    <li> This is a decent peel but it was my first and I consider it a light peel for my skin.  I did peel slowly over a period of time but not as deep as I thought it would be. The second time I used it the peel actually quit burning after several applications before I neutralized it...I am peeling somewhat now and it is helping my skins appearance.  I will use the tca peel next time.  I can see how this peel would be excellent for acne breakouts and enlarged pores.</li>
    <li> I used this product yesterday following the directions.  nothing happen i applied 3 times. no frosting, no peeling, no redness, no burning, nothing.</li>
    <li> Well despite my skepticism I purchased this product. My skin was dry dull, sunspots and large pores, acne scars, I am very impatient and thought the peel was not working. I was pleasantly surprised, a week later I have soft skin, over a 60 percent reduction in pore size and pimples are gone. Acne scars aren&#x27;t all gone but I only did a three layer peel. You can&#x27;t lose you get a whole lot for a small price and it it actually works. Thank you skin obsession.  Also I received the product a lot quicker than estimated</li>
    <li> Ut us stated that that you should test you skin before using it because of the hyperpigmentation of african amercians. I am glad that i did because i tried to spots and it severly lightened my skin but not the blemish. It looks more like i got burned and the scab is just falling off. Well, atlease it did not take too long. I started this week and the scab has already fallen off. So i know it works just not those with pigmentation in skin. it is noted and i am glad i read the instructions.</li>
    <li> Awesome! It really helped my skin a lot!! Anyone wanting to try something that WORKS, use this! It really works.</li>
    <li> Did not exfoliate as deeply as I would have hoped but ok. I work for a dermatology practice and one of the girls said you have to build up a tolerance so will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this peel after reading about it in a salon. I&#x27;ve gone through the PCA peels so know about the frosting, etc...  I just did the peel tonight and I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin in a few days! I frosted after about 2-2.5 applications with mild stinging.   The seller is very professional with exact instructions and the \\&quot;kit\\&quot; is a deal! I&#x27;ll be referring my friends to this product!  I&#x27;m sure I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> i did this peel 4 days ago for my first time, it frosted over, burned a bit but not to bad.&gt;&gt; im on day 4 and have had no change to my skin yet so im curious to see if it will work or not. my skin is dry but nothing more, feels fine with moisturizer on. Gave this peel 3 stars because i still don&#x27;t know if it will work or if my skin just peels slower then most.. ill post again if it works.   the moisturizer is way to greasy, makes me feel like i put oil all over my face and was making me break out so i stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Used my product for a long time. Definitely minimized my pores. Peeling part sucks when you need to go out but product definitely did the job</li>
    <li> Was so easy to do this myself and saved a $100.  Just follow the instructions that come with the product.</li>
    <li> It works just as described.  It&#x27;s more affordable than going to get a chemical peel at a dermatologist.  It takes longer to get the full peel than when you go to a professional, but it works the same way.</li>
    <li> works pretty good i like it. will be buying again. this stuff really works the way i wanted it to. thanks</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the product for the price, my skin looks much better! Looking forward to doing a second peel in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money. I did 4-5 application but my face didnt peel at all. I gave it a try again after 2months following all the instructions, but still&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;It just mAde my face dry and looked 20years older. I am so disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have been getting peels for about a year. I pay about $35-40 per month. I decided to try it myself. A great savings in money and time from trying to get an appointment. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how many thousands of dollars I&#x27;ve spent getting jessner peels from my Estetichian over the years.  This peel worked equally as well if not better!  I&#x27;m thrilled with how flawless my skin looks.  I definitely recommend it for people who have prior experience with medium depth peels.  I wouldn&#x27;t try this at home as a first timer.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using chemical peel so putting this kind of stuff on my face skin was a too scary specially when I started to feel the stinging sensation. :-)  Men, was I nervous!  But then it went away after 3 minutes of each first layer. I just did 2 layers like the instruction said.  I only had 2 frost spots, my regret because each time I run the guage on my face, I ran it really quickly. I should have watch youtube videos before starting so I will get the idea.  By running the guage too quickly (I am not saying to be slow, either), you will only get red spots and so I just got a very minimal peeling.  Even with the minimal peeling I still see results.... pores and black heads became less visible, skin became brighter and even tone. I said WOW!  I cannot wait to do my 2nd time (ladies, that is 3 weeks from now... did I say I cannot wait? LOL)  I am just glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> My skin was very sensitive to this product.  The chemical is too harsh making my skin more prone to breakouts.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Jessner&#x27;s Peel kit. I loved it! It does exactly what is expected from a professional peel. I used to work in the skin care industry as an Esthetician for about 10 years. This is what I used to use on my clients, but at a much better price.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions. Expect a little discomfort. I would recommend a test patch. My skin was sensitive for a few hours, just like other people a said in their reviews. Then tight for a few days. Then turned brown and splotchy for several days. Then peeled for several days. All as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the face wash and moisturizer in this little kit. It takes very little of the face wash (pearl size in palm, rub hands together with a drop of water, wash gently) It helped to put the moisturizer on before it completely dried and got tight. And since I have such dry skin right now due to being 52 and menopausal, I added a drop of Jojoba oil to my palm, along with the moisturizer and gently pressed it into my skin at night for extra moisture while I slept.&lt;br /&gt;The results are amazing! I wish I had taken a before picture! But next peel I will take one before and after. I am sure there will be further improvement in my skin. The age spots I had before are incredibly improved with only one treatment!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a chemical peel, and I purchased it to even out the texture of my skin because of acne scarring. I applied 1 layer over the whole face and 3 layers in areas where I needed more smoothing. It did burn, but not terribly and neutralized with just water. I peeled for about 7 days and it really wasn&#x27;t that difficult to cover with mineral makeup. My skin is smooth and my scarring is much less noticeable. With a few treatments, and you can get several out of this kit, I should have some pretty dramatic results. I read several reviews before deciding which product to use, because I have deep scarring I wanted something that would give me good results, but I also wanted a product that helped treat break outs and didn&#x27;t have extremely toxic chemicals such as the deep TCA peels. This product was perfect, it peeled deep enough and it was nice I could layer to get a more dramatic result. It was gentle enough for my sensitive skin but strong enough to do what I wanted. Also, the package arrived earlier than I had expected and came with a sample of Skin Obsession microdermabrasion crystals...which I used to finish my peel. Overall, amazing product and I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants to help clear acne (honestly, this worked better for me that accutane), who might have sensitive skin and is prone to breaking out with harsher products, who wants to fade the appearance of scarring ( I had deep scarring and this really diminished their appearance), and who wants smooth fresh skin. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my face. I had such high hopes for this product and it failed me. It barley peeled my face, I&#x27;m willing to try it one more time but I&#x27;m absolutely positive this product is crap.&lt;br /&gt;African American female with dark acne scarring.</li>
    <li> I have now done 3 of these peels and absolutely love the product and result. It only took one kit to do all three, and that is a fantastic deal, given the savings compared to an office peel. Having done many of those, I cannot see the difference in the two, so I&#x27;m sticking with this one. I am knocking on the door reading \\&quot;60\\&quot; but I am pegged at 30-32 all the time. Proper skin care matters and I started early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hubby is just two years older than me. While in line at a video store, a young boy turned to me, looked at Mac, and said to me, \\&quot;Is that your dad?\\&quot; Yep, I get to tease hubby about that a lot! Kids... they just say it how it is for them.</li>
    <li> I applied this product correctly, and its been 5 days and I have not peeled or seen any difference. I have done this peel before with a different product and I did peel on the 4th day. I do not recommend this brand. Its definitley not strong at all. I amm 33 years old and I do have a couple age spots I was trying to get rid of. I guess I have to try a stronger peel.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my husband but it burned his skin. Good I got the lowest grade. I tried it and it never worked either. Burned my skin. Our skin darkened and no peeling took place.</li>
    <li> Ok so I just did this peel 2 days ago and now I am on my third day...First off I think I got a bad batch because I had to reapply this stuff to my skin the 2nd day because I didnt get any leathery brown patches my skin looked like it did when I first applied the peel(normal soft skin with no sighns of putting a chemical peel on my face)..and I did four layers of this stuff like I usually do when using this product.I have been doing the Jessner peel for two years now and have ordered from this company on and off) it was very scary for me to have to apply this product to my face twice in one week back to back but I can say my results are turning out perfect!!! my skin has finally browned/crusted and leathered up nicely..My pores are 95% smaller, my skin is glowing and now I am waiting patiently for the peeling process....because I have used this peel before I would recommend this product, it&#x27;s just that this is my first time not seeing results after applying the peel the first day..I was dissapointed that I had to reapply the peel on the second day going on the third day(I reapplied my peel 2nd day late evening time because I knew the third day I would not have the crusting/brown leathery skin)...But now that I applied four more layers of this product(which in total I did eight layers,,Ya very scary) I see results. I guess for the first time I recieved a bad batch or something but after doing two peels in two days eight layers in total.....I like the way my skin is looking so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 26 year old female with fair (yet recently plagued by lovely hormonal cystic acne) skin. Accustomed to 20% salicyclic acid peels, I jumped right into the jessner&#x27;s peel with little hesitation. I peeled pretty heavily for a week post peel, but nothing that moisturizer couldn&#x27;t handle. Easily went to work without anyone noticing. I&#x27;m now about 3 weeks post my first jessner peel, and I have to say that I&#x27;m truly thrilled. My hyper pigmentation isn&#x27;t gone, but my skin looks so much SMOOTHER with makeup than pre-peel. Cannot wait for the next peel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in doubt, as I was, you literally have nothing to lose. Well worth a try. Hopefully you&#x27;ll have awesome results too.</li>
    <li> I rated this only 2 because it doesn&#x27;t say what type of chemical peel t s. I thought it was glycolic acid. I like to know what I a using. Whats the secret?</li>
    <li> It probably works wonders for most people, but I probably fall into the small category where it doesn&#x27;t do well and gives me post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. I should&#x27;ve known, my skin just loves to pigment at the slightest bit of trauma. So this definitely had a field day by giving me even more dark marks. My face looked like a planet with continents and oceans, that&#x27;s how weird and uneven my skin stone ended up being. Maybe it was too strong, but I won&#x27;t be doing any chemical peels again, unless of course it&#x27;s a professional whoe knows what their doing, which is what everyone should do when it comes to this stuff anyway.</li>
    <li> I like this product line and the prices as well. Very well packaged,quick shipment,excellent results! Well worth every cent!!! Plus some!!! &#x3D;D happy customer!!!</li>
    <li> did my research.  decided I could do this and handle it (being the a whole week of &amp;#34;UGLY&amp;#34;).  very pleased that the product arrived so quickly...didn&#x27;t give me time to change my mind.  now, keep in mind, I am 41 yrs. and people have been telling me always that I have great skin...very fair, I wore sunblock ALWAYS, even as a child, so no freckles, small pores, maybe 3 tiny beginning wrinkles...which was one of the reasons I thought of to take this step, the other being that my skin, no matter how wonderful my skin regimen was, just didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; like it used to.  so here I go...first I brought in the industrial &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; fan for carpentry work out of the garage and turned it on high.  blew my mail all over the house...good, i&#x27;ll have a project to keep me busy while I turn crusty for seven days...wonder if my dog will know who I am during this...better bribe her with lots of cookies so someone will love me.  I clean face, so the alcohol thing...o.k. , here it goes........&amp;#34;OWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&amp;#34;.  now I know what how my rib eye steak feels in that frying pan.  run to industrial fan...it blows me against a wall...I don&#x27;t care because i&#x27;m staying here forever.  it still hurts but at least I won&#x27;t cry here.  15 min. goes by, i&#x27;m a wimp.  I now know I lied to myself...high pain thresh hold my ass...this really hurts!  eventually go to mirror. yep, I frosted.  good because i&#x27;m not doing that ever anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;spend 8 days alone with emu lube on face...peeling...i&#x27;m peeling...ALOT.  the dog is now obese but loves me so much because that was a major cookie binge on her part.  I ate one cookie...too depressed to eat, too ugly to eat, too &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34;  (that was the worst, truly).  I wanted so very badly to scratch my face off, even in my dreams would dream of how itchy my face was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in the end, I came away with a fresher, brighter, slightly more youthful look. beginning of those wrinkles gone.  do this again?  maybe years on down the road, but unless you truly have a &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; that really needs to be addressed, consider looking into a great skin care regimen early on to avoid having to do this in the first place, or be ready for a very character-building week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALWAYS WEAR SUN PROTECTION so you don&#x27;t have to go through this as often, if at all...and remember to love your pet, you are gonna need all the love you can get for that week.  good luck!  ( wash your pillow, it&#x27;s full of emu oil) smile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars, but my lack of experience with it means my overall experience is a 4- but that is for user error/caution and not because the product isn&#x27;t awesome. So I have never done a peel before, at home or in an office, so I did 1 coat, waited 5 minutes, then a second coat and waited 4ish minutes. I did not get much frosting at all, and now that I am done peeling (5/6 days total), I realized I should have done another coat or two to get a proper frost, but I am glad I didn&#x27;t go too far without knowing how my skin would react. It burns, makes your eyes and nose water and you don&#x27;t want to leave the fan, but its all worth it. I suffer from cystic acne and scarring, so I don&#x27;t think the peeling was all that bad in comparison to how much I already try to hide and cover. I did the peel on a Thursday night, it started to peel on Saturday and Sunday, my skin looked terrible. Monday wasn&#x27;t so bad if I didn&#x27;t really use foundation- that seemed to accentuate the peeling, but I am used to having to cover up cystic acne so this wasn&#x27;t terrible. I didnt really want to go out too much in public, but it wasnt a huge deal. And by Thursday that week, my face was all good. I did start using my clarisonic brush Tuesday night. My big mistake, I think, was I used Nude progenius oil on my face all day Saturday and Sunday, and I think that made three huge cystic bumps come up. I would have been better just using the light lotion that came with the kit. My coworker that pays a ton at the plastic surgeons office for the same kind of people said she was told not to over moisturizer as it restricts your peeling, and you want it to peel. Also, I think I would do the peel Thursday morning so the skin starts peeling around when I get off work Friday, with the worst peel days being Saturday and Sunday, and then back to work the next week without too much hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the fan brush, and I just put clumps of straight baking soda on my face to neutralize when I rinsed off. Also, when doing all my prep, I didn&#x27;t think cold water sounded good because it was cold in my house, but you want to rinse with cool/cold water. Believe me! Also, I did set a time for each 5 minutes to ensure I did it for the correct time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will repeat again with additional coats until I get a good frost and I think my skin will then be almost free of my acne scars and discoloration.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing buy and product. I had my worries as I have always done the peel through a professional spa but I could not keep up with the high cost. The first time I tried Jessner&#x27;s I did two coats and rinsed in between because I was so worried about it burning my face. *One thing no one mentions is the fact that it has the most intense burning sensation. I thought that I would not see results due to the lightness of the peel that I did but to my surprise I had amazing results. I almost have no pores in the area I treated.</li>
    <li> Product does set your face on fire, but it works well.  I will buy and use product again.  Will have a bigger fan to cool my skin while product is working.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my skin! I prefer vi peel!</li>
    <li> Product works very well does not irritate my skin I can see a difference.</li>
    <li> Whoo!&lt;br /&gt;They weren&#x27;t kidding when they said this stuff was powerful!!&lt;br /&gt;I had a week off and used this on a Friday - which was good because I wasn&#x27;t fit to be seen for about a week!&lt;br /&gt;Stung like the dickens so be prepared with a magazine to fan your face which really did help.&lt;br /&gt;My skin immediately turned red - looked like a terrible sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;My face got tighter and tighter over the next couple of days until it started peeling off in sheets!&lt;br /&gt;Impressive!&lt;br /&gt;I had quite a bit of sun damage, uneven texture, hyper-pigmented spots.&lt;br /&gt;I do think this treatment helped.  My skin texture/coloration isn&#x27;t perfect, but I definitely think it is improved after only one treatment.&lt;br /&gt;No doubt about it, you will not be fit to be seen by other than family for about a week - you will be red and peeling and generally incredibly unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it works!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an at-home peel that does what it says it will do - look no further.  This is the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;And, the post-peel wash and creme were wonderful bonuses.  Very nice and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 3 days since I&#x27;ve used the peel I tried it on others part of my boby just to check the effects before to do the facial peeling&lt;br /&gt;Nothing yet I might have to do another application</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of Skin Obsession&#x27;s products before, so I know that their products are good, which is why I&#x27;m giving this a 3-star review instead of a poor one.  I really didn&#x27;t have the reaction I thought I would have from this.  Yes, it stung like crazy (as it should- it&#x27;s a peel, not a massage).  I followed all of the directions exactly, but only had mild flaking at around day three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m an experienced peeler and have been using TCA peels for quite a while.  Unfortunately, I thought the Jessner&#x27;s peel was a stronger peel than the 20% TCA peel that I had been doing.  It&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like that Skin Obsession included the cleanser and moisturizer with the peel (and the moisturizer really is a great post-peel lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you have not been doing peels consistently (or have only been using light peels), then the Jessner&#x27;s peel may be just what you&#x27;re looking for.  However, if you&#x27;re like me and are looking for something stronger than a TCA peel, then keep looking.  You just aren&#x27;t going to get much from this. (By the way, the company itself really is a great one, and this is the fourth or fifth product I&#x27;ve bought from them, so this review in no way reflects on the quality of their products).</li>
    <li> Really like this. Was afraid at first but so glad I tried it! Only this peel made my skin (finally!) look youthful. Definitely recommend trying a patch (best on side of face/temporal area) first, so you’re not surprised by what happens, and by using small patch you can cover with hair/bangs during test. For what to expect: my skin reacted close to what they put in the instructions. Immediately red with some discomfort, then within a couple hours the real redness fades and looks more just like you’re a little flushed or in the sun a bit. This is how my skin looks for about 30 hours, and is actually possible to be in public/ not have down-time. Then by the end of day 2 starts looking more leathery, not really able to cover with make-up. Day 3 the scaling starts and since you can’t pick at it, is really noticeable. Day 4 the worst, with lots of scaling/leathery appearance of skin, and def will be noticed at work. After day 4 they say you can use warm washcloth to help sseparate the scale separate from skin, which I definitely recommend. Otherwise, it could stay another couple days. However, warning: one part of my skin I tried to remove with washcloth before the 4 days were up and it was red, not as ‘nicely-done’ as the rest of skin. Definitely recommend to wait the 4 days before using warm washcloth to help remove. If you’re trying to do this without much of a ‘vacation’ etc, would recommend doing Wed night, or Thurs morning, then you should be able to have it all done by Monday morning (with the worst-looking days on Saturday and Sunday). Everyone’s skin reacts a little differently though, so this is just based on my experience with my skin, which seemed to coincide with what they say to expect on the instructions. Follow the instructions exactly. Do a small test patch first so you know what to expect and won’t be afraid. Good luck and enjoy your awesome new younger-looking skin!</li>
    <li> The packaging is very simple and instructions are very easy to follow.  Make sure you do a test area first as instructed.  It burns alot, but is worth it in the long run.  It took me only one layer to frost and helped my scars after first use.  I have to wait a few weeks to do it again.  Will be buying this product again!!! Great price also!!!</li>
    <li> Recently started being interested in skin care and specifically the benefits of AHAs and BHAs and wanted to share with my sister as a present. Saw a recommendation for Jessner&#x27;s peels working really well at exfoliating so I bought it for her. She was skeptical as a previous peel solution had burned. I kept insisting that it works really well based on reviews.... after all I needed her to be my guinea pig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She put it on. It burned. She teared. Face peeled. &amp;#34;Never again&amp;#34; was mentioned. It exfoliated somewhere between microbead facewash and potato peeler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful stuff, would buy again. Thanks /r/skincareaddiction</li>
    <li> Loved this! So excited that i&#x27;ll be able to do peels at home now, when I was spending $150/treatment before, and getting them done every 8 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was definitely skeptical at first, but truly, if you can apply toner, and follow simple instructions, you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest everyone do a little research and watch some applications on Youtube before trying.</li>
    <li> My skin is smooth and more even toned. My sun spots are almost gone, will be doing three layers again in 6 weeks, I&#x27;m sure this will erase them.  It did take 7 days to completely peel and then heal. I super duper happy with the results and with continued use will stay young forever! ;-)</li>
    <li> BLOODY painful! works just as described and does a good job but do not use it if you need to be in public any time in the following week, you will look like the lizard man until it heals and flakes off.  I was not impressed by the moisturizer though</li>
    <li> Great!! Used as a combo peel with their TCA peel.  LOVE  Skin Obesession, their products perform as described and provided EXCELLENT results-will use again.</li>
    <li> I am a retired esthetician and I have been using this once a week.  If you have never used a peel kit, don&#x27;t be afraid.  It doesn&#x27;t do any harm to your skin.  You look better instantly, and the more you use it (weekly) the better your skin looks)</li>
    <li> I love this product. However, what I recommend for added caution, drink 5oz of water every hour for 8 hours to ensure hydration. I used one layer. I felt the sting after a couple of seconds. Removed it after 8 min. My skin was sensitive to the touch and only used water to wash my face for a day. I noticed a few brown patches throughout my face after 2 days. The 3rd day my skin was lightly flakey. After two weeks or so the discoloration was cleared up. I will keep my self hydrated and look forward to doing it again in 30 days. In this case less is better. Do not get anxious and use more then recommended. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend and this made my skin worse and I looked better before using. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Just pay a professional.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this product, and has asked me to order it a second time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple Jessner peels at my local spa and they each cost $395 - before the tip.  This kit is amazing for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did 5-6 layers as this is not my first time, had lots of redness for 2-3 days then peeled for 3 more days.  After 7 days, the sloughing was over and I used the microdermabrasion sample to give my face a nice polish and get rid of any left over skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results were better than when I got this done at a spa! I am 35 years old, have some fine wrinkles and lots of acne scars, pits, discoloration and still break out a lot.  After the peel: it looks like I&#x27;m wearing foundation when I&#x27;m not.  I stopped breaking out and any tiny lines I had are gone.  This treatment is amazing - I&#x27;d say this gave me quicker and longer lasting results than Accutane, (without destroying my body with side effects).&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for the deep acne scars but they were reduced significantly, as was my pore-size.&lt;br /&gt;I will do a few more of these for sure.  Does it hurt? Mildy.  The fear I created in anticipation of the burn was greater than the actual burn.  Compared to all the poking and prodding of a European Facial or a Brazilian wax - this is nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company, Skin Obsession, was a pleasure to purchase from.  The price is reasonable.  It shipped very quickly, (ordered Thursday night and had it by Monday afternoon.)  I also emailed the company for further instructions and they were quick and friendly with their response.  I highly recommend this product and this vendor.</li>
    <li> This is not a medical grade peel. I love this company&#x27;s glycolic peel. I tried the jessner peel once and it did less than my 40% glycolic. I have had 2 jessner peels before from my derm so I knew what to expect. I like the moisturizer in this kit. I would not buy this product again, and I would not recommend this to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why I thought this would be the same. It would be a terrible idea for this company to sell the medical grade stuff, because a real jessners peel if done incorrectly could ruin your face.</li>
    <li> This product is great! If applied properly, you will yield satisfactory  results. The instructions are clear &amp; concise.</li>
    <li> I feel stupid for buying this product on line.I didn&#x27;t work. I wasted the money that i could have put toward a V peel at my med spa. My skin looked amazing after one last year. I was trying to save money,but have experienced \\&quot;you get w hat you pay for\\&quot;. Also, my skin looked very bad after this peel, very red,swollen,splotchy,scary looking for a week. I followed the directions and just not good results. I love great skin .It&#x27;s the thing i notice on other women. I&#x27;ve had peels before,given by a physicans assistant,working with a plastic surgeon. This is the way I&#x27;ll be getting another peel, it may cost med spa prices,but I&#x27;ll look great not like a leper.</li>
    <li> I have been using this peel for about 7 years from this company and Julie Simons.  It is the same peel that I used to spend 5 times the price for at my dermatologist.  I did read the reviews, and I do think this peel works better on some skin types over others.  I get a very good peel applying two layers, however, I have tried this peel on my mother and a friend, and they never got more than some flaking.  Downtime is about a week, as others have posted.  If you have gotten a Jessners Peel from a professional in the past, this peel should work perfectly for you.  If you have never had a peel before, I would definitely consult with a dermatologist, etc. before buying this product to see if it is the appropriate strength for your specific skin.</li>
    <li> I bought the peel a few months ago along with some other products and honestly after reading some of the super scary reviews I was scared to try it. I&#x27;ve used the 40% glycolic peel evey four weeks and love it, I&#x27;ve had a retinol peel before and didn&#x27;t think this would be nearly as strong. I followed the instructions and using the gauze, starting on my forehead was a bad idea. It dripped in my eye, I immediately rinsed and started over. I started frosting immediately and didn&#x27;t even make it the five minutes before I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and rinsed with baking soda water. 48 hours later and I&#x27;m peeling fabulously. Next time I will use my fan brush and start on my chin where my problem area is. I knew what to expect because I&#x27;ve had a peel before so I&#x27;m not going to whine and complain about what I look like, I put acid on my face and I look like I put acid on my face. This is not a glycolic peel that just loosens the goo that holds your dead skin on. This peel makes you look yucky for a few days, if you can&#x27;t deal with that, it&#x27;s not for you. Otherwise, once your yucky old skin falls off and your new skin appears you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;re 20 something again.</li>
    <li> Excellent pell is not my first time ,,,,, that work ,,absolute recommend !!!!!!!!! Don&#x27;t forget emollient ,hidrated you skin .</li>
    <li> thought it would be a lot stronger have to put on several layers before it would even peel its okay</li>
    <li> This is a MEDIUM peel. Your skin should first be conditioned with several glycolic acid peels up to at least 30%. If you follow the directions EXPLICITLY this product is wonderful. It is best for oily, acne-prone skin. It leaves my skin soft and smooth, only with an occasional flaky spot or two. Highly recommend, just be careful not to leave it on too long for your skin type and again, follow the directions to the letter..</li>
    <li> This product definitely works, but it isn&#x27;t for all skin types! I would not recommend this peel for skin that tans easily or is naturally dark. In my experience and from scouring the internet for others who have done the peel and posted results, jessner&#x27;s acid peels can often cause HYPOpigmentation and/or hyperpigmentation in those skin types. Do your research!! Try peels that are safer for those skin types like mandelic acid or a low % glycolic acid peel before jumping into this one!!!!</li>
    <li> worked fast, no problems recovering.</li>
    <li> I had to use about three layers of the peel, but boy does it work!  Makes my skin look great!  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Got changed results but can tell I need to do several more peels down the line. Prepare for at least 7-8 days of trying not to leave your house because you cant go around explaining why you appear to have just escaped the hospitals burn unit. If you have the time to stay home this is a life maintenance tool you will add to your beauty routine. I&#x27;m going to try for one every six months to start.</li>
    <li> I have been having chemical peels done at a medspa that were costing me $75 to $100 a treatment.  I decided to try an at home alternative and after the first time, see great results.  My skin is smooth, soft and glowing after the first treatment and I am definitely satisfied with the results versus what I was paying almost 3 times as much for professionally.  The first time I used it, the instructions were clear and easy to understand.  As the instructions say, you will have redness and peeling for several days, but it is totally worth the results.  I can&#x27;t wait until my second treatment.  My pores are clear, tight and smaller after just one use.  I also noticed that my fine lines were smoother and at 35, I need all the help and preventative help I can get!  I did not buy the neutralizer, but used the baking soda / water method which worked great to balance the PH.  The lotion and cleanser that is included is equally as good.  The moisturizer really helps with the peeling and feels great.  I am going to purchase the micro-dermabrasion  beads that come as a sample.  This really helped after the treatment with the peeling and the fine beads feel great on my skin.  Definitely recommend this product and will buy this again after I finish the first bottle which is going to last at least 6 peels!!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I am amazed!  I have Melasma/hyperpigmentation on my forehead, I have had it for over two years, I&#x27;m guessing a combination from medications/acne/tanning beds.  I have tried everything and i mean everything to get rid of these hideous dark blotches, make-up was a joke!  Made it actually worse to look at,  I even cut bangs because of questions people were asking me about my skin \\&quot;What is wrong with your forehead\\&quot;  \\&quot;is it cancer?\\&quot;  and more....  I took before pictures but deleted them because i couldn&#x27;t bare to look at myself.  I was really scared to use the peel honestly...  I made sure though that i frosted so it would be worth it and wow it stung like hell!  I have completely peeled after five days, \\&quot;use the moisturizer alot!\\&quot; or raw coconut oil.  My Skin is about 75 percent better.  I cannot wait to do it again in 6 weeks!  Maybe the rest will just be gone next time and I can grow out my bangs again!!!  :^).  I will say this I will never expose my face to the sun without the best sunblock ever again!  I cannot believe I paid 27 dollars to feel like this!  Worth it!  Thank you skin Obsession!</li>
    <li> I used to get peels done every other month and saw amazing results. Trying to save some $ I tried at home kit. Results were just not the same. I like the face wash and lotion though. Very mild and does not cause irritation to my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> BE CAREFUL when doing peels at home, but if you&#x27;re an experienced peeler, then try this one out. I am of Mediterranean heritage and so I have an olive complexion but tan and never burn (in other words, I am more prone to post inflammatory hyperpigmentation!). This worked great for me with darker skin and was surprisingly not painful at all. I mean, the lactic acid peel I did stung more. No frosting, redness, but I think this is because of the skin prepping I did (Aquaglycolic lotion or any AHA lotion daily use for a month prior). Be careful you guys. Always patch test and always be safe!</li>
