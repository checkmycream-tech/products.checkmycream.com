<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like another reviewer, I bought my 1st trimmer in 2007 to cut my 3 year old&#x27;s hair.  It worked great eventhough he has fine hair.  I leave his hair fairly long on top and I am able to cut almost his entire head using this trimmer.  However after only 1 year, my trimmer blades started seizing up.  When they seized, I stupidly took apart the blade and cleaned all the hair and unfortunately the &#x27;lifetime&#x27; lube too. (DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!).  I have tried other lubricants but have not been able to get the blades to stop seizing.  It runs for about 10 to 15 minutes and then the blades seize. While I am disappointed and frustrated that this keeps happening, I do take responsibility for cleaning out the lubricant.  Although I only gave this 3 stars for above issue, I am going to purchase this trimmer again and give it another try.  I have not found another trimmer with a vacuum feature like this, and for me, the vacuum is worth having for cutting my children&#x27;s hair. I tried to cut my son&#x27;s hair w/ regular trimmers and the wiggling was much worse because he was so itchy w/ hair that fell on his neck.</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington HKVAC-2000 last year and I have been using it since. I gave it to my brother whan I went back home, because he loved it. When I camme back I bought a new one last month. This machine is amazing and very precise. It cuts the hair smoothly and vacuums the cut hair and there is not any need to clean the floor after the hair cut. I love it and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was so reluctant to buy this.  After trying to groom my 10lb. terrier mix (looks like Todo from Wizard of Oz) myself once before, it was a nightmare...hair EVERYWHERE...not only did I make a mess of my dog, I was full of hair, my bathroom was full of hair...it was an ordeal that took hours to implement and clean up afterward...I thought NEVER AGAIN!!    I have used Remington&#x27;s Pet Clipper twice now and it is EFFORTLESS...it&#x27;s actually fun.  It does EXACTLY what it says it&#x27;s supposed to.  This is definitely NOT for large, thick-haired dogs...although with some practice and technique I could see someone using it successfuly on a larger dog with finer hair.     The vacuum is very powerful and actually sucks the hair away from the skin toward the clipper so I use that to my advantage to judge what length I want to cut. My dog has two coats (short and long) and this clips both easily. You do have to stop and empty the container but if you keep a wastebasket close at at, it&#x27;s easy and fast and the container holds much more hair than you&#x27;d think just by looking at it.    The other thing I like is that because there&#x27;s no mess, I can leave it sit out and one day touch up his tummy and the next day do his legs, etc., whereas before I&#x27;d set aside 3 hours to do everything at once because it was such a mess.    For me this clipper has already paid for itself...a great product at a great price. If I had any complaints it would be the carrier pouch that comes with it...it&#x27;s a nice idea but not big enough to hold everything that&#x27;s included.</li>
    <li> After one year of use the blades are now so dull that they tear my hair out rather than cut. The blades, advertised as never needing to be oiled, might not in fact need oil. Rather, they need to be completely replaced. Also, as another reviewer pointed out the vacuum doesn&#x27;t quite work as well as they&#x27;d lead you to believe. I was quite pleased with this product the up until the blades crapped out on me. I&#x27;d be interested to see the results of a year-later follow up review. Products simply should not be manufactured to last a year then fail. I feel like I leased these clippers...</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s only one bad thing about this product: it comes with no 1mm plastic guide. The rest is very good</li>
    <li> I used a Flowbee for ten years. It was funky and clunky but gave a decent cut. Recently the blades went dull and refused to cut. So I decided to donate it to Goodwill, embrace technology and get its latest competitor. After all, it sells for just twenty-five bucks.     I was a bit nervous but not like I was on the first Flowbee cut. Anyway, this Remington works like a charm and a whole lot easier to handle. First thing I heard today was, \\&quot;who cuts your hair?\\&quot; I had to make sure the question was meant as a compliment -- it was.    If I was a barber I&#x27;d be pretty nervous these days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for 9 months, using it to cut my own hair. In general it does a good job. I don&#x27;t get \\&quot;professional\\&quot; results - no one would think that I just came from a barber. But after cutting my hair, I just don&#x27;t look like I need a haircut.     The trimmer is relatively big, so it is not ideal for precision work, like around the ears or sideburns. I bought a smaller trimmer for that. But for simply cutting hair it&#x27;s perfect. The vacuum really works, the trimmer hasn&#x27;t clogged, and has probably saved me over 200 bucks, while making my life more convenient.    If it busted tomorrow I&#x27;d buy another one in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> The clippers work well.  The big selling point is that it does not need oil.  The vacuum does not work too well, but still catches some hair.  Unfortunately, I think if the clippers did not have the vacuum, it would be a quieter set of clippers.  It would be better if the vacuum actually picked up more hair.    Also the rest of the kit came with a cheap pouch to store the clippers and attachments in.  It would be better if the storage provided was a plastic container instead of a cheap pouch.d</li>
    <li> These clippers have given us years of great cuts with very little mess.  They have finally quit on us and I am having trouble replacing it.  If anyone knows where I can get another set, I would greatly appreciate it.  I don&#x27;t want to go back to not having the vacuum.  Worth every penny if you can still find them!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years to cut my kids&#x27; hair.  I love, love, love, the vacuum functionality.  I love it so much that even though it is still in perfect working condition after many years of using it,  I started looking for a replacement just in case it eventually breaks.  I am one of those people who buys a backup for anything I really like just in case they stop making it or it is not in stock when I needed a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was initially disappointed that they are not making this anymore, HOWEVER, I just found out that they are making this again!  Amazon is not selling the latest model, but you do a google search for HKVAC-2000ACDN to find it somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I had the Remington haircut kit for 2 1/2 years and it worked great.  I could cut my hair in the bathroom without making any mess from loose hairs on the basin or floor.  The vacuum really worked and the titanium blades stayed sharp, making a clean, hassle free cut.  After frying my original clipper in New Zealand (240 volts).  I purchased a replacement from Amazon.  It works just as good as the original.  My only suggestion would be to make it a cordless rechargeable clipper.  It&#x27;s not a big deal unless you travel a lot to foreign countries that use 220 to 240 volts.</li>
    <li> The Remington Vacuum Haircut razor is the best way to go if you are a frequent \\&quot;head shaver\\&quot; like I am.  I just had to buy a new one because I blew up the old one in Europe (damn crazy voltage).  The new one is even better than the old one as they figured out a way to have a smaller plug/transformer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum does a great job and it definitely minimizes the mess in your bathroom.  The titanium blade cuts smoothly even without any of the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your wife will love you more if you buy this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Tom</li>
    <li> This is my second Remington Vacuum hair clipper, I like it so much that I gave my first one away to someone who needed it. It is very clean to work with, no mess afterwards.</li>
    <li> With the cost of haircuts nearing 20$(including tip) I thought, i will give this a try. And since I live in an apartment, I didn&#x27;t want messy hair falling on the bathroom floor. Having had 2 haircuts already, this one has already made me a profit.  Ofcourse small amounts of hair will still fall, but then its not messy.</li>
    <li> My husband has a lot of fine hair and we cut it every 2-3 weeks.  We are amazed at how well it vacuums. There are a few hairs that didn&#x27;t make it into the unit, but just a few.  He wasn&#x27;t even itchy.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair trimmer to cut my own hair. I have a very short hair and I cut it every 2-3 weeks.  I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months now and I am very happy.  The vaccum works great and I usually finish cutting my hair in less than 10 minutes.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderfull &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Use it..Cut hair.Forget it .. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had my summer cut well with this</li>
    <li> This razor is a lot different than other razors I have had. I have been doing buzz cuts on my ownself for over 10 years now. The pluses are that it is ultralight with the power adaptor (wall wort) taking up the bulk of the weight, the vaccum feature actually DOES WORK, which I was very impressed with, as almost all of my hair ended up in the canister, and you don&#x27;t have to oil it so it is very low maintenence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, it takes several more passes to cut my hair, whereas my older professional grade Oster could do it in one or two passes.  Nevertheless, it does ultimately get the job done right, so providing the blades stay sharp for a few more dozen haircuts, which remains to be seen, I would reccomend this product.  Oh...and it is very reasonably priced...so yes I would say go for it!</li>
    <li> I started going with the close cut hair style back in 2000 so I&#x27;ve used a variety of devices.  Until I got the HKVAC-2000 I was never very impressed with a trimmer.  Then I got this baby and took it for a test drive and I was sold!  This is by far the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for cutting hair.  I even use it to cut my 4-year-old&#x27;s hair, sometimes while he is watching TV, it&#x27;s that easy to use!  I&#x27;ve been using it now for several years without incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor sharp cutting blades, hair catching action, easy to clean, an assortment of attachments, relatively quiet operation (not as loud as a hair dryer), easy empty hair cartridge, adequate cord length, lightweight (the weight is in the wall-wort), and reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!  Highly recommended.  Pays for itself in a matter of months.</li>
    <li> I got one of these years ago on a recommnedation from a co-worker.  I use it to give myself a haircut every 2-3 weeks and it is great to avoid the mess associated with other clippers that do not have the vacuum feature.  I got a second unit on Amazon because even though it is still working great it can&#x27;t last forever and at this price I wanted to have a spare.</li>
    <li> Wow, this haircut really does the job. After using it on me there was nothing on the ground. The vacuum container can take a lot more hair than everybody can imagine. Finally found my haircut kit after few months chasing:). Highly recommended product - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The clippers cut great and they are also very light weight.  However, if you are cutting short hair (i.e. buzz cuts), then the vacuum will only pick up about 60-80% of the hair clippings.  Produces significantly less mess, but not mess-free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 4 years and I have found it easy to use with no mess. I keep my husband&#x27;s hair short and I have to buzz his head about once a month. In the middle of the winter in New England the last think I want to do is go outside to cut his hair.  We go in the bathroom, it takes me 10 minutes and we are done for another month.  I recomend this produce very much.</li>
    <li> We were skeptical that this haircut kit could replace trips to the barber.  My husband is partially bald and knew just how to advise me on what attachment to use on each section of his head. I&#x27;m not skilled enough yet to go solo, but his haircuts have come out looking really good and the vacuum has worked flawlessly so far. We are very pleased that in just 3 months of using it instead of going to the barber we saved more than the cost of the kit!</li>
    <li> My wife has been cutting my hair for the last 20 years.  We have used all sorts of hair cutting kits.  This one is absolutely the best.  Not only does it do a great job of cutting hair but the vacuum works great to collect the cut hair.    We used to hate hair cutting time because there would be hair all over myself and the floor.  If you cut your hair at home I believe you will love this kit.</li>
    <li> This haircut kit is very good and cuts the hair evenly. All the functions are easy to understand and use. The only problem is that the box in which the hair is collected after trimming is small. So it needs multiple cleanup while using it. However it couldnt have been bigger coz then it wont be able to fit into our hand.   A small amount of hair falls outside if you cut the hair and the box gets filled. So to avoid this situation, you have clean it up as soon as it gets filled.    I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bought the clippers b/c my 3 yr old hated having the cut hair fall on his face/neck.  He got to the point where he would cry the minute I started clipping.  Just used this clipper with built-in vacuum and it was fantastic.  I was able to cut his hair quickly without a single whimper out of him.  He also thought it was \\&quot;neat\\&quot; seeing me empty the hair into the trash.  My son&#x27;s hair is very thick and filtered into the vacuum just fine.  I had to empty about 3 times but even with doing this, cutting went much quicker than normal b/c I was not fighting with my son!  Clippers also cut very well.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair very short, almost shaving his head all over. This thing is awesome. It makes quick work of the chore and the vacuum keeps the cut hair off him and the floor. Wish I would&#x27;ve ordered it sooner!</li>
    <li> After using a lot of different brands of hair clippers to clip my Yorkshire Terrior and sometimes my own hair, I never felt clippers were very good.  Most clippers I have used at home seemed like junk compared to the ones barbers use.  Clippers often became too hot, get clogged, and the hair attachments were especially useless.  To clean and oil the blades, I had to always use mineral oil and hope the unit still would work pretty well next time.  In many ways, most clippers I have used in the past were awful.  I always wanted to buy a pair of clippers that would last more than a few clippings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing the Remington NoMess Clipper in the pet section at Walmart, I decided to take my chances and see how well they would cut my Yorkie&#x27;s hair.  I saw the vacuum that was part of the unit, but this idea seemed more of a novelty than useful.  The box claimed that Remington blades did not need oil, which helped sell me the clippers.  I hate oiling clipper blades.  The Remington clippers were more expensive than other brands, but I felt that they were worth the extra money if they lived up to their advertised claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After clipping my Yorkie, I was impressed with these clippers.  The blades did not get clogged or become too hot.  The vacuum worked very well and did not get in the way of clipping.  In fact, the vacuum helped me clip my Yorkie with speed and precision.  A Yorkie is supposed to have very short hair around its ears and this task was always dangerous to do with previous clippers because the blades kept getting hot.  Remington&#x27;s clipper blades stayed cool.  It almost seems like the vacuum blows cool air from the vent to cool down the unit.  I was very impressed with how well these clippers worked.  In fact, after clipping my dog, I cut my mom&#x27;s Shih-Tzu with ease.  A Shih-Tzu has a thicker coat of hair than a Yorkie and these clippers were able to buzz right through the hair with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cutting two dog coats, I experimented on my own head and found the blade attachments fit very well on the clippers.  The vacuum kept my floor clean and hair out of my eyes.  The vacuum container is small, so it must be cleaned every few minutes, but this is a small problem and allows the motor to rest for a moment.  The blades can cut closely to the skin.  In fact, I had a little facial hair at the time, but the NoMess clippers removed a lot of the hair all over my face.  After clipping my hair, I learned how to clean the unit.  The blades easily pop off of the front of the machine and the included brush removes the excess hair that accumulates after a hair cut.  The version I purchased was the NoMess Pet Clipper, but they look identical to this version on Amazon.  These clippers are excellent and I would recommend them for use on a dog or human.  Save some barber or animal grooming costs by using these well-engineered clippers.and found the blade attachments fit very well on the clippers.

    <li> This is an excellent product.  I bought it for cutting my 3 year old son&#x27;s hair and it works great.  Evidently high quality and sturdy, and the vacuum feature is everything it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  No mess!  Comes with several attachments that work fine.  I&#x27;m relieved to eliminate the hassle and expense of taking my son for frequent haircuts.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I got the Remington HKVAC-2000 Precision Vacuum Haircut Kit for my husband as a gift.  He hated getting his hair cut and usually put it off for longer than he should have because he knew he&#x27;d come home with a disaster on his head that would look bad for weeks while the missing chunks grew back.    This thing is great.  I&#x27;ve used clippers before and always hated it because the machine was heavy, oily and seemed dirty.  This machine is so nice and lightweight.  The vacuum is wonderful!  We didn&#x27;t expect it to collect so much hair.  The first time we used it we put down an old sheet on the floor and my husband wrapped a towel around him to keep the hair off his shirt.  Turns out we wasted our time because all but a couple hairs ended up in the vacuum chamber.  The cord is hardly noticeable because it&#x27;s so thin and is more than long enough to keep out of the way.  This machine is also much quieter than other clippers I&#x27;ve used.  Cleaning up was very easy.    Before getting this I had used clippers but only to tidy up botched necklines.  I was very nervous about cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for the first time but I have to admit I did a surprisingly good job.  It turned out way better than the cuts he used to get at the walk-in chain salons.  The instructions that came with the clippers were hard to follow at first.  I watched some videos online that showed how to cut men&#x27;s hair with clippers.  After that the instructions made sense.</li>
    <li> Bought the same clippers a few years back-after many uses, the blade became a little dull and wasn&#x27;t cutting as well so I bought a new one and it works just as well as the old one.  The best part is that there is no mess</li>
    <li> I bought two Remington HKVAC-2000 haircut kits.  The first one was for our son and worked so well my Dad wanted one for his Christmas present.      My son&#x27;s hair is extremely thick so I take my time cutting his hair. The vacuum bag needs to be emptied three or four times before we are finished.      My Dad has baby fine, flyaway hair.  Again, I have to cut his hair slowly so the hair goes into the blades.    There is very little hair that escapes the vacuum.  It happens more often when I keep going over the already cut hair and get short pieces.     Having a special needs son, the Remington works great.  DS isn&#x27;t bothered by the sound and we don&#x27;t have hair falling into his eyes or sticking to his equipment.</li>
    <li> I have the WAHL hair cut kit for my wife to cut my hair. But the teadious after-hair-cut floor cleaning work is time consuming.  So, when I found this Remington Vacuum Haircut Kit, I decided to give it a try. And it proved to be a great tool for following reasons:      1. It indeed collects the cut-off hair in the built-in collection compartment. This really saves a lot of cleaning effort. Unless your hair is so so thin, I can hardly to see how the hair will get out of the collection compartmen.    2. The whole hair cutter is built with plastic and it&#x27;s light for my wife to use. I know some people think this is made of cheap plastic. But plastic makes it light weight.    3. No more maintenance work to oil to the cutting blade. Really a worry free tool.      Yes, this hair cutter depends on gravity to catch the hair and you need to move the hair cutter in an upword movement direction. But I found that&#x27;s a quite nature way for hair cutting.  My wife feel it is far more easier to cut my hair with Remington Vacuum Haircut Kit than the WAHL haircut kit.      I really think this product is a good design with thorough thinking. I highly recommend this haircut tool to save you some hair cutting $$$.    ***** Update on 12/26/2014 ****  I have owned this hair cut kit for 5 years now. I had my hair cut on monthly basis by my wife. It never gives me any problem. The cutting blade still works great without pulling my hair. Definitely one of the best investment that I have made.</li>
    <li> Found this product several years ago in a large retail chain store.  Have used it faithfully every 3-4 weeks to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  Immediately fell in love with it, especially the vacuum feature!  No more hairs down the neck, inside the shirt, on the floor...so no more itchiness after the cut! Hair collects neatly in the reservoir with easy empty feature. Many length options, so start with the longer, and experiment til you find the right length.  The plain edge without attachments is great for trimming neckline. Slanted heads don&#x27;t seem to work well with this user, need to learn the technique. Plugs in, has nice long cord, so it keeps the power for the whole job because of no battery.  Saves lots of money at the barber&#x27;s.  Little scissors that comes with it is pretty sharp and a handy size.  BEST PART...we just ordered a replacement because we are afraid Remington might stop making these.  The first one is still working...but the price on Amazon is right, and we don&#x27;t want to have to make a trip to barber&#x27;s if and when our first one stops working!  Also, can&#x27;t find it in stores any longer!  Have recommended this whenever we get the chance!</li>
    <li> Was not happy with this at all. Threw it away and purchased an Oster after about a week. Cheaply-made, awkward, and only sucked up about 50% of the hair that it cut AT MOST. When no attachments were used, the blades were not adjustable and nicked my skin a lot. Maybe it works better for long hair, I don&#x27;t know, but this does not work at all on hair under half an inch long, including facial hair. Basically, it was just a piece of junk. Surprised at the good reviews it has receieved!</li>
    <li> What can I say? I already bought one and I gave it to my parents. Everyone says it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I borrowed this from a friend before I tried on my pets.  I have a Yorkie and a Maltese.  I&#x27;ve used it on the Yorkie, and all I can say is WOW!  It works perfectly, and the vacuum feature cuts down on the mess.  It&#x27;s not very noisy either, which is great as my Yorkie is a timid little girl, and loud noises freak her out.  She had a full coat, and I trimmed her down to 1/2 inch for summer.  It only took me about 45 minutes to complete her cut.  Nice long cord, easy to change the guards out.  Love this product!  I hope it works as well on the Maltese, and will update review once I try it on her.</li>
    <li> This is the best haircutting appliance I have ever used.Have been cutting my own hair for years and used to waste time cleaning up with hair all over me , and used to have to immediately have a shower.Amazed at how easily it removes hair and absolutely no mess,simply emptied container of hair into bin.The quickest haircut I have ever had.I would give it 10*.Certainly worth ordering all the way from America to Australia,even though had to purchase a plug to adapt to Australian electrical outlets.</li>
    <li> I love this haircut system, but unfortunately have lost some of the length guides. If anyone has all 6 lengths, I would love to purchase them from you. Please reply to the post. It&#x27;s a great system.</li>
    <li> Ever since a happy accident several years ago, I&#x27;ve been buzzing my hair. My clippers had just about had it and so I began searching for a nice, but inexpensive set of clippers to replace them. I wanted one that would vacuum the clippings as the hair was cut. Turned out these are few and far between. Then I discovered the HKVAC-2000 on Amazon. The reviews on the item seemed to indicate an overall good product with a handful giving average to just below ratings. Based on the frequency of these I assumed they were isolated incidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving the clippers and trying them, I have to say it was the single best investment I&#x27;ve ever made for any personal product of its type. This thing is amazing! I&#x27;ve never had an easier or cleaner time cutting my son&#x27;s hair! When it came time to do the bi-weekly buzz on my own crop, it went far better than expected based on that handful of disappointed customers&#x27; reviews. There was no \\&quot;3 foot\\&quot; mess on the floor to clean up, the product did not grab my hair or cut me anywhere at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience with the clippers so far (4 cuts for myself, 1 for my son), I have to now assume those who&#x27;ve had some trouble are attempting to cut too fast. The faster you try to cut hair with these the more likely you&#x27;ll get a snag (moving faster than the clippers can keep up) and the more likely the vacuum won&#x27;t be able to suck up the hair (it will go flying past the vacuum opening instead of being sucked in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about these, NO OILING the blade!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is so easy. Simply detach the catch chamber and dump. Use the accompanying brush to clean off the blades. The blade assembly is amazingly easy to clean as well. Instead of having to unscrew anything or risk breaking small parts, it pops off with ease, but not so that it will during a cut. Just use the brush again on the inner workings and replace. Voila.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no real trouble with it so far. The only drawback I could perhaps mention is when doing a self cut and coming up the back of the head, you have to make sure you keep the blade assembly flat against the head (assuming your doing an attachment-less buzz like myself) or you may hit a \\&quot;snag\\&quot; of sorts at the curvature of the back of your head. I can&#x27;t see that happening if someone else is doing the cut for you since they&#x27;d be able to see what they&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that minor difficulty, I can&#x27;t think of anything else that would be a potential problem. Just remember those two things,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. When giving yourself a buzz, remember to go slow on the back of the head as you come up where the head curves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Go slow to ensure minimal clean up and a perfect cut with no snatching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend these highly enough. If you&#x27;re looking for a great set of electric clippers and you don&#x27;t like the clean up after a haircut with scissors or the usual clippers, you&#x27;ve found the perfect set. Buy now!

    <li> great idea of a vacuum haircut kit, now I even want to have short hair all the time! Remington, keep up the good work</li>
    <li> This product is great. It&#x27;s light, it doesn&#x27;t get hot (like my old barber shop style clippers), and it doesn&#x27;t scare my sons come hair cutting time. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t catch -all- the hair and leaves a very light sprinkling  of hair behind, but given the overall amount of hair that is cut I do not mind the cleanup. And yes, the cut hair reservoir needs to be emptied maybe twice during a trim, but again, I do not mind. I am so impressed with the haircut kit, I purchased one for my sister and an extra for myself.</li>
    <li> This is the second pair of the HKVAC-2000 that i have owned.I love the cut it gives and the blade lasts about 3yrs.  It&#x27;s not 100% mess free but it collects most of the hair in the chamber and makes cleaning much easier.  Blades do not need to be oiled.  Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Pros:  As is the main appeal of the item, most of my hair is captured by the vacuum. As far as cutting goes, it works without any issues. One reviewer noted that the vibration dampening kept him from being able to apply a fade, however I was able to get a great fade when cutting my own hair even though I&#x27;m an amateur.    Cons:  I don&#x27;t have this problem, but I could clearly see as one reviewer noted that if you have very thin hair, it would just pass right through the filter and fly out the other end. Do beware of this and do not buy if your hair is very thin.  Also, there is no small adjustment knob to fine-tune the cutting length, and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t come with the 3/8\\&quot; or the 5/8\\&quot;.  Lastly, when using the blade directly on the skin, it can be pretty painful.    Pretty much, if you aren&#x27;t too concerned about the above and you don&#x27;t have time to clean up, this is for you. But if you don&#x27;t mind cleaning up afterwards and you are concerned about the above, there are better products out there.</li>
    <li> This looked like a good idea but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every clipper I&#x27;d seen before use AC power, not low voltage DC power. Result motors are not very powerful. Next on first use some hair managed to get into the vacuum motor compartment and promptly got wound up in the motor, jamming it. Worse there is no way to disassemble it even partially to clean out hair that WILL get inside so it&#x27;s lifespan is very questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned. You don&#x27;t need special clippers or trimmers to cut your own hard, all you need is a quality set of clippers with a set of cutting combs for various desired lengths of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and buy some real clippers, not this kiddie toy junk.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this same model for 4 years without any problem and I love the vacuum feature.  I bought another one for my brother 2 years ago and I just got another for clipping my dog&#x27;s hair.  My mini-schnauzer needs a haircut every 3 weeks, and now I&#x27;m saving the $40 of the groomer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Reminton vacuum haircut kit and am very please.  The price was much cheaper than on Ebay and Works great.  No mess!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this haircut kit because of all the rave reviews, and the integrated vacuum. The latter works ok, even though the occasional hair goes through the screen and gets stuck. The biggest problem was that it doesnt cut well and actually pulls my hair out. My friend had bought one as well, and has the same problem.</li>
    <li> The Remington hair clipper with vacuum is a great product. It works very well and there is no mess. What a blessing to a novice \\&quot;barber.\\&quot; The price was right and the order arrived in good time. Thanks for the opportunity to sing praises.</li>
    <li> This Remington Vacuum Haircut Kit does a great job of cutting my hair and the Vacuum makes for no hair on the floor.</li>
    <li> PROs: Excellent unit, yet very reasonable cost!    CONs: Remington apparently discontinued this item, and it is no longer available for sale. REMINGTON, if you are monitoring this web site, PLEASE bring this unit back into production and for sale on Amazon.com. You&#x27;d sell a million more!!! Nothing like it on the market for sale that even comes close for the nearly the price, etc.</li>
    <li> Purchased in 2009 and have used it every 2 weeks for more than 2 years and it&#x27;s still going strong.     High and tight &#x3D; skin with 3 on the top    &gt;52 cuts more than 2 years &#x3D; more than $500 in savings. This baby pays for itself!    Wanted to purchase another unit for a friend but looks like discontinued?    NOOOO, bring it back!!!</li>
    <li> my obtaining the remington 2000 hairclipper from amazon has made me  a more self assured barber in cutting my own hair.    i&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for over thirty years, and i did it well enough that friends would make favorable comments about how well i did it.  however, i just got the remington clipper, and i feel that the quality of the cutting immediately improved, because of the quality of the clipper and the clipper combs, plus the vacuum of the clipper insures a very even cut throughout the operation, and it shows.    my wholehearted endorsement for the remington 2000 hairclipper!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t paid for a hair cut in over ten years now since graduating from basic training.  Many soldiers go for the high and tight look which is nice, but I just can&#x27;t see paying eight dollars for a hair cut every week.  I recently was deployed to the middle east and my room mate had this set of clippers.  We shaved each others hair every week.  Additionally, we had two other guys who came by and used it.  There was little to no mess after cutting our hair and it gave a decent shave.  Very tough little guy too.  My room mate dropped this thing at least once a month on a concrete floor.  He was kind of clumsy.  The power block eventually had a crack down the side of it that we rigged back together with electrical tape from the motor pool.  If you are tired of paying nearly ten dollars a week for only about a minute of work order these.</li>
    <li> It is very good! I like it very much. Although it can&#x27;t vacuum all the hair, it is not a big deal. Maybe the kit should include a cape, hehe.</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer. I&#x27;ve been using it once a week for about three years. The last month or so the vacuum has started working, or not working, intermittent. Looking to replace it and will buy another one or may go cordless. The vacuum won&#x27;t capture all the hair but it does keep most of it contained.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few years ago, it does a good job, but still leaves a considerable mess.  The blade seems to not be cutting as well either, and I have to use scissors to clean up the hairs it misses.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair cutting device. I have been cutting my own hair with it for over 8 years now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this since October of 2008, and used it regularly. I really liked it at first, because it does successfully reduce cleanup time a lot. (It doesn&#x27;t eliminate, there are fine hairs that generally still escape the vacuum on it, but it does quite well.)  However, 2 huge drawbacks have made me decide, \\&quot;I&#x27;ve had enough\\&quot; and switching to different clippers.  1) It just doesn&#x27;t cut well. I&#x27;m astonished this isn&#x27;t mentioned on more reviews (so many 5 star reviews!?). I would always have to pass though and though my hair, to get it to buzz to the height of the attachment. I recently was at a friends and for the first time used a different pair of clippers, and was shocked! My hair cut like butter, instead of being yanked and pushed by this clipper. Perhaps my clippers got dull? (They can&#x27;t be sharpened though). I remember thinking in the beginning that they didn&#x27;t cut _as well_, but still did good enough. After trying another set of clippers (just a cheap $20 pair), that also cut much better, I see this as a huge drawback.  2) However these oil less blades work, they really irritate and redden my skin when they come in contact. My girlfriend was shocked how my red was red for the day and the next day, because of the rash from the cutter. Other cutters don&#x27;t do this to me- I can press them nicely against my neck to trim that irritating hair, while this one I always had to be oh so careful in order not to really hurt and irritate my skin.  Maybe I got a defective model? I used it for a pretty long time, I cut my hair about once a month or so, but I&#x27;ll get the shop vac out to clean up from now on and give up, at least for now, on the awesome concept of vacuum cleaner and hair-clipper in one...</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and surprisingly quiet. The vacuum collects most of the hair. It is very low maintenence; empy the vacuum chamber and brush off any loose hair you see and you&#x27;re all set. I even use it on my 1-year-old. My only complaint is that my husband knows he wants a &#x27;Number 2&#x27; on the sides, but the attachments only have actual inch/cm measurements on them. Maybe the &#x27;Number&#x27; system isn&#x27;t standard enough to use.</li>
    <li> This is the best there is. I have been cutting kids and now grandkids hair for over 34 years. This is the best there is. It is smooth and quiet, light weight and the built in vacuum system blows away anything out there. On the down side I have a few criticisms - the motor is not strong enough and neither is the vacuum. In addition it is not a durable product.... I am on my THIRD one - the blades simply do not last (don&#x27;t stay sharp). Now then you might wonder why I rate it so highly with those criticisms, well the answer to that is that the positives WAY outweigh the negatives. If, however, someone else came out with the same thing but improved... I would switch to that one.</li>
    <li> A good idea to have a vacuum equipped hair clipper, it saves much time to clean after a home haircut, but you should know that it doesn&#x27;t really vacuum everything, you&#x27;ll still have to clean around 10% of the hair that it didn&#x27;t catch, but still, the mess is so much smaller that what I used to do before!!  The other thing is doesn&#x27;t look and feel as a heavy duty machine, the clipper blades are smaller than a usual hair clippers, sometimes you&#x27;ll need to run many times on the same spot to get the job well done</li>
    <li> This is one of the most amazing appliances for the home barring none. What appliance can pay for itself after only two uses.  As far as performance-Never needs oiling, cuts great and best the vacuum feature works flawlessly. You won&#x27;t have any hairs to sweep up.  I may sound like a paid voice for this product, but my only motivation, is to let all know, it&#x27;s absolutely great!   Five Stars-for sure.</li>
    <li> I gave myself a haircut for the first time.  I like my hair fairly short.  I used the 1\\&quot; guide and buzzed my head in the opposite direction of the grain.  The around the ear trimmer attachments worked well.  Careful there.  They will cut short close to the ear.  The neck was a bit tricky but using a hand held mirror and my bathroom mirror I was able to get it done.  The end result was short but still comb-able.    The hair pickup system holds more hair than it looks like it will.  It was easy to open and clean.  It doesn&#x27;t get all the hair but does get most of it.  I still used a towel over my shoulders and showered when through.  Clean up was easy.  Hardly anything left on the floor.     For longer hair I would reccommend a friend to do the cutting.  It includes a manual with some instructions.      I have a friend that gets the same thing I did for $15 plus tip per cut.  This clipper set more than pays for itself after two cuts.    This is not for the preson that want&#x27;s really stylish haircuts (unless your friend is a barber).  For us regular Joes it&#x27;s an A+</li>
    <li> I have purchased 3 previous haircut kits and none compare to this one.  This is the greatest purchase I have made in along time.  No mess no cleanup.  Super product.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing for $18 at TJ Maxx outlet about 5 years ago, and have LOVED it for cutting my 3 hairs...;).  Unfortunately, I broke the 3mm clip when I was getting it out for use a couple of weeks ago, and cannot find replacements anywhere. This clipper doesn&#x27;t use standard sizes, and I haven&#x27;t had any luck finding any that will fit. I&#x27;m so disappointed, as no one else appears to make anything like it.  I bought a Wahl model at Costco last Saturday, and I guess it&#x27;ll do. It&#x27;s just so annoying to have the hair go everywhere now! *sigh*</li>
    <li> this hair trimmer works as promised. dont be lured by the status of going to the hair salon. wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have been married for 8 years with 5-year-old son.  During my married life, I&#x27;ve been cutting trimming my husband&#x27;s hair about every 3 weeks.  Although I&#x27;m not a professional, my husband loves getting haircut from me and my son also picked it up from his dad.  I have gone through at least 5 or 6 clippers during last 8 years, and I would say with all my heart, that this is the best clipper for the price range.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course I have no experience with 300 bucks professional equipment.  But the kinds that you would use at home, the ones under 50 bucks, I would say, this is absolutely the best.  I have been happily using the current one I purchased over a year ago although I&#x27;ve noticed weakening of the sucktion recently.  Since the delivery took quiet awhile last time, I wanted place my order for a replacement before I would face some real problem.  (between my husband and my son, I do haircut about every week.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The best part, of course, is the vacuum function.  At first by its fragile look and light weight, I couldn&#x27;t really trust how it would suck in the hair.  The result was amazing, though.  The person below complained about this machine not picking up fine hair.  I guess my husband and son have a little thicker hair, anyway, I thought it worked wonderfully.  From many years of hair cutting, I&#x27;m equiped with floor mat, cape and big brush.  Since I started using this one, I didn&#x27;t have to use any of them.  I used to be a little bit reluctant to give my son a haircut with all the mess it would creat, but now I can even give him quick trim while he is standing by the sink, without creating any mess! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another amazing part is the titanium coating.  For somebody like me who accepted the fact of haircutting... that when you finally clean up the floor, you are not done, you still have to clean your clippers thoroughly with little tiny brushes and oil them!... it was also amazing that this machine would not require oil.  It just keeps going and the blades have survived the longest time among all the clippers I&#x27;ve used.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had to replace my clippers since the blades start getting dull after about one year of use. (maybe my husband does have thick hair!) And replacing blades is as expensive as getting a new one.   I haven&#x27;t had any problem with blades so far.  The only reason I&#x27;m thinking to get a replacement is spilling of bits of hair.  Yes, I&#x27;m getting spoiled.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is though, with vacuum and everything, it is the loudest clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is so noisy that when I&#x27;m trimming around the years, I have to block their hair with one hand to protect their ear drums. :)  Still the convenience is worth ignoring the noise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m well pleased with this vacuum haircut kit.  My 5 years old son likes it, too.  It used to  be a hassel to cut his hair, but not anymore. We all enjoy it. It has different length you can chose, no need to oil the blade, the vacuum receives his hair quite well. I could finish his hair cutting in 5 minutes, for there is no need to brush away the hair getting in to his neck.  Now even my husband wants me to cut his hair, and it works well, too.</li>
    <li> This item did exactly what I thought it would. It collected 99% of the hair clipped minimalizing the mess to clean. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to buy this after reading that it wasn&#x27;t so great on fine hair, but my son&#x27;s hair was really getting shaggy and I was *NOT* going to wrestle with him at the barber shop again. So I bought this and was so happy when it worked perfectly on his hair. I used the 1 inch guide for his whole head and he looks great! The vacuum got all the hair which is a good thing, because I cut his hair wherever he happen to be in the house. He didn&#x27;t have to stop what he was doing and sit still or wear a cape, which he hates.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Having his hair cut at home also allowed him to get familiar with the trimmer--what it sounds like, and feel like-- in his own time and environment. He cut his stuffed bear&#x27;s hair first, then daddy&#x27;s, then his own by himself and then let me cut his. What a relief to have a nice haircut and no kicking or screaming.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At $25, it has already paid for itself. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because it is pretty loud and  had a really crappy users manual.</li>
    <li> I have three kids, two of which hate to get there haircut. I usually end up with a slobber sticky face with hair everywhere at the end of any hair trimming session. This cut it down by 90%, and thats good enough for me. Easy to handle. Easy to use accer. Bad part? No way are the guards interchangeable, the scissors with the set are not very good. But, again for under thirty bucks, well worth it.</li>
    <li> This machine has lasted me 6 years.  Today, after 6 years, the blades still work but the electrical plug isn&#x27;t in the best of shape.  I have to wiggle the wire to fix an intermittant power problem.  If i manage to position the wire in the right spot, the machine turns on and works just fine.      But overall, I&#x27;ve been incredibly pleased with this product.  It makes no mess, is durable, and does its job flawlessley.  I&#x27;m ordering a second one!</li>
    <li> I purchased this haircut kit 4 years ago and have used it every month since then. It works very well, and I&#x27;ve saved lots of money by cutting my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that the vacuum is not very strong, and that about 10% of the clippings will fall on the floor. But that&#x27;s still a big improvement over regular hair clippers.  It helps to frequently empty the the container that collects the hair clippings - the more often you empty it, the less clipping mess on the floor.</li>
    <li> When I first opened these, I thought they were cheap, plastic junk compared to the Wahl clippers I had been using.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised.  The wahl clippers are very solid, well made, and relatively heavy compared to the Remington HKVAC-2000.  That being said the Remington&#x27;s are easier to use and maneuver because of the lighter weight.  The clippers do a great job with thin and thick hair.  I have thin hair and these cut like hot knife through butter.  One of my children has supper thick hair like his mother and the clippers did a fine job on his hair as well, just had to take it slow and empty often.  The vacuum cuts down at least 80 to 90 percent of the mess but does have to be emptied VERY often.  It is very easy to empty the collector, simply have trash can near by and pop off container from clipper over trash can.  Banging the collector usually got all the hair out, but in the case of thick hair I usually had to help it out into the trash with my fingers, not a big deal though.  The vacuum feature does add a little more noise, but these really are not noticeably any louder than the Wahl clippers.  For buzz cuts and trimming these clippers are fantastic, and the vacuum is a very welcome feature.</li>
    <li> These clippers work quite well &amp; the vacuum seems to collect about 99% of the hair. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 16 years but I always put it off for a few months in between cuts due to the hassle of having to shake out my shirt, vacuum the floor &amp; take another shower afterward. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting these to work very well but thought I&#x27;d give them a try anyhow, glad I did. They collect almost all the hair except a few stray pieces here &amp; there which are easily brushed off the shirt or rinsed down the sink. Quite surprisingly I didn&#x27;t find any hair on the floor to vacuum &amp; I didn&#x27;t even have to change my shirt or take a shower after using them, they&#x27;re that good. They also have a very long cord which makes them much easier &amp; more convenient to maneuver than my old clippers. I use the #8 (1\\&quot;) comb on my head for a tidy but not buzzed look &amp; the #4 (1/2\\&quot;) comb on my goatee.</li>
    <li> I love this little groomer. It solved my problem. I do not have to put a mat on the floor or get my vacuum cleaner out every time after I trim my hair. It sucks on most of the hair. I am satisfied with this device.</li>
    <li> My wife has been cutting my hair with a shaver for the past 8 years - what little of it I have left :) We always do the haircut in the bathroom because it was the easiest place to clean up the mess afterwards. There was always hair all over the floor, my clothes, etc. After the haircut we would have to vacuum the floor and use wet paper towels to get up all the little pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this shaver, there was practically NOTHING on the floor when we were done. There were only tiny specs of hair on my shirt, which was easy enough to throw in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make it even better, my 4 year old always hated getting his hair cut because he said it was too itchy and bothered him. We showed him this shaver and how it doesn&#x27;t make him itchy, and now he can&#x27;t wait to get his haircut. He thinks it is the neatest thing!</li>
    <li> I was pretty surprised how well this works. Before I always had small hairs all over my bathroom floor, however with this, it&#x27;s now none. Only gripe I really have with this is that the smallest attachment size is a 3mm (why don&#x27;t they include 1mm and 2mm?). Besides that, it does a pretty good job keeping the bathroom floor hair-free and also does a pretty good job cutting evenly. A great product. Only reason it didn&#x27;t earn a 5 star is because of the lack of attachments for people who want to maintain short buzz cuts.</li>
    <li> It is quiet and keeps the mess to a minimum. Very little of it escapes. No itchy hair and a whole lot less noise means my boys actually enjoy getting their hair cut now.</li>
    <li> If it had a adjustment for the blade like a wahl clipper it would be outstanding, it cuts real good.</li>
    <li> This product is good but my son didn&#x27;t like due to air it throughs out because of it vaccume capability in cold seasons.     I used for about 2 years without any problem with normal usage (Once in 2 months). Beware of pricing, I bought this product 2 years back about $30 to 35 and now online (with some seller) it is casting $99.00, definitely it doesn&#x27;t $100.00. Beware buyers!!!     I can give more stars to this per my usage, but it is not as strong as other products.</li>
    <li> Having never cut my own hair, I was very skeptical after this haircut kit was recomended by a friend. The purchase of this clipper was one of the best things I have done. I now cut my own hair and the cost has been offset after just 2 ea. cuttings. This clipper is light weight, has all the attachments one would desire, to include a right and left over the ear taper attachment. The compartment in which the clipped hair is contained is very easly removed and cleaned. The clipper also comes with a handy storage bag. I would recommend this unit to anyone who is thinking of clipping their hair at home.</li>
    <li> My husband is the one who really wanted this.  He had used the one my son has and thought it was great.  It really saves him time and money because he&#x27;s not running to the barber shop every two weeks now.  The product works great, very little clean up. We both would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> 7/30/2013  NOTE:  [[ASIN:B0081TQ150 Wahl Vacuum Conversion Kit]] is available to convert a WAHL Clipper into a vacuum clipper as this Remington clipper is no longer being manufactured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review for Remington HKVAC-2000:&lt;br /&gt;Our son (9 yo) has serious sensory issues as well as severe ADHD.  Cutting his hair has always been a two hour procedure of chasing him around the room (or salon on the one occasion we tried a porfessional cut) with clippers or scissors.  He would scream and cry at the top of his lungs the entire time and be covered with wet sticky hair.&#x27; We tried everything including vacuuming the hair while clipping it.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, we have been doing this for eight years!  His therapist laughingly suggested a \\&quot;FLOWBEE\\&quot;.  I didn&#x27;t even know they made them anymore, but it seemed like a great idea.  While shopping for the Flowbee, I ran across this Remington.  For $28 it was worth a shot.  We received it in the mail this a.m. and I cut his hair (thick, thick, dark wavy hair) in 15 minutes.  At first, I didn&#x27;t even think it was working and he said, \\&quot;Look in the thing Mom, it vacuumed it up and I didn&#x27;t feel a thing!)  It was awesome, this time it was me crying!  Yea!  I want to shout it from the rooftops.  His hair was so long and thick, we had to empty this thing about 10 times, but he sat quietly through the whole thing.  We didn&#x27;t even use a cape or towel around his neck.  It is completely mess free, does a great haircut.  I can&#x27;t imagine how gorgeous his hair would be with a professional using this product.  We&#x27;ll find out next haircut though!</li>
    <li> Lets be clear this is not a professional Machine, but it works perfectly for domestic use and it doesnt create a mess, it will save you a ton of money on hair cuts :)</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it does cut the hair pretty good but the vacuum is not working as good as advertised. Hair still go all over the place not as much as without still hair all over the floor and sink even if I empty it several times during the cutting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own haircuts forever (I basically just buzz-cut it to \\&quot;shaved\\&quot;) and this is the third clipper I&#x27;ve owned.     Pros:  1) Nice long cord. I like that because there&#x27;s a bit of distance between the outlet and mirror I typically use. You can set up shop about anywhere with the length of cord provided.  2) Sharp clippers. It seems to cut very well, and I don&#x27;t have the occasional \\&quot;snags\\&quot; I&#x27;ve had with previous clippers. You can&#x27;t just mow through your hair like a madman but as long as you use nice measured strokes it cuts right through with no problem.   3) And of course the biggest plus: little to no cleanup. the vacuum is pretty powerful and collects the cut hair nicely.  4) Weight. It&#x27;s really light, so much so that you might think it&#x27;s \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;. Results say otherwise.   5) Full set of attachments. I only use the shortest so most of them are wasted on me, but I&#x27;d imagine you can do about whatever you want with the set.  6) No oiling, and basically zero maintenance required.    Cons:  1) the vacuum, as good as it is, isn&#x27;t SUPER-powerful. I do get a bit of missed clippings. Really very little though---and I have some thick, heavy hair---and it only happens when mowing at certain angles.  2) the collection chamber isn&#x27;t huge so, depending on how long my hair&#x27;s gotten, I usually have to empty it 2-3 times during a cut. Not a big deal whatsoever and what are you going to do, really? The clipper is only so big, and the only answer would be if they attached a bag to it :)    Very nice set, especially at this price. I&#x27;ve owned semi-professional clippers before (Wahl, and some other brand I can&#x27;t recall) and this one is as good, if not better. Though it&#x27;s very lightweight and \\&quot;plastic-y\\&quot; it&#x27;s performance is outstanding. We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time but for now, highly-recommended!</li>
    <li> The on-board vacuum works great and saves me having to get our upright out to clean up.  The only thing that I wish were different was that it was made better.  The unit is all plastic and won&#x27;t endure a drop on a hard floor very well so be careful.</li>
    <li> I bought this to save money on barbers, especially when I always cut my hair short and in the same way, but it is a little difficult to cut my hair by myself so I enlisted my wife to be my private barber and it works great for us.</li>
    <li> This unit has the power transformer at the wall socket end instead of in the handheld part. The handheld part is mostly made of plastic. So, it&#x27;s pleasantly light to hold, much lighter than my Wahl homecare thing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The supplied guard things (that you swap to change length, etc.; IIRC they range from 1/8\\&quot; to 1\\&quot;) have a curve on the bottom so it&#x27;s easier to have them glide over concave surfaces instead of digging the pointed end into them. This also makes things more pleasant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe the no-mess story, though. It really does catch most of the hair, so it&#x27;s certainly worthwhile, and it&#x27;s easy to empty the hair trap, but I still have to vacuum the remainder afterwards. It doesn&#x27;t catch it all.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to let everybody know, seems like this device can work with  220V (220 volts), at least power adapter says so. This is critical to me, because I live in Europe. I experienced no problems with this kit so far.   Overall vacuum part works well, but it looks like occasional hairs on the floor are inevitable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used these clippers twice, but both times the end result looked pretty good.  My test subject was my husband and although the cut was shorter than what he was used too, he eventually liked it (after he got over the initial shock at seeing so much of his hair in the garbage can).  I used the biggest cutter attachment hoping it would not cut it so short, but it did anyway.  I can only speculate that if I used the smallest cutter attachment he would&#x27;ve had a buzz cut.  Also, the cord is several feet long so you&#x27;re not stuck having to to use the clippers while standing right next to the wall outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cut very smoothly and evenly the back and sides though I took it gingerly on the top (not quite as much hair growing there).  When I used it without any attachments it did superbly in giving a very straight cut on his sideburns and shaved his neck fairly well of wild hair growth.  (Sounds lovely doesn&#x27;t it?!)  I had to empty it several times during both cuts, especially the first cut since his hair was a lot longer, but I just kept the kitchen garbage can nearby and it was very easy to empty the clipper vacuum compartment.  The clippers also felt good to hold and I was able to move it easily through his rather course hair.  The directions on how to cut hair didn&#x27;t tell me how to do the top of his head, only the back and sides.  I just had to kind of wing-it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that the haircuts looked super professional, but I think he looked fine.  Sure beats the heck out of paying $12 dollars plus tip for a cut each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  May 6, 2009&lt;br /&gt;I have used this haircut kit many times now on my husband and it gets easier and faster to use.  The cuts are really looking expensive now!  Just don&#x27;t push it through the hair too fast since it will yank it and the haircut recipient will holler, &amp;#34;OUCH!&amp;#34;.  Also, just for the heck of it, I tried it on my dog to no avail.  She&#x27;s and Eskimo Spitz with a thick undercoat and I was hoping I could shave her myself and save $$ but the clippers wouldn&#x27;t even budge a micron through it.  So, it&#x27;s not good for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 10.5.15 - would you believe I&#x27;m still using this to cut my husband&#x27;s hair?  I am.  Still working fine.save $$ but the clippers wouldn&#x27;t even budge a micron through it.  So, it&#x27;s not good for that.  UPDATE: 10.5.15 - would you believe I&#x27;m still using this to cut my husband&#x27;s hair?  I am.  Still working fine.</li>
    <li> The unit is a little larger than I&#x27;m used to using, but I will get used to it. Love the vacuum idea and it works good, only a few stray hairs were missed. Did a great job cutting hair. Great vacuum clipper for the price.</li>
    <li> Makes more noise than it actually sucks    Hair still goes all over the floor</li>
    <li> I just received this today and used it for my first self-cut.  Works great!  I just do a buzz cut, so I don&#x27;t need anything fancy.  It has the feel of a low-end model because it&#x27;s made of light plastic, but the vacuum portion works better than I had expected.  I&#x27;d guess the vacuum would have a harder time with longer hair, though.  It&#x27;s rather loud since it&#x27;s running two separate motors.  But for the price, I&#x27;m very happy with it.  After two cuts, it&#x27;ll have paid for itself!</li>
    <li> My wife just loves this product. We have purchased other brands, but this one does the best job. It is light weight and very comfortable to use. My wife has some soreness in her hands from aging and this clipper is just what we need.</li>
    <li> The product does what it says it cuts your hair and contains it all in a vacuum container.</li>
    <li> The design is good but the product life is about 6-7 Months that is it. Well for the price you pay it is good.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head since late 2006 and I&#x27;ve used this shaver every 3-4 days until the electrical cord got messed up last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This WAS the best shaver on the market PERIOD! I currently own a Wahl and it sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: *It shaved your head so close you didn&#x27;t need to bic it all. It took the hair clean off from the skin.&lt;br /&gt;  *There is no hair all over your shoulders, counter, and floor because the vacuum mechanism works fantastically&lt;br /&gt;  *The blade was super sharp from the day I bought it to the day I had to throw it away with no maintenance or oiling.&lt;br /&gt;  (that&#x27;s about 520 shaves...twice a week for 5 years)&lt;br /&gt;  *It was lightweight and quiet with minimum vibration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: *THEY DON&#x27;T MAKE IT ANYMORE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to plan ahead years ago and buy like 6 of these at the store, but never got around to it. I figured they would come out with something better.....I was wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these on a whim back in 2005 and have been using it a few times a month ever since. It has held up pretty well, but I recently dropped it and cracked the back casing. No worries...just go on amazon and purchase a new one....But they no longer sell it! Remmington, if you read these, get something like this unit back into production. I can&#x27;t find any other competing brands that offer a similar product. It blows my mind that more trimmers don&#x27;t have this feature built in. Works great!</li>
    <li> I first bought this product in a department store in 2006.  My husband loved it because there is little to no mess afterwards.  We use the vacuum trimmer on my husband and my son about twice a month.  After only one year, the product died.  I am not sure what the problem was, and despite its short shelf life, I bought it again because it is lightweight and has little to no clean up after trimming.  I recommend this product.  For the price, it would not matter if I had to buy one every year, it is great.</li>
    <li> Great home haircutting system.  The blades are very sharp (don&#x27;t use on skin that is not taught and watch out for moles on scalp.)  Vacuum catches almost all the hair.  Should empty hair catch chamber after each cut for optimal efficiency.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who hate getting haircuts, from professionals and from my wife, because of the mess the hair leaves on the floor as well as me. I use to get my hair cut at this little barbershop who used a hosed vacuum duct-taped to his clippers for easy clean up. I use to leave there feeling clean and refreshed, and loved getting my hair cut.  So when I saw this product I had to have it.     It pulled my hair from the get go. I even had my wife try a longer setting. Didn&#x27;t help, and led to a fight. While cutting my hair, my wife tells me that the reason its having a hard time is because there is something in my hair. I run my fingers through it (we used the longest setting) and it felt like I had residual syrup or honey in my hair. Then I realized it was because of the \\&quot;cut\\&quot; from the clippers. It was as if I had burned my hair enough to singe it. Back to regular clippers for me. Until they make an attachment for vacuum cleaner hoses.     As for my son, I am with the other reviewers, a lot of hair gets through the screen.     So if you have thick hair, or really, really fine hair, This might not work.  This is a great idea, but the clipping part (the main reason for buying such product) needs an overhaul.</li>
    <li> Delivery was not a problem and was at my house within a week of ordering. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I purchased this unit specifically for cutting my son&#x27;s hair (3 years old).  I&#x27;ve been doing it with a conventional buzzer since his first haircut and I figured this would eliminate the itchy-ness that bothers him.  Unfortunately, this razor creates nothing but problems. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The razor works as advertised but it fails miserably with thin, fine hair like that of my son&#x27;s.  The hair trap mechanism uses a fine mesh screen to catch the hair similiar to a juicing machine.  With very fine hair, it fails to capture a small portion of it since it easily passes through the screen mesh.  Worse, the escaping hair is blown out the exhaust port of the razor and flies everywhere.  After about 2 minutes of haircutting, about 20% of his hair was scattered all over the tile floor in a three foot radius of where he was sitting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another problem is that the suction doesn&#x27;t seem to be very powerful.  It relies heavily on gravity for the hair to fall towards the opening of the hair trap and then the suction takes over.  In the normal cutting method of &#x27;bottom to top&#x27; motion, it does a good job.  If you use the razor sideways or upside down (ie: buzz the top of the head), there seems to be alot of loose hair that gets away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One positive is that the blades are titanium coated and require no oil for the life of the unit.  Another is that the unit has good vibration dampening so less \\&quot;buzzing\\&quot; action in your hand.  Believe it or not, I think that this extra dampening is detrimental in cutting hair because you can&#x27;t feel or hear the hair being cut with the unit.  When creating a &#x27;fade&#x27; from shorter to longer hair, it&#x27;s difficult to get consistent results as compared to a conventional razor.  Unit is slightly bulky in size due to the addition of the vacuum and hair trap. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this might be helpful for some people with thicker hair.  I can easily seethis razor being jammed with hair longer than 1-2\\&quot; in length and with a relatively small hair trap, you will have to empty it often.  Unless loose hair bothers you during the haircut, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it.  Stick with a good conventional buzzer.</li>
    <li> The Remington works fine as a trimmer; however, the vacuum feature leaves a lot to be desired.  The vacuum was the primary reason I was willing to change from my current cordless trimmer, and it does not do an adequate job.      As stated by another reviewer, the trimmer relies too much on gravity to capture the hair in its vacuum.  Too high a percentage of hairs simply get blown away by the exhaust.  There may be fewer hairs to clean up, but they&#x27;re scattered over a wider area.  Cleanup time was not reduced nearly enough to justify the addition of a cord.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair clippers, no mess or fuss. Little clean-up after haircut. &lt;br /&gt;This is the second one that I have purchased. Bought my husband one &amp; our daugther-in-law loved it, so we bought her one as a gift, so that she can cut our two year old grandson&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Using this shaver once a week seems to allow me to space out the trips to the barber.  For the price, it just has to save me two haircuts a year to pay for itself.  Nearly all of the hair trimmings end up inside the vacuum chamber, so there is minimal clean up (but you do still need to wipe down the sink as it is not perfect).  My only complaint is that the length guides don&#x27;t go quite as short as I would like (3 mm is the shortest).</li>
    <li> I bought the product to keep my hair at the shortest lenght possible . Product does what it&#x27;s designed to do, but pulls when going against the grain. Possibly dull blades or slow speed in cutting.</li>
    <li> it does a great job, i just tought it woundn&#x27;t let any hair go, but i gess that&#x27;s impossible.</li>
    <li> Dollar for dollar, i would suggest that this kit is the best value on Amazon. The vacuum does not act like a &amp;#34;flowbee&amp;#34;, or whatever they are called; it does not aid in the actual cutting process. The vacuum is solely for cleaning up the hair as you cut, so this trimmer acts the same way any standard trimmer does, only it cleans up after you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decide for yourself if the following point is a good or bad thing: I find the blades at times to be TOO sharp. I have caused myself to bleed slightly on a couple occasions while trimming hair near the crooks of the elbows (the part you can see when your palms are facing the ceiling). If you use these trimmers for such strange purposes, be sure to stretch the skin smoothly before attacking. It is this sharpness, however, that leads me to believe that these blades will last a long time before they become dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2015 Update: Wow, has it really been EIGHT years? I still have this item, and still use it about once every 1-2 months! The blades are still sharp enough to cut me on the sides of my torso if I&#x27;m not careful (which is basically every time). I did start to notice some slow down back in 2013 (6 years after purchase). I bought a bottle of Wahl clipper oil, and the problem went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2016 Update: NINE years after purchase, and the zipper on the bag finally broke. I can&#x27;t even remember if it&#x27;s the bag that came with this item, or something I bought before 2007, because these clippers and accessories barely fit into the bag anyway. Nine years of forcing the thing closed, and it finally gave up (the bag, not the clippers). Clippers are still going strong.</li>
    <li> After my stylist butchered my hair for the third time. I decided to take matters in to my own hands and start cutting my own hair. For whatever reason he has been unable to cut my hair evenly. And since I live in a small town there aren&#x27;t many alternatives.    After reading all the reviews for both the Remington and the Flowbee. I selected the Remington because of its many positive reviews and low price.    I ordered it four days ago and it arrived this morning. After a quick read of the instruction manual I decided to attempt to correct my stylist&#x27;s latest mistakes.    Amazingly, it worked beautifully! It smoothed out the uneven patches and fixed several problem areas. When I finished, I had what I consider to be a professional haircut and on my first attempt to boot!    While it&#x27;s not perfect ... it&#x27;s close. With a little more practice I&#x27;m sure I will only get better at cutting my own hair.    I highly recommend this product because it does what you expect it to do. Haircuts made simple. 5 STARS...</li>
    <li> I love this hair cutter, I brought one and later brought 4 more, however, the blades go bad fast and I can&#x27;;t find any replacement for them, the units last forever, but not the blade, if anyone knows where I can buy it, please provide info. I am so spoiled with not using anything around the neck to catch the hair, not needed with this unit. Plus I can cut anyone&#x27;s hair if they are bedridden. Why did they quit making this????????????? AGH</li>
    <li> glad to share-the rem vac-trim is good looking and easy to use alone or with help, without making a mess!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  The clean up is nothing compared to when cutting with regular clippers.  Almost all the hair is sucked up by the vacuum and cleaning is reduced to wiping down the sink area.  The motor could be a bit stronger, but it still cuts the hair without any pulling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I really like how this thing sucks up my hair when i&#x27;m trimming it because it makes clean-up a cinch.  i&#x27;ve owned multiple clippers over the years and this is the first one i&#x27;ve used that has a built-in vacuum feature.  sweeping up excess hair with previous trimmers got old.  wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other clipper on the market</li>
    <li> I had been so use to using the family&#x27;s Flow-Bee that after I moved to a different state I really didn&#x27;t like the idea of paying for haircuts. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the conversations are great, but I really didn&#x27;t like the idea of paying nearly $70/year for haircuts. My hair grows extremely quickly. After finding out that Flow-Bees cost $60-100 I decided to look other places. I found this and bought it right away because of the cost.    My hair is very thick, so the vacuum has no problem holding onto it. There is a possibility that thinner hair could pass through easily. I used it last night for the first time following the instructions. Sadly, after 5 minutes of use, and irreversible trimming, I realized it might be a good idea having someone else do it for you. :) Even though, the kit comes with clips to hold back hair, a comb, and scissors, it would take a while to get skilled at doing your own hair. Sooooo... I opted for a nice short summer cut. The clippers handled my thick hair nicely even if I moved a bit to quickly. You will need a drop clothe around you if you don&#x27;t do it in front of a sink.     Overall I would recommend this product with only two flaws; storage bag could be bigger, and the hair catch could also be bigger. I emptied that sucker six to seven times. It is a LOT better than hearing a loud vacuum in your ear the whole time though.</li>
    <li> We love it.  My wife has been cutting our hair since she learned on our poodle!</li>
    <li> I usually just shave my head these days and this product works great for that. No stray \\&quot;hairs\\&quot; to clean up. The barber shop charges $10 for a haircut, so this thing has already paid for itself!</li>
    <li> What an excellent hair clipper, works beautifully and can do it in the house as hair is collected not thrown to the floor.  We love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and cuts my hair fine, just wish it had smaller guards</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 54 y.o. guy whose 18 y.o. son just came home with this product.  In a fit of craziness, I asked him to cut my hair!  The results were very good - with a little practice I think we can get a great haircut, and some concentrated time together as well.  Only problem - my hair was fairly long and the longest comb was a 1\\&quot;  - sure wish they had a 1.5\\&quot;, but I can&#x27;t find where you can buy accessories on the Web.  My hair is shorter than I&#x27;m accustomed to, but very even all around.  My son was very proud of himself!! &lt;br /&gt;Anybody know if you can get a longer comb for this thing??  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I never have left a comment on Amazon before. But this haircut kit is what I been waiting for. The few hairs that escape are no biggie. I can give myself a quick trim AFTER the shower. Normally I would wash my hair-then cut-then wash/rinse my hair a second time to get all of the little hairs still imbedding in my hair out so I can style it. If you have really long hair and plan to cut hair off over 2\\&quot;. It might not fit in the vacuums nozzle. Besides the cool vac feature, it does a clean job of cutting as well.</li>
    <li> This product is great, easy in use, quiet and light. I recommend from the bottom of my heart.</li>
    <li> Bought this for use by my husband while he was in a nursing home and I used it to shave and cut his hair with while he was there, no hair on him or pillows or sheets.  This is wonderful for anyone that does not want a mess while trimming or cutting hair, I also used it on the tougher part of his beard.  Wonderful item.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to replace my old cheap one, and it was well worth the money. The device it very light, and not loud. The blades cut effortlessly, and combined with the vacuum feature, it saved me a whole lot of time and cleanup. The vacuum picks up around 90% of all the hairs (in my experience), and cleanup was too easy. It&#x27;s fun to use and the minimal cleaning make it well worth it (perfect for the college student, or anyone who doesn&#x27;t have much time to clean up). It gives me more initiative to cut my hair (I don&#x27;t  go to a barber, and I do enough cleaning in my condo already). The only thing that really bugs me is that I&#x27;m afraid of dropping it; it&#x27;s made of plastic and it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would take a lot of abuse. I am pleased with this product and hope to use it for a very long time.    *edit Oct 28,2008*    It still works as advertised but the blades have gotten just a bit duller and it takes me an extra pass to get all the hairs. Not a big deal considering it still works great. I hope they don&#x27;t take it off the market before mine finally gives up!    *edit May 17, 2010*    It still works great! keep it clean and re-oiled time to time. Only complaint is that the cord now has some serious kinks in it and refuses to stay straight. Some quick splicing should do the trick. Other than that, the rubber grip is scratched up pretty bad, but that&#x27;s pretty normal at this point. The cut is a tad bit slower but nothing an extra pass can&#x27;t fix.    *edit April 21,2011    Yeah, it still works. Kind-of. The wire has become badly damaged from use and it cuts power to the device every now and then. The blades are tired but the vac works perfectly still. Remember to remove the mesh carefully and wash with soap every now and then. Overall this clipper has done a magnificent job and I will be cutting one last time before retiring it. Best tip I can give you: DO NOT twist the cord when putting it away. Time to re-order!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST HAIRCUT KIT, THE VACUUM IS GREAT AND NO MESS. WORK AMAZING, I JUST BOUGHT MY SECOND ONE FOR  A GIFT..</li>
    <li> Just cut my husbands hair for the first time and we were both very pleased.  The little vacuum part is awesome! No hairs to vacuum up with the big vacuum and none down his neck.  Very pleased!  Used the 1 inch size which is the largest length and happy with that.</li>
    <li> This is a great little device. It works as advertised. I have only used it twice so far, but it does in fact keep my hair trim and even. I do warn you though that this device is for very short hair. The longest it can be set to is 1 inch so if you are looking for a longer cut then that, this is not the device for you. If you are looking for 1 inch or less then this is an easy way to trim without making as much of a mess as a normal trimmer would make.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent but the only problem I would have to say is that it is still a little loud for clippers.  This is due to the vacuum which is to be expected.  Great hair clippers though.</li>
    <li> I really loved this item since it was so very easy to use and so accurate as a haircutter.  I have been searching for another one for months but haven&#x27;t been able to find one. I dropped mine once too often and it finally gave up on me. I bought a much heavier one which was much more expensive and much more difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I love this for kids hair I have been using mine for years. It keeps the mess off my baby and now he is 6. Little kids hate hair all over and this works great it&#x27;s not sharp enough for thick adults hair it will cut but will pull on the hair they will be mad at you.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers! It works wonderfully. The slower you move the clipper, the more hair will get into the vacuum. It doesn&#x27;t get every single hair but it comes close. Empty when you need to and then continue using the clippers. The container that captures the hair holds quite a bit and emptying is fast and easy with less mess than the traditional clippers. I have used this on my 5, 13 and 18 year old and they didn&#x27;t have any issues. Each of them have different hair textures and the Remington handled the differences just great. The unit isn&#x27;t any louder or the vibration isn&#x27;t any stronger than a traditional clipper, there are just pluses to this clipper!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this hair clipper!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually purchased two of these over the years.  Had one for at least a couple years and it was wonderful.  But I noticed that it started pulling my kids&#x27; hair now and then which, naturally, would upset them.  And when they don&#x27;t enjoy getting their haircut much in the first place, this is annoying.  So I thought it was because it was old, so I bought a new one.  And right away it was doing the same thing.  So then I thought it was because I was going too fast.  But it still will give a quick grab and pull on the hair now and then.  I don&#x27;t really know why this is, but it&#x27;s the only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars.  It&#x27;s worth buying, but only because it&#x27;s the only hair trimmer with vacuum built into it on the market.</li>
    <li> The remington precision vacuum haircut kit has saved me so much time! My least favorite part about cutting my son&#x27;s hair was the clean up. It took so long to sweep, vacuum, wipe, and pick up the hairs that I cut off all three boys. But now, I can just grab the clippers, cut, and throw the kids in the tub and don&#x27;t even have to sweep the floor! It&#x27;s amazing! My boys have curly thick hair and the clippers work great, cuts and collects all the hair with ease. I don&#x27;t care if this thing only lasts 6 months, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> We have had one of these in our house since my son was born and he is 5.  It is awesome to cut his hair and it all goes into the vacuum and is easy to dump.. very easy clean up.  The cutting of the blades sometimes leaves streaky marks on his head but he thinks it is cool.  Sometimes it pulls his hair when it is too long instead of cutting it.  We use it only to cut his hair and if you want your kid to have anything but a buzz cut I wouldn&#x27;t purchase.  For us it works because he likes it like the cutter cuts :).</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll be happy after purchasing this trimmer! I had purchased this same trimmer several years ago at a walmart and it has been the best trimmer ever!  I couldn&#x27;t even tell you how many haircuts it lasted for.  Had we kept it up better it probably would have lasted even longer. We used it about ever other month but would have used it every month if I could get my husband to remind me more often to cut his hair.  He has very thick hair...usually filled with hair gel at the time of cutting...and it works like magic!  Never started cutting my husband&#x27;s hair until shortly before we were married and so I learned on this trimmer.  We were so pleased with this very small investment (compared to how many haircuts it gave us) that we started to look for a new one when our first finally needed to be laid to rest! lol :)  Looks like there aren&#x27;t too many out there any more.... can&#x27;t see why?!?!?!  So happy that Amazon had this available.  Almost tempted to buy another for the future.  Just can&#x27;t find a trimmer with a vacuum anymore.  The vacuum is so nice during the winter months so we can trim my husband&#x27;s hair inside the house without getting hair all over the place!</li>
    <li> these are great clippers for children because it takes most of the fallen hair. that was a big issue for my child... thanks</li>
    <li> If it wasn&#x27;t good the Baracuda wouldn&#x27;t buy it.  She purchased two kits to supplement the one we already have to groom our seven pound dog.  That&#x27;s crazy!  Pets come and go though and we have had up to three dogs that needed grooming.  If you&#x27;ve ever clipped a pet you know about cleaning up hair afterward.  With the vacuum feature that is eliminated.  We purchased the clippers with the expectation that they will last a lifetime.  The only drawback is that the clippers get really really warm, so when one gets uncomfortable the Baracuda swaps to another.  Remington has stopped producing the HKVAC-2000 so available stock is the only way to go.  Happy clipping.</li>
    <li> I have owned these clippers for around 4 years with ZERO issues.  In fact, they are still sharp enough to cut me where my ears connect to my head if I am not careful.    The hair catcher is the primary reason I bought these and they do not disappoint.  I shave my head bald with these every two or so weeks and very little hair doesn&#x27;t get caught, I damp a piece of toilet paper and wipe in front of the sink and I&#x27;m finished.    I highly recommend these, in fact I just bought a set for a friend that was complaining about standard no vacuum razors.</li>
    <li> I just bought my second one of these.  I used my first one for over 3 years with weekly haircuts for me and every other week for my 2 boys.  Only started having trouble lately, but after 300+ haircuts it was about time for a new one.    Pro:  Very little mess to clean up.    Cons:  1) My boys had very fine hair when they were little and the mesh didn&#x27;t catch it all, but still much better than no vac at all.  2)  Noisy, the fan that sucks up the hair better than doubles the noise over a standard clippers.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair cutting kit.&lt;br /&gt;My husband cuts his own hair and has for many years now, it looks very nice and professional, he can always change his style by changing the blades, very simple, and saves a ton of money with him not having to go to the barber every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;This also really doesnt leave a mess of hair trimmings all over the bathroom (or where ever you use it) which is perfect... I would always find little hairs around after he cut his hair and even after he swept after himself, but not no more! The blades are nice and sharp and havent had any issues with it at all.</li>
    <li> This works great greats no mess what so ever i would recomend this to anyone that wants to save the money of having to go out to get a haircut</li>
    <li> What a great kit!  I had read many reviews and was hestitant to purchase this one.  My son is 17 and has very thick hair.  I was expecting that we would have to stop to empty the holding box of hair.  But we did not have to once.  We finished cutting his hair and the box was not even full.  There is some hair that is not sucked in by the vacuum, but it is no big deal.  Clean up was a breeze compared to what it used to be.  A great value and very compact!</li>
    <li> This little trimmer/cutter is Fantastic !!! All the others I have tried did not have the vacuum to lift as well as cut hair, the result was uneven at best w/o the lift factor. Great product !!! Just watch out for the cutter as it can pop out with little effort, the only complaint I could say I have about this neat product.</li>
    <li> The vacuum works nice - catches the cut hair and it is easy to empty the collection space. Cuts hair as advertised, and has the usual snap on attachments. Lasted a year, then quit with no warning. $22 + shipping.</li>
    <li> My parents sent this to me while I was in Iraq from 2006 - 2008 and I used it about once every two weeks while there and once every two months or so since then. This thing is awesome! I have had it for over 8 years and I have not had a single problem with it! The only hard part is finding replacement blades, the reason I am reviewing this is because I now, after 8 years, need new blades. If you are thinking about getting this, 100% buy it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t imagine the day mine will finally wear out but it&#x27;s still going strong.  Really weird that it&#x27;s so popular but Remington quit making it. A used one recently sold for over $200 on ebay.</li>
    <li> Vacuum function is great. Very little to no clean up.</li>
    <li> my wife uses this to cut my hair all the time.  Works as intended and sucks up \\&quot;most\\&quot; of your hair. Not all, and you still need to clean the floor afterwards.  But still a great product.  I gave it 4 stars because after about 1.5 years of use, it needed to be sharpened.  Not sure if this is normal.. Just an FYI</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this item.  Does the job, no muss/no fuss, no cleaning up needed, and still going strong after several years of monthly use!!</li>
    <li> This is the nicest haircutting unit I have used.  It works more accurately than those other vacuum units on the market, and is quieter and cleaner than other clippers.  For those of you who cut your own hair, or the hair of your family members, this is a must for your home.</li>
    <li> Very nice trimmer alot of levels of how you want to cut your hair. But the most part that I like is that it is clean and hairless when you are done so after your trim you just have to comb and go. This machine vacuums up the hair as you cut! VERY NICE and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I use this for haircuts. I have thick, coarse hair, and I use the one-inch guard for my whole head, then do a couple of swipes with a shorter guard around my ears. The trimmer cuts well, but my unit died the second time I used it.</li>
    <li> I was paying $14 for a haircut.  My hair has thinned out so much that it wasn&#x27;t worth paying this anymore.  This clipper was recommended by a friend and I have been using it for a few months.  I use the 1/4 inch guard and just go over my whole head once a week.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and paid for itself quickly.  The only negative thing I can say is that it pulls on my hair if I go too quickly.  This may just be because my hair is so stiff.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the second one that has been purchased in my family - which obviously means we are happy with them.  Good haircut trimmer, attachments are easy to use, gets rid of the majority of the mess - which is the best part of it!  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I went into this phase where I thought I could save alot of money by cutting my own hair and thought i would always look much better if I could give myself a quick cut each weekend.  I think this went on for about a year and this was handy given the vacuum portion of this cutting razor compare to others.  I would say that it did help to pull in alot of the hair which otherwise would have gone on the floor, but I still had to lay down a towel as it wouldn&#x27;t catch it all.  This was great for touch-ups to my hair also, but I would need to get help occasionally from my significant other to make the fine detailing on the back of the neck work out.  Cutting your own hair can be done but the fine details which you can&#x27;t quite see make it difficult.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone wishing to save a buck on haircuts and just plain looking to make life a little easier. It is what it says it is and does what is advertised... it cuts your hair. Easy to use and durable.</li>
    <li> too bad its not made anymore</li>
    <li> I dont recall as to when I bought this, but it has been through a lot.  I took it with me to Iraq and it worked great there and continues to work now 3 years after coming home.  I use them for simple groming and clipping my hair.  The only problem I have had is the blades tend to grab and pinch my hair if it is too long.  This may be a sign they need to be cleaned or the angle I am using is to steep.  But I would totally buy this again if they ever broke.</li>
    <li> i got this for my husband at christmas and he loves it.  it&#x27;s much better than regular clippers.  he shaves his entire head and not one hair touches the floor.  saves him so much time since he doesn&#x27;t have to sweep up after he&#x27;s done.  but it does sound like a vacuum!  i had no idea what he was doing the first time he used it.  the only problem he has is when he gets down to his neck area where the skin bunches up.  other than that he loves it!  highly recommended.</li>
    <li> As my hair has left my head I just hated to pay full price for a cut,my wife is so much more willing to do the job with this cutter. It is so easy to use and so very clean with the vaccum capabilities that she does not mind at all when I ask for a cut.    Thank You Remington</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair, and I used to have a turbine operated clipper (hook it up to a vacuum cleaner, and the cutter requires no electricity other than the flow of air generated by the vacuum).  That type worked great - sucked the hair up as it cut, and no poking hairs to deal with in your clothes later.  The turbine, however, was much too noisy, so I wore ear plugs while getting a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is much quieter, lighter weight, and requires no external vacuum.  It works fine - but is not nearly as solid or beefy, and the suction isn&#x27;t as good - so it doesn&#x27;t always pull the hair in to cut it.  What I would really like is an electric one that connects to an external vacuum - more suction, but less noise at the business end - but I couldn&#x27;t find anything like that on the market when I was purchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 or 4 years now - still works fine.  Better than the turbine.  Better than those that don&#x27;t have any way to suck the hair in.  Worth getting, at least until they produce something better.</li>
    <li> I wish I could order more, but sadly they are discontinued. (huh &amp;#34; 9 more words required?) Lol ok,, great item!! Bring item back to sell!! :). There you go !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a pair for over 5 years. They lasted a long time. The blades never dulled, just had to be cleaned. I did break end up breaking it the other day, by taking the hair catcher out while it was still running. Hair got stuck int he impeller. I tore it apart and could really get it back together. I got it working enough to finish shaving my head. I wished they still made this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best way to cut kids hair.  I have not had any problems cutting my 2 kids hair with this since they were age 1.  My 2 sons hated getting a haircut and we would have to bribe them everytime.  When I bought this and they saw how their hair went inside the cup and not all over them, making them itch they loved it.  Because I give my husband a haircut every 6 weeks or so and my boys every 2 months, I do have to replace this every year.  I figure that in just one month of cutting their hair buys this shaver, so I have no problem with it.  Also my husbands hair is super thick and that may be part of the problem also.  Either way I love this shaver and hope they never stop making it.  You will not be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I used this haircut kit since 2008 and loved it.  I need one now and Remington does not make it any more.  A year ago, I even called Remington company and made a request to them to remake this product.  I don&#x27;t think they received enough requests to start manufacturing this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone who reads this review has a used and functional piece of Remingtion HKVAC-2000 Haircut Kit and willing to sell it, I would buy it from them.  Please reply via comment and I will respond.  Serious sellers only please.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> We have been using this model for years to cut the family&#x27;s hair.  The fact you don&#x27;t have a mess to clean up when your done is awesome.  Vacume  works great. its easy to dispose of the hair when the blue container fills up.</li>
    <li> These clippers have worked awesome for my wife and I. My wife started cutting my hair and these clippers make it so much easier. The vacuum is powerful enough to catch a majority of the hair and make cleanup so much easier. It comes with guards ranging from 1&amp;#34; to 1/8&amp;#34; and two ear guards. The kit also comes with some scissors and a little brush to clean the blades. The blade part is easily removable, too, so maintenance is easy. The bag everything comes in, though, is a little tight and sometimes we can&#x27;t fit all the pieces back in and zip it up completely, but that shouldn&#x27;t stop you from buying it. Great product.</li>
    <li> THESE REVIEWS COME FROM MY HONEST FEELINGS, NOT JUST TRYING TO MAKE SOMEONE FEEL GOOD! THANK YOU!</li>
