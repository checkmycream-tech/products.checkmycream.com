<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is an excellent scrub; it has a nice scent and my face feels soft and clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin which is a problem even in my fifties.  This scrub is great for removing any oily build up and dead skin.  Some one with sensitive skin may not want to use this product on a daily basis, but for me, this is a God send.</li>
    <li> Best scrub ever!!!! My skin has never been this soft.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, it is a scrub but I use it as a mask about once a week.  It makes my skin glow.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower once or twice a week.  It definately takes off the dry skin without turning my face red, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Use this daily.  Keeps my skin smooth and clear.  Used Brasivol for decades.....they quit manufacturing it.  This is a very good close second.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!!! My face and hands are so soft after using this product. I bought this scrub to replace another scrub that I have used for years but is now discontinued. I like this one even more than the other.</li>
    <li> This facial scrub has brought my face back from hell on many occasions. I would recommend leaving it on for 20-25 minutes and then washing off. Not only does the surface look rejuvenated, but it moisturizers too! It leaves you with a shine!</li>
    <li> I love the Pharmagel line. Even thou this is a scrub its very mild.  I use it twice a week and my face feels clean and soft.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I have oily acne prone skin and I love this scrub. It is not too harsh, but I feel like I get a good exfoliation. Leaves my skin soft and clean. It&#x27;s my new favorite scrub. Bonus: They don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
    <li> I started using this product over ten years ago and have found it to be an effective cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I use other products from the same manufacturer and have been very satisfied with them all.  Since I have oily, sensitive skin I want a facial scrub that I can use often without irritating my skin or drying it out.  Pharmagel Ex-Cell is the scrub I can depend on, and I can even say I believe it has kept my skin looking younger as well as preventing blackheads and pimples.</li>
    <li> Loved this product, my Mom actually introduced me to the facial srub.  Just use at least once a week, works well for me twice weekly.</li>
    <li> best scrub in the world.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT..........GENTLE AND EFFECTIVE FOR MY THIRTY YEAR-OLD COMBO SKIN AND MY 14-YEAR OLD STEPDAUGHTER&#x27;S OILY/SENSITIVE SKIN!!!!!!!!  COULD PROBABLY USE IT EVERYDAY</li>

    <li> ordered this product on december 27th with standard shipping and received it before new years eve!  i&#x27;m an esthetician and used these products at my former job for the refinement and it&#x27;s amazing- i couldn&#x27;t wait to get my hands on a bottle of a lot of things in this line.  it&#x27;s remarkable how smooth it leaves your skin immediately after use.</li>

    <li> I love this stuff and how my skin feels after I use it. I use it by itself and with Gurin Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush 4-in-1 SPA Cleansing System, Waterproof and Cordless (purchased on amazon as well) two or three times a week. I look younger and my ance is almost gone.</li>
    <li> Used it twice at sister in laws place and I was in love ! It literally polishes skin ! I was searching high n low n finally found it here :)</li>
    <li> It cleans you face. Nothing extraordinary. Just like all the other products I tried. Haven&#x27;t noticed any tightening of skin. When rubbing on you face it tends to fly out. I notice little sprinkles of it on my shoulders, chest, clothes and shoes. I guess apply very gently.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love it.</li>
    <li> makes skin look new.  I use about three times a week and it makes my pours much smaller and skin glow.</li>
