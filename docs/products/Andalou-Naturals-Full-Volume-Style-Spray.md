      <li>I love love love Biotin Volume Style Spray.</li>
      <li>It is okay, have to say the lavender smell isn&#x27;t my favorite but</li>
      <li>you want a hairspray, Andalou Naturals has a sunflower citrus hairspray product that you might consider trying. :)</li>
      <li>Love the product and use it all the time.</li>
      <li>I was looking for safe alternative to a hair spray</li>
      <li>I searched through many sprays before deciding on this one.</li>
      <li>I cannot believe how much better my hair looks after using this product.  </li>
      <li>and I love Andalou skin products, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>I also love that it contains Lavender.</li>
      <li>Gets it moist and leaves pretty good curls.</li>
      <li>The scent is light yet refreshing.</li>
      <li>Smell is way too strong for me.</li>
      <li>Did not hold at all, like spraying my fine hair with water, will not buy again.  </li>

      <li>I am happy with the hold and that it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that regular hairsprays have.</li>
      <li>The citrus one works great though,will be switching back.</li>
      <li>I had switched to all organic, all natural products from skincare to hair care, but my one issue was finding a good hair spray.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a good thing for me since I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances.</li>
      <li>Great natural product and rated very well on the EWG.org website.</li>
      <li>Nice for soft style.</li>
      <li>Not only is it Certified Organic, but it is also Fair Trade.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair and this spray is light and really works.</li>
      <li>My hair feels fuller when using this, and it&#x27;s just the right amount of hold.</li>
      <li>So, I used this spray for the first time today in my journey to switch my hair products to healthier, more natural and even beneficial/nourishing products.</li>
      <li>First I used Andalou&#x27;s argan orange moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used everything to add volume to my hair/roots, including &amp;#34;Big Sexy Hair&amp;#34; products, John Frieda volumizing mousse, Sally Hershberg volumizing spray, and various curl mousses that add hold and stickiness and therefore lift.</li>
      <li>Not seeing much of a difference even with blow drying.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have any hold (didn&#x27;t expect it to)</li>
      <li>I was worried that this style spray wouldn&#x27;t provide much hold, but it has exceeded my expectations.</li>
      <li>I found this, and it really does add volume.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t give me much volume.</li>
      <li>It may control the frizz a bit but since my hair is so straight my hair was never frizzy to begin with.</li>
      <li>The main ingredient in all three of these products is aloe and they all have the same, lovely, natural lavender scent.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll experiment with how much I use at the next wash and may get more dramatic results with more product.</li>
      <li>If you like natural, this is it!</li>
      <li>Received several comments the first day that my hair looked thicker and fuller.</li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;m liking it so far!</li>
      <li>/bun just for the fact that it smells great, adds shine and contains biotin that my hair desperately needs to look fuller and healthier.</li>
      <li>Leaves the hair in a natural essence feeling.</li>
      <li>Helps me in a soft way.</li>
      <li>This makes my hair feel really soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>It is not a heavy styling spray.  </li>
      <li>All of them have worked with varying degrees of success, but my hair is NOT very healthy anymore.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the most dramatic volume I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a volumizing product, but it&#x27;s also left my hair feeling crazy-soft, completely touchable, light, and in no way sticky or hard to run your fingers through.</li>
      <li>Left my fine hair to wet and mated down.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say that most of the 2-star reviews complained that it left their hair wet, and didn&#x27;t hold...?</li>
      <li>just as you need for thin fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product as it works extremely well in my experience!</li>

<li> I have natural african hair - and it is very thin and fine.</li>
<li> I get compliments on how long my hair is getting, and I really am starting to see results.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a volumizing spray for us ladies who have hair that is flat or weighed-down.</li>
<li> If you spray on already dry hair it is going to be sticky.</li>
<li> Dry, broken, and brittle after years of using various drying alcohol and silicone-containing products and too much heat</li>
<li> I am really surprised there are not more reviews for this company out there.  </li>
<li> Then I squeezed out the excess moisture with a towel, let it go from wet to damp for 15 minutes while I did my face makeup, then sprayed about 8-9 spritzes in as evenly as possible at the roots, combed it through and dried upside-down with a blowdryer on low heat.</li>
<li> It does work as a volume spray on wet hair then blow dry, I like it.</li>
<li> You apply it when your hair is damp, then dry and style as usual, for some extra volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Not too stiff, but just enough to keep my hair the way I want it.</li>
<li> I have really thin straight hair and like all of those other products it is defeated by my hair.</li>
<li> It is getting harder and harder to get this product from my local health store - and that is not good news for me...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scents, but this one is not overwhelming nor bad.</li>
<li> I spritz a little of this before I blow-dry</li>
<li> I use it even when I&#x27;m wearing a messy summertime ponytail</li>
<li> so that&#x27;s a disappointment, because that was the main reason I bought it for.</li>
<li> THEN LIMP!  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews</li>
<li> Its&#x27; HORRIBLE - only made my hair wet!!!  </li>
<li> I also have thin hair, so I&#x27;m always on the search for hair products that contain biotin.</li>
<li> Again I have really thin hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was looking for safe alternative to a hair spray and I love Andalou skin products, so I decided to give it a try. Well, I cannot say that this spray add any volume to my hair, so that&#x27;s a disappointment, because that was the main reason I bought it for. On the bright side - it smells nice and I actually notice that my hair is easier to comb after I apply it. So I would rather describe is as a &#x27;detangling&#x27; spray&#x27; than a &#x27;volume spray&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Nice for soft style. Helps me in a soft way. Will buy again. Rita</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly suprised and how well this works</li>
    <li> Excellent, all-natural product. Best results if you spray on and comb-through before styling.  Adds light body to fine hair.</li>
    <li> Left my fine hair to wet and mated down. Love the ingredients though.</li>
    <li> Very light spray...just as you need for thin fine hair.  This product in combination with the volume shampoo and conditioner are awesome.  Received several comments the first day that my hair looked thicker and fuller.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. Leaves the hair in a natural essence feeling. Gets it moist and leaves pretty good curls. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I searched through many sprays before deciding on this one. I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t loaded with chems. I found this, and it really does add volume. I have lots of very fine hair, and have never had volume. I spritz a little of this before I blow-dry (it&#x27;s winter), and hey-what&#x27;s-that? VOLUME. I never thought it could happen to me. Going to order more for my mother and sister! I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scents, but this one is not overwhelming nor bad.</li>
    <li> Great natural product and rated very well on the EWG.org website. It is not a hairspray however. It does work as a volume spray on wet hair then blow dry, I like it. Not sticky if used as directed. If you spray on already dry hair it is going to be sticky.</li>
    <li> Very good product for a good price! Uncomplicated shipping to Europa.</li>
    <li> I love love love Biotin Volume Style Spray. I have natural african hair - and it is very thin and fine. This product gives it elasticity and at the same time lifts it up so it looks healthier and fuller. It is getting harder and harder to get this product from my local health store - and that is not good news for me...</li>
    <li> I tried this as an alternative to toxic styling products and it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s a safe product but it doesn&#x27;t hold a style for me or seem to add any volume.</li>
    <li> Not seeing much of a difference even with blow drying. Nice scent.</li>
    <li> I ordered another spray that did not hold as well as this one. I am happy with the hold and that it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that regular hairsprays have.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t give me much volume.</li>
    <li> I had switched to all organic, all natural products from skincare to hair care, but my one issue was finding a good hair spray. I also have thin hair, so I&#x27;m always on the search for hair products that contain biotin. I was worried that this style spray wouldn&#x27;t provide much hold, but it has exceeded my expectations. My hair feels fuller when using this, and it&#x27;s just the right amount of hold. Not too stiff, but just enough to keep my hair the way I want it. I also love that it contains Lavender. The scent is light yet refreshing. I use it even when I&#x27;m wearing a messy summertime ponytail/bun just for the fact that it smells great, adds shine and contains biotin that my hair desperately needs to look fuller and healthier. Bonus: Not only is it Certified Organic, but it is also Fair Trade. Love!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews but I always appreciate when others do so here goes.  I love this style spray!  My hair is fine and needs a lot of help in the volume department.  I cannot believe how much better my hair looks after using this product.  I would highly recommend this product as it works extremely well in my experience!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Gives your hair bounce and body with no residue and has a wonderful lavender scent.  I have baby fine hair and this spray is light and really works.</li>
    <li> Smell is way too strong for me.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel really soft and manageable. It doesn&#x27;t really have any hold (didn&#x27;t expect it to) so try the hair spray or gel if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. The scent is very light and I can really only smell it when I&#x27;m spraying it. That&#x27;s a good thing for me since I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my hair,won&#x27;t even hold flyaways back when my hairs in a ponytail. The citrus one works great though,will be switching back. Smells great though</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this stuff and decided to buy it but I&#x27;m not impressed. Sure it smells good but it doesn&#x27;t do anything. I have really thin straight hair and like all of those other products it is defeated by my hair. No volume. Nothing. It may control the frizz a bit but since my hair is so straight my hair was never frizzy to begin with. A plus though is that it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy. Again I have really thin hair so it needs to be washed everyday or it looks disgusting and greasy/oily. This spray doesn&#x27;t add to the problem.</li>
    <li> Love the product and use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Nice refreshing scent. Ingredients touted as being more healthy, as healthy as hair spray can get. I gave it 4 stars, but am leaning towards 3.5 as that&#x27;s not an option. It doesn&#x27;t &#x27;hold&#x27; your hair like regular hair spray does.</li>
    <li> Its&#x27; HORRIBLE - only made my hair wet!!!  THEN LIMP!  no hold-----</li>
    <li> I am really surprised there are not more reviews for this company out there.  I have only tried their line of the lavender/biotin hair care: the shampoo, conditioner, and the volumizing spray.  The main ingredient in all three of these products is aloe and they all have the same, lovely, natural lavender scent.  These products are effective and affordable, too.  I have been using this routine for six months now, because I wanted to grow my hair longer.  I get compliments on how long my hair is getting, and I really am starting to see results.</li>
    <li> Was happy with product and how quickly I received it.</li>
    <li> Did not hold at all, like spraying my fine hair with water, will not buy again.  LOVE the shampoo and conditioner though!</li>
    <li> Was delivered as promised and product was in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> To try to explain the huge gap between the 5-star and 2-star reviews... I&#x27;d say that most of the 2-star reviews complained that it left their hair wet, and didn&#x27;t hold...? There&#x27;s a reason for that. This is NOT a hairspray! It&#x27;s a volumizing spray for us ladies who have hair that is flat or weighed-down. You apply it when your hair is damp, then dry and style as usual, for some extra volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a hairspray, Andalou Naturals has a sunflower citrus hairspray product that you might consider trying. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onwards! So, I used this spray for the first time today in my journey to switch my hair products to healthier, more natural and even beneficial/nourishing products. I&#x27;ve used everything to add volume to my hair/roots, including &amp;#34;Big Sexy Hair&amp;#34; products, John Frieda volumizing mousse, Sally Hershberg volumizing spray, and various curl mousses that add hold and stickiness and therefore lift. All of them have worked with varying degrees of success, but my hair is NOT very healthy anymore. Dry, broken, and brittle after years of using various drying alcohol and silicone-containing products and too much heat styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO! First I used Andalou&#x27;s argan orange moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. Then I squeezed out the excess moisture with a towel, let it go from wet to damp for 15 minutes while I did my face makeup, then sprayed about 8-9 spritzes in as evenly as possible at the roots, combed it through and dried upside-down with a blowdryer on low heat. It turned out pretty good! It&#x27;s not the most dramatic volume I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a volumizing product, but it&#x27;s also left my hair feeling crazy-soft, completely touchable, light, and in no way sticky or hard to run your fingers through. (I can&#x27;t actually stop running my hands through it.) It gave enough volume to keep my hair from having that pasted-to-my-head look that I dread. I&#x27;ll experiment with how much I use at the next wash and may get more dramatic results with more product. All in all, I&#x27;m liking it so far!</li>
    <li> It is okay, have to say the lavender smell isn&#x27;t my favorite but the volume style spray part does work.  It is not a heavy styling spray.  I have baby fine hair and this works but if you have a specific style in mind this one might not hold it...just gives the volume.</li>
    <li> If you like natural, this is it!</li>
</ol>
