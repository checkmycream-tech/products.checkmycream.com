      <li>its a pretty cool concept, but it&#x27;s low -key a pain in the butt trying to hold this to your face while properly positioning it with one hand and trying to put on mascara with the other.</li>
      <li>I like my lashes thick and chunky and in order to do that I have to make sure I&#x27;m applying it starting at the roots of my lashes.</li>
      <li>Kind of weird to hold.</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it pulls those little lower lashes right out and make them pop.</li>

    <li> I love this tool for my lower lashes. I do not have to worry about smudging anything, chunks of mascara on my lower lids due to blinking, or poking my eye out. I like the fact that it pulls those little lower lashes right out and make them pop.Very easy to use and very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the most Asian shaped eyes but for some reason I thought this would make my eye routine a little simpler.  When I apply my mascara it tends to get on my eye lids so I thought this would help.  It&#x27;s a little messier than helpful, for me personally</li>
    <li> This is actually quite useful if you&#x27;re like me and tend to get your mascara everywhere. I use it all the time, I love it. Thanks lots!! xx</li>
    <li> The person whom received them was very grateful for these being available. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> works great!  serves it purpose</li>
    <li> Waste of money, even though it&#x27;s cheap...</li>
    <li> its a pretty cool concept, but it&#x27;s low -key a pain in the butt trying to hold this to your face while properly positioning it with one hand and trying to put on mascara with the other. It took forever to arrive and it just isn&#x27;t something I see myself using. It&#x27;s currently in a drawer somewhere. I just take my chances with my mascara. If it gets on my eyelid, I just go back over it with my eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> Works like it says! :) Mine came in broke at the top, but that&#x27;s ok. It still works. I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> Kind of weird to hold. Haven&#x27;t figured it out.</li>
    <li> this is great, no smudging of mascara on your eyeshadow, and great for the bottom lashes so you dont make a mess</li>
    <li> Very cool concept but the edges on the item I received are quite sharp!</li>
    <li> Works great and came fast wonderful for the price too definitely will be getting another one for my daughter so she stops using mine lol</li>
    <li> It was awkward for me and I couldn&#x27;t easily see my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> it looked wonderful but does not work that well - at least for me</li>
    <li> Either I don&#x27;t use it right, or it sucks. I feel like I&#x27;m using it right but I get more mascara on my face than ever before. I&#x27;ll update after I master the use of this little contraption.</li>
    <li> I absolutely absolutely love this product. It&#x27;s the most important tool in my entire kit. I love how it&#x27;s made my work on my clients so easy. I don&#x27;t have to ask them to look in any direction and it has saved me from that extra step of cleaning up if at all the mascara gets on the kids especially while applying on the lower lashes. It&#x27;s a great tool and a must have. I will recommend it to all MUAs or even for personal use.</li>
    <li> Does not work. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Its a great product. Great for not smudging mascara everywhere.</li>
    <li> Not impres and is not comfortable to use very disappointed</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described, plan to try this out soon</li>
    <li> Simple eye tool. Easy to use. Perfect for mascara application</li>
    <li> Works great, separates eyelashes very well. Only down side it that mascara c etc stuck in the groves</li>
    <li> i use it everytime, i like it when you put mascara in your lower lash not messy..</li>
    <li> the plastic edges are so sharp you&#x27;ll cut yourself if not careful and its very flimsy and thin.</li>
    <li> I paid about $3 for a 2 pack and gave one to my daughter, who also likes it. This helps you keep your mascara off your lids and from under your eyes. I am actually surprised how well it works, because I still feel like I get mascara everywhere, but when I lift this off my eye, my eye is clean. I will say that I must blink a lot, because I feel like this keeps my eye opened and it does start to water, but me blinking a lot might be the reason I normally get mascara all over my eye. I would give this a try for only $2 if you don&#x27;t like it give it to a friend.</li>
    <li> You should advertise this product more efficiently in the USA as women love cosmetics and this product offers ease. It&#x27;s user friendly, and anyone can operate it perfectly. I love it. Thank you Towall</li>
    <li> This crazy lil thing works! Lol it seriously does! I&#x27;m someone for whatever reason can&#x27;t apply mascara without getting it on my eyelid which screws up my eyeshadow! So yeah, it works.</li>
    <li> I can finally curl my bottom lashes. Such a handy beauty tool</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product. It&#x27;s great in theory. It does help so you don&#x27;t mascara on your eyelids, however it&#x27;s hard to hold it while applying the make up. I like my lashes thick and chunky and in order to do that I have to make sure I&#x27;m applying it starting at the roots of my lashes. With this product it prevents me from doing so. It was only a few bucks so not a big deal. It&#x27;s plastic and nothing fancy. It shipped from china so it took about 2-3 weeks but I knew ahead of time it would take that long. I would buy different products from this seller again, I didn&#x27;t have any issues. I just didn&#x27;t care too much for the product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Easier without...glad I didn&#x27;t spend much.</li>
    <li> Love it def does its job !</li>
