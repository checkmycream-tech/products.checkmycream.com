      <li>but these are perfect</li>
      <li>Great shower cap - perfect for our mom&#x27;s needs.</li>
      <li>I may have to start my own cottage industry and make one!</li>
      <li>Good but water still leaks in around the elastic when I shower.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with this one, and would buy it again.</li>
      <li>As a gift for daughter, she was very pleased.</li>
      <li>This is a nice shower cap.</li>
      <li>It does what it is supposed to do, and it&#x27;s a pretty color, and the lace is very nice.</li>
      <li>But I think most people looking for a &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; shower cap probably have in mind something roomier than this one.  </li>
      <li>Most were</li>
      <li>... enjoy the roomy pouffiness.</li>
      <li>This product came up after searching Amazon for *PVC FREE* shower caps, but when I got the item, I saw that the packaging states that this shower cap is made from PVC, which is a toxic substance.</li>
      <li>Nice large shower cap that does the job, dries quickly</li>
      <li>I love my new shower cap.</li>
      <li>Then you&#x27;re golden</li>
      <li>I think it was worth about $2.99.</li>
      <li>This shower cap is no larger than the ones I already own.</li>
      <li>Will mostly cover a head full of large-sized rollers but the sides will pull up and your watertight seal will be compromised on the sides, back and front.</li>
      <li>I own a Diane Large Cap and when I could not find one in stores, I ordered what I thought was the same product from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Really keeps my hair off my face and body when taking a quick neck-down shower.</li>
      <li>Can not find this size in my local drug store any more.</li>
      <li>I expected it to be pretty nice.</li>
      <li>Buyer be aware.</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for, especially for the price?</li>
      <li>The only good thing I can say about it is that it&#x27;s a pretty color blue.</li>
      <li>Finally, I&#x27;ve found this a functional and inexpensive shower cap which I been using daily for over 8 months and the elastic is still good.</li>
      <li>Good basic vinyl shower cap, large enough to completely cover a head full of &#x27;medium-sized&#x27; rollers.</li>
      <li>Elastic seems to be longer lasting than the cheap drugstore caps.</li>
      <li>The color, the tiny stretch elastic, the cheap lace and the made in China</li>
      <li>My daughervwears her be very time she showers,or just as a protective style to prevent her hair from snagging</li>
      <li>Just as I expected , Fits well ,good blue color</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair dry during a shower, the elastic is comfortable.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s runs kind thin but other than that ok.</li>
      <li>I was looking for one that would cover completely over my hair rollers.</li>
      <li>Tight around the edges, keeps more hair dry.</li>
      <li>This one&#x27;s pretty tight.</li>
      <li>Love it as its large enough for a few curlers and also I have a lot of long thick hair.</li>
      <li>However, the new one has only an 11 5/8\\&quot; diameter, the same as the Spa Sister Cap, and the other caps advertised here.  </li>

<li> All shower caps let a little hair escape and allow a little water in around the edges, but this one performs very well and keeps the bulk of my hair dry and out of my face as I bathe.</li>
<li> Larger than average, keeps the hair dry and seems to be well made.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not really a GREAT cap - it&#x27;s not lined with plush terry cloth or covered in silk fabric, but it&#x27;s exactly what it needs to be.</li>
<li> Giving 2 stars because it is a little larger than a regular cap, so hard to contest the advertising.  </li>
<li> I find the elastic band to be quite snug, but not cut-off-my-circulation tight.</li>
<li> Finding an extra large bouffant shower cap is almost impossible!  </li>
<li> small.  </li>
<li> Had a very hard time finding a shower cap the size I wanted.  </li>
<li> It turned out to be really thin, stiff plastic that smelled terrible.</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>

    <li> This is a nice shower cap. It does what it is supposed to do, and it&#x27;s a pretty color, and the lace is very nice. I&#x27;d buy another, however I don&#x27;t need another one just yet. When I do, I hope to get another just like this one.</li>
    <li> Tight around the edges, keeps more hair dry. Elastic seems to be longer lasting than the cheap drugstore caps.</li>
    <li> Finding an extra large bouffant shower cap is almost impossible!  I own a Diane Large Cap and when I could not find one in stores, I ordered what I thought was the same product from Amazon.  The color, the tiny stretch elastic, the cheap lace and the made in China tag are all the same as the one I purchased from a drug store years ago.  However, the diameter of the cap is significantly smaller.  The cap I have been using has a diameter of 14 inches if it is placed flat.  However, the new one has only an 11 5/8\\&quot; diameter, the same as the Spa Sister Cap, and the other caps advertised here.  Not only was I unhappy with the order, but I still don&#x27;t have a new extra large shower cap.  I may have to start my own cottage industry and make one!</li>
    <li> Disappointing. Item is &amp;#34;Large,&amp;#34; but not that much bigger than a regular cap. Not even close to an &amp;#34;Extra-Large,&amp;#34;  which, by the way, I found at a CVS store (and CVS online) for $3.89 (unlined).  Giving 2 stars because it is a little larger than a regular cap, so hard to contest the advertising.  But I think most people looking for a &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; shower cap probably have in mind something roomier than this one.  Buyer be aware.</li>
    <li> My daughervwears her be very time she showers,or just as a protective style to prevent her hair from snagging</li>
    <li> Works well with my big head and hair do.  Can not find this size in my local drug store any more.</li>
    <li> Good but water still leaks in around the elastic when I shower.</li>
    <li> Love it as its large enough for a few curlers and also I have a lot of long thick hair.Lasts a long time but I always keep six as a backup.They are hard to find the large size but these are perfect</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend...it&#x27;s runs kind thin but other than that ok.</li>
    <li> Great shower cap - perfect for our mom&#x27;s needs.</li>
    <li> This shower cap is no larger than the ones I already own. I was looking for one that would cover completely over my hair rollers. This does not.</li>
    <li> This product came up after searching Amazon for *PVC FREE* shower caps, but when I got the item, I saw that the packaging states that this shower cap is made from PVC, which is a toxic substance.</li>
    <li> Nice large shower cap that does the job, dries quickly</li>
    <li> leaks in the shower,  not water leak proof.</li>
    <li> I love my new shower cap. It fits snugly around my hair. All shower caps let a little hair escape and allow a little water in around the edges, but this one performs very well and keeps the bulk of my hair dry and out of my face as I bathe.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really a GREAT cap - it&#x27;s not lined with plush terry cloth or covered in silk fabric, but it&#x27;s exactly what it needs to be. Larger than average, keeps the hair dry and seems to be well made. What more can you ask for, especially for the price?</li>
    <li> I thought it would have been larger.</li>
    <li> As a gift for daughter, she was very pleased.</li>
    <li> This one&#x27;s pretty tight. Really keeps my hair off my face and body when taking a quick neck-down shower.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Cap was not adult size.</li>
    <li> Finally, I&#x27;ve found this a functional and inexpensive shower cap which I been using daily for over 8 months and the elastic is still good.</li>
    <li> A piece of junk to stay away</li>
    <li> Had a very hard time finding a shower cap the size I wanted.  Most were&lt;br /&gt;to small.  I was very pleased with this one, and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected , Fits well ,good blue color</li>
    <li> This shower cap cost $8.99. I expected it to be pretty nice. It turned out to be really thin, stiff plastic that smelled terrible. It was trimmed with lace that had strings hanging off it. I think it was worth about $2.99. The only good thing I can say about it is that it&#x27;s a pretty color blue.</li>
    <li> Good basic vinyl shower cap, large enough to completely cover a head full of &#x27;medium-sized&#x27; rollers. Will mostly cover a head full of large-sized rollers but the sides will pull up and your watertight seal will be compromised on the sides, back and front. Not using rollers? Then you&#x27;re golden... enjoy the roomy pouffiness. I find the elastic band to be quite snug, but not cut-off-my-circulation tight. I recommend!</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair dry during a shower, the elastic is comfortable. No complaints.</li>
