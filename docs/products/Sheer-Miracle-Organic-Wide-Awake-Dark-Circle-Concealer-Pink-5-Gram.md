### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>a while and works wonderful for brightening my eyes and dark&lt;</li>
      <li>I was very happy to see there was no  shimmer in this.</li>
      <li>The color is the perfect shade</li>
      <li>This is better than going to the dept store to make a purchase!!!!</li>

      <li>GREAT  PRODUCT--  </li>
      <li>great product,</li>

      <li>I love this concealer!</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t as amazing as I had thought..</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>Nice product, creamy and doesn&#x27;t settle in creases.</li>
      <li>It does work though and it finishes nicely, it just wasn&#x27;t the product I was expecting.</li>
      <li>It lasts all day and conceals magically.  </li>
      <li>This is to be applied lightly just on the inside corner of the eyes and the results are amazing.  </li>
      <li>but I still needed more.  </li>
      <li>My eye makeup looks so much better when I use this.  </li>
      <li>it was ok</li>
      <li>Color is okay.</li>
      <li>This one is just okay--hard to blend, rather grainy texture, and so I&#x27;m not at all pleased.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I am not too sure of the coverage</li>
      <li>again, it was ok.  </li>
      <li>For the price, I was expecting more product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better coverage from a L&#x27;Oreal or NYX product.</li>
      <li>&quot; I ate that one up:)</li>
      <li>I think some of the reviews must be staged, because there are a lot of products out there better than this.</li>
      <li>It works better than most.</li>
      <li>This pink-salmon is such a perfect tone for some reason.</li>
      <li>The product itself is not any better than the MAC or Dermablend concealers I am using.  </li>
      <li>so it looked better in my frown lines.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m still glad I have this on hand.</li>
      <li>Ok...</li>
      <li>I was sceptical about buying this concealer, but am so glad I took the plunge.</li>
      <li>, I love it on the weekends when I don&#x27;t like to look made up</li>
      <li>then press my warm finger on top to smooth it out.</li>
      <li>Would be glad to pay of it</li>
      <li>I love that this company is paraben free as well.</li>
      <li>made me interested in getting more products from this vendor!</li>
      <li>I have no complaints other than it not being the best match for my skin.</li>
      <li>plus I like the texture, which makes it easy to mix with a foundation or concealer.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>This is the absolute BEST concealer I have ever used (and I am in my early sixties, so been using makeup a a looonnnggg</li>
      <li>That is another strong point - it lasted for over a year</li>
      <li>Was advertised as free shipping, yet I was charged shipping.</li>
      <li>(smile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this so much</li>
      <li>The photo looks like a nice and NORMAL size product.  </li>
      <li>Under my glasses the difference was really significant.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to receive this product</li>
      <li>I am in love, love, love with this pink concealer.  </li>
      <li>Patting it on gently does not yield better results, BTW.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
      <li>I love this product,&amp; will be back to this shop for more.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
      <li>And the service was zippy fast,&amp; hassle free.</li>
      <li>I tossed it, as it does not apply smoothly--no one wants her concealer dragging the skin under her eye all the way to the ear just to &#x27;smooth&#x27; it on.</li>
      <li>Its worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It does help make you look awake more, but light color and when add other concealer seems to fade.</li>
      <li>It is mostly for the inner corner of the eye.</li>
      <li>This product works very well!</li>
      <li>Maybe I should have read the reviews first</li>
      <li>The product definitely works better than old-fashioned &#x27;beige&#x27; concealer.  </li>
      <li>I bought several more as gifts for friends - plus to make sure I always have enough.  </li>
      <li>i bought this based on positive reviews</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this product as suggested w/ the nice little product card that came with it.  </li>
      <li>Suddenly I look wide awake and my eyes are bright.  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much</li>
      <li>so you really have to layer it</li>
      <li>Hides the veins under my eyes really well.</li>
      <li>No matter how much sleep I get, they are there.</li>
      <li>Very creamy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a game changer</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Much overpriced at $16.00.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it made that much difference</li>
      <li>Thank you for the fast shipment  </li>
      <li>No mention is made of the size in the Amazon listing, and for the price I expected more product.  </li>
      <li>This is not soft or easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>This has a beautiful pale pink tone that covers and brightens.  </li>
      <li>It is a TINY little pot for the price which is surprising when you receive it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality under eye concealer.</li>
      <li>This concealer is a high performance item.</li>
      <li>maybe just the days I need to look a little bit more refreshed.</li>
      <li>Will order more in the future, it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Blends right in and lightens the area around my eyes without looking obvious.</li>
      <li>quick delivery and lasts for a long time!</li>
      <li>and wow does it brighten that area up like nothing I have tried!</li>
      <li>Use concealer first then this brighter pinkish color will brighten those two spots drawing light and focus there and help the under eye look less obvious.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is supposed to be creamy, however, it is stiff and chalky.  not usable</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Hides the veins under my eyes really well.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:2d77ab5cb260a4c2f18da2df13d5776f]][[VIDEOID:632d95833aae8036c160bf1210fae440]] How to apply concealer / eye brightener to virtually eliminate dark circles.</li>
    <li> Chalky. Not good unless you are VERY fair-skinned.</li>
    <li> This works great under eyes. I was very happy to see there was no  shimmer in this. Very creamy. I wish it were a little thinner consistency so it looked better in my frown lines.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. It&#x27;s small, as I expected from reading other reviews but you&#x27;d use such a tiny bit, this should last a long time. My only negative is that after using it on my dark circles,  I think a yellow concealer would better camouflage my dark circles. However, I&#x27;m still glad I have this on hand. I have no complaints other than it not being the best match for my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  It lasts all day and conceals magically.  I found it on a whim and chose it because of the reviews. Love it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this product so imagine my surprise when I got it and it was the size of a nickel.  For it&#x27;s size NOT WORTH the price.  Save your money.  I wish I would have read the reviews regarding it&#x27;s &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; size.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!! This is amazing product I have tried everything this works!!</li>
    <li> Works just great what a hidden little secret.  Thank you for the fast shipment  the pot container is small but you get a lot of bang for your buck Patricia</li>
    <li> Ok... This pot id only big enough for my little pinky finger to swirl around the top. I hold my pinky on the pot product which is Not creamy. I rotate the pot around in a circle putting some on my finger.&lt;br /&gt;Now you ONLY PUT THIS ON TWO SPOTS. You put some in the very inner bottom of your rye and the lower outer edge- not across the bottom of the lid. Its NOT a concealer. Use concealer first then this brighter pinkish color will brighten those two spots drawing light and focus there and help the under eye look less obvious.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a concealer and is NOT intended to be used under the eyes to cover dark circles.  I use their regular concealer for that and it&#x27;s great.  This is to be applied lightly just on the inside corner of the eyes and the results are amazing.  It&#x27;s an optical illusion, but I apply this AS DIRECTED as my last step while doing my makeup.  Suddenly I look wide awake and my eyes are bright.  My eye makeup looks so much better when I use this.  The container is tiny, but it lasts forever.  I haven&#x27;t even made a dent in mine.  I ordered a sample size before (that really is very small) and it has lasted weeks in my work out bag.</li>
    <li> I like the coverage of this concealer/brightener.  It is a very tiny pot, but a little goes a long way.  I find the product is a little drying compared to other products I have used.</li>
    <li> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!! 16.00 and could u find a smaller container??? I did a swatch on my hand and not only was I afraid to waste what little there was nut I am not too sure of the coverage untill I actually try it.. but I would have never paid 16 dollars for this.. very disappointed</li>
    <li> The product definitely works better than old-fashioned &#x27;beige&#x27; concealer.  I have sinus problems and insomnia so covering dark circles is hard; even after a sleepless night, the product almost concealed my very dark circles.  Under my glasses the difference was really significant.  Reason for 3-star rating:  the product is much smaller than it appears in the photograph--a lot smaller.</li>
    <li> A little chalky, but does the job..</li>
    <li> this is not a color for everyone. It does have a salmon hue when it is in the pot but goes on pink. It&#x27;s s little sheer so you really have to layer it is you want heavy coverage. It is a TINY little pot for the price which is surprising when you receive it. The cost is a little high for such a tiny item. It&#x27;s basically sample size. It&#x27;s not a game changer but it does its job.</li>
    <li> Very small for the price. I also noticed that if I don&#x27;t wear a primer under it will crease. I think that</li>
    <li> miracle product! quick delivery and lasts for a long time! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality under eye concealer.</li>
    <li> The photo show PINK  Mine looks tan. The photo looks like a nice and NORMAL size product.  IT&#x27;S THE SIZE OF A POSTAL STAMP!  My bad.  I should have read the reviews.  I would have never guessed it.</li>
    <li> Does cover the dark circles, takes getting used to, but it works wonders.  Will order more in the future, it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> As advertised, this is worth the cost, a great seal! This is better than going to the dept store to make a purchase!!!!</li>
    <li> I like it but it isn&#x27;t as amazing as I had thought.. I have drugstore makeup that does the same for less.</li>
    <li> This product is great I love that this company is paraben free as well. This concealer is a high performance item. It lasts all day and gets rid of your dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with dark under eye circles for a long time and it seems like I&#x27;ve tried everything.  I currently have 2 different concealers I wear under my eyes.  I first tried using just this without my other concealers...it was ok but I still needed more.  Then I tried it after I put on my other 2 concealers...again, it was ok.  It did add a little something extra but it also makes the other concealers look cakey.  So, in summary, it does add a little something extra but not enough that I love it and will use it everyday...maybe just the days I need to look a little bit more refreshed.</li>
    <li> This Wide Awake Pink Concealer arrived in record time, but I was very disappointed at its TINY size, which is more like a sample than a full-size product. No mention is made of the size in the Amazon listing, and for the price I expected more product.  The product itself is not any better than the MAC or Dermablend concealers I am using.  In fact, used alone, it does nothing to conceal my undereye circles.  Used over my other concealers, it does seem to highlight the area a bit, but I can get the same effect with other less-expensive products.  All in all, I am very disappointed with this product, both in size and effectiveness, and I will not reorder.</li>
    <li> This product works very well!</li>
    <li> It works well but does crease so I recommend using a under eye cream before using.</li>
    <li> This  is a great concealer that works well to brighten.  The color is the perfect shade plus I like the texture, which makes it easy to mix with a foundation or concealer.</li>
    <li> Does not perform as described to conceal and brighten.  Much overpriced at $16.00.  Would be glad to pay of it worked!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute BEST concealer I have ever used (and I am in my early sixties, so been using makeup a a looonnnggg&lt;br /&gt;time!)  I also use it for any discolorations or brown spots on my face and it covers just great.  I bought one in April of last year and it just ran out, so I bought another last week.  That is another strong point - it lasted for over a year and I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I just hope they keep making it because I would never switch.  I rate this product a 11++++++++</li>
    <li> Was advertised as free shipping, yet I was charged shipping. The ad, it&#x27;s deceiving. It doesn&#x27;t give you the actual size of item so you pay nearly $21.00 for a sample size container.</li>
    <li> I got a facial and the anestician asked if there were any areas of concern. I asked if there was anything I could do to treat my dark circles. No matter how much sleep I get, they are there. She said there is no treatment, the skin is just thin there and you can see the blue underneath - you can only cover them up. So I bought this and wow does it brighten that area up like nothing I have tried!</li>
    <li> This product works great! I have a 6 month old so having something that can help with dark circles is a must in my make up bag. This works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried and you only need a tiny bit</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is mostly for the inner corner of the eye. It last all day and really brightens my eye color. I use it also as a highlighter. It works better than most.</li>
    <li> Too hard to apply to your face, especially to the eye area. Not creamy at all. Color is okay. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this concealer.  It shows it to be a salmon color when actually is bright pink,  useless for covering bluish, purple under eye circles. Put in my 12 yo nieces play makeup box. :(</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Easy to use and it does help lessen the appearance of darkness under the eyes.  I did not give it 5 stars because I was a little disappointed in the size.  It is a very tiny jar and I use it every time I put on make-up.  So I fear it won&#x27;t last real long. For the price, I was expecting more product.  But, I might recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Even though I had read previous reviews warning about how dry this product was, I decided to try it anyway and found that it is indeed very dry and the container is really small.  I ended up mixing it with a fluid concealer and it&#x27;s worked out well but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I am in love, love, love with this pink concealer.  The first time I purchased it, it came with a card that showed you how to use it - inside your eye and down a little, NOT under the whole eye.  I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve used SO many concealers that just sit on my light skin, drying it out, and are very obvious.  This pink-salmon is such a perfect tone for some reason. It blends in then all you are left with is brighter looking eyes.  I didn&#x27;t think it made that much difference but now I look like I&#x27;ve had plenty of sleep for a change (smile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this so much I bought several more as gifts for friends - plus to make sure I always have enough.  It may seem like a small jar (about the circumference size of a nickel) but it will last a LONG time since you only use a dab.  I have a small concealer brush that I use to dab it around my inner eye - then press my warm finger on top to smooth it out. I love this concealer!</li>
    <li> a lot smaller than I expected for the money, but arrived in a timly manner</li>
    <li> Maybe I should have read the reviews first so that was my fault. It&#x27;s a tiny- very tiny- pot container with a creamy, almost shimmery product. It goes on well though and I didn&#x27;t realize you could only put it in the corner of your eyes to brighten your eyes. I was looking for an actual salmon colored concealer, not necessarily an eye-brightener. I could have just used shimmer shadow in that case. It does work though and it finishes nicely, it just wasn&#x27;t the product I was expecting. Brightener may have been a better term than concealer since it&#x27;s not actually used like your typical concealer.</li>
    <li> Blends right in and lightens the area around my eyes without looking obvious.</li>
    <li> Received product timely. However, reviews compared this product to erase paste... it does not measure up.  It does not cover or conceal nearly as well as erace paste.  Do not like consistency. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> very very dry!!  i bought this based on positive reviews and it&#x27;s very dry.  i don&#x27;t think i have dry skin, i have typical combination skin and i can not wear this product because it looks caked on.  i&#x27;ve tried it with face moisturizer, eye cream etc and it still is not creamy enough.  it&#x27;s almost like a clay.</li>
    <li> works well, small jar but goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This has a beautiful pale pink tone that covers and brightens.  Yellow based concealers make me look unwell.  This concealer goes on easily and blends flawlessly.</li>
    <li> awake concealer is good.  It does help make you look awake more, but light color and when add other concealer seems to fade.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical about buying this concealer, but am so glad I took the plunge. It was a much smaller container than I thought, but I have been using it for a month now and havent even made a dent in it... Works great for my really bad dark under eyes!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, except was so small, I was disappointed with the size, the picture&lt;br /&gt;Best , Mrs. Stewart</li>
    <li> Very VERY expensive for a tiny little jar of something that doesn&#x27;t make much difference. I think some of the reviews must be staged, because there are a lot of products out there better than this. But I got sucked into it like others. I&#x27;ve had better coverage from a L&#x27;Oreal or NYX product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a tiny little container that comes without instructions.  I dot the a tiny amount under my eye and blend; product is sticky.  It does hid the dark circles and no one had called &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s working inconspicuously.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  It covers with a very little amount and it does not have that dry look that some concealers do.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> ...nor what I have been looking for, which is a product by Sally Hansen, and IMO is the BEST brightener. This one is just okay--hard to blend, rather grainy texture, and so I&#x27;m not at all pleased. Not displeased enough to send it back, (too much hassle), but enough not to buy it again. I tossed it, as it does not apply smoothly--no one wants her concealer dragging the skin under her eye all the way to the ear just to &#x27;smooth&#x27; it on.Patting it on gently does not yield better results, BTW.&lt;br /&gt;No bueno. My advice? Give it a pass.</li>
    <li> This stuff is in a small jar but it takes just a tiny bit, it will last&lt;br /&gt;quite a while and works wonderful for brightening my eyes and dark&lt;br /&gt;circles. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a small package.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it only takes a little bit to work&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I love it on the weekends when I don&#x27;t like to look made up but I also don&#x27;t want to look like I need 10 hours of sleep!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very thick and stiff, and I don&#x27;t think it covers very well.  I have dark areas in the corners of my eye sockets, and I was hoping this would take care of that issue, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.  It may help a little.</li>
    <li> great product, but it&#x27;s so tiny!! wish the container wasn&#x27;t in miniature.</li>
    <li> Nice product, creamy and doesn&#x27;t settle in creases.</li>
    <li> It tends to make me look washed out.  It&#x27;s a little thick to apply under the eyes.</li>
    <li> This is not soft or easy to apply.  Way too much money for the low product quality.  Would not buy again!</li>
    <li> soft, creamy covers well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got real dark bags under my eyes. I&#x27;ve watched many YouTube Videos of girl&#x27;s that only \\&quot;THINK\\&quot; they have dark circles. I truly have \\&quot;BLACK HOLES.\\&quot; I tried this product by itself, but it wasn&#x27;t great. So I used it with one of my covers.. And it worked wonders.. I didn&#x27;t look tired, it brightened my eye&#x27;s &amp; hence my entire face.. I actually was asked if \\&quot;I had been on vacation?\\&quot; I ate that one up:) I will continue to use this product as suggested w/ the nice little product card that came with it.  Used like its meant to its invaluable, and a must have for anyone with dark circles. And the service was zippy fast,&amp; hassle free. Its worth every penny. I love this product,&amp; will be back to this shop for more. Thanks so much</li>
    <li> GREAT  PRODUCT--  made me interested in getting more products from this vendor!</li>
