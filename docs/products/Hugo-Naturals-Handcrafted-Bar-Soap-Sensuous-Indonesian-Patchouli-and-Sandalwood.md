### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>But this shipment was perfect.</li>
      <li>It has a very nice scent which stays on the skin and in the shower for quite awhile.</li>
      <li>This soap is good quality.</li>
      <li>Scent is great; warm and earthy, yet not overbearing as some can be.  </li>
      <li>Great product - love the way it treats my body and the earth.</li>
      <li>Glad I ordered a dozen!</li>
      <li>I need to get more!</li>
      <li>Love this soap!</li>
      <li>The sent and quality are amazing.</li>
      <li>Great smell, great lather, overall great soap.</li>
      <li>It melts too easily!</li>
      <li>Love this soap.</li>
      <li>It is not an overwhelming scent...</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it stays with you for hours.</li>
      <li>but then it might be a bit overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>Like the way it leathers up and love the smell.</li>
      <li>It seems to be factory seconds though, as the colorant had risen to the top of the bar</li>
      <li>My wife says she likes it because it reminds her of me...:)</li>
      <li>Smells amazing and fresh.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite soap!  </li>
      <li>on&amp;#34; via amazon, for free shipping.</li>
      <li>Decent soap, nice smell.</li>
      <li>If you are familiar with sandalwood and patchouli, this soap smells like that.</li>
      <li>It lather&#x27;s off and rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>Gives a nice creamy lather, leaves skin feeling soft and squeeky clean.</li>
      <li>Love Thanks for fast shipping</li>
      <li>The other soap I got from another company was really good.</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous patchouli soups and of the half dozen or so that I have tried this is the best</li>
      <li>at 4.99, it seems a bit much for soap, but it&#x27;s worth it as an &amp;#34;add</li>
      <li>Smelled great but didn&#x27;t last long</li>
      <li>Maybe some scents smell better than others -- or of course there&#x27;s always personal preference.</li>
      <li>That may be why the reviews vary so much.</li>
      <li>case it was THIS particular batch that was lacking.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this soap if you like these scents.  </li>
      <li>This particular shipment was exactly the same quality I receive from Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>soap cleans well, leaves you feeling soft and is a unisex scent that complements women and men both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells heavenly, and natural.</li>
      <li>This is the first patchouli soap that was not really patchouli soap.</li>
      <li>Soap might be old, but no lather and no scent left on skin.</li>
      <li>Similar to a clear bar of soap; a jell , a cloudy jell rubbed on the outside with patchouli.</li>

<li> The scent lasts long.  </li>
<li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because you must be careful not to let it sit in the soap dish with water.</li>
<li> actually I might like the scent a little stronger</li>
<li> so it is oddly colored.</li>
<li> /&gt;I was a little apprehensive to purchase it based on a review from someone who didn&#x27;t like the scent, but if you like sandalwood, you&#x27;ll like the soap.  </li>
<li> Very little of the correct scent.</li>
<li> Faint aroma.</li>
<li> Not impressed!  </li>
<li> Hated, hated to throw away a bar of soap this expensive, but away it went.</li>
<li> Awful.</li>

    <li> Not impressed!  Soap might be old, but no lather and no scent left on skin.</li>
    <li> Smelled great but didn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> This particular shipment was exactly the same quality I receive from Whole Foods. I agree with some of the posters that my previous attempt to order through Amazon was a bar that was almost brown in color and was no where near the same- back in 2012/2013. But this shipment was perfect. Glad I ordered a dozen!</li>
    <li> Awful. Smells like some sort of petroleum - fuel. Very little of the correct scent. Hated, hated to throw away a bar of soap this expensive, but away it went.</li>
    <li> Great smell, great lather, overall great soap.</li>
    <li> I expected a bar of soap that was fragranced with patchouli all the way through but only the outer layer is scented and when I finished showering I did not smell like patchouli or any perfumed scent. This is the first patchouli soap that was not really patchouli soap. Similar to a clear bar of soap; a jell , a cloudy jell rubbed on the outside with patchouli.</li>
    <li> My wife and I like the smell of both sandalwood and patchouli.  This soap has them both.  It is not an overwhelming scent...actually I might like the scent a little stronger but then it might be a bit overwhelming.  The scent lasts long.  I highly recommend this soap if you like these scents.  I have tried numerous patchouli soups and of the half dozen or so that I have tried this is the best so this is what I use daily.  I used to just use it for showers but we use it as a hand soap now.  My wife says she likes it because it reminds her of me...:)</li>
    <li> Faint aroma. Will buy again just in case it was THIS particular batch that was lacking. Lathers well.</li>
    <li> I need to get more! Love this soap! Smells amazing and fresh. Gives a nice creamy lather, leaves skin feeling soft and squeeky clean.</li>
    <li> Scent is great; warm and earthy, yet not overbearing as some can be.  It lather&#x27;s off and rinses clean.  Would buy again, but likely only online...at 4.99, it seems a bit much for soap, but it&#x27;s worth it as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; via amazon, for free shipping.</li>
    <li> This soap is good quality. It is a different aroma than I was expecting so I will use it but not reorder. I think others might like the smell but it is a personal prefence. The other soap I got from another company was really good. I will keep searching.</li>
    <li> Like the way it leathers up and love the smell.</li>
    <li> Decent soap, nice smell. It seems to be factory seconds though, as the colorant had risen to the top of the bar so it is oddly colored.</li>
    <li> Great product - love the way it treats my body and the earth.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. It smells heavenly, and natural.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite soap!  I love the smell and it stays with you for hours.</li>
    <li> The sent and quality are amazing.</li>
    <li> If you are familiar with sandalwood and patchouli, this soap smells like that. I think it has a stronger sandalwood scent. Both fragrances are an earthy/woodsy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap cleans well, leaves you feeling soft and is a unisex scent that complements women and men both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little apprehensive to purchase it based on a review from someone who didn&#x27;t like the scent, but if you like sandalwood, you&#x27;ll like the soap.  I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: Also, there&#x27;s a &#x27;scent name&#x27; along with the review. That may be why the reviews vary so much. Maybe some scents smell better than others -- or of course there&#x27;s always personal preference.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because you must be careful not to let it sit in the soap dish with water. It melts too easily! Otherwise, I like it. It has a very nice scent which stays on the skin and in the shower for quite awhile. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love Thanks for fast shipping</li>
