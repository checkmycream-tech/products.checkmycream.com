<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this one at Sephora after watching an online review on youtube.com a while ago and really liked it.  I&#x27;m SO happy they came out with the new model now that&#x27;s cordless and I can use on my face and bikini.  No more waxing or shaving for me. :)</li>
    <li> it came so quick, and iam so happy. so far although i only used it 2 times, but so far iam very&lt;br /&gt;pleased.</li>
    <li> This does work, although I&#x27;d never buy it now that the tria and silkn have become somewhat affordable.  Look on ebay for a good deal pricewise. Sadly it doesn&#x27;t work well on the bikini area ( not just ime, according to the study only 15 percent of bikini hair was stunted---it does work on the face even though it says not to.    Look online for the clinical study- I had similar results and it gives you an idea of the time involvement.  Offhand I&#x27;d say an hour a week for a 50 percent reduction in growth legwise.  Not a bad item, just not that great compared with tria/ silkn results and time commitment. Also some people are really bothered by the burnt hair smell.  It didn&#x27;t bother me but some of my friends could detect it in my room or even on me (I guess my legs gave off a burnt odor?) after I used the device.</li>
    <li> I think it is a good product but takes time to work. I have very fast growing hair I could shave twice a day since using this product that has slowed down especially on my arms. It smells when doing it but that isn&#x27;t a big deal. I will continue using it I have only had it a month.</li>
    <li> I think the product just doesnt work as easily as shown on tv. It works just is a little more effort in doing so.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;NO! NO!  is aptly named.  First time I have ever purchased something from Amazon which I deeply regretted.  It absolutely does not work as advertised and was a waste of my limited funds.  I certainly will be more careful in the future with any purchase.</li>
    <li> i bought off of hsn and it was just a stupid purchase .barely works. just sux doesn&#x27;t remove hair shaving it does and then i guess you apply no no but there is little to no difference in regrowth amount. it might take ten years to get a bald patch of skin. If i could i would rate 0.</li>
    <li> This was a very poor purchase on my part...I gave this product away to someone else who wanted to try this!!  It is one of those infomercial products that did not deliver the \\&quot;Promised Results\\&quot; and since I purchased it from a third part on Amazon, I knew it would be a hassle returning this item!!  What a waste!!  I won&#x27;t repeat this one!!</li>
    <li> I just received product will do another review. Once I have tried it. Seen good reviews hope yo have the same results.</li>
    <li> i will not ever use this item again, it burnt my skin, and it didn&#x27;t work if you went to fast, but don&#x27;t go to slow either because it will really burn your skin</li>
    <li> I like this is excellent.</li>
    <li> This piece of crap is not worth anything. I bought this used it for several months and no results. Those  commercials are full of lies. Another crapy gimmick to line some scammers pockets.</li>
    <li> I was really dissatisfied with this item, it was not as advertised.  It pulled my hairs and was very discomforting.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item about 2 months ago, and I wish I hadn&#x27;t.  I feel like I threw my money in the garbage.  When you see it demonstrated it is so deceiving.  It takes a ton of time.  It worked great on my arms but not on my legs or anywhere else. The blades wear out very fast.    I was not able to return this item or exchange it for something else which really was terrible since it was a third party vendor.  Never again!!!</li>
    <li> If I could rate this zero I would. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!  It doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL!!</li>
    <li> I believe I gave this product ample time to work.  It did remove the fine, light color hair on the tops of my legs.  However, below the knee, my hair is dark and coarse.  It did almost nothing to remove this hair.  Also, the light color hair seemed to remove only to the skin surface, not to the root.  The results were not any more long-lasting than shaving - and took a lot more time.  I had high hopes for this product - I have tried SO MANY types of hair removal.</li>
    <li> I had some fast growing hair around the  bikini line that used to be very frustrating but today after using the No No Hair Removal system for a few weeks I have very little hair trying to return.   The hair on my legs is disappearing all together, it does take some time to use it but it is well worth it so far. There are some stubborn areas on my legs but I just follow the directions and I know that the hair will eventually disappear.  I am very happy with the product so far. I will return in a month for a follow up.</li>
    <li> it never really worked as advertised</li>
    <li> Being above the 50 mark, I bought this product for fascial hair removal.  This product states in the liturature not to use on your face.  I did anyway, and the product was disappointing.  But, since I blew a ton of money on this, I tried the product om my legs, underarms and bikini line.  The product is clear you need to use daily for 6 weeks to be effective.  I couldn&#x27;t stick with the program, and I&#x27;m still hairy and scary.  I don&#x27;t know if the product works if indeed, you can stick with the daily routine.  Good luck, and bless you if you can laser treat yourself daily for 6 weeks!</li>
    <li> This product is worthless.  It&#x27;s not even a matter of thinking that it&#x27;s user error - or a matter of time.  It&#x27;s a piece of junk and not something I would recommend . . . ever.  Maybe I should call this review A State of Constant Stubble - because that&#x27;s what it gives you.  I only tried to use it on my legs, it&#x27;s too bulky for bikini, and too unwieldy for underarms.  You have to use it more often than shaving, it takes longer, and gives less desirable results.  The blades burn out quickly and there isn&#x27;t anything redeamable about it.</li>
    <li> Good product &amp; fast delivery.</li>
