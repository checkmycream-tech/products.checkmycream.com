      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sure a lot cleaner than having to dig your fingers into a pot every day!</li>
      <li>love it - the alligator skin under my eyes is disappearing!</li>
      <li>This was a nice moisturizer, but that&#x27;s about it for me.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it has a nice texture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also effective on under-eye shadows with continued use.</li>
      <li>It rubs in nice, and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue or film.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;The product is nicely packaged, and I like the applicator.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice and understated, and did not irritate my eyes at all.</li>
      <li>I found the L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Eye Treatment to be an effective product for under-eye care.</li>
      <li>This is quite nice.  </li>
      <li>Is there some new thing at Saks that will best the performance of the L&#x27;Oreal?</li>
      <li>The best thing about this cream is that it didn&#x27;t sting around my eyes when they felt sensitive from overwork at the computer.</li>
      <li>I recommend it strongly to all ladies!</li>
      <li>Used for 1 month, didnt notice any difference at all, although the cool metal feels good under the eye in the morning.</li>
      <li>Philosophy products work much better</li>
      <li>Otherwise I love the effect and the price.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this eye treatment.</li>
      <li>but I tried many products and the wrinkles were still there.  </li>
      <li>Revitalift Triple Power Eye Treatment\\&quot; is the latest product I have tried.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t love the applicator, though.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but you will eventually start to notice the difference under your eyes because I sure did.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay if you put a lot on, it seems to work.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this great budget-conscious eye cream!</li>
      <li>Will keep using it and will order some more.</li>
      <li>but it felt nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>All in all I enjoyed this product and would use it again.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>this stuff was ok, i didn&#x27;t stay with it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Macys to buy an Estee Lauder eye cream and that worked even better.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite eye cream.</li>
      <li>I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>I would give it more time.</li>
      <li>OK.  </li>
      <li>Thank you to the reviewer who mentioned it!!! :)</li>
      <li>Aside from liking the applicator, I also liked the non-scent, the smooth texture and the lack of greasiness.</li>
      <li>I will keep using it, and hopefully will see more results.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>Wow that made me feel good!</li>
      <li>a texture of the serum, is absorbed by the skin very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth, and help the eliminate fine lines of expressions and wrinkles that affect the look.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful!!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m doing pretty good</li>
      <li>There are many solutions that are natural but this is a great product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am very happy that there is no scent (or light enough</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal makes very good products of which I use on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>On a younger person it should be ideal to treat the under eyes faster and be preventative towards not getting the puffy eyes to start with.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t want to get it in your eye, of course, but gentle, soothing cream feels good all around.</li>
      <li>The metal applicator is nice because it&#x27;s cool and makes it easy to apply the RevitaLift Power Eye Treatment because you can get a precise application without wasting any of the serum.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Other than that I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
      <li>the product is lightweight and easy to massage into the skin around the eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll also add that it seems to be okay when applied to the outer corners of the lower lid; however, I really don&#x27;t have crow&#x27;s feet so can&#x27;t comment on whether or not this is effective.</li>
      <li>I love the cool metal applicator tip.  </li>
      <li>This eye cream does a wonderful job hydrating around the eye, and the dark circles under my eyes *</li>
      <li>Easy to put on, and light greasy touch until soaks in the eye lid.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>Reading the fine print on the side of box, my \\&quot;Recommended</li>
      <li>I really would have liked to see some improvement in the fine lines, but there&#x27;s nothing.</li>
      <li>We don&#x27;t know how this response was elicited, so there&#x27;s no way to know how accurate it</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot and seems to smooth out wrinkles around eyes.</li>
      <li>The L&#x27;oreal feels like a nice moisturizer but my eye cream has to really earn</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a good part of an overall approach to maintaining a healthy look.</li>
      <li>Very pleasant shopping experience!Hope can open more direct mail goods for China！</li>
      <li>Bought it for my eyebags which after 2 weeks use I saw significant improvements.  </li>
      <li>i love it so much !</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s new eye treatment is a nice moisturizer, but that&#x27;s about all we can expect from it.</li>
      <li>I used almost all the Lóreal products to my face and specially for my eye.</li>
      <li>But as far as being effective, it may be too soon to tell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For an eye-specific product, I&#x27;m surprised that it irritated my eyes after 10 minutes or so, much like the feeling when sunscreen gets in your eyes.  Otherwise, it has a nice texture.</li>
    <li> Really makes a difference!</li>
    <li> Just another eye cream that maybe does what it promises if used regularly for a period of time, but I&#x27;m a flake, so I dunno. I also have insomnia and have spent most of my life not getting enough sleep. It shows. There&#x27;s no miracle cure for that, or for my hereditary under eye bags. I&#x27;m only 59. I&#x27;m cursed. My dad had a blepheroplasty (sp?) at 65 and I probably will too.</li>
    <li> i love it so much !Very pleasant shopping experience!Hope can open more direct mail goods for China！</li>
    <li> I was really, really hoping this product would work for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and have not noticed any difference at all around my eyes. No visibly reduced wrinkles, no firmer skin around the eye area, no help for the circles under my eyes. I do like the product is lightweight and easy to massage into the skin around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Triple Power Eye Treatment for about two weeks now. What I like is the cooling sensation as it goes on. It is non-greasy and has a pleasant scent. But as far as being effective, it may be too soon to tell. I have notice a bit of firmness around my eyes since starting to use the product, but that is about it. I will keep using it, and hopefully will see more results.</li>
    <li> I have very fine lines under my eyes and my left eye has a little darkening under it so I wanted to see if the L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Eye Treatment would work and it took about three weeks before I could see any difference. The difference is very subtle and you have to look very closely but I did notice small changes, but nothing dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an African American Woman it is hard to find a product that can effectively fix small lines because our skin is different and we have to use different products but the L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Eye Treatment was perfect on my skin and to me surprisingly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also very careful of what I use on my eyes because I have allergies and anything overly perfumed or too strong will have my eyes teary and runny all day and this eye treatment didn&#x27;t cause any issues and I was able to get really close to apply the cream. The metal applicator is nice because it&#x27;s cool and makes it easy to apply the RevitaLift Power Eye Treatment because you can get a precise application without wasting any of the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great eye treatment but it doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but you will eventually start to notice the difference under your eyes because I sure did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old woman in the military, which means high stress and little sleep.  I&#x27;ve had dark eye circles and under-eye bags/wrinkles even since I was a little kid. I&#x27;ve never had a product give me the results this has.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and within 3 days I could see my eyes noticeably brighter.  After 2 weeks my dark circles are minimal - even without makeup. I&#x27;m starting to see less wrinkles and puffiness now, and hopefully those continue to improve. I even noticed today that my eyes feel more open.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cream or surgery, but it&#x27;s definitely  worth at least twice its cost.  I highly recommend it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I started out using it on both eyes, but didn&#x27;t see any difference, so I went to using it on one eye only. After a couple of weeks I don&#x27;t see any difference between my eyes. I really would have liked to see some improvement in the fine lines, but there&#x27;s nothing. Maybe it didn&#x27;t work because it didn&#x27;t absorb very well. It just sat there on the surface of my skin looking greasy, so I used my finger to rub it in. I suspect that worked because my finger absorbed the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t like the applicator. It has a metal tip with a hole in it through which the product squeezes out. I found that the tip dragged and pulled on my eyelid. Instead of using the tip, I dabbed the product on my eyelid, then replaced the cap, and used the tip of the cap to spread the product under my eye. That worked quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin products are so hit and miss. They work for one person, and not for another. One person has an allergic reaction, but another person doesn&#x27;t. I think we&#x27;re all in the same boat, and have to keep trying products until we find something that works for us. Unfortunately, that means spending a lot of money trying different products. This one didn&#x27;t work for me, so I&#x27;m going to keep looking. Good luck in your own search.</li>
    <li> Basically, I think you&#x27;re getting from L&#x27;Oreal what you would have been spending 10 times as much 5 years ago at Saks. After a week of use I found the crepeiness in my upper eye area visibly reduced as well as some of the puffiness of my lower lids. Is there some new thing at Saks that will best the performance of the L&#x27;Oreal? Probably. It likely will cost you $300 and go off before you finish it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caveat that I am not fond of the applicator. Product tends to dry out in the opening. Other than that I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> I do love this product albeit a bit pricey, I do think it takes the  puffy eye down but you must use this EVERY night in order to make a difference. The other great product of theres is the Triple Power night / day cream. Honesty erased my wrinkles on the fore head!</li>
    <li> I think this eye cream is a lot of hype without much substance. Reading the front of the box, the Triple Power claim sounded promising. Reading the fine print on the side of box, my \\&quot;Recommended Regimen\\&quot;, I&#x27;m confused about how and why this eye cream should even fit into my routine, or what exactly it&#x27;s supposed to do. The side of the box tells me that I&#x27;m supposed to be using 3 separate eye creams over the course of one day. Why doesn&#x27;t one cream do it all for me? I didn&#x27;t realize \\&quot;Triple Power\\&quot; meant \\&quot;This is only part of Triple the amount of products I actually need in order to see any results.\\&quot; The stainless steel applicator provides some cooling effect, but I didn&#x27;t notice that it actually helped with the bags under my eyes when I woke up. The cream itself has a zingy feel, but I didn&#x27;t notice any actual tightening or firming of my eye area, even with morning and evening use over an extended period (a few weeks). It definitely provides moisture, but I wouldn&#x27;t pick it over my regular moisturizer. I&#x27;d leave this one on the shelf and keep looking.</li>
    <li> I started seeing changes in the skin under my eyes. This product was helpful</li>
    <li> It is good since it is especially for the eyes, and it takes a special cream to go near the eye area. This one I would rate very good.</li>
    <li> It has been my experience that viewing one&#x27;s reflection and seeing something that wasn&#x27;t there the last time is virtually never a good thing. This was certainly true when, after using L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Eye Treatment as directed for &lt;a week, I was greeted by a large, puffy welt of sorts under one eye and its less horrible little sister under another. The irony of this unattractive surprise is that something like this serves to make its unhappy host look older than she did before it made its appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s at this point that I should mention that I have exceptionally nice but somewhat sensitive skin. L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Eye Treatment seems to be unscented but stung ever so slightly when I applied it. I was eventually able to reduce the inflammation with the use of cortisone-based ointment, so the damage wasn&#x27;t lasting. I&#x27;ll also add that it seems to be okay when applied to the outer corners of the lower lid; however, I really don&#x27;t have crow&#x27;s feet so can&#x27;t comment on whether or not this is effective. However, I have some under-eye darkness and am somewhat disappointed that I won&#x27;t be able to see if this is an effective treatment. I&#x27;m continuing to use it on the outer corners of my eyes and if it seems to improve the area, I&#x27;ll update. On the plus side, I like the metal tip--it really is cooling and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: proceed with caution if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Eye Doctor recommended lid lift but I was determined to try anything first.  This worked almost immediately.  It tightens the lids and is used at morning and night.  I have gotten two so if it is stopped I will have one.  I am 70 so if I was in my 40&#x27;s I would have started then.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this eye cream for a couple weeks but I do believe I see a difference.  Luckily I don&#x27;t have wrinkles around my eyes, but I do have puffy bags under them.  After putting this on morning and night after I wash my face, my eyes are looking less puffy.  Hopefully they will continue to improve over the next 6 to 8 weeks.  It has a nice texture, absorbs in well, very little fragrance, and the metal applicator tip helps you to glide the cream on without pulling on the skin around your eyes. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Wow! I absolutely LOVE this eye treatment. I&#x27;m 74 and wrinkles suddenly appeared. Don&#x27;t know how that happened but I tried many products and the wrinkles were still there.  I tried several eye treatments, even L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code which I liked, but it still didn&#x27;t give me that smooth look. I purchased the RevitaLift Triple Power Eye Treatment and I swear I noticed a difference from day one. My neighbor told me the other day. You have beautiful skin and no wrinkles and look at me. Wow that made me feel good! Love this product!</li>
    <li> I ordered L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Eye Treatment a couple weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve applied it every morning and every night, and my eyes do seem improved. It doesnt work instantaneously, but what skin care product does? If you use it everyday, within a couple weeks, you should see a difference. My only complaint is it did irritate my eyes just a bit but I have sensitive eyes and haven&#x27;t found an eye cream that doesn&#x27;t. I just have to be careful not to get it on my lids. If anyone knows something you can moisturize your lids with that won&#x27;t irritate your eyes, please let me know.</li>
    <li> I recommend this eye cream for any woman who wants to reduce puffiness, erase under-eye wrinkles (often caused by dry skin as much as aging!), moisturize the delicate skin under and around her eyes, and help erase wrinkles and delay aging.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin and allergies, including psoriasis, but this cream is soothing to my skin.  I&#x27;ve never experienced swelling, itching or a rash with it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to see some improvement, but it&#x27;s just not happening.  I guess I&#x27;ve been using this for six weeks or so, but no change in undereye circles or any lift in upper lids.  I&#x27;ve used Olay Regenerist products for several years, and can&#x27;t say I really saw any difference in my eye area with them either, so maybe an earlier reviewer was right that there is simply not much that will effect change in the eye area, but I&#x27;ll keep trying!</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a year ago and it has really helped with the wrinkles sags and lines under my eyes and I have to say that they are almost invisible. If you doubt it try it for a while you will probably see some results but give it time. I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s new eye treatment is a nice moisturizer, but that&#x27;s about all we can expect from it. It does have a cooling tip that feels nice and cold when you hold it against your undereye area.  I doubt this is of much therapeutic value, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients consist mainly of some hydrating oil, a lot of water and some hyaluronic acid, another type of moisturizer.  What hyaluronic acid is, actually, is a magnet for water.  It holds water inside skin cells like a little sponge. This is good and bad. It&#x27;s good because the water plumps out tiny wrinkles making them less visible. Temporarily. And that&#x27;s the key word. It does not repair wrinkles, just fill them out...for a while. That&#x27;s where you get  dramatic lift mentioned in the product description. And please note, that&#x27;s not clinically proven dramatic results. It&#x27;s based on consumer response. We don&#x27;t know how this response was elicited, so there&#x27;s no way to know how accurate it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I saw for myself was some minor plumping up of the very fine wrinkles...the ones that really don&#x27;t matter. Those deep, entrenched ones...no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there is a downside to hyaluronic acid. Remember, it&#x27;s a water magnet...and water is what&#x27;s making eyes so puffy.  If you have swollen, tired looking eyes, the last thing you need is more water retention.  You can get rid of puffiness with a cold eye compress (I like a bag of frozen peas and and 20 minute nap), cold cucumber slices, or chilled, used teabags. No need for an expensive cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does Revitalift work on real undereye bags?  No. Those pouches are filled with fat and only a surgeon fix them.  No topical treatment will make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, enough gloom.  Here&#x27;s the good news. L&#x27;Oreal Rvitalift Triple Power Eye Treatment has apricot kernal oil, which is a dense, long-lasting and excellent humectant with anti-oxidant properties.  This will help prevent existing wrinkles from getting worse, and may even prevent new wrinkles. It won&#x27;t do much for the severe ones that already exist, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fix those, you have to go back in time and select the right ancestors, because youthful looking skin is an inherited trait. Then, starting at about ten years of age, keep out of the sun and wear a heavy-duty sunblock at all times.  If your time machine is in the shop, get to know a good dermatologist and invest in Botox and cosmetic fillers.  After a while, you may want to start googling cosmetic surgeons as well. And investigate Endermologie. It&#x27;s a mechanical massage treatment from France and if I had not tried it myself, I would&#x27;t believe how good the results are. But again, like the injectibles and the surgery, it&#x27;s not cheap. But you do get your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no quick fixes.w wrinkles.

    <li> The best thing about this cream is that it didn&#x27;t sting around my eyes when they felt sensitive from overwork at the computer. You don&#x27;t want to get it in your eye, of course, but gentle, soothing cream feels good all around. This treatment is non-greasy, fast absorbing and I found myself gently tapping a little around my eyes through the day. I&#x27;ll definitely use this brand again.</li>
    <li> I love the cool metal applicator tip.  It feels like my eye area is getting a nice relaxing massage.  You do, however, have to make sure you squeeze out enough of the cream or the tip will drag.  It seems to work well as a moisturizer for the sensitive eye area; nonetheless, after using for a month, I couldn&#x27;t tell that my lines or the occasional bagginess was any different.  My lines and bagginess are very mild, so perhaps there wasn&#x27;t much it could do.  The cream is unscented and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy oil residue.  I plan to use it a little longer and see how things work out.  It&#x27;s worth a try since each person responds differently to products.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at what this little tube can do!  I have noticed a dramatic difference and even my friends have said that I don&#x27;t look so tired. I love this product! Super fast shipping also!</li>
    <li> This item works well on the under eye circles.  It takes away the sleepless under-eye bags.  It feels cool on application and is priced just right.  The seller packaged this item well and sent it to my door in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Very suitable for women over the age of 40y . My wrinkles around the eyes definitely decreased. I recommend it strongly to all ladies!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 weeks but dont notice any changes. It works more as a moisturizer than anything else, which helps in this harsh winter weather.  My slight puffiness is still there though and the lines are still the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a \\&quot;drug store brand\\&quot; eye cream.  Until this one-- and I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.  This eye cream does a wonderful job hydrating around the eye, and the dark circles under my eyes *have* lessened.  The (genetic) under-eye puffiness has not noticeably diminished, but nothing seems to shift this.  And the price can&#x27;t be beat (I&#x27;ve paid a LOT more for less effectiveness).  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this great budget-conscious eye cream!</li>
    <li> Tried it for a month, saw no difference around my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I have some pretty baggy eyes, but I saw no positive effect from this product.</li>
    <li> This was a nice moisturizer, but that&#x27;s about it for me. Maybe if you are in your 30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have a lot of other things going on, this would be something you&#x27;d like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a surface roughness in/around my eyes. Well I did have, until I used another eye product for a couple of months and eliminated that crepey texture. I wanted to try the L&#x27;Oreal to see if it could work as well (at a cheaper price). At the end of my 30 day trial, the crepey texture has creeped back to my eyelid area. The L&#x27;oreal feels like a nice moisturizer but my eye cream has to really earn it&#x27;s keep, I&#x27;m not getting any younger and sure don&#x27;t want to have to buy multiple products for the eye area! I had just gotten used to enjoying the mid-shimmer type eyeshadows again after the texture of my eye skin had improved so much with the other product, but I noticed yesterday at work that my eyeshadow was starting to look like asphalt on my lids. That&#x27;s a familiar look and not one I want to return to, thanks. I&#x27;m back to using my other eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is nicely packaged, and I like the applicator. It&#x27;s sure a lot cleaner than having to dig your fingers into a pot every day! You can also put it in the fridge for a cool treat on your eye area. Just be prepared the first time you touch that tip to your undereye area, not to jump and stab yourself in the eye. I was NOT expecting it to be so cold and it was a bit of a shock.  The smell is nice and understated, and did not irritate my eyes at all. It was thick enough  to stay where it was put.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product that will tighten up my upper eyelids because when I get tired, they really sag and my eyelashes can irritate my eyes. It&#x27;s a family trait, and I&#x27;ve talked to my doctor about it, but he said any surgery to correct it would be viewed by insurance as cosmetic. I&#x27;ve tried Avon Anew Clinical EyeLift and Argan oil with minimal results, so I thought I&#x27;d try the L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift product. I have to say that although I am not totally thrilled with the results, after three weeks, it gives the best results so far. It seems that most people are looking to minimize signs of aging under the eyes, but I don&#x27;t have much of a problem there. The skin over my eyes and the lids feel somewhat firmer, and I&#x27;m not experiencing the irritation from eyelashes that was bothering me before. So, for half the cost of the Avon  and Argan products, I&#x27;ll keep using this one for awhile longer. The applicator is cool and soothes the skin after a long day. It doesn&#x27;t sting at all and the smell is very minimal. I&#x27;d recommend this product for the areas both over and under the eyes. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I found the L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Eye Treatment to be an effective product for under-eye care. It only takes the smallest dab for under-eye and eyelid/browbone area. I like the texture and I found the product work well on my sensitive skin. I use it for hydration and wrinkle prevention. It&#x27;s also effective on under-eye shadows with continued use. A quality product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really reduce any of the lines under my eyes....didn&#x27;t make it worse either. I&#x27;m starting to wonder if any of these products do anything at all....I will continue my search for the perfect product ....</li>
    <li> L&#x27;oreal products are hard to find, but worth the search. These are the best products on the market. They work well and don&#x27;t leave skin greasy.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and experience trouble with most creams around the eyes but this cream is amazing. I wear all day and reapply at bedtime. Great results.</li>
    <li> I am bothered when I use products with Retinol in them, tried this since it did not list it in the ingredients.  It really does help your skin to exfoliate itself.  Nothing drastic but over time it may make a difference.  No irritation at all.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a substitute for the Genie Instant Line Smoother that I always buy, but had run out of.  This sounded promising, but it did absolutely nothing to reduce the puffiness under my eyes.  I will say, though, that it definitely had a softening effect on my skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this out after reading the reviews on here. However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the product for me. I&#x27;ve tried it on every night religiously for over a month-- with NO improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Macys to buy an Estee Lauder eye cream and that worked even better.</li>
    <li> So far I have not noticed any change,but it could be that I have not used it long enough.I would give it more time.</li>
    <li> I like it - not sure I&#x27;ll get it again - there are a few other items on teh market I&#x27;d like to try for the price ... but overall the puffiness was improved and the soothing nature of the cream was effective + the wrinkles are still held at bay -  &amp;#62;&#x27;&#x27;&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> Me: Late 40&#x27;s, dry, sensitive skin. This is almost like a serum, it&#x27;s a runny cream. I like the coolness of the metal on my skin and using this to apply around the delicate eye area is better than tapping with your fingers. But the first time I went outside and sweated, it migrated up into my eyes and burned like crazy. And after using 2 days, my crows feet appeared worse.</li>
    <li> The cream feels immediately cooling upon application. The scent is very mild and though i have sensitive skin, i noticed no irritation after use. The cream is not greasy and appears to be a good option for eye treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B001IZ0ZFQ Clinique All About Eyes--/1OZ]], and this eye cream is fairly similar in both price and effectiveness. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after switching from All About Eyes to this Revitalift Eye Treatment, so I&#x27;m guessing that neither product can make a gal in her mid-50s look 25 again, and that Clinique had done what could be done before I switched to the L&#x27;Oreal. (L&#x27;Oreal \\&quot;overdescribed\\&quot; their eye cream, however -- it&#x27;s not a miracle cream, and I get annoyed when products can&#x27;t live up to their grand claims.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t love the applicator, though. It&#x27;s nice on a warm morning to apply the cool metal tip of the tube directly to my undereyes, but either that way, and just squirting some of the cream onto my finger to apply, the applicator gets a bit messy. I find that I prefer Clinique&#x27;s little tub of cream with a screw-top lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. November 12, 2013: When I could no longer squeeze lotion out of the tube, it still felt somewhat heavy, so I snipped off the top 1/3 or so of the tube with scissors. Lo and behold, there was a LOT of lotion left in the two ends. I clipped notches into half of the tube so I could slide the other half back into it as a kind of lid, and so far I&#x27;ve just been pinching one side or the other of the tube to squeeze more product out. Eventually I&#x27;ll use a Q-Tip, but if you&#x27;re as thrifty as I am, you&#x27;ll want to use up this huge amount of extra eye creme that remains in the tube.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other eye creams for the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes, but I&#x27;ve had much better results with this product. The applicator tip stays cold and reduces puffiness almost IMMEDIATELY.  Even hours later, I could still tell the differed.  Plus, it feels relaxing when applying right after a shower. I had considered buying higher end products with applicator tips, but I don&#x27;t know that they&#x27;d work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, it not only goes on easier, it works better too.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about my eye creams (I&#x27;m at an age that I have to be).  So, I&#x27;m actually surprised for the price that this works so well.  A quick review of the ingredients shows me that it contains very similar ingredients to one I use that costs three times as much that I have been a fan of ever since my dermatologist recommended it to me.  But, this one is knocking it out on sheer value.  Here are the things that I like about this that I think helps it deliver.&lt;br /&gt;1. CAFFEINE AND COLD: I always look for something that contains caffeine (they are hard to find), but for me I&#x27;ve found that helps eliminate puffiness - just like cold tea bags on your eyes long enough will.  This ones application also provides a cooling effect.&lt;br /&gt;2. AMPLE DEEP MOISTURIZING: Keeps those lines from getting or showing up too deep.&lt;br /&gt;3. NO SCENT/BREAK OUT FACTORS: One would think I&#x27;d hit an age I didn&#x27;t have to worry about that.  But, sensitive skin is sensitive skin - and this one works with mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Very good value that does all three of the things that it says it will do.  Way to go L&#x27;oreal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve fought a battle against the deep, deep crow&#x27;s feet that inflict all the males in my family--my brother and father have eyes you could run rivers through.  And while it may not be the most manly thing in the world I have regularly used eye moisturizers for years.  I&#x27;m doing pretty good so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Eye Treatment\\&quot; is the latest product I have tried. Like most eye treatments, it has an aggrandizing name and lots of promises that it couldn&#x27;t possibly live up to. There is no magic. But it does as good a job holding off the tides of time as any other product I have used. I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic improvement over the two weeks that I have been using it, but it seems to work just as well as my previous eye treatments I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is a little weird--a cold, metal wand that you use to squirt around your eyes. I&#x27;m reminded of the Tin Man oiling his joints whenever I use this. Its cold, which can be refreshing on summer mornings but I&#x27;m not sure how much I will love it come winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy that there is no scent (or light enough I couldn&#x27;t tell). As a guy I really don&#x27;t want scent with my eye treatment. It rubs in nice, and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue or film.  All in all I enjoyed this product and would use it again.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working quite well!  I use it with the L&#x27;Oreal night creme as well, and I think its an extra good boost. I am only 22 but I think it is helping a ton already !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the package.One side is placed eye treatment,but another side is empty.I need some explanations.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Eye Treatment for about 3 weeks.  It appears to be taking the puffiness down under my eyes and each day I can see a difference.  I gave this a 4 star because I want to use the whole .5 fluid ounces so I can make a final judgement of this product.  I would rather of had this product work a little faster but some things you just can hurry the process and have to be patient.  So far it is doing what I want it to do.  On a younger person it should be ideal to treat the under eyes faster and be preventative towards not getting the puffy eyes to start with.  L&#x27;Oreal makes very good products of which I use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I am on the younger side of the spectrum for the target consumer of this product and don&#x27;t yet have too many problem areas around my eyes, but I didn&#x27;t notice much change when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It was not irritating and doesn&#x27;t have a lingering scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I personally would not pay full price for this. I&#x27;m of the opinion that natural things (such as better sleep, better hydration, and healthy eating) can also improve the look of the area around the eye, just as this product claims.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think the metal \\&quot;cooling applicator\\&quot; is silly and a marketing gimmick. Of course it is cooling, it&#x27;s metal. I preferred to apply the cream with my finger, and the cream itself is also cool to the touch as it is first applied.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I felt that the cream didn&#x27;t absorb too well into my skin. On more than one occasion, I noticed myself rubbing dry cream off which had not absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for those who want to try a product from the beauty aisle, this one might do the trick for less cost than very high-priced brands. It isn&#x27;t going to work overnight, as the box claims that after 3-4 weeks X% of people found improvement in under eye circles, wrinkles and puffiness. Not everyone will find a change in their under-eye area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye treatment for a month and really have not been able to tell a difference. The only good thing about this is it did not irritate my skin as many facial products do.</li>
    <li> Very happy with it.  Bought it for my eyebags which after 2 weeks use I saw significant improvements.  Under eye bags looks receded.  Will keep using it and will order some more.</li>
    <li> Makes my 56 year old feel supple, love it</li>
    <li> I love it and may eye looks fresh and soft , My face is too white and I have to take care of it. I used almost all the Lóreal products to my face and specially for my eye. I only used a drop for each one and the fluid stay with me about two months.</li>
    <li> Works great its about the only one I can use that does not give me allergy because it dries up fast.  I&#x27;ll keep using it,</li>
    <li> love it - the alligator skin under my eyes is disappearing!</li>
    <li> Normally when I use an eye treatment for dark circles, I use a q-tip and dip it into the jar so as not to contaminate the rest of the stuff.  This applicator is terrific.  It actually does feel cool when applying and it also keeps one from having to use q-tips or their germy fingers.  Of course this is not a miracle cure for bags or circles.  I have used a lot of different (men&#x27;s) eye creams and have always gotten just minimal results.  I think bags and circles are hereditary and can&#x27;t be fixed by an eye treatment, no matter what the manufacturer claims.  Still, this one felt good going on and I did see a hint of improvement after three weeks of daily use.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  Aside from liking the applicator, I also liked the non-scent, the smooth texture and the lack of greasiness.</li>
    <li> Seems to work a little better than Revitalift Double Eye Lift and I like having only the one product.</li>
    <li> Helps to lessen the appearance of puffy eye&#x27;s and dark circles. It is best if you use it morning and at bedtime. Works better than other products I have used. Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Helps with bags and wrinkles</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  I use it in the morning when I&#x27;m bicycling.</li>
    <li> Puffy eyes?  There are many solutions that are natural but this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I believe this really helps with wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Attention all...this is a complete waste of cash. I saw another review on here &amp; she suggested Bel Essence cream. I read those reviews &amp; decided to try it. WOW!!!! Click on over to Bel Essence, it is a miracle in a jar!!!!!! I had some faint under eye wrinkles &amp; they are completely gone. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I look like I had plastic surgery. Thank you to the reviewer who mentioned it!!! :)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. I followed the directions but seen no change at all</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes of shrinking my under-eye bags caused by watery eyes. It didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> Received promptly and in New condition.  I&#x27;ve been using for a month or so and everything seems a bit tighter, so I&#x27;m please with the results.</li>
    <li> I just bought this after running out of my Neutrogena eye serum, which is so hard to find! ( Just ordered it from Amazon). It is actually drying and has created more lines! I am throwing this out! Can&#x27;t wait to get my order,&lt;br /&gt;I may just have to go to half a dozen stores to see if I can find my fav. product in the meantime!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye cream. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot and seems to smooth out wrinkles around eyes.</li>
    <li> I am always trying a new face/eye cream. There is no magic fix. That being said. This cream I will probably keep using until I find something else. It does absorb well and makes the skin softer but I really do not see any other difference.</li>
    <li> I had never used this product before, however I use L&#x27;Oreal shampoo &amp; conditioner and am very happy with it, so I thought I would give the eye cream a try.  I will consider more L&#x27;Oreal products in the future.</li>
    <li> The use of L&#x27;Oreal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it everyday and night with no visible changes. Sadly, I purchased two of them. I don&#x27;t plan on buying this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to shop for a product that soften or eliminate the bags under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I must admit I like having an eye cream that is easy to apply - the applicator tip is cool to the touch because it&#x27;s metal, which probably helps if you have puffy eyes (if you don&#x27;t like anything cold against your skin, beware). You squeeze a little out and then gently touch and rub, and you&#x27;re done. I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference, but there hasn&#x27;t been any negative effect, either.</li>
    <li> I usually buy the higher priced eye creams, but was pleasantly surprised with this one.  It works as good as the more expensive eye creams at a 1/4 of the cost!  I have very oily skin so the fact it goes on as a serum is great for me.  Now I want to try other products in this line.</li>
    <li> Not that it&#x27;s expensive, but save your money.  I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully for three months and have not seen one difference.  I highly recommend drinking more water than buying this product.</li>
    <li> I definitely agree that skin needs to be tended to and nurtured. While good nutrition, ample hydration, and proper sleep are all critical components, a good moisturizer can help as well. That helps protect the skin from the outside, while you make sure it&#x27;s healthy from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this product is gentle and does not irritate my skin. I tend to be sensitive to a variety of products and often it&#x27;s hard for me to find something that my skin is OK with. This worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a miracle face lift? No. But it&#x27;s a good part of an overall approach to maintaining a healthy look.</li>
    <li> I do like this.  We recently lost our beloved sweet dog of 12.5 years and I thought the puffiness in my eyes from crying would never go away the first few days.  This helped and I am using it every night now before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a 3 piece kit ... they came in 3 piece set.  This L-Oreal Paris RevitaLife Triple Power Eye, L&#x27;Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power and the L&#x27;Oreal Nighttime Revitalift Triple Power .... great price too! for all three sets.</li>
    <li> this stuff was ok, i didn&#x27;t stay with it.  no smell and wasn&#x27;t greasy but i didn&#x27;t see any results with it after a couple months of use</li>
    <li> This is a new product from loreal, and that  surprised me, because is very efficient!&lt;br /&gt;Has a texture of the serum, is absorbed by the skin very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth, and help the eliminate fine lines of expressions and wrinkles that affect the look.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I noticed that the skin around my eyes was getting a bit loose. I am 27, and thought this might make them a bit brighter and tighter. It works great! I love how much it has improved my eyelids and under my eyes as well. This little tube lasts a long time, and this price is much better than in the store! I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for under eye puffiness. I was using Roc&#x27;s version, but wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted. I have dark circles, not bad though, and pretty bad puffiness. I found that this helped both issues a lot. In fact, I was looking in the mirror earlier today and really noticed that my eyes are not near as puffy as they used to be. Actually, you can&#x27;t really tell anymore. It&#x27;s not surgery, and it&#x27;s not a miricle worker, but if you hang in there it seems to make a difference. Since it&#x27;s so inexpensive, I applied it thich and worked it in gently both morning and night after washing my face. It&#x27;s non-greasy and non-scented (that I can tell anyways). I suggest trying it out.</li>
    <li> Used for 1 month, didnt notice any difference at all, although the cool metal feels good under the eye in the morning. Philosophy products work much better</li>
    <li> This really works.  Put on at bedtime and great reduction in bags in the am.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Use Loreal all the time.this one stumps me. Don&#x27;t see any real improvement,but then again, things haven&#x27;t gotten worse. Wish it worked on slight &amp;#34;crapeing &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product works well to moisturize but I haven&#x27;t seen a difference as far as smoothing lines or wrinkles.  I like it though. I have eczema on my eyes and it seems to help with the dryness.</li>
    <li> This is quite nice.  I think it is the applicator that makes it feel good.  This product doesn&#x27;t smell which is good.  I don&#x27;t know if it did any real good on wrinkles but it felt nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay if you put a lot on, it seems to work. But really just depends on your level of eye bags.</li>
    <li> I appreciate the product arriving earlier than expected. I enjoy these products very much.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these products to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Also I recommend your service.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is not greasy but it did tighten the skin around eye area! I&#x27;m still in search of a great eye cream!:))</li>
    <li> I like to use, let me soft skin</li>
    <li> Works with in 15 mins for puffiness, and about 30 for dark circles. Easy to put on, and light greasy touch until soaks in the eye lid.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to put concealer over or eye make up. Only thing is after a few hours it can stick to your eye lashes, but a quick swipe and it comes right up. Otherwise I love the effect and the price.</li>
    <li> OK.  So of all the firming and rejuvenating products out there, this one actually gives you a noticeable firmness right after you put in on.  It will not renew you skin, but when you use it, it will minimize lines.</li>
    <li> I would say this is a good preventative for &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; or wrinkles. It did nothing to disperse or even temporary relieve my undereye lines. I would say get it to try it on yourself. We&#x27;re all different!</li>
    <li> SEEMS WRINKLES OR BAGS GOT BIGGER WHICH I DONT LIKE AND MAYBE SOMETHING IAM DOING WRONG THE WAY IS AM USING IT AS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IBOUGHT IT.</li>
