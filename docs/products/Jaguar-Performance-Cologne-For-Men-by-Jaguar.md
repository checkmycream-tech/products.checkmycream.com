      <li>I really liked it.</li>
      <li>is nice aswell.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping - Great prices for the most part - Great customer service...</li>
      <li>Nice fresh smell and great price.</li>
      <li>This is a good perfume in the lot and it is mild though.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found this for my hubby.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>Paid a lot more in the department stores...</li>
      <li>I love the scent and the girls fascinated about</li>
      <li>Nice clean, manly aroma.  </li>
      <li>Authentic new and great buy.</li>
      <li>I get so much compliments everywhere that I go about how good I smell.</li>

      <li>and I have re purchased this and same great service and item.</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance at decent price.</li>
      <li>/frank, the packaging is good, the pricing is ok, but the core attributes are not what I had expected from the original jaguar.</li>
      <li>If this is not done then a warm fragrance sprayed will not smell the same and have more of an alcohol and synthetic vibe to it which does not do the fragrance justice.</li>
      <li>You will smell pleasant, but people around you won&#x27;t necessarily notice it unless they are close.</li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s great, I used that perfume long time ago and now still being my favorite, thanks a lot</li>
      <li>this specific item, does not have the original smell - to be fair</li>
      <li>was not too sweet of a smell.</li>
      <li>It hits the spot and is not too sweet.</li>
      <li>Most colognes once shipped have been in warm shipping environments for a certain duration and need to cool to the proper temperature to have the formula ready for enjoying.</li>
      <li>what real men wear the cologne for in the first place :)</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>for the price I think it worth to buy one.</li>
      <li>The sweet smell reminds of our times together when we got married.</li>
      <li>Great cologne for such a low price.</li>
      <li>I ran out and found it on Amazon at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I use it on regular basis, will order more.</li>
      <li>Subtle and smells great.</li>
      <li>Also anyone who orders online make sure it ships from and is sold by Amazon and always remember to let your fragrance cool down before trying it on.</li>
      <li>Gift for my husband as he really enjoys the scent without being over powered by it.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>The smell is good, a variety of cologne, and it lasts for many hours (but does not last as compared to the expensive ones that we get from stores, Hope you understand)&lt;br</li>
      <li>This scent is not as strong as the other Jaguar colognes.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>

    <li> This &amp;#34;appears&amp;#34; to be a fake - i have personally used this for several years now and this was the only brand perfume that i ever got compliments for, bu this specific item, does not have the original smell - to be fair/frank, the packaging is good, the pricing is ok, but the core attributes are not what I had expected from the original jaguar. I will not order this specific product from the internet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this everywhere last time I saw it at a store was $60. So I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s going to be small bc of the price but it isn&#x27;t . It&#x27;s going to be my husband&#x27;s b day present on Monday. I love it, I bet THEY will too!</li>
    <li> I THINK THESE IS A GOOD CHOISE  SMELL REAL GOOD AND THE PRICE IS PERFECT.  I GAVE IT AS A GIFT AND MY BOYFRIEND LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Great smelling Cologne.. Be using it since 2006. Great price vs in Dillards. Paid a lot more in the department stores...Great Value</li>
    <li> Nice clean, manly aroma.  Women that have noticed have complimented me on it.</li>
    <li> Excellent store. Everything was as expected with product and product deliver on time. Everything perfect buying from them and I would buy with them again.</li>
    <li> Like the frangrace but doesn&#x27;t last too long. Wear this cologne everyday and I have 10 hour working day. It last for about 5-6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;But for the price I think it worth to buy one. Did try other jaguar frangrances but this is the best for me.</li>
    <li> very nice perfume, that&#x27;s great, I used that perfume long time ago and now still being my favorite, thanks a lot</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance.  Some people already told me that I smell good when wearing it.</li>
    <li> Authentic new and great buy. The product is always in time and I have re purchased this and same great service and item.</li>
    <li> cologne is great. I am a frequent purchaser of this type. It hits the spot and is not too sweet. Nice fresh smell and great price.</li>
    <li> Wow! I waited too long to review this product. I&#x27;ve used this product faithfully for 11 years. Nothing has changed about it. I get so much compliments everywhere that I go about how good I smell. Smells last longer.</li>
    <li> This scent is not as strong as the other Jaguar colognes. However, it does have a pleasant aroma that I would recommend to young and middle-aged men. You will smell pleasant, but people around you won&#x27;t necessarily notice it unless they are close.</li>
    <li> Unique Citrus and Peppermint smell which long lasting. can be used for formal and casual use...  2 day shipping was just amazing</li>

    <li> Product was well packed and service/response was rapid.  I would use this seller again.</li>
    <li> Awesome perfume, smells great and well worth the price. Would definitely purchase again and recommend to others. Tony from queens</li>
    <li> Cologne was a great product. was not too sweet of a smell. shipped promptly and arrived on time. had no problems with order. my husband has tried all of the jaguar colognes and likes them all. would recommend this to anyone. i bought this as a gift for my hubby.</li>
    <li> Great cologne for such a low price. It has great projection, longevity and the smell is nice aswell. I also asked a few females for their opinion and they all liked the fragrance and rated it above average. After all isn&#x27;t that what real men wear the cologne for in the first place :) Also anyone who orders online make sure it ships from and is sold by Amazon and always remember to let your fragrance cool down before trying it on. Most colognes once shipped have been in warm shipping environments for a certain duration and need to cool to the proper temperature to have the formula ready for enjoying. If this is not done then a warm fragrance sprayed will not smell the same and have more of an alcohol and synthetic vibe to it which does not do the fragrance justice.</li>
    <li> Good product. Nice fragrance at decent price. I use it on regular basis, will order more.</li>

    <li> This is a good perfume in the lot and it is mild though. The smell is good, a variety of cologne, and it lasts for many hours (but does not last as compared to the expensive ones that we get from stores, Hope you understand)&lt;br /&gt;Most of my friends like the smell and I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tempest...</li>

    <li> I am so glad I found this for my hubby. The sweet smell reminds of our times together when we got married. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Distinguished, alluring, strong, but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> This has a fresh, sporty and long lasting fragrance. At this price, I have nothing to complain about. The mild, yet lasting fragrance makes it a perfect for a day time use.</li>
    <li> Subtle and smells great. I hate strong overbearing colognes and this one fits the bill.</li>
    <li> good transaction, item was as described.</li>
