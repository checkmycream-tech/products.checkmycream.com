<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It came when expected and was as described. Perfect for my gym bag. No longer worried about melting my bag or items in it.</li>
    <li> It is 12 inch long, not 13 inch like it says in the description.&lt;br /&gt;It looks nice, seems well build but I measured it (because I couldn&#x27;t fit my flat iron in it) and it is 12 inch not 13inch long.  Frustrating that the manufacturer provides the wrong specs.</li>
    <li> Seems to be good tool.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Nice for travel- fits Onei Flat Iron well. High quality travel pouch. Nice that it shields from heat for when on-the-run. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is good product. I have a Chi straightener and it fits perfectly in the pouch. Perfect for when you are traveling. The actual plug-in does not fit in the larger pouch or the smaller outside pouch, but the Chi has a large plug-in. If you have a straightener with a normal size plug-in then it would fit in the outside smaller pouch. Overall it did the job and my Chi traveled onto a cruise line unharmed.</li>
    <li> I always hate waving my curling iron in the air trying to cool it off the morning of a return flight. This makes it SO much easier, just stick the hot thing right in there and you&#x27;re good to go. I use it with my larger size InStyler and it fits.</li>
    <li> Allows me to get ready in the morning and immediately pack.  No need to wait for my Chi to cool down.  Perfect for business travel.</li>
    <li> it was a good size and it did hold up the heat from exiting the pouch. Only thing is I wish it had a handle or strap on top or side to hold or use to hang on hook.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a case for my flat iron when I came across this product. I love it. My one inch flat iron fit perfectly and the elastic and pouch on the back was great for the cord. I would highly recommend this product. It is great for traveling, or everyday use!</li>
    <li> My sister was looking for a pouch for her flat iron. Rolling up the cord while waiting for the iron to cool off is a long process so a good pouch can make a world of difference. I ordered this one because it seemed like a good deal and it turned out to be great. The pouch is large so it can easily fit a larger flat iron as well as a smaller travel iron. On top of that, the little differences set this one apart. The storage area on the back for the cord is great. With some pouches, you have to roll the cord up next to the iron itself and hope it doesn&#x27;t make contact and burn if it shifts around in a bag or suitcase. Also, this one stores vertically so you don&#x27;t have to worry about rolling the iron and cord in on itself. It just drops right in, you seal the velcro and you&#x27;re good to go. If you have a family member or girlfriend you travel with that needs a decent flat iron pouch, this is definitely one you should consider.</li>
    <li> Yes i loved this straightening iron. It gets hot really quick. I have thick frizzy hair and i use straightening brush and works great. It even turns off after a bit so you have to pay attention make sure it don&#x27;t turn off on you. I take a long time because i have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s long down my back.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. She seemed to like it ! Great quality :)</li>
    <li> My iron it is a little to big for the pouch, it won&#x27;t close all the way but it is good enough.</li>
    <li> I am totally happy with my Onei Heat Shield Flat Iron Travel Pouch.  It fits my Chi flat iron perfectly and will make packing so much easier.  Thanks for a quality product.</li>
    <li> Actually, I initially purchased this item, by accident, thinking it also included the flat iron . . . silly me.  Upon receiving it I thought what a fantastic gift it would be to go with the flat iron that I now needed to purchase.  Upon receiving her flat iron, I put it into the pouch to check out the fit; and it was perfect! (turned out to be one of the best &amp;#34;accidental purchases&amp;#34;, I ever made)!&lt;br /&gt;My granddaughter was thrilled with it.  She is always on the go, and loves that it is so well insulated; and a such a perfect fit!!</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try out my travel pouch recently and was very happy with the pouch.  I have a relatively expensive flat iron that can get extremely hot.  As I went to place it into the pouch, I flinched a little, being concerned that perhaps it could/would melt the heat resistant plastic and ultimately ruin the flat iron.  My worries were wasted, as this little pouch did everything it said it would do.  I had no issues with any melting of the case, and my flat iron came out just as clean as it went in.  This pouch is very handy for travel, especially if you are on business travel and you have to check out of your hotel and head to the office/airport, shortly after doing your hair.  You can pack your flat iron in here without worrying that it will melt or cause damage to any of your other items in your bag.  Of course, I would still recommend that if you have the opportunity to let your iron cool off, even for just a few minutes, you would be better to do that first and then insert it into the case.  That&#x27;s just my opinion though, and the case will handle the flat iron being unplugged and going directly into the case.  There is a nice pouch on the back of the case to hold your folded up cord, so that it tucks away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this case so much that I purchased a second one.  I am keeping one pouch with my travel bags, and the other stays out for my day to day use.  I would recommend this pouch to others without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Exactly as described</li>
    <li> I use mine for a GHD flat iron.  I knew it wouldn&#x27;t fit exactly, but it does the job perfectly. For the price it is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Seems to be well made.  Keeps my curling iron from burning my gym bag or suitcase.  My only wish is that it were about 2 inches longer.  My curling iron is not that big, but I can&#x27;t close the flap over the end of the iron.  My workaround is to stuff the flap into the bag.  The corded end of the iron sticks out a bit beyond the end of the pouch, but it fits in tightly enough that it won&#x27;t fall out.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping &amp; a nice item, works as expected to shield other items from the heat of my straightener.  Would buy it again</li>
    <li> This is a great case for your flat iron. I don&#x27;t have enough sink space to really leave mine out in the mornings. Keeps it safe so I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning the house down! So awesome I will buy one for a friends birthday!</li>
    <li> It fits my flat iron perfectly and it&#x27;s easy to store and retrieve the cord. It also has a slim profile for packing.</li>
    <li> Since the hair appliances are usually the last thing that I pack when travelling, this is perfect when storing a 425 degree flat iron in my suitcase without worrying that my clothes are going to catch on fire!</li>
    <li> This item really works. I place my hott flat Iron into it perfectly and simply wrap the wires around the outside.&lt;br /&gt;Makes fixing my hair on the go so much easier!</li>
    <li> This was great!  I put the flat iron in complete hot and into my suitcase.  Worked as promised and made my travel morning much easier</li>
    <li> I would defintely recommend this travel pouch.  Even though my flat iron is too long to completely close the top flat, it still works perfectly to slant and close it since that part of the iron does not heat up.  I store my flat iron in it every day and am happy I now have something for traveling.</li>
    <li> Product was better than I had expected. it  fits my large staightner as well as my curling iron. I will definately recomend this product.</li>
    <li> Finally found the perfect flat iron case. Looks well made and it has a side pocket to stuff cord into so that it doesn&#x27;t come into contact with hot iron plates. My flat iron is 1.5 inches wide and it fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> The product is far more than what I expected for this price. I bought this as a gift for my daughter because I already owned a flat iron cover, though not this particular product. This one has a heat proof liner, which mine does not have, a Velcro closure which mine does not have, and is twice the size of mine. I would dare say that two heating appliances could be put into this pocket, but, I am not sure about that. The company is terrific to work with and very open to feedback.</li>
    <li> Wow, did I receive the same product as everyone else?  This doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Once the hot flat iron goes in the pouch, the outside of the pouch is just as hot as the flat iron itself.  A completely useless travel pouch.</li>
    <li> I bought this pouch for a trip and it worked perfectly. My flat iron fits as it should and the cord is easy to slip under the elastic on the back. Now that I&#x27;m back home, I slip the iron inside when I&#x27;m done using it so that it&#x27;s even less likely that anyone (toddler, me) will try to touch it while it is hot.</li>
    <li> This is as described and arrived on time.  My GF had this iron and pouch and let me use it at the gym.  No more waiting for the iron to cool down, just place in the pouch. toss in my bag and I am on my way.  Love it</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple heat resistant bag for my flat iron for some time now. This is a great bag and it will be a blessing formy upcoming travels.</li>
    <li> A terrific find!  The Onei Heat Shield Flat Iron Travel Pouch makes it convenient to pack one&#x27;s flat iron - whether for a trip to a new&lt;br /&gt;city or a trip to the gym.  One can easily insert the flat iron into the pouch.  While I have yet to put a hot flat iron into the insulated interior,&lt;br /&gt;I have put a warm flat iron into it.  No problem.  The Velcro flap closes the pouch to keep the iron secure within the pouch, and the cord is stored into the a pouch located on the back while held in place by an elastic band. Very nice pouch for storing one&#x27;s flat iron whether at home or on the road.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to travel with it yet, but it fits my Chi flat iron completely.  The flap on the back along with elastic band keeps the cord tucked away nicely.  The only thing is my electrical cord comes out at a swivel angle so the flap on the top has to close just slightly at an angle.  No biggie.  Overall, the construction of the material feels very sturdy and seems that it will stand up to being thrown around during trips.</li>
    <li> My flat iron fits perfectly- bought one for my daughter too!  Very reasonably price and nice quality. I would recommend to anyone looking for a great flat iron case.</li>
    <li> Onei Heat Shield Flat Iron Travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife used this on a recent long trip and loved it. Sturdy, functional fit the bill to a tee. She informs me that it&#x27;s a keeper! Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Onei Heat Shield Flat Iron Travel Pouch after years of traveling with my flat iron and the pain of having to wait for it to cool completely before repacking.  The last thing a lady does before departing her hotel room is finish her hair, so it just makes sense that there should be a product to allow a warm iron to be safely packed.  A friend of mine also has a pouch that came with her CHI iron, but I was so happy to find one of noticeably better quality.  I highly recommend this product, it even fits curling irons!</li>
    <li> I have a large barrel curling iron and just a little too small to put it in all the way</li>
    <li> The Onei pouch works very well for both my flat irons. It&#x27;s better than my old one because it has loops for the cord so the cord isn&#x27;t just hanging down and getting in the way. Worth the money and would buy again.</li>
    <li> A small carrier. Works exactly as hoped. Fits easily in a cosmetic bag and solves my problem of having to wait for the iron to cool.</li>
    <li> very nice and handy...unfortunately it is a bit too small or my curly iron so it doesnt close well but I still use it</li>
    <li> Works great to store a flat iron. Nice band in the rear to hold the cord.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to pick out one of these.  My iron is quite wide and this cover should cover it, but it is quite a tight fit.  It is a good sturdy product and a good purchase,  Received it quickly too.</li>
    <li> I used to not straighten my hair the last morning of a trip because I couldn&#x27;t pack away the lava hot plates in my bags. Or I&#x27;d pack it last and lay it in the floorboard of my car and just hope it didn&#x27;t touch anything. Not anymore! I love this pouch and while it does get a little warm to the touch on the outside, I easily feel safe tucking it away in my suitcase with all my other items. So glad I have this product and so happy to support a business with such great customer service!</li>
    <li> Great, durable product, it is made well, not bulky and fits my flat iron perfectly.  I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect!  I no longer have to worry about my flattening iron damaging anything when I package it up after use at the gym.  My flattening iron, T3&#x27;s Mane Tamer, is very large - 11 x 2 x 2 inches and it fits perfectly in this pouch!  The company is wonderful as well!  All in all, a great purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. Makes travelling so much easier since  i frequently do my hair as the last step before packing my bag.  This case makes travelling so much easier. I never worry about where to put my flat iron to cool off.</li>
    <li> Love it! Fits my new PYT straightener perfectly, for a lot less than they were trying to sell me a case for, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it melting stuff in my bag!</li>
    <li> This item is very well-made--keeps the hot flat iron from burning everything after I use it.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is that I wish it was about one inch longer..the flap won&#x27;t close because my flat iron cord connector makes it a little  longer than the pouch--but I make it work and would buy one again.</li>
    <li> Helps me get out the door faster when I&#x27;m traveling. The top won&#x27;t close over my flat iron so I turn it diagonally and close the flap around it. Convenient elastic bands in the side to store the cord.</li>
    <li> Had been looking for a flat iron case for a while...and finally found this on Amazon.  Not only was the price great - but I&#x27;m able to put the flat iron in the case while it is still warm.  Love - Love - Love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent gift to my wife. Has been used and performed perfectly.</li>
    <li> The shield flat iron travel pouch fit my travel iron perfectly, and it&#x27;s not bulky or heavy so I can bring it with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> From the picture it looks smaller, but this easily fits my 1.5&amp;#34; wide CHI flatiron. My cord for the CHI was always a tangled mess so there&#x27;s no way I &#x27;d be able to fit it coiled nicely, but that is my fault because for years i just quickly wrapped it around the curling iron after it was cooled so now its all kinked.  Still, the case feels like good sturdy quality, not thin, and will work great!</li>
    <li> THIS IRON IS FABULOUS!  THE FIRST IRON I GOT THE LCD DISPLAY DID NOT LIGHT UP AND I CONTACTED THE COMPANY AND THEY FIXED THE SITUATION NO QUESTIONS ASKED,  THEY WERE VERY NICE AND EASY TO DEAL WITH.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> The bag does protect from heat. The flat iron itself fits inside the bag except for the cord attach point. It angles out from the iron handle at about 45 degrees so the flap doesn&#x27;t close well. If there was a notch on one side of the flap or on the bag itself at the top it would. The elastic does hold the loose cord but it would be much more convenient and secure if it were velcro. I rated it 4 stars because I think the closure and cord holder could be improved.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Fit my flat iron. Just what I expected and worked with a hot iron. I recommend this to all</li>
    <li> I love this pouch because it makes traveling with my flat iron A LOT easier. I used to wrap the cord around it but I read it&#x27;s best not to do that because it shortens the life of your flat iron - not a problem with this Onei pouch because it keeps the cord separate from the flat iron so there is no way the cord will be damaged by the heat. This pouch fits my flat iron perfectly. The best part is I can use my flat iron after working out and slip it in my bag without worrying about it.</li>
    <li> great quality for the price This is a great item for traveling with your flat iron.  It keeps other items safe.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s advertised as fitting most flat irons. I purchased two, one for me and my daughter. Our flat irons are not the same brand but both of them are your typical standard size flat irons. This case didn&#x27;t fit either one of our flat irons. You would need a very small flat iron to fit into this case.</li>
    <li> My wife REALLY loved these as a gift, and they came the next day, despite not expediting things. Work great, affordable, look good. I&#x27;m definitely a fan! I got her both of these together, and it works great, and she loved the pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B007ZXR4I6 MK-I Halo Ceramic 450 Degree 1-inch Ionic Flat Iron - Hair Straightener - by Onei Beauty]]</li>
    <li> Very happy I bought this, I will be using it in our travels to visit grandkids all over the country.  I&#x27;ve used it once, and it did a great job, no worries about packing it away while still too hot to pack.</li>
    <li> I bought this to store my straightener after use at home as well as for travel since my hair is the last thing I do before I leave. After looking at quite a few brands and reviews, I chose this one.  It&#x27;s perfect. I have a 1 inch straightener and it fits with some extra room to spare. The back has a band and a pocket below it to keep your cord secure while away from the hot plates. I&#x27;ve also tested it by putting my straightener in it right after use on an extremely high temp. Both bag and straightener were fine. Great product, good quality, and a great price. Shipped right away too! Definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I had a little bit of trouble fitting the flat iron along with the cord of my flat iron because the pouch is very narrow, but got it to fit. Takes a bit of finagling. Overall though, it is a good, sturdy product that I expect to last a long time.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly how it was described and arrived in a timely manner. The pouch/strap combo on the back worked great for storing the cord.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for trips to the gym when the last thing I do is dry my hair and so I don&#x27;t have time for the flat iron to dry before packing it up. This can go hot directly into the pouch. I use it daily at home too as I keep my flat iron in a drawer in my closet.  I would  recommend it. It fits my 1&amp;#34; flat iron with no problem and a larger one would probably fit in too.</li>
    <li> My daughter love it and it worked well. I would Recommend it to anyone who has a flat iron. Thank You</li>
    <li> I recently spent over $120 on my flat iron, and realized that it could easily drop and be damaged.  This pouch fits it perfectly and protects it while at home.  Also great for traveling!  Was shipped to me extremely quickly.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love being able to put the iron away hot and the cord holder is nice, too.  The only negative thing I have to say about it is that my iron seems to have it&#x27;s cord in an odd position, causing the closure to be crooked.  Not a functional problem, however.</li>
    <li> This is great for cleaning up after getting ready in the morning, you can put away straightner/curling iron even when still hot. Great for travel also. Big enough to hold straightener but not too bulky.</li>
    <li> Great product. Only downside is that it had less room inside than I thought. I have a 1 inch straightener, and the straightener with the cord wrapped around does not fit in the pouch. Not an issue though - I just put the heated plate part in the bag and wrap the cord around the outside of the bag.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday. Fits perfect, keeps things safe and neat. People seem to say they have trouble with theirs fitting. Mine slides in no problem it&#x27;s 2 inches wide. The cord swivels and hangs to the side while the majority is folded and tucked in the pocket and elastic band. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a nice quality case. It fits my larger 2&amp;#34; flat iron and the cord is easy to tuck in the pocket on the back of the case. My only complaint is that my particular flat iron is larger at the end since it has the piece that allows the cord to swivel around, so the top does not close. I don&#x27;t think that is really a big deal, though I would have preferred if it did.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product which functions exactly as advertised. We needed a protector for traveling with a hair straightener while still hot and this has worked very well for us.</li>
    <li> It seems a little expensive to pay $20 for a case to hold a straightening iron, but otherwise it does the job just fine</li>
    <li> My wife loves the flat iron and we received the product as promised. It shipped the day after order. I would recomend this company to anyone who wants and has high expectations.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot, or go to the gym in the morning, and needed something I can slip my curling iron or flat iron into quickly and go! This does the trick. Fits either curling iron or flat iron nicely and protects other things from it. I just wish there was better areas for the cord. I end up just wrapping the cord around the whole thing.</li>
    <li> Got here quick, fits my Chi straightener nice &amp; snug.</li>
    <li> Product arrived and love it. My chi air flat iron fits perfectly in it and the storage for the cord is great. The elastic loop helps to neatly keep in tact the cord and the pocket is large enough for the cord to tuck into (no need to worry about melting the rubber). Anyone on the go needs to have a bag like this to travel with!</li>
    <li> Truthfully I ordered this for a friend who was coveting the travel pouch that came with my flat iron (different brand).  She&#x27;s a frequent traveler and never knows what to do with a hot flat iron when it&#x27;s time to pack up and head for the airport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouch was the closest to mine that I could find and it does the trick perfectly.  I&#x27;ve seen other models in stores that weren&#x27;t nearly as good - bulky, silly looking patterns.  This one is slim with all the right features.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect pouch for the straightener to keep safe and perfect from anything. It stores nicely instead of just throwing the straightener under the sink. Love the product!</li>
    <li> I have a larger flat iron (1.5 inches wide) and was afraid that it wasn&#x27;t going to fit. The product is marketed to fit all full size irons, and mine fits perfectly. Extremely happy with this for travel purposes.</li>
