      <li>Ive been using this product for nearly 10 years now and it always leaves me feeling clean and smelling great.</li>
      <li>Like the lightly scented odor.</li>
      <li>cheap and my husband loves this soap....</li>
      <li>a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says &amp;#34;UNLIMITED FEMALE ATTENTION&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Terrific, smells great.</li>
      <li>Great scent, provides a smooth clean feeling for several hours.</li>
      <li>Bottle is a great shape to grip with wet hands</li>
      <li>Price was good enough.</li>
      <li>There are a lot of shower gels out there, this one is good enough.  </li>
      <li>All is good in his teenage</li>
      <li>Not bad I recommend it, it&#x27;s not too strong and is pretty gentle, with this type of product is more like weather you like the smell, personally it smells good.</li>
      <li>It is also thicker in consistency than the others; it helps to not wash away so quickly when applying.</li>
      <li>They smell much better than the Old Spice that he used to use.</li>
      <li>It lathers goods, &amp; I like that it left most of my body feeling clean/fresh &amp; smooth.</li>
      <li>This is my jam right here</li>
      <li>My stinky teenaged son is fit to live with again!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I get so many more women now following my recent switch to the invigorating Axe Phoenix shower gel, thanks Axe!</li>
      <li>I often find females touching and smelling me after showering for entire days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also worth noting that Axe Shower Gel, Phoenix, 16 Fluid Ounce also attracts gay men as well who can smell the maverick spirit of the phoenix from a distance.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my man.. &amp; not only was it so much cheaper than buying in the store, but I can&#x27;t help but LOVE this smell on him...  </li>
      <li>certainly cheaper then in the store.</li>
      <li>Certain areas of my body</li>
      <li>The boys really like the fragrance of these shower gels.</li>
      <li>Smelling it straight from the bottle</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really liking the smell of this version.  </li>
      <li>Recommended, can&#x27;t really find any cons about this item.</li>
      <li>Really, if you can&#x27;t smell this in person, don&#x27;t order it online.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this body wash for about almost a year now, and I&#x27;ve actually gotten to where people tell me I smell fantastic.</li>
      <li>practices at least three times per week with matches twice a week and often on weekends, so he uses a good bit of body wash (and also uses Axe shampoo) after matches...</li>
      <li>Our active teenage son is fairly picky about the shower products he uses, and he likes the way this body wash works and smells on</li>
      <li>I&#x27;f tried 3 other Axe shower gels, and this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I was somewhat surprised at the size of this baby (much more than I expected).</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I would have been happy with a faint smell but nothing, nada, zippo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Keeps you fresh all day long</li>
      <li>Seriously though, you will feel refreshed and smell good all day long (and aren&#x27;t we all allergenic to BO?)..</li>
      <li>/&gt;Only slight gripe is that I wish it would lather a little better, but it seems to be on par with most other body washes.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my 27 year old son, and he loves it.</li>
      <li>Axe really does smell good, it&#x27;s just that people go crazy spraying themselves all over with it.</li>
      <li>Previously have bought this in stores for as much as twice as much which makes the amazon price</li>
      <li>It cleans and it&#x27;s got very manly scent -- but you won&#x27;t reek of it like you drowned in cologne</li>

<li> a small squirt about the size of a quarter is about all he needs, so this size bottle lasts a while -- even when doing a quick wash at least 5 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> it left it feeling tight.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also contoured so it won&#x27;t just fall out of your hands when wet and soapy.</li>
<li> I would recommend this body wash, and other ones like it.</li>
<li> little bit goes a very long way...</li>
<li> He loves the compliments he gets from his little girlfriends from school..</li>
<li> Just a little dab will do you.  </li>

    <li> It lathers goods, &amp; I like that it left most of my body feeling clean/fresh &amp; smooth. Certain areas of my body it left it feeling tight. My biggest problem with this body wash is the smell. It kind of smells like a chemical cleaner. Smelling it straight from the bottle it&#x27;s a strong smell. On your body the smell doesn&#x27;t come off strong, but every now &amp; then I get a whiff of it coming off my body. Really, if you can&#x27;t smell this in person, don&#x27;t order it online.</li>
    <li> Great smell to this product. Probably the freshest smelling shower gel/soap I&#x27;ve used. Recommended, can&#x27;t really find any cons about this item.</li>
    <li> Love the way this gel lathers.  Some gels seem to be more slimy, but this one is not.  Like the lightly scented odor.</li>
    <li> My son and I both use this body wash and it has the most awesome smell. He loves the compliments he gets from his little girlfriends from school..</li>
    <li> Satisfactorily a pleasure.</li>
    <li> Terrific, smells great.</li>
    <li> I quit using deodorant bar soap after trying this gel.  I love the smell and love using it.  Once you try Axe shower gels, you will never go back to using bar soap. Somehow using it makes my body feel really amazing.  Not sure why - perhaps they put pheromones in the gel?! lolz</li>
    <li> Still waiting for the Axe effect to kick in &#x3D;O) Good product for the price leave a fresh scent all day.</li>
    <li> Son likes to use only Axe products. Price was good enough. Smell reminds me kind of herbal essence but kind of musk smell too. I think the body sprays are heavy, but the shower gels and shampoos don&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> My Axe Shower Gel has a pleasant odder. It does a great job cleaning me up. Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in axe bodywash. Use this with a light deodorant and forget the body spray you will smell good all day without smelling TOO STRONG.  People won&#x27;t be smelling you as you enter a room. (Which is a good thing. ) Axe really does smell good, it&#x27;s just that people go crazy spraying themselves all over with it. So I suggest this bodywash with cleans your skin and leaves you smelling good. :)</li>
    <li> My boyfriend likes this and the Phoenix antiperspirant deodorant. They smell much better than the Old Spice that he used to use. Bleh. I have both on subcribe and save so we save even more money than if we buy them at cvs, plus it saves us gas money ordering on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great price fast shipping thank you</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for nearly 10 years now and it always leaves me feeling clean and smelling great. Got this for a great deal of $3 when the coupon was applied. certainly cheaper then in the store. plus has the fact it comes to me.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Lathers up great, smell wonderful and it&#x27;s AXE.  Amazon sells it, ships it and my wife loves it.  Could it get any better.</li>
    <li> The product was great</li>
    <li> I remember when I would tell myself there is no way I would buy this stuff. That thinking did not last long onc I had the chance to test it and now I only use thi stuff.</li>
    <li> Great scent, provides a smooth clean feeling for several hours.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat surprised at the size of this baby (much more than I expected). Excellent price for what you get.. Can&#x27;t keep the girls away (just kidding, I&#x27;ll take all the girls I can get). Seriously though, you will feel refreshed and smell good all day long (and aren&#x27;t we all allergenic to BO?).. Don&#x27;t take my word for it, do yourself a favor and get this good deal through amazon at a great savings from brick &amp; mortar.</li>
    <li> My stinky teenaged son is fit to live with again!</li>
    <li> cheap and my husband loves this soap.... gonna be a christmas stocking stuffer.. i order this every two months anyways</li>
    <li> I get so many more women now following my recent switch to the invigorating Axe Phoenix shower gel, thanks Axe!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Smells good and fresh...&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely luv it.. Will definitely buy again and the product deserves five stars..&lt;br /&gt;Glad I tried this.. Thanks!</li>
    <li> great product definately would buy again</li>
    <li> Stuff doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. I would have been happy with a faint smell but nothing, nada, zippo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dial is a heck of a lot cheaper is lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This the the second time I bought it.</li>
    <li> Love  the  scent, great body  wash.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lathers good!!!!!</li>
    <li> Our active teenage son is fairly picky about the shower products he uses, and he likes the way this body wash works and smells on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He practices at least three times per week with matches twice a week and often on weekends, so he uses a good bit of body wash (and also uses Axe shampoo) after matches... otherwise his mom won&#x27;t let him back in the house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a very long way... a small squirt about the size of a quarter is about all he needs, so this size bottle lasts a while -- even when doing a quick wash at least 5 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey - it&#x27;s his body wash and he likes how it works and also the fragrance of it, so I guess that is all that matters. No irritation and no dryness. All is good in his teenage world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our son definitely recommends this Axe Phoenix Shower Gel based on his experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.</li>
    <li> I love Axe, I even use my husbands own. Smells nice and lathers well, so I will be buying more</li>
    <li> I like the scents and quality for all of the Axe products, but like all others they are all a bid overpriced.</li>
    <li> Love this scent on hubby</li>
    <li> It cleans and it&#x27;s got very manly scent -- but you won&#x27;t reek of it like you drowned in cologne afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only slight gripe is that I wish it would lather a little better, but it seems to be on par with most other body washes.</li>
    <li> I brought plenty of AX shower gel, soaps and sprays for gifts, got carried away watching TV ads about Ax. I brought assorted ones and trust me,  they all smell nice,  I will keep buying as long as they are wanted and needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking the smell of this version.  I&#x27;f tried 3 other Axe shower gels, and this is my favorite.  It is also thicker in consistency than the others; it helps to not wash away so quickly when applying.</li>
    <li> This is my jam right here</li>
    <li> Not as a gift for my grandsons, they seem to like the AXT products will update if any further info.</li>
    <li> We bought the Axe shower gel for Christmas stocking stuffers. The boys really like the fragrance of these shower gels.</li>
    <li> Previously have bought this in stores for as much as twice as much which makes the amazon price a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says &amp;#34;UNLIMITED FEMALE ATTENTION&amp;#34; which I have found to be an understatement. I often find females touching and smelling me after showering for entire days. It&#x27;s also worth noting that Axe Shower Gel, Phoenix, 16 Fluid Ounce also attracts gay men as well who can smell the maverick spirit of the phoenix from a distance.</li>
    <li> This product smells great, and it works great. Will definitely buy again. Highly recommend. Lasts forever, too! Bottle is a great shape to grip with wet hands</li>
    <li> Keeps you fresh all day long</li>
    <li> I think this stuff smells as good as the mall store stuff.</li>
    <li> Great smell and cleans well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite refreshing in the shower, and it gets me compliments out of the shower. What else is there to say... Oh, I like the container. You push to open the cap instead of having to pry it open. It&#x27;s also contoured so it won&#x27;t just fall out of your hands when wet and soapy.</li>
    <li> I Bought This For My Finace To Use..Omg Love It The Smell Everything Would Recommended It To Anyone.This Product will allways be bought by my for my home. My fiancée is now a lifetime user of this axe body wash.</li>
    <li> This item was shipped with several others and it did open during transit and was all over the box.  I know it was not intended, just unfortunate that we lost most of it  - but the delivery person smelled great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this body wash for about almost a year now, and I&#x27;ve actually gotten to where people tell me I smell fantastic. I would recommend this body wash, and other ones like it. Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.  You got nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my man.. &amp; not only was it so much cheaper than buying in the store, but I can&#x27;t help but LOVE this smell on him...  :) :) :) :)</li>
    <li> The men in my house will only use this. Great smell</li>
    <li> An OK scent but a good product.</li>
    <li> Not bad I recommend it, it&#x27;s not too strong and is pretty gentle, with this type of product is more like weather you like the smell, personally it smells good. There are a lot of shower gels out there, this one is good enough.  I used to have this irish spring gel body wash it was good but it had this mint after effect all in all is a matter of what you prefer.</li>
    <li> runs out faster and more expensive than bar soap but sometimes you just need a good smelling lather.  this does the job.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 27 year old son, and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Good product.</li>
    <li> Just a little dab will do you.  Really strong, good smell and cleans well.  I like it a lot. Their shampoo is also great.</li>
