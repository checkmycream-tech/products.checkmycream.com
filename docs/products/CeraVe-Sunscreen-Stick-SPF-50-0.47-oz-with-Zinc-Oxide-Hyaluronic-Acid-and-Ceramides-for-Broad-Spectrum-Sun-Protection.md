      <li>great sunscreen, not greasy</li>
      <li>great price for a great product</li>
      <li>Very handy being in stick form to carry in a purse but requires a lot of time to rub into skin.</li>
      <li>Easy and awesome.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
      <li>I guess the good thing is that you can see any places you missed applying it.</li>
      <li>I have fair to medium skin.</li>
      <li>Love their lotion, cleanser, and cream!  </li>
      <li>So pleased with this product!</li>
      <li>The benefit is that it fits nicely into my purse, backpack, pocket, etc.</li>
      <li>does not rub it very easily and just feels like zinc oxide in a tube.  </li>
      <li>This is the mildest and most effective sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever found for my face.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to keep handy.  </li>
      <li>(where he seems to burn the most.)  </li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen but was startled when it arrived.</li>
      <li>(age 8) keeps complaining of face sunscreen burning, so I bought this CeraVe stick to try.  </li>
      <li>I looked at the stick more closely to see \\&quot;water resistant (40 minutes)\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Bottom line -&lt;br /&gt;Gentle and perfect if you are not going to get wet.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>This products is great and I use the big bottle</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is still okay since it doesn&#x27;t burn her skin, but reapplying a 50 SPF after 40 minutes in the water is probably not my most practical solution as much as we&#x27;re in the water.</li>
      <li>It is easily absorbed and does a fantastic job.</li>
      <li>CeraVe Sunscreen stick provides a quick application for baby and myself.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this sun screen stick on my whole face because it seems too heavy, but it feels very good around my eyes.</li>
      <li>I like the smoothness of the application, but was thinking that it was more clear.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and it has not caused problems (many \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; products burn my skin</li>
      <li>I already have other products I use faithfully on my face, neck &amp; body, but was looking for an ideal hand sunblock with broad spectrum protection and convenient, non-messy packaging that I could throw in my purse.</li>
      <li>happens even with consistent sunscreen use).  </li>
      <li>Yes, it does give a blueish white cast, but since I put on moisturizer before, I just put it on and smooth in.</li>
      <li>This never makes me break out and yet it has real staying power.</li>
      <li>This is cute but for the price not worth it.</li>
      <li>(we live at the beach, and she is very tan--</li>
      <li>I put it on under makeup, and my husband uses his stick to quickly swipe his nose, forehead, ears, and the back of his neck</li>
      <li>but I like that better than a heavy perfume scent.</li>
      <li>That statement was not mentioned under the description where we purchased (CVS) but that statement is very clear here on amazon.  </li>
      <li>A little smaller than I expected but good for ears, nose, etc.</li>
      <li>I purchased with great trepidation due to the negative reviews but though applying the stick does leave white marks, they disappear with a total of five seconds gentle rubbing with the back of my hand.</li>

    <li> Bottom line -&lt;br /&gt;Gentle and perfect if you are not going to get wet.  If you plan to get wet, remember to reapply every 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter (age 8) keeps complaining of face sunscreen burning, so I bought this CeraVe stick to try.  Love their lotion, cleanser, and cream!  The oval shape of the stick is a little hard for her to apply by herself, but she said the sunscreen did not burn her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con is that we noticed her face was a little pink, under her eyes (we live at the beach, and she is very tan--happens even with consistent sunscreen use).  I looked at the stick more closely to see \\&quot;water resistant (40 minutes)\\&quot;.  That statement was not mentioned under the description where we purchased (CVS) but that statement is very clear here on amazon.  This sunscreen is still okay since it doesn&#x27;t burn her skin, but reapplying a 50 SPF after 40 minutes in the water is probably not my most practical solution as much as we&#x27;re in the water.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face daily.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Suppose to be invisible.  It leaves the typical white chalky zinc layer on your skin</li>
    <li> CeraVe Sunscreen stick provides a quick application for baby and myself.  It travels with us everywhere.</li>
    <li> great price for a great product</li>
    <li> not bad，can this be used for kid？</li>
    <li> I bought this to use around my eyes because protecting the skin around your eyes from sun damage. The sun blocks I was using before were too greasy feeling and made my eyes sting. I wouldn&#x27;t use this sun screen stick on my whole face because it seems too heavy, but it feels very good around my eyes. The whiteness of the zinc even seem to cover up the veins on my eyelids, which is a plus. It&#x27;s not greasy at all on my eyes and I&#x27;ll bet it will work well under makeup! Best of all, it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Looked in a ton of places for this, finally ordered while on vacation and it was there when I got back. I like the smoothness of the application, but was thinking that it was more clear. Yes, it does give a blueish white cast, but since I put on moisturizer before, I just put it on and smooth in.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I expected but good for ears, nose, etc.</li>
    <li> This is the mildest and most effective sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever found for my face.  I put it on under makeup, and my husband uses his stick to quickly swipe his nose, forehead, ears, and the back of his neck (where he seems to burn the most.)  This never makes me break out and yet it has real staying power.</li>
    <li> This products is great and I use the big bottle so I bought am pm creams, and facial cream. This is cute but for the price not worth it. I rolled out the who roll on and it was half an in. I used it in a week.</li>
    <li> I am a sunscreen-obsessed freak and never leave home without it. I already have other products I use faithfully on my face, neck &amp; body, but was looking for an ideal hand sunblock with broad spectrum protection and convenient, non-messy packaging that I could throw in my purse. Bingo! This stick is PERFECT for my needs! It takes the headache out of applying sunscreen to the backs of my hands when I&#x27;m away from home and protects them from getting sun damaged while driving. So pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> does not rub it very easily and just feels like zinc oxide in a tube.  It does block the sun..</li>
    <li> Stick is the perfect size for my bag and works perfectly. I have fair to medium skin. I purchased with great trepidation due to the negative reviews but though applying the stick does leave white marks, they disappear with a total of five seconds gentle rubbing with the back of my hand. Easy and awesome.</li>
    <li> Best suncreen. I was the only one who didn&#x27;t get burned in Hawaii. It&#x27;s easy to apply and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Not the sunscreen stick to wear under or over makeup or with any dark clothing. It is thick and visible. I guess the good thing is that you can see any places you missed applying it. It doesn&#x27;t wash out well so wearing a dark hat or shirt isn&#x27;t practical.  I&#x27;m used to being pasty white with sunscreen, but this made even strangers tell me I needed to &amp;#34;rub my sunscreen in&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended all the Cerave products.  I use this on my nose and chest and it is not too thick or too oily.  It is easily absorbed and does a fantastic job.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen but was startled when it arrived. The stick is tiny - 3 inches tall, 1.5 inches wide. The benefit is that it fits nicely into my purse, backpack, pocket, etc. so it&#x27;s easy to keep handy.  I have sensitive skin and it has not caused problems (many \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; products burn my skin but this does not).  It is thick when you put it on and you need to rub it in well since the active ingredients are zinc and titanium dioxide.  The zinc goes on really, really white.  Even once I rub it in, a slight bluish-white cast remains which doesn&#x27;t bother me since it tones down my skin color but it might be a problem for some. It has a very slight sunscreen smell but I like that better than a heavy perfume scent.</li>
    <li> Very handy being in stick form to carry in a purse but requires a lot of time to rub into skin. Very white when it goes on. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> great sunscreen, not greasy</li>
