<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> About six years ago, I learned about tea tree oil when I started researching natural alternatives for acne control. Since then I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of tea tree oil with varying degrees of efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when the Apothecary tea tree oil arrived was the scent. It was strong--nearly overwhelming. But it was the familiar tea tree scent I&#x27;d come to appreciate, a sign of the potent stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True to its scent, this tea tree oil was potent. I&#x27;ve used it for several things already: a break out across my face and shoulders (when I decided against my better judgement to try a new face and body wash)--using the tip of my finger to apply it where necessary, everything was cleared up within a few days; I also used it for a small toenail infection that cropped up--that one took a bit longer, but it too was done in by this oil. Overall, this gets slotted in on my &amp;#34;quality oils&amp;#34; list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are that it doesn&#x27;t provide potency breakdown, an expiration date (it does have a &amp;#34;bottled on&amp;#34; date), and the eyedropper is a pain to use. I eventually just pried it out and started using my own pipette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample bottle for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Used one drop with a water/baking soda mixture to wash my hair. Had no dandruff for over 24 hours after. Seems like good stuff to me.</li>
    <li> it really does get rid of skin tags</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Apothecary Tea Tree Oil for free for review purposes. I was very satisfied with the Apothecary Tea Tree Oil and I will be purchasing it again whenever I run out of it. I love it that you get an e-book with 53 uses for tea tree oil when you purchase Apothecary Tea Tree Oil. With recipes on how to use the oil for making cleaning supplies, facial treatments, shampoos, lip balms, first aid treatments, and more . I also like that the Apothecary Tea Tree Oil is a great value. When you purchase the Apothecary brand you get 4 oz. for $24.99. Some other brands are almost $10 for just one ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my sample to make some DIY all-purpose household cleaner. It was really easy and the recipe only called for Apothecary Tea Tree Oil, vinegar, and water. I loved how easy it was it just add these ingredients to a spray bottle to make my own green household cleaner. The spray was very effective and it did a great job on cleaning countertops and even the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also, added Apothecary Tea Tree Oil to my homemade laundry detergent. It made me love my homemade laundry detergent even more. The tea tree oil did a great job of helping to eliminate odors from my laundry. It eliminated odors without leaving a lingering scent on my clothes. I personally don’t like heavily fragranced laundry detergents that seem to mask odors. I like that the tea tree oil actually eliminates odors.</li>
    <li> great deal, well packaged, fast delivery- has helped my psoriasis tremendously.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is the only product that truly helps control break outs.  I tested this one by Apothecary for a week and was very pleased with it.  I know there are several other used for tea tree that I will definitely be trying out.  Plus I got a free ebook with it!</li>
    <li> I have no complaints!  This was my first time using TTO, and I know I still have a lot to learn about its uses, but I love how it&#x27;s a natural disinfectant.  I will definitely be using it to replace the harsher cleaners I&#x27;ve been using in my kitchen and bathroom.  I have already used this TTO mixed with coconut oil as an ointment for scratches and cuts and also as a cuticle oil.  Some people may be allergic, so always do a patch test when using it on your skin.  Also, always dilute it with something else and never ingest it or put it near the eyes.  The smell is very pungent.  It smells very clean and herb-y.  Take heed should you want to get a big whiff or if you&#x27;re going to be using it near your nose!  I did receive this product for free, but as always, my opinions and words are my own.</li>
    <li> This product packs the most punch for the best price.&lt;br /&gt;It is MORE effective, less volatile (less pungent a smell),  and is 4oz for the same price I would pay for 2oz off the shelf.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely pure and unadulterated Tea Tree Oil. It has a strong smell and works well.</li>
    <li> Have used the oil for five days. Delivery was as promised and the oil seems potent. I was very happy to see that the drop style dispenser, which works well to measure, but I haven&#x27;t figured out how to keep a little oil from running down the side of the bottle when it is tipped back upright. Cleaning it off is only a small nuisance, and that&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.</li>
    <li> They immediately responded to an email and replaced the original delivery that got lost in the mail.  I received the 2nd bottle, only a couple days after my email.  Happy with the amount and the cost as well.  Will buy again from this distributor.  Very pleased.  Thank-you.</li>
    <li> I received this to review for my blog. I was incredibly happy with the product! I used it to make my own cleaner for a wood cutting board as well as a couple beauty scrubs. This stuff is natures wonder!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t usedthe product yet but the shipping was great (secure packaging for sensitive items).  The strength seems strong (great thing) after only needing to add  a few drops into oil.  I bought it for a rash I&#x27;m unable to get rid of with prescription topical drugs and lotions.  Fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> I ordered my bottle of Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil after receiving a coupon for a free bottle. My purchase came with a free eBook titled 53 Uses for Tea Tree Oil. The eBook is very informational and is a great tool to use around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with the packaging of the product. The bottle and vintage-style label has a rich-feel. The tea tree oil comes nicely packaged in a dark brown, glass bottle with a top that has a built-in dispenser. They also include lots of great product information right on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With so many benefits, it is hard not to use your Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil everyday. It promotes healthy skin, kills bacteria, and can even treat the common cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a few drops of oil to create many of the recipes!&lt;br /&gt;I have selected a few of my favorite recipes from the free eBook 53 Uses for Tea Tree Oil and included them on my blog to share with the public. (http://IamJournalistBurks.com)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recipes from the eBook can be used to make your own lip balm, shampoo, soap, body scrubs, facial cleanser, and natural body scrubs. Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil can also be used to make all natural household cleaners, disinfectants, detergents, and shower sprays. This product can be used for a multitude of recipes beneficial to your health and well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would surely recommend this product to a friend!</li>
    <li> Great product , great company...thank- you for the recipe catalog</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product because Tea Tree Oil is great for a lot of different stuff. After I ordered this, I even got an eBook that tells me how to use this product and told me of more uses for it. I like using it to help with acne for one of my son&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve even used it on myself before and it does work. I did not really care for the scent of this but it did not bother me that much. I am glad to have this essential oil in my arsenal because it really does have a ton of uses. It&#x27;s great for cold sores, dandruff, flea and lice prevention, and so much more.  I was given the chance to test and evaluate this product through a promotional offer. However, I did not have to give a positive review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I love tea tree oil. It&#x27;s the best cleanser for my acne prone skin.  I only use it at night, after I take my makeup off. All I do is get my face wet, then apply the tea tree oil directly to my face with a cotton puff.  Once it dries, I&#x27;m good  to go. I don&#x27;t even need to apply any moisturizer. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the recipes from the ebook they send you with your purchase, but I will one of these days.</li>
    <li> The health benefits of tea tree oil are too numerous to state in one review, but i found it most useful for my psoriasis.</li>
    <li> Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil is a fascinating product with many uses for the home, health and beauty. I was surprised to learn of the many versatile ways I could use Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil. I received an extensive e-book with several recipes for health and beauty products as well as cleaning solutions. It was an impressive collection of ideas for use that really helped me to get the most out of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the information provided in the ebook, I was able to use the Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil for a few different purposes so far. I have used it for acne issues my tween has, as well as dry scalp for me. It was easy to find out how to dilute the product and use it for these purposes. It worked well and the product goes a long way! At just $24.99 for a 4 oz. bottle of Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil, it is a great value. I can’t wait to try out some of the home cleaning product recipes in the ebook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary bottle for review purposes.</li>
    <li> ok, smells good, don&#x27;t know about efficacy. I applied it directly to a boil I had developed on my back for several days in a row, but it wont heal, after a week of trying this alone, I applied Neosporin alone and it went away.............so not really sure about what that really means in terms of using it as an alternative medicine.</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s the scoop, if you haven&#x27;t used Tea Tree Oil in your life, you are missing out! I have come across so many uses for tea tree oil as it has many medicinal properties. It&#x27;s great for any type of skin condition. As a matter of fact, my dog caught mange this summer (Yuck, I know) after a short trip to the animal shelter. i guess that is what you get for breaking free from your home. Anyhow. I tried several medications the Vet had prescribed him but all with no relief. I remember having some of this 100% tea tree oil and knew i just had to try. I was amazed at how quickly it began working. With in two days Loki had showed so much improvement, i started spreading the word to my neighbors and even called the shelter and let them know! When looking for tea tree oil, don&#x27;t be fooled by others who claim to 100%. Apothecary is the real deal! Exceptional product and a really great price!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for many uses!</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil after comparing other brands that are sold on Amazon and other sites.  I finally decided on this one based on the glowing reviews and so far it has not disappointed me.  Right now I am using it with my regular shampoo to fight off dandruff and so far, my scalp feels and looks healthier.  Yes the scent is strong, but once you can get past that (it fades away after shampooing it in) you realize this oil is very potent and worth every penny, even with the smell.  I am so glad I found this product on Amazon and would order it again!</li>
    <li> I lost an entire toe nail to fungus. Hard to admit, but there it is. It happened to me twice. This just happens to people, I guess. My entire toe nail came right off...why? FUNGUS. I looked up how to treat this and I wanted to go natural. Every search I did came up with Tea Tree Oil. This seemed like a good brand with good reviews so I jumped at the chance to review it myself. This is POTENT stuff; very strong smelling. I only use it at home,  or at night.  I have used it on my toes..only. I know there are other uses for this oil,  but right now I never want to lose another nail again. So far so good. My nails are growing healthy including the one I lost. As long as it keeps the fungus at bay I am happy. This is a winner. I may update my review in the future if I use it on other things or for other things but for now, my toes and I are happy. No sign of fungus. Truthfully the smell is so strong...nothing would dare penetrate it!! Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this stuff, and I love it. I put some one my face at night before I go to bed, and I love the way it feels and smells. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed was the almost overwhelming scent of the oil, in addition to the size of the bottle! This told me two things, that the quality was more than likely on point and that the seller is focused on customers receiving value for money spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this in several different ways, most notably as a soother for hot spots on my dogs, an antiseptic for minor cuts and scratches, and my personal favorite-the anti dandruff treatment. It comes with a free e-booklet detailing dozens of different uses, although some of those uses require other ingredients. Aside from being offered a complimentary bottle on a one-time basis for review purposes, I love that it is 100% pure with no fillers or additives. This means it will go a lot further than other products I&#x27;ve previously purchased.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase, it seems to never run out, due to the special dropper opening at the top which gives me the perfect amount with one shake.i use it daily with coconut oil, mixed in my hands and straight onto my face, hair and beard. I look forward to the fresh smell and comfort on my skin after every face cleansing with a harsh 10% benzo-per product. This does the trick, keeping moisture control all day.</li>
    <li> Did not know about all the multipurpose uses of tea tree oil. Now I am well educated thanks to this product. Got a free sample for a blog review.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and works well.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t very please with the product because it peeled my skin so much and my face got so dark that I had to stop using this product.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use this on my cocker spaniel for dry skin---good for me to!</li>
    <li> BEST QUALITY TREE TEA! Trust me!</li>
    <li> Great service; product arrived swiftly and well-packaged.  I&#x27;ve been using the oil and am very happy with this product.  I&#x27;m also  impressed with the way the bottle is sealed: good for accessing the oil and good for sealing when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely shop from this seller again.</li>
    <li> The value and efficacy of tea tree oil is widely known.  The cost/quantity of this particular oil, coupled with the quality and ease in ordering and receiving, makes it an especially good value.</li>
    <li> Received my 100% Tea Tree Oil in like 2 days!! Very fast shipping!! I also received the free e-book by e-mail, and it is a wonderful guide/recipe/information book!! When I need to reorder, I will definitely order this tea tree oil! Many Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great for stopping cold sores from developing.  This stuff can&#x27;t be beat for killing viruses, bacteria or fungi on the skin.  When I feel a cold sore starting I immediately apply this oil to the spot and take a couple grams of L-lysine.  Kills the cold sore every time!  I put it on several times per day until the immature cold sore is well-and-truly going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t apply this to a cold sore that has broken the surface though.  I bet that would hurt pretty bad.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil is a must for your medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Good stuff.  Smell potent - which is what I want.</li>
    <li> A very nice and pleasantly aromatic tee tree oil. Product came quickly! I will definitely purchase from this company again! They include an awesome  e-book with the purchase filled with recipes of ways to include tea tree into every day living. That&#x27;s an Extremely nice plus. With all of that info I am without a doubt using more of their wonderful tea tree! Thanks for the great poduct!</li>
    <li> far better quality and potency than other brands. A little of this bottle will go a long ways.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent but the requirement to go to the post office to pick up the package is stupid.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely and looks ok.</li>
    <li> There are plenty of tea tree oils on the market but Apothecary Extracts tea tree oil has been my best buy for its price, quality and the bonus recipes and tips that come with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tea tree oil shipped quickly and the glass bottle was protected by a padded envelop and a well designed and informative recyclable box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is pure and has great staying power as a cleaner. And knowing that it is 100% pure Australian oil makes me feel at ease using it on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that put this product above others was the email I received after my purchase. It provided me with a link to a free Ebook that contained 50 tea tree oil recipes. Now I have even more uses for this oil!</li>
    <li> Excellent product great quality and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already started using it to disinfect. It leaves a clean smell without the lingering chemical smell of commercial cleaners. It even zapped a facial blemish that appeared overnight; the blemish was gone just as quickly as it appeared!</li>
    <li> Use your intelligence and consider carefully any product that declares itself a cure-all. In all fairness, this product does not claim to cure everything, but it does purport ability to cure everything from toenail fungus to hair loss. Really? Next, in the spirit of honesty, I was sent this without cost in order to assess it&#x27;s effectiveness. Also, I&#x27;d never heard of Tea Tree oil, prior to being offered this opportunity, so I would have to say that I&#x27;m in a good position to offer a fair assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First -- the smell. Good heavens above, it reeks. It&#x27;s so off-putting, that a majority of my review is based on research. Actual research from reliable sources (not these overly-enthused five star reviewers). Here&#x27;s what I discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It toxic. If swallowed, it can do some serious harm. Even put someone in a coma. Next, it&#x27;s a serious irritant. A lot of people who tried using it for toe fungus (again, on medical websites, not here on Amazon), claimed that the smallest concentration caused serious swelling and redness, and that it wasn&#x27;t effective. Of those reviewing on other sights, the effectiveness for toe fungus was sketchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most websites stated that the claims for killing certain bacteria wasn&#x27;t validated. Those that did claim it killed bacteria, stated it&#x27;s effectiveness on one type. If anyone has research supporting it&#x27;s effectiveness, I&#x27;ll gladly review it. Those who use it in their homes, I&#x27;d love to know how you know it&#x27;s working as an anti-bacterial. Do you go around with a black light and do a before and after. If you just say, \\&quot;I just know\\&quot; then you&#x27;re claiming something that you don&#x27;t really know. For those who&#x27;ve had success on things such as lice, when combined with a myriad other ingredients, how do you know that the inclusion of this oil was the deciding factor of that success over the combination and/or a single other ingredient?  I&#x27;m not certain that so much success should be attributed to this oil when I&#x27;ve read so manyreviews stating that it is used sparingly in conjunction with other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here&#x27;s something that I found for those who are interested in knowing a little more facts about this product: For me, personally, I won&#x27;t be buying it and am glad that I didn&#x27;t pay for it. The claims are too far-fetched for me and the smell is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEA TREE OIL Uses &amp; Effectiveness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possibly Effective for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Athlete&#x27;s foot (tinea pedis). Topical application of a 10% tea tree oil cream works about as well as tolnaftate 1% cream (Genaspor, Tinactin, Ting, and others) for relieving symptoms of athlete&#x27;s foot, including scaling, inflammation, itching, and burning. However, the 10% tea tree oil cream doesn&#x27;t seem to cure the infection. A stronger tea tree oil solution (25% or 50%) is needed for that. Application of 25% or 50% tea tree oil solution appears to both relieve symptoms and clear up the infection in about half of people who try it for 4 weeks. However, 25% or 50% tea tree oil concentrations don&#x27;t appear to be as effective for curing the infection as medications such as clotrimazole or terbinafine.&lt;br /&gt;  Fungus infections of the nails (onychomycosis). Topical application of 100% tea tree oil solution, twice daily for six months, can cure fungal toenail infection in about 18% of people who try it. It can also improve nail appearance and symptoms in about 56% of patients after three months and 60% of patients after six months of treatment. It seems to be comparable to twice daily application of clotrimazole 1% solution (Fungoid, Lotrimin, Lotrimin AF). Lower concentrations of tea tree oil do not seem to be as effective. For example, there is some evidence that a 5% tea tree oil cream applied three times daily for two months has no benefit.&lt;br /&gt;  Mild to moderate acne. Applying a 5% tea tree oil gel appears to be as effective as 5% benzoyl peroxide (Oxy-5, Benzac AC, and others) for treating acne. Tea tree oil might work more slowlythan benzoyl peroxide, but seems to be less irritating to facial skin. When applied twice daily for 45 days, tea tree oil reduces several acne symptoms, including acne severity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insufficient Evidence for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Bad breath. Early research shows that adding tea tree oil to an essential oil mixture containing peppermint and lemon oils can reduce bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;  Cold sores (Herpes labialis). Research so far suggests that applying 6% tea tree oil gel 5 times daily does not significantly improve cold sores.&lt;br /&gt;  Eyelid infection (blepharitis). Early research shows that tea tree might cure common eyelid infections and reduce the associated symptoms, including eye inflammation and vision loss.&lt;br /&gt;  Dandruff. Early research suggests that applying a 5% teat tree oil shampoo three minutes daily for four weeks reduces scalp lesions, scalp itchiness, and greasiness in patients with dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;  Dental plaque. Results from research examining the effects of tea tree oil on dental plaque are inconsistent. Some early research shows that brushing the teeth with a 2.5% tea tree oil gel twice daily for eight weeks reduces gum bleeding but not plaque in people who have gingivitis caused by plaque. Also, using a mouthwash containing tea tree oil after a professional teeth cleaning does not seem to reduce plaque formation. However, rinsing with a specific product (Tebodont) containing tea tree oil and a chemical called xylitol does seem to reduce plaque.&lt;br /&gt;  Gingivitis. Results from research examining the effects of tea tree oil on gingivitis are inconsistent. Some early research shows that brushing the teeth with a 2.5% tea tree oil gel twice daily for eight weeks reduces gum bleeding but does not improve overall gum health in people who have gingivitis caused by plaque. However, rinsing with a specific product (Tebodont) containing tea tree oil and a chemical called xylitol seems to reduce gum inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;  Hemorrhoids. Some early evidence suggeststhat applying a gel containing tea tree oil reduces symptoms of hemorrhoids, including pain, inflammation and itching, in children.&lt;br /&gt;  Lice. Early research suggests that tea tree oil might repel lice. Also, applying a combination of lavender and tea tree oil kills lice eggs and reduces the number of live lice. It is unclear if the effects are caused by the tea tree oil alone or the combination of lavender and tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. Evidence about the effects of tea tree oil on MRSA infection is unclear. When compared to standard MRSA treatment alone, adding tea tree oil does not seem to improve overall MRSA clearance. Also, using a tea tree oil solution when cleaning wounds does not seem to improve MRSA clearance. However, an early study suggests that using a 4% tea tree oil nasal ointment plus a 5% tea tree oil body wash along with other standard treatments might have a small benefit.&lt;br /&gt;  Allergic skin reactions to nickel. Developing evidence suggests that undiluted tea tree oil may reduce the area and redness skin reactions in people who are allergic to contact with nickel. Also some early evidence suggests that applying diluted tea tree oil to the skin before nickel exposure reduces skin reactions in people allergic to nickel.&lt;br /&gt;  Water warts. Early research shows that applying a combination of tea tree oil and iodine for 30 days helps clear up warts in children better than just tea tree oil or iodine alone.&lt;br /&gt;  Yeast infections in the mouth and throat (thrush; also known as oropharyngeal candidiasis). Because people with AIDS have a weak immune system, they sometimes come down with \\&quot;opportunistic\\&quot; infections such as thrush. There is some evidence that tea tree oil might be beneficial in patients with HIV/AIDS whose thrush does not respond to usual antifungal medications such as fluconazole. Swishing and expelling tea tree oil solution for two to four weeks seems to improve symptoms. Thereis also early evidence that using tea tree oil as part of an essential oil mixture might improve oral comfort in cancer patients. However, adding 1 mL of tea tree oil to a standard conditioner treatment does not reduce infections and inflammation in people with dentures.&lt;br /&gt;  Vaginal bacterial infections. Some studies suggest tea tree oil may be beneficial for some vaginal infections caused by bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;  Vaginal yeast infections. Early evidence suggests that tea tree oil might be beneficial for some vaginal yeast infections.&lt;br /&gt;  Ear infections.&lt;br /&gt;  Scabies.&lt;br /&gt;  Ringworm.&lt;br /&gt;  Preventing infections in cuts, abrasions, burns, insect bites and stings, and boils.&lt;br /&gt;  Sore throat.&lt;br /&gt;  Cough.&lt;br /&gt;  Congestion.&lt;br /&gt;  Other conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More evidence is needed to rate tea tree oil for these uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMENDED 2/11/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was attempting to warn purchasers without slamming the product too much, as reaction may vary; however, I was called on my statement that a majority of my review was based on research. It is true that I was attempting to allow the research to speak for itself, but we DID attempt to use this product. As I don&#x27;t want people to get the wrong impression, I will post here that which I responded to the individual who declared I should have tried it first. Here was our actual experience with this product. Again, this may work fine for some people, but people should really be careful before assuming too much. Again -- here was my response to the gentleman in question:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;My apologies, but I said \\&quot;a majority of my review is based on research\\&quot;. I should have clarified that my husband and I tried the product in three different capacities. First, I attempted to use it as an antibacterial spray, despite absolutely NO evidence that it is actually effective at killing germs (other than staph, which is questionable). My house reeked for hours afterward. So, attempt number one was disastrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has toe fungus on one toe. Persistent and aggravating. \\&quot;Let me try it on the toe fungus.\\&quot; Again, despite absolutely NO evidence that this is effective, he gave it a go. It immediately caused a negative reaction. He did his best to wash it all off, but the inflammation and irritation took hours to subside. Strike TWO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I decided to use it in my shampoo. I was smart enough NOT to put it in the shampoo container, rather placed a tiny bit on the shampoo in my hand. I got a migraine afterward. I know my shampoo didn&#x27;t cause the migraine, and it occurred right after my shower. Strike three.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> using it for my face and feet. It&#x27;s working well.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product!</li>
    <li> This product is new to me.  I found it here by way of a friend&#x27;s referral.  I&#x27;m totally pleased with it, and would easily refer it myself.  Fine service only makes it better.</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil has the best consistency that I&#x27;ve tried. So far I have used it in a facial mud mask and shea butter/coconut oil body butter. A little goes a long way, and this bottle is huge. The heavy duty amber glass bottle keeps the light from deteriorating the product. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased. My first bottle was beat up in shipping and had leaked (the box was obviously crushed). Customer service was wonderful and I had a new bottle within 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;I got this bottle in an on line contest. The opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it in my soaps ! Love the tea tree.</li>
    <li> I enjoy taking lot, hot baths but I can&#x27;t stand the perfumed junk that&#x27;s usually sold for bath oils or bath salts, even the expensive spa stuff. I like some Epsom salt and tea oil for a cleansing, skin healing, muscle relaxing soak. Tea oil heated in hot bath water is aromatic, it&#x27;s a clean, acerbic scent that I kind of like, but might remind some people of hot tub disinfecting chemicals or manufacturing clean rooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just three drops of this oil in a full tub of hot water will do more for your soak than four ounces of standard bath oil.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil has so many amazing benefits.  It&#x27;s nearly endless what tea tree oil can be used for, and is amazing for holistic medicine.  Essential oils are all the rage.  Pick this one up at a serious discount, as compared to the big name brand oils.  HUGE bottle, too.</li>
    <li> I love this tea tree oil! I discovered this about 2 months ago and I&#x27;m already on my second bottle. I add this oil to my homemade body cream and my homemade lip balm.  This oil has done wonders for my eczema. The E-booklet included is an added bonus. The smell is also great. A definite must have!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality oil. I used this in a mixture to make my own natural deodorant and works great! Use it on all skin irritations and mix it with coconut oil for a nice face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Although I can&#x27;t stand the smell, the tea tree oil has so many uses. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my face, but when I got it, I then knew it was way too strong to use on my face. Total disapointment. I am so bummed. Might work for other things, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Putting it on your face unless you don&#x27;t care about the VERY strong aroma this gives off. :/</li>
    <li> very happy with this. so far i&#x27;ve only used it in the bathtub and in my laundry but when i have more time i&#x27;ll try some of the other recipes. there are so many uses for this... just have to have the time to play around with it. only problem is with the bottle - it doesn&#x27;t drip easily so i have to shake it and when i do i can&#x27;t count the drops.</li>
    <li> The best tea tree oil ever</li>
    <li> Excellent oil. Great quality!</li>
    <li> Apothecary Extracts 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil -- If there were 6 stars I&#x27;d give it on this one. I bought this on a promotion to try it out and review it. I absolutely love this oil.  It is now my go to oil for all manner of skin concerns- I had been battling athelete&#x27;s foot and this stuff really keeps my feet under control. That alone is worth it. But the uses are pretty extensive and there is a handy online guide to tea tree oil uses. I also think the labeling and the packaging is really fun and attractive - I would give this as a give to any of my all natural advocate girlfriends.</li>
    <li> Using this to make my own cleaning products, it comes with a guide for more uses around the home. Amazing</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product, price, delivery time. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product  is amazing and it is organic. I also love the packaging. Making it easier for dispensing  product. I mainly use this to treat my acne. I have a very oily skin. And I always tend to have breakouts. I dispense the product on a cotton ball and applied it on my acne. I have noticed that my acne dried faster. It works the same way as the clean and clear drugstore product. The main difference is that this is an organic product and I love it. And a little goes a long way. The scent is kind of strong but it is an indication that the product is pure and strong. It did not irritate my skin at all. Just do not overdose or put a lot of product in your skin as this oil is potent and it may overdry this skin. I was sent this product for me to test and review. I love it and I think it really works. This will be very Helpful for those who have a very oily and acne prone skin. Give it a try and you will know what I&#x27;m trying to say.</li>
    <li> Addicted to this. I use it for everything!  Mixed with coconut oil in a spray bottle makes my hair grow and conditions my scalp. Very happy and smells so good!</li>
    <li> This tree tea oil is fabulous I use it for tons of different things one important use  is I add 10 drops 4 oz of shampoo and it kills lice this can also be used as a spray with water to prevent lice this us a must have for school aged children it also helps with cuts n scrapes n tons of household uses cleaning etc a few drops goes a long way tree tea oil is a must have in my home n yours to</li>
    <li> Good service n good product</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this tea tree oil. The value is very good at 4 oz bottle for $25. I have paid more for less in the past. I also like that I received an ebook with 53 ways to use the oil, it was very helpful. I definitely will purchase this product again as I like to keep a bottle of oil around the house for first aid purposes.</li>
    <li> Great product.I had a little left from another source used it on a dry spot and got a little rash NO rash with using your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> Great value for such good quality of tea tree oil.  Compared to Now Foods Tea Tree Oil, I prefer Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil.  The smell is somewhat different, but I notice a difference on my skin as well.  It seems to have cleared up after using this for a few weeks versus the Now Foods brand.  Could be just a fluke, however, I&#x27;m sticking with Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil!</li>
    <li> I have been  working for years to get rid of some toenail fungus. This is the only remedy out of MANY I tried that actually works! I can see a difference and I&#x27;m very happy with the progress. As a bonus the vendor sent me a recipe book with different ways to use this product in my home. I had no idea there were so many benefits to tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Quality is high and just what I needed!</li>
    <li> Lately, I have been having an intensly itchy scalp due to dryness and dandruff. I think I have a mixture of the two, but never been officially diagnosed. I decided I would try this stuff and mix it in my Aveeno dandruff shampoo and boy have I noticed a difference. I went from feeling like I had head lice to barely itching at all and I&#x27;ve only used it in my hair a few times. It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest but I&#x27;ll take that over the itching relief I get from this. If I were to describe the smell, it would be dog shampoo, but, like I said, I don&#x27;t care about the smell.</li>
    <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The presentation of this product is great.  It has really pretty packaging.  It comes in a printed box that is protective and has an old country store sort of feel to it, with great graphics about tea tree oil. IT would make a nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 other brands of tea tree oil here that I was able to compare it to.  Compared to the NOW brand, it smells more natural.  I think they maybe use chemical solvents- I can&#x27;t smell any petroleum or other chemicals in this brand.  As far as feel they feel the same.  They both seem about as strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always used tea tree oil as my go to first aid for small cuts and scrapes. I just find that they heal faster. My grown son currently has a cuticle infection so we are putting it on that.  I do find this comes out a bit easier than I like- it doesn&#x27;t pour but I&#x27;m used to bottles that only a drop comes out more slowly.  This one will deliver 3-4 drops fairly quickly, so note that when you first use it. It&#x27;s more of an adjustment than a problem. So far, it seems to be working - the infection seems to be improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it for cleaning.  Tea tree oil sounds like it would smell great but it has a very medicinal smell.  I have grown to like it over the years, but at first I thought smelling it was about as attractive as huffing gas.  In cleaning preparations though, you ONLY need a few drops, so the smell should not be that bad.  I find that if it is mixed with equal amounts of lavender, it can be very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read though that it is not a good idea to use this product directly on young boys that have not went through puberty.  It can POSSIBLY cause growth of manboobs.  I&#x27;ve seen some conflicting reports.  I didn&#x27;t chance it until my son was grown.  It doesn&#x27;t cause any problems in grown men.  My guys use it all the time.  My husband keeps a bottle with him at work for first aid.</li>
    <li> This is a nice large (4 ounce) bottle of 100% pure &amp;#34;pharmaceutical grade&amp;#34; Australian tea tree oil that is bottled in the USA. Not that it&#x27;s that important, but I do like the company name and product packaging (in a glass bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality seems excellent... and there are a lot of uses for tea tree oil which I won&#x27;t rehash here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I can think of no negative, 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It came in a cute little box and smelled pretty pure to me when I opened the bottle:) I use it to remove random pimples quickly. I also use it on my scalp before I do a co-wash. When I run out, I&#x27;ll most definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Excellent extraction of true tea tree oil. This is the real deal. It may be a few bucks more than some competitors, but it is super concentrated so you use less.</li>
    <li> This pure essential oil is distilled from the leaves of the tea tree, Melaleuca alternifolia.  It is very rich in terpenes and has an unmistakable and intense, clean fragrance that is complex, with elements of camphor and eucalyptus balanced by a subtle sweetness.  The scent is a good complement to that of lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very concentrated and should be diluted in a carrier oil before topical use.  Just about any carrier oil works well because the scent of the tea tree oil is so strong.  It can also be used for its fragrance alone, spritzed into the air and on bed linens or added to a misting diffuser.  I find the scent to be very invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amber glass bottle has a convenient dropper plug, which is my favorite way to dispense essential oils.  The box and label are remarkably attractive and a bottle of this oil would make a nice little thank you gift or get well present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red Rover Naturals provided essential oil for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I have tried many tea tree oils. This one is the best! It even smells better. Some people don&#x27;t like how it smells... I do! I normally use tea tree oil after I shave. I love the cooling sensation with this tea tree oil. I can really tell that its the real thing.</li>
    <li> This is a review of the 4oz bottle of Apothecary Extracts&#x27; Tea Tree Oil. I was provided a free sample for evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first learned of Tea Tree Oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) during a trip to Australia. The friend that I was visiting was extolling its virtues, along with Eucalyptus. I&#x27;ll never forget the day we were driving from up in elevation from the Gold Coast towards Brisbane, through a Eucalyptus \\&quot;forest\\&quot;. It started hailing and the smell of Eucalyptus was so strong in the air. It left a lasting impression on me. I know that little story has nothing to do with Tea Tree Oil but that experience is what first got me interested in essential oils and aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next run-in with Tea Tree Oil was when I used some shampoo that had Tea Tree Oil in it. It was invigorating on my scalp and I really enjoyed the aromatherapy experience of the Tea Tree Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I\\&quot;ve used Tea Tree Oil for lots of things as I accumulated knowledge about its various attributes. I won&#x27;t list all the ways you can use Tea Tree Oil because there are so many applications for it... but it is great for using in an aromatherapy diffuser. You can add it to body washes and shampoos, you can add it to your bath water, it can assist in ridding your pet bedding of fleas, it&#x27;s has antimicrobial properties... the list goes on and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of its suggested uses is for getting rid of skin tags. I have a small skin tag that I am using this on right now. According to what I&#x27;ve read, it should be applied to the skin tag a few times a day for up to 1 month. Eventually within that time period, the skin tag should to away. It&#x27;s not always effective to use Tea Tree Oil for that purpose, but there is enough anecdotal literature that suggests it can work. So I&#x27;m giving it a shot and will amend my review with the results. I&#x27;ve read that if the skin tag is not eliminated within 4 weeks, then it probably is safe to assume it will not work for you. Time will tell and the clock is ticking. Whether or not it will work for removing skin tags is not a deciding factor in whether Tea Tree Oil is good at other things,,, it is and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s such a versatile and effective oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my advice when purchasing Tea Tree Oil  is making certain that what you are buying is 100% pure, unadulterated Tea Tree Oil (Melaleuca alternifolia). This product from Apothecary Extracts seems to meet that qualification. It is certified Pharmaceutical Grade and contains no preservatives, artificial colors, fragrances, parabens, mineral oil, petroleum or chemical solvents. It is pure Tea Tree Oil.the clock is ticking. Whether or not it will work for removing skin tags is not a deciding factor in whether Tea Tree Oil is good at other things,,, it is and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s such a versatile and effective oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my advice when purchasing Tea Tree Oil  is making certain that what you are buying is 100% pure, unadulterated Tea Tree Oil (Melaleuca alternifolia). This product from Apothecary Extracts seems to meet that qualification. It is certified Pharmaceutical Grade and contains no preservatives, artificial colors, fragrances, parabens, mineral oil, petroleum or chemical solvents. It is pure Tea Tree Oil.</li>
    <li> tea tree oil has many benefits. its mainly known for its healing benefits. it helps heal and soothe sunburns. it can be used as a cleaner by adding half tsp of tea tree oil and 3 glasses of water. Treats psoriasis and other skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;it has many more benefits but these are some to name few. it is a very useful product and i was lucky to receive it under promotion for honest opinion</li>
    <li> Great quality and a great size bottle. It came packaged in a very nice box (could be nice even for a gift). I am going to use this for so many things including cleaning and for my skin. I love that you get tips and recipes with this purchase. Lots of things I didn&#x27;t know it was good for! I purchased it to use as a cleaner more than anything. I love the smell and it&#x27;s nice to not be smelling the fumes that you get from chemical cleaning agents. You only need a few drops so this bottle will last me a long time. Really happy to have received a discount so I could try out this product and I will definitely be recommending this to friends and I will buy more once this bottle has run out.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I ordered from this company. I agree with other reviewers that this product as well as the company deserves 5 STARS. I purchased this Tee Tree Oil to use on my feet as an anti-fungal agent because I was told it was a very helpful solution. Now I am hearing about all these other uses and recipes for making anti-bacterial hand soap liquids for my hands (maybe might use it as a soap soak for my feet as well) and more. Like I said, so glad I ordered this amazing oil and I will keep ordering more from Amazon. Thank you again.</li>
    <li> This is a 100% pure tea tree oil, so my teenage son uses it, undiluted, as a spot treatment for acne. Careful not to use it undiluted on healthy skin though. My son learned that the hard way. It can cause some redness and burning (which actually proves to me that this isn&#x27;t diluted with fillers and is as described - 100% pure) Just a little dab here and there on his pimples goes a long way. Tea tree oil is known for its antibacterial properties and this tea tree oil works like a charm! I received this bottle through a promotional discount, and my son thanks you! His acne has really improved - and it&#x27;s all natural! Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> I picked this up for my wife, and for the quality and quantity you get, you can do no better than purchase this very item.</li>
    <li> Awesome flavor and tea tree oil is great for pain and for massaging. Very nice bottle, well packaged. Great product. I received a sample in exchange of a review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for many health and household uses for years. When I was given the opportunity to receive this product to review, I was overjoyed!  I&#x27;m used to getting the small, 1 oz bottle when I purchase essential oils, so was even more excited when this tea tree oil was delivered and I saw that it was the large 4 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tea tree oil will give a boost to your natural cleaning products without having to resort to nasty chemicals.  Adding just a little to the laundry will help to freshen it up naturally, and the healing properties are amazing when used in a diffuser, or when applied topically (use sparingly .. it&#x27;s strong stuff!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on cuts and scrapes of my own, and also on livestock.  A small amount added to a bucket of water is great when stripping horse stalls and you don&#x27;t have to worry about your horses standing in the remains of something that might harm them - simply toss fresh bedding in and you&#x27;re good.  Better than lime!  I&#x27;ve also used it to treat bumblefoot (a gross looking foot infection) on my chickens (I was going to attach photos of that, but thought better of it.  It really is gross looking, LOL).  When my dogs get into trouble, tea tree oil is the first thing I reach for.  One just had surgery on his ear, and I will be keeping the small spray bottle of tea tree oil mixture on hand to zap his ear at least once a day to help keep infection at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good quality tea tree oil at a great price.  I usually pay anywhere from $6.99 to $11.99 for a 1 oz bottle of essential oils locally, so even though I got this product to review, $24.99 for a 4 oz bottle (current price I see in the listing) is a good bargain for such a versatile product that can be used in so many ways.  Comes with free ebook of 50 uses for tree tree oil, which is emailed to you after purchase.</li>
    <li> This Tea Tree oil is fantastic. I have very brittle nails and this has worked far better than I could of ever anticipated. If you have bad nails, please try this, you will be very happy. I am very pleased with this product and have told my friends to give it a try because I like it so much. Tea Tree oil has so many uses and it&#x27;s great that the company will send you an ebook for all of the uses.</li>
    <li> (Disclaimer - My wife and I were invited by the seller to try and review their products. We only agree to these requests when it&#x27;s something we would actually use. The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free. Also, for this type of invited review, we always begin with a disclaimer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This review is written from my wife&#x27;s perspective.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have known about the natural anti-bacterial properties of tea tree oil for a long time now, and how great it is for keeping the skin healthy. I always have a bottle in my skin care cabinet, and I have used a number of different brands in the past. This particular bottle is a high quality product yet it is not expensive. All the other bottles I have from other companies were more expensive but not necessarily better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the company provides many different recipes via email link that shows you the many different uses of tea tree oil. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try them out, and immediately made the hair conditioner, which made my hair soft and silky, and gave a nice refreshing feeling to my scalp. There was no irritation of any kind. I also mixed some into my body wash and the smell really relaxes me, and I know it&#x27;s great for my skin. I even put some in my body lotion. At my desk, I have a scent oil bottle, and I mixed the tea tree oil with lavender and orange oil, and it smells great--very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this tea tree oil a lot and I&#x27;ll continue to use it in different areas of my life. I think every household should have a bottle of tea tree oil, and I would definitely recommend this to family and friends.</li>
    <li> This bottle is going to last a good long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe in full disclosure: this company solicited a review and sent this to me to test.&lt;br /&gt;However, I never review products which I haven&#x27;t tried and I don&#x27;t review them until I&#x27;ve tried them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a top notch product.  I have used tea tree oil/melaleuca for many years as antiseptic and antifungal for such things as abrasions, rashes and small cuts, cat scratches/bites, bug bites, and externally and internally for fungal infections. When combined with a natural oil like almond or coconut oil it is both cleansing and soothing, as melaleuca is a drying agent.  Diluted 3/1 with water, it can be used on an infected tooth to very good result.  There are different grades of Tea Tree Oil; this one is top notch which is why it costs a little more but it is very much worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brand of Tea Tree Oil.</li>
    <li> This seems to be working great. I&#x27;ve seen results in a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> Great product can be used for so many different things</li>
    <li> The smell takes some getting used to, but the Tea Tree Oil has done everything it promised to do so far.</li>
    <li> I love tea tree oil, but finding a decent brand can be difficult in my rural area.  I was so happy to be contacted by Apothecary Extracts to try out their tea tree oil.  It did not disappoint!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it came in the most adorable little box, which I loved!  I like items to be pretty when I receive them, and the little box this came in was awesome!  I am always concerned ordering anything liquid in the mail, there is obviously the chance that it can be broken or leaking.  Neither was the case with the tea tree oil.  It was delivered in a careful fashion, so there were no issues during shipment.  It was also shipped out extremely fast!  I placed my order on March 30th and it was delivered on April 2nd!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When purchasing this tea tree oil, the manufacturer e-mails you an entire book on the benefits of tea tree oil.  It was an amazing resource.  I know a lot of the benefits already, and use it often in making my own cleaning and beauty products, but to have the information all available in a nice little e-book was a definite plus.  The company really wants you to have a great experience with their product, and they are amazing on customer service and anticipating what the customer may need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to use tea tree oil in homemade laundry soap, as well as in wipe solution for cloth wipes and cloth diapers.  It also works great as a cleanser for skin infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is an amazing product and I was very happy with the service that I received, and I will definitely be ordering from them again.  The cost for what you receive is great, as essential oils are typically quite expensive.  I was expecting to receive a smaller bottle, but this will last me for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this company for future tea tree oil purchases, and can&#x27;t wait to check out what other products they offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as well as compensation in return for my review.  All opinions are my own, and I never endorse a product I don&#x27;t believe in and use myself!</li>
    <li> I received my Tea Tree Oil and was impressed how it helped my psoriasis out, my lesions were not so red and the patches didn&#x27;t itch as much. I put it on a skin tag and will see how it works on it. It helps a lot with my dry skin, I apply it at night after a bath and my legs are not dryer out like usual, I&#x27;m i pressed</li>
    <li> I love using this oil. I used it and mixed a little with water to spray my door. We had a lot of bug constantly trying to get and since I sprayed this my issue is gone! It works amazing and no chemicals. The scent is nice and its not super greasy. I did receive it a discounted price to review</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and delighted with the speedy delivery. My Dr. Recommended it for a toe that has a fungus...it stopped the pain immediately, yet I know it will take a while to heal...I am not ingesting another &amp;#34;drug companies&amp;#34; pill with side effects.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service from Red Rover Naturals.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Pure oil.  Great company.  Tea Tree oil has many health benefits, as everyone has noted.</li>
    <li> Love tea tree oil and this brand seems great. Love the packaging</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great. I enjoy it very much.</li>
    <li> Purchased for daughter, who is writing this review: Very potent, but I personally love the smell. I looked up uses, I have been using it with my shampoo &amp; put some on my face every other night. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive a free sample of this Tea Tree Oil to try because I&#x27;ve used and liked face products with tea tree oil as an ingredient for treating my acne.  However, I don&#x27;t always love the scent or feel of these products.  I also have skin that is sensitive to some ingredients, so making my own beauty products with 100% Tea Tree Oil seemed like a great way to control what I put on my face and create products with scents that I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since receiving this I&#x27;ve been impressed with how many natural beauty recipes there are out there that call for tea tree oil from masks to spot treatments to scrubs.  I especially love that some only call for a few drops making this bottle last a long time.  I&#x27;ve also found this to be just as effective for treating acne as buying pre made products that list tea tree oil as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been surprised to learn that you can use this for many purposes beyond beauty like removing ticks, as a cleaning product, and also as an antiseptic for cuts and scrapes.  It makes it a handy multi-purpose oil to have around and it really works.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product.</li>
    <li> This is a really good tea tree oil because its  100% pure Autralian - harvested tea tree oil in a big 4fl oz bottle. I heard  a lot of good uses of tea tree oil but I use it mainly to treat my acne. I been using it for my face for a long time and at least now I can use this and mixed it with the coconut oil. This is good as a mild antiseptic for mild cuts and soothes skin bites. This comes in handy with burns too, apply it and will prevent from developing blisters! With all these uses it comes in handy to have this at home. I can go on and on with the  tea tree oil uses and it truly amazes me! It can be used as an all-purpose cleaner too: Just fill a spray bottle with 1-2 tsp. of tea tree oil and the rest of the bottle with water. This is worth buying for that&#x27;s why its highly recommended!</li>
    <li> With so many uses for this Tea tree oil you really cant go wrong getting it. its 100%pure and you get a huge bottle of it for the money . what is also really helpful is that they send you the recipe guide so you can make tons of things with it . this bottle will last and last because after looking over the recipes I see a little goes a very long way .&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
    <li> The product is great and it arrived early. Yeah!!</li>
    <li> Had an opportunity to review this and have been using it for several days on my toes to help fight a fungus issue.  I&#x27;ve used other brands in the past but this one seems to be working great, even after such a short period.</li>
    <li> Great product with many uses.</li>
    <li> Lovely tea tree oil. Good potent smell. I use this liberally.</li>
    <li> I commonly use a essential oils in cold process soap, household cleaners, and other ways to do things around  the house while still being &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;. I have previously purchased tea tree oil and have been very excited by the quality of this particular bottle of tea tree oil. You can do so many things with tea tree oil. Not only do you have to use it as in a diffuser but is also known as a natural antifungal, antibiotic etc. I am very pleased and have been very excited by the quality of this particular tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and was received very quickly.  The free how to use book was an added bonus that will allow me to get maximum benefit from this oil. Thanks.</li>
    <li> If I had to go by smell alone, I would say that this is a pure, unadulterated oil --  strong and working as I expect it to.  It says for external use only, but I use it in some of my oral hygiene recipes for it&#x27;s anticeptic properties.  The size is great, since the oils I have purchased previously were a half ounce to two ounces.  The bottle pictured has a plastic cap, but the one I recieved has an old time metal cap, like and extract.  Complimentary sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil is one of the most versatile essential oils. It was the first oil that I can remember my grand mother using around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this should be called the wonder oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the product information, this oil will help to naturally fight Acne, Lice, Yeast Infections, Skin Tags, Cold Sores, Dandruff, Ringworm, Fleas, Warts, Psoriasis, and More.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite uses are  in shampoo and for fighting viruses. I like massaging a drop or two into my scalp to help with flaky skin. It also really does help with tummy woes in the teens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just dab a little on a cotton ball and apply to scrapes and scratches. Soak your feet in a warm tub with a couple of drops of oil. Oh, you will just feel the stress float away! Got a stuff head? Add a few drops to your bath to soothe and open respiratory tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other uses include cleaners, detergents, shower sprays, and disinfectants.   You can use this oil in just about any room in your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is an amazing oil. If you are not familiar with it, you will be surprised at all the uses for it around your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> I have been using Red Rover Naturals Tea Tree Oil for 4-1/2 months and the product has cleared my pimples and blackheads, shrunk the pores on my nose, eliminated and shrunk my skin tags, and lightened dark spots.  I know with continued use twice a day after washing face with soap and water rinsing and drying well, I will achieve my goal of reversing the signs of aging. I use the Tea Tree Oil without diluting it and apply it by pouring a bit of it on my fingers and rubbing it gently all over my face. I apply it twice to areas of concern. I am 58 and my friends and family say I look better than they ever seen me. DO NOT GET IN EYES, INSIDE NOSTRILS OR INSIDE MOUTH.</li>
    <li> Okay here it goes. I love this product.  I use it for my hair and it makes my hair feel so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited I found it about this product. I love the oils it has a string scent to it but I have been using for my skin tag i found and putting on my fungi toe nail. There are so many things you can use with this oil thank you for the great tips for uses</li>
    <li> The best Tea Tree Oil I have ever used! Pure and potent! The free recipe guide is a bonus.</li>
    <li> I mixed this in my face wash and it has helped clear it up better the the soap alone</li>
    <li> first bottle came broken and they replaced immediately and with no issues</li>
    <li> High quality. Fast shipping. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> good stuff, real deal.</li>
    <li> My friend gave me a bottle of this tea tree oil to review, I use it to clean especially areas that are moldy.  It works great!  This is my favorite disinfectant.  You only need 2-3 drops in a bucket of water the oil is just that good. So while the bottle is not that big, it will last you awhile.</li>
    <li> Received this product on discount and boy was I excited about reviewing it.  The scent is really excellent and tea tree is so useful for so many things.  My parents did come to town and swipe this one from me, but while I had it it was great.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately not seeing the results I had so strongly expected. I&#x27;ve been applying to a wart and skin tag daily and nightly for a month now with no visible results. Not knocking the brand or seller, just the fact it is not working as I expected.</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil as a sample for review and evaluation and I love it! It comes in a very cute box that is suitable for gifting. It&#x27;s a huge 4 oz bottle that will last you quite a while! I have been using tea tree oil products for about 20 years now but have only recently been using the pure essential oil. It works great in my diffusers and I sometimes use it in my bath. I am not extremely sensitive to the oil so I can use it undiluted on my skin in small amounts without any issues but I&#x27;m always very careful if using it in a new way (if you have never used this oil be sure to read over the safety instructions!!). Most important I feel as though this is a trustworthy source, I am very hesitant to use oils on my body or in my bath unless I am more familiar with the source and I feel like this oil is an excellent quality (they even offer to send your their test results of the oil). Overall I am very happy with this and love how versatile it is.</li>
    <li> Awesome service!  Just learning about the many uses and hope to be able to speak to the effectiveness of the product soon!</li>
    <li> Great product and great value for the money. It has a really nice scent and not all the tea tree oils do.</li>
    <li> I am such a huge believer in the powers of Tea Tree Oil. My sister is always telling how amazing Tea Tree Oil is for you body and also your hair. I love using Tea Tree Oil in my hair. It’s one of those products that are part of my daily natural hair regimen. Every product I own has a hint of Tea Tree Oil in it because I am literally obsessed. When I was given the opportunity by BrandBacker to try out the Apothecary Extracts 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil I was so elated. I’ve always wanted to work with them but every time I applied for a campaign I was denied but not this time. The first thing that stood out to me with this product was the smell. This Tea Tree Oil is pure (the real thing). The odor is so pungent that to be honest I sometimes don’t even want to use it but I got over it. I love to apply it when my hair is clean, which is right after I shampoo it. Normally I have a very itchy scalp but since I started using this brand my itchy scalp isn’t so itchy anymore. I noticed that a lot of the acne and yes I get acne on my scalp it’s so disgusting but I noticed that it hasn’t been appearing that much. I am in love with this product and now I am mixing it with my Tea Tree Oil Shampoo and conditioner because even though it’s oil it’s not really oily so it can be mixed with anything. My only reservation about the product is the smell of it but soon I’ll get over it. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who has hair problems or simply just wants to try out Tea Tree Oil.</li>
    <li> As an avid user of oils I have to say this is an amazing, high quality product. It is from a brand I trust and their oil making practices are good.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very large bottle which will treat my dogs the whole summer.&lt;br /&gt;I was given mine at a reduced rate to help facilitate this review.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome but very strong smell.I had been wanting to try 100% organic tea tree oil for some time now but didn&#x27;t want to pick just any brand. I&#x27;m glad i chose this one honestly. The amount is great for the price and it&#x27;s 100% organic. Most tea tree oils are mixed with other oils it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to mix this with a powdered mask and yes the smell is strong but you get over it. After i rinsed my mask i mixed argon ouloil with the te tree oil and applied to my face then went to bed. My face has been feeling great and clear!!</li>
    <li> Excellent oil, and concentrated making this a great buy, a little goes a long way! I wanted to try Tea Tree Oil for a while, I used to use the oil back in my teens, as a acne fighter. Now as an adult I decided to try a DIY homemade deodorant, for my daughter and her very sensitive skin. Having sensitive skin, my daughter cannot use store bought deodorant without breaking out in a rash with bumps. She says it is very irritating, being a teen she doesn&#x27;t want to smell bad, so I started to look into DIY, natural deo.  I came across a recipe that includes, coconut oil, baking soda and essential oils, one of them being tea tree oil, I choose Tea tree for its antiseptic properties. I wanted something that would help my daughter with her rash. Well, after trying it just one time she is absolutely loving it! The smell at first was a little strong, I had to balance the ratio, but the baking soda actually helped in that dept. at downplaying the tree&#x27;s smell.  My daughter is amazed that she has not incurred any outbreaks and she loves that it actually works at eliminating the odor. I love the savings cost of diy, so win-win. A little about the oil.. It last a very long time, smells fresh, and not overly oily. The only problem I had was a little leaked out during shipping and my box was wet with oil, but it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, and I wasn&#x27;t missing a lot of product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have bought Tea Tree Oil numerous times from numerous sources and I have to say that Apothecary Extracts is the BEST.  Even after a few uses I have already noticed a significant difference in my skin tone.  I am also enjoying the add-on of the E-Book Recipe Book.  I had no idea that the oil could be used in so many different ways.  I basically bought for skin tag removal , so I&#x27;m so happy to learn of its many other uses to charm my life.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Carolyn Lee</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil is definitely full strength.  It was leaking a little when the box was opened, but most of it was left in the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is going to last me a long time</li>
    <li> I use this exclusively on my neck, ears, face as an astringent after I wash, followed by jojoba oil.  It is wonderful.  I love the tingle it leaves and it tightens my pores so much they are nearly invisible.  It really cleans the skin (the cotton ball shows the dirt removed) and it has taken years off my face.  I would not hesitate to use this in other applications such as soap and air purification.  A year ago I went gluten free/paleo and as natural as I can with cleaning products.  I have never felt better.  I highly recommend this product.  In fact, I suggested it to my best friend and she purchased it as well.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT... IT is a great oil for so many things--- will be a staple at my home!</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used Tea Tree Oil for a couple of years now and find it useful for several things.  I originally bought some for a tooth ache  and it seemed to help.  Plus my husband had a toe nail infection and I read that it was useful for that as well although it does take some time and consistent usage.  Tea Tree Oil is one of those natural products that has dozens of uses for all sorts of things.  I was then offered a complimentary bottle of this tea tree oil several months ago and accepted because I knew it was something I could use.  I also appreciate the quality of the offering.  This company provides a &amp;#34;recipe book&amp;#34; filled with all sorts of ways you can mix and match it to better serve your needs.  About the only thing that I have done  (other than use it straight out of the bottle) is use it as a facial cleanser.  The recipe was simple but I had to buy a few other ingredients to mix it with.  So far so good.  I like the way it my skin feel and I also like the smell of it.  I primarily want to have it on hand to use to treat skin irritations and also as a healing tincture when necessary.  Even better it is a large bottle and will likely keep for a very long time. I may come back again in the future and update this review once I&#x27;ve been using it for even longer.  So far I&#x27;m extremely happy with the product and believe anyone else looking for quality tea tree oil will also be please.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. I used it on a very bad breakout. It hurt like crazy. I put this on it morning noon and night the past couple days and boy has it helped. Also helped clear up sinuses. Lol. The smell is strong but if you can get past that, the helpfulness is immense. I was starting with a cold and last night I put a bit of the oil on my chest and I woke up this morning much better. You also get a free ebook with helpful tips. Received this product for review.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time with bonus book of recipes</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this oil. It is a good value and the quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil has changed my life. I use it for many reasons, I use it in my diffuser for nasal congestion and runny nose. I place 10 drops each of tea tree oil, lavender and eucalyptus in the water in the diffuser.</li>
    <li> I love the size of this bottle it&#x27;s a great size. Most companies bottles are only about 10-15 ml. Tea Tree oil can be used for so much bug bites, antiseptic andflea deterrent around dog beds and so much more. We do not use traditional home cleansers or disinfectants and Tea Tree isa perfect oil choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: a sample of this product was provided free of charge, however all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I bought the this tea tree oil because it is from a family owned company here in the US, where it is made and because it is 100% pure. The packaging is very creative and cute—I love the vintage style labeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a VERY sensitive nose and some of the other tea tree oils I have used in the past have smelled just awful. This stuff smells great. There are so many different uses for it. I use it in my hair as an anti-dandruff / moisturizer and for my skin in lieu of a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair smell so good and it feels so smooth—no dandruff either. If you have sensitive skin and want to use this as part of a beauty regime I suggest testing it on a small area as it is very potent. You can always mix the oil with another oil such as coconut to bring down the potency. I use it on my entire body after a shower and it makes my skin feel great, look great and makes it super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helps with sore muscles. (There are a ton of things it’s good for, these are just the things I use it for). I keep it by my bedside so I can use it in the morning on my stiff joints. It’s not greasy and absorbs quickly … you don’t need a lot, a little goes a long way! I am so happy with this product and intend to buy it again and again!</li>
    <li> a little bit strong, as odor goes, but I &#x27;accidentally&#x27; found out that it can heal very well.  I used it for my hair, and I have had an open sore on my finger for a few years now, the oil got into my band-aid, and I think it is actually healing!</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil has so many great uses. You should just have it around. I loved the presentation/box it came in and felt really good that the company gave me a quality product!</li>

    <li> Oh my gosh am I in love with this stuff. I can now make my cleaning products from it.  I now make shampoos and even my lotions from it. I think calling myself a Tea Tree Oil addict is an understatement. I am amazed at what you can make at home with this oil and just a few inexpensive ingredients. I definitely give this my thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;I had never used Tea Tree Oil before but I will never use anything else. Who knew it would remove my skin tags. I never had a clue. As well as helping me with my dandruff and cleaning my home by making home made chemical free cleaning products for my kitchen, bath and whole home. This is amazing stuff. I cannot rave enough about just how awesome this product is and the free eBook you get after purchasing this is an amazing read.  There are a ton of helpful uses for the oil. I highly suggest you buy a bottle.</li>

    <li> Product works well and is versatile.</li>
    <li> nice oil for many use!</li>
    <li> I received the below mentioned complimentary product for the purpose of this review. All opinions are 100% my own. I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever heard of Tea Tree Oil? I hadn&#x27;t. So when I was asked if I would review the product I had to google to see what it was and I was shocked. Tea Tree oil can be used for so many things its unbelievable! My daughter (she&#x27;s 23) said &amp;#34;Mom, I can&#x27;t believe you never heard of it. I was told to use it when I got my lip pierced, that it would speed up the healing&amp;#34; Ok again I have to ask &amp;#34;WHY havent I heard of this before?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you about this product. 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil is one of the most versatile essential oils.

Can you imagine 50 + uses for a single product. What a money saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other Tea Tree oils 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil is 100% undiluted, and without impurities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading for hours all the uses of this product I decided I would try it on a skin tag I suddenly found on the back of my neck. How I got a skin tag I will never know. The first thing you notice when you open the bottle is the odor. To me it was not pleasant at all but if it works I can live with the smell. I applied the tea oil twice a day and it was a little over 2 weeks when the tag was completely gone. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product that worksut if it works I can live with the smell. I applied the tea oil twice a day and it was a little over 2 weeks when the tag was completely gone. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product that works</li>
    <li> I loved it. I use it for my acne and helps so much.</li>
    <li> Smells quite strong, but it healed my fever blister in half the time of OTC pharmaceuticals. Also helped my mom&#x27;s shingles!</li>
    <li> I have experimented with this product primarily for use in a diluted shampoo to learn how to control scalp eczema or other ailment of my hair oil ducts.  Anyone else&#x27;s ratios may vary.  I first diluted Dr. Broomer Castile unscented, mild baby shampoo 2 oz. to 22 oz. filtered, boiled water in an empty, cleaned Joy dish liquid soap bottle.  I then added 10 drops of this Tea Tree Oil per 4 oz. of diluted shampoo, or 60 drops.  Not knowing if the oil separates or emulsifies, I shake the bottle vigorously before each use to insure that the oil is mixed before use.  I just leaned over in the shower after completely rinsing my scalp with luke warm water, only, and pour the mix into the cup of one hand and apply with both hands and fingers gently rubbing it into my total scalp hair.  Depending on how oily one&#x27;s hair is, it may take a few applications to have an adequate lather, and then very thoroughly rinse in luke warm water, only taking special care all the while to not get any of the mix with Tea Tree Oil in one&#x27;s eyes.  In the process of using this mix procedure, my hair is more oily and soft and the scalp condition is well under control.  Now, I sometimes just luke warm shower water rinse my scalp thoroughly instead of shampooing every other day.  I have tried just rinsing more than two days, but the scalp irritation returns or my hair gets too oily.  Often, I can run my finger tips through my entire scalp and not feel any sign of the previous uncontrolled condition.  Since this procedure worked so well, I also experimented with using a Qtip to dab straight Tea Tree Oil to the surface of Mosaic Warts on my body, and have seen them dissolve after repeated applications after showering.  I have also used the same application process on decades old black heads, and I have observed them seeming to dissolve and shrink in diameter.  It is now my first choice to treat skin disorders.  12/01/2016 - still using this effectively.  I find it difficult to even spot the old blackheads.  A skin clinic doctor told me that blackheads are caused by bacteria, and that the tea tree oil is an anti-bacterial, so that explains to me why the black heads have shrunk over time.  My scalp is still better, but I have to use it daily in the shower, but without using any other shampoo or other soap on my scalp.  If I would otherwise not take a shower every day, a thorough rinse of my scalp to hydrate it.</li>
    <li> Gotta love it when a product has a big Warning 100% Pure on the packaging.  I am very familiar with Tea Tree oil and it&#x27;s benefits.  I use it for almost everything...add to shampoo &amp; conditioner, as an anticeptic &amp; antibacterial, with a carrier oil in a diffuser and so much more.</li>
    <li> No leaks during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;The package is unassuming, and looks semi-vintage.&lt;br /&gt;This is full strength essential oil.  It has strong scent and works well in soap making.&lt;br /&gt;No skin irritation for me, with no allergy to tea tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fine if you personally use melaleuca / tea tree oil for potpourri, lotions, soap, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The price when I got it was comparable with bulk essential oil, but more than fragrance oils.&lt;br /&gt;Today, I see it&#x27;s unavailable.  I hope it&#x27;s just between production batches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is suitable for a gift, or for your own use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product reviewed was provided as a free sample.</li>
    <li> tried another brand of Australian tea tree oil side to side Apothecary wins I think you&#x27;rs is a better quality product the consistency when applied has more of a silky feel and glide. Continue the great quality on all your products and you will have repeat customers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out a sample of Austrailian Tea Tree Oil that I recently received, and it does a good job in a variety of situations. I&#x27;ve mixed it with my shampoo, and it works well in controlling dandruff. Granted, I don&#x27;t have a LOT of hair, but this keeps what I do have looking good. I also saw that it&#x27;s a good disinfectant for cuts and scrapes. I decided to try it out on a couple of scrapes I received, and it shortened the healing time considerably. I found that as I get older, the cuts and scabbing tend to hang around longer than they used to. This seems to speed up the healing and leaves the area looking more like it did before I hurt myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to trying this out for other uses that are recommended. I doubt I&#x27;ll get to the point where I would try it for the more extreme uses like chicken pox or gout, but I like what it does to skin surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Vendor&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
    <li> Just started using it for a short time.  Trying to clear up nail fungus and so far I don&#x27;t see any change. Granted I have to be more diligent, I use 2x a day.  The only thing I see more is a white residue round the toenail.  Used it for as antiseptic recently and it helped heal a sore on leg.  Will have to wait couple more weeks to see improvement in toenail.</li>
    <li> This is a great value! The size is very generous, and the tea tree oil is just what my skin needs!</li>
    <li> I have only used the tea tree oil for a couple days now. It is a powerful scent! I am likeing it so far.</li>
    <li> I have found three unusual uses for my Apothecary 100% Tea Tree Oil.  First, if you have a front-loader washer and find that it starts emitting a foul odor, just mix five drops of tea tree oil in with the liquid laundry detergent you are using for your laundry load.  The tea tree oil completely eliminates the odor and most likely kills whatever is causing the odor, as it has not come back!  What a blessing!&lt;br /&gt;Second, along the same line, if your car&#x27;s air conditioner starts pushing out a foul smell, just mix the tea tree oil with vinegar and water in a spray bottle and spray completely along the outside air intake while the a/c is running; it works like a charm and gets rid of the smelly air!&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, my husband cleaned our rain gutters with the above spray solution, and it worked perfectly to take off winter&#x27;s gray buildup on our white rain gutters.  This worked much easier than toxic products we have tried on the gutters in the past. I will never be without this Tea Tree Oil!  It&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
    <li> I got this on a very good discounted price. Its a magical product for acne and blemishes. It made my skin clear in few days of use..I am totally in love with this product. You just need a little not much and it will make acne vanish completely.</li>
    <li> CAUTION: This tea tree oil is VERY strong. It must be mixed with a carrier oil if applied to the skin or scalp, or diluted when used as a cleaning or fabric refreshing product. A few drops go a very long way, since it is 100% pure Tea Tree oil. With that being said this is a very good product. I have been using it to disinfect, clean, and freshen my home. I&#x27;ve also used it as a dandruff treatment for my son mixed with coconut oil. I do not recommend using this product as aromatherapy in a diffuser since the scent is very strong. A drop or two in a roller ball with a carrier oil would be a better option.</li>
    <li> Like the tea tree oil.  As nice as any I purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> I have previously used Tea Tree oil, but the quality was not as good as this kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that this oil smells like tea! I like to use this oil in my oil diffuser to scent the room. The tea scent calms me, and with the easy drip opening on the bottle it allows the oil to drop right into my diffuser without making a mess. Great oil to prep for a manicure, to soften cuticles. Another awesome use is just using this oil to massage into the body. The oil massage softens the skin and relaxes sore muscles. Lastly I use this oil on the ends of my hair where it is lacking oil. This helps to prevent split ends and will add a shine to dull hair. Discounted sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Work at a Vet Hospital and Tea Tree is always good to have around in case of ringworm outbreaks.  This is a great value for the size.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I made some soap with it and wash my face and my acne seems to be clearing up. It makes my skin feel fresh. Theres many uses thi. This is my favorite.</li>
    <li> After finishing my GNC tea tree oil I find this one from Amazon. I got it with a deep discounted price, but I will review it honestly.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this oil is a little different from the GNC tea tree oil: the GNC has a stronger scent. I used this one to do some cleaning, mixed with water and other oil. It works great to remove the grease. Works better than the lemon oil I have.&lt;br /&gt;The cap of the bottle, I received, is not plastic but metal and the shape is distorted upon arrival. I hope another type of cap can be used: drops or press and open caps.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it on the skin yet since I do not have the need. But I heard that it is good to kill bacterial.</li>
    <li> What a GREAT PURCHASE! WELL WORTH THE PRICE. The bottle is bigger than what I had expected and the quality is amazing. I use it on my face or I use it as an oil for massage thought the smell is a bit pungent for those not used to the smell of tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Smell reminds me of a cozy old man working in his shop, it&#x27;s comforting to me. Using it on my skin. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Some of the most important things to consider when picking out an essential are the quality and purity of the product. This apothecary extracts essential oil excels in both. This oil is 100% pure, not some watered down version that&#x27;s diluted with filler oil and it is a high quality, potent oil. It comes in a sturdy glass bottle with a built in dropper top. Although I prefer to use an eyedropper, this top can definitely come in handy.    There are so many uses for tea tree oil and this large 4 oz. bottle will be plenty for all your needs. If you&#x27;re new to using essential oils, be sure to check out the ebook that comes with your purchase for loads of ideas on how to experiment from health and beauty treatments to home cleaning products.    This is a great value for a quality product. I definitely recommend both this oil and the brand!    Disclosure: I received a sample of this review. All opinions are my own based on my experiences with the product.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped quickly and arrived safely.  Thanks for the recipe book and the high quality product.</li>
    <li> came very quickly to my house!! the smell is not the best, but I guess pure tea tree oil has that smell. Mixed with lavender makes the smell better.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite brand of tea tree oil. I love the versatility of it. My favorite way to use it is combining coconut oil, tea tree oil and honey and making a hair mask. 5 Stars!!</li>
    <li> I have been using tea tree products for a long time! So I was super excited to be able try this product for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with the tea tree oil I was also given a PDF file with TONS of cool tea tree recipes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apothecary Extracts sent me a coupon code for a free bottle with free shipping on Amazon.com. I received the bottle in just a couple of days and get the recipe guide via email. As soon as I opened the box I smelled the wonderful small of the tea tree. The bottle was a big 4 ounces. Which is lot since such a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a tea tree dog shampoo but it was very expensive. So I immediately added some to my dogs shampoo and gave them a bath. My older dog gets a lot of hot spots and sores so I was hoping I had enough in the shampoo to help. First thing I noticed was that the few fleas my dogs had escaped very fast! The fleas did not like the tea tree! Bonus! Since using it we had had zero ticks and fleas and my dogs hot spots are SO much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this on my daughters acne and bug bits which relieves the discomfort almost immediately. My mom has been using it on her athletes foot that would not go away until she used the tea tree and hot water to soak her feet in now she no longer complains about itching and discomfort. I have been having fun using the recipes I was sent in my email. The possibilities are endless with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it to anyone for SO many different uses! Thank you Apothecary Extracts!</li>
    <li> Let me start my review by saying that I think I found a Tea Tree Oil brand that works really well for me and my sensitive skin - 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil by Apothecary Extracts! I can use it for a gazillion other things as it naturally fights acne, fungus, lice, yeast infections, skin tags, cold sores, dandruff, ringworm, fleas, warts, psoriasis, etc. You can also use it in your home and make all natural household cleaners and sprays. I have personally tried using it to clean and disinfect our fridge - and I am quite happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try the “Australian Tea Tree Oil” &amp; its many uses “Recipe Guide!” When I think back to my first impression of this product, I was truly amazed at how multifunctional Australian Tea Tree Oil actually is. Plus that this is an all natural product. Even one bottle can last you well over a year even with regular use. Just check out this impressive list of the many uses Australian Tea Tree Oil can contribute to you &amp; your home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus after viewing that list I would defiantly recommend keeping a bottle of Australian Tea Tree Oil in stock in your home on a regular basis. Since I can personally say this product would have came in handy a ton of times in the past if only I knew about it. Not to mention its other functions that would be useful in day to day life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However in the future I would also love to see this company come out with some of these pre made for instant use.  I think that would be an impressive line of products, don&#x27;t you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all what I love about this company is that with your large four ounce bottle purchase you’ll also receive a free one hundred page guide. Providing you with the many ways to use tea tree oil to help improve your life, while helping you replace the harmful cleaners around the house! I personally have a long way to get before I get to try them all, but so far my favorite uses have been in the form of house hold cleaners. What would/is your favorite?</li>
    <li> Great value for the quality.</li>
    <li> i use this when i have breakouts and almost always i see a noticeable difference in the blemish once applied. its always my go to when i need an instant fix. definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have oily and acne-prone skin, and I&#x27;ve literally tried every anti-acne product in the market. A few of my friends has always told me to try tea tree oil because it works quickly and it&#x27;s an all natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first time using the oil I took a q-tip and dipped it in the oil and applied the oil directly to the pimples on my chin. I had two that were just huge. They began to diminish in a couple of days. This is the single best solution I&#x27;ve ever found for getting rid of pimples and it&#x27;s a natural way. This product comes with an E-Book that shows you so many ways and uses tea tree oil is good for and honestly I was amazed at some. You can use this oil as a natural cleaner for your home, anti-fungal and it is also used to soothe respiratory ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased tea tree oil before and this I must say is by far the best! This oil is 100% pure and contains no fillers or additives. You will love how versatile it is and how many great benefits you can get from it. The sample of this product was provided free of charge and all the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  I am very satisfied wit the product and their excellent customer service!  They deserve 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil has a lot of great uses, so I was excited to get to review Apothecary Extracts 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil for free during a promotion. You can use it to make your own shampoo, lotion, face and body wash, household cleaners, to treat acne, lice, skin tags, cold sores, and even fleas on pets. It&#x27;s a versatile jack of all trades product! I like that this one comes with a free ebook that gives you a huge selection of uses for your Tea Tree Oil. I love that it&#x27;s 100% pure, and is harvested using conservation farming. The scent of this Tea Tree Oil is very strong, I could smell it through the packing when it arrived. Personally, it drove my allergies crazy, so I couldn&#x27;t even use it. But I did pass it on to a friend who loves it.</li>
    <li> Oil arrived packaged well &amp; fun old style box  Seems to be a quality oil. I have tried other brands years ago, but this appears to be superior to those. Many uses planned for the oil.</li>
    <li> As I delver further into using essential oils, I expand what I am using and how I use it. I had been hearing about Tea Tree Oil so I was super excited to receive a bottle of this to review and I can say I love the power it has! I haven&#x27;t yet gotten to use it for any sickness related uses, because.... well we haven&#x27;t been sick! Thank goodness for that! I have gotten to use it for cleaning various things around our home and it is a wonderful cleaner and sanitizer!  We also just started using it for some skin issues, like a spot I have had on my leg and some small warts on a family member&#x27;s hand. Our use has only been for a few weeks so far, but we are noticing marked improvement. I was unprepared for the scent, but realized right away that when using on the skin, the smell is gone within just a moment. It also doesn&#x27;t take much at all!&lt;br /&gt;The only real suggestion I can make that could improve the use would be the inclusion of a dropper instead of the small hole it has. It would make using it so much easier. There may be a reason it is manufactured this way, but I feel like I would have better and easier control with a dropper. As for the product itself I just love what I have experienced so far and will be experimenting further with some of the recipes included in the ebook very soon.</li>
    <li> I use for my hair and dry skin it work verygood I love it.</li>
    <li> Using for toe nail fungus and seems to be helping....very slowly but I&#x27;ve read to stay persistent with it and it will go away. Here&#x27;s hoping!</li>
    <li> just what i expected thank you</li>
    <li> Wonderful item.  Loved the oil</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil has so many uses.  I have used it in shampoos for many years and now have tried some additional uses.  I have made my own cleaning solution and used it to treat the dog beds.  I like the smell but prefer to mix with lavender. I received this at a reduced price but with all the possible uses will have to purchase more when this runs out. This brand is 100% pure which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> This is still in debate to love it or to really love it that is the question i took it and made soap with it and cleaner and i dont just love it i overly love it, i used it as a cleaner on my floor and stripped all that nasty yick off my floor you know those black marks that come from nothing specially when you dont wear shoes in the house. takes tape off my mirrors with ease and the smell isnt over powering in my soap either Thank you sooooooooo much for letting me try this i had so much fun even used it on my neighbors hair however i dont think i will be seeing that bottle again she kind of kept it but that&#x27;s ok i used a lot lot of it and there was only a tiny bit left&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> First quality tea tree oil, perfect for so many uses.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!!!  Super great price and the bottle is super full. I have bought from other places and the bottle was not full like this one. Works great! Highly recommend!!!! I did receive this for a review, but it is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I never had problems with acne when I was younger. Now, I am fifty and have some problem with pimples/boils on my head and under my arms. I also get acne on my shoulders and the top of my back. It is annoying and I have trouble getting rid of it. This is my first time using tea tree oil. I thought I would try it on the acne and it works well. It gets rid of it without sores and other problems I have had with scratching at the problem. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other recipes, but will in the future. I just know I have a product that will help me with this middle-aged acne problem. Look forward to using this product the way many other people have done.</li>
    <li> It is an amazing product.  We ordered it because my husband had a couple of skin tags and we heard tea tree oil would work to remove them.  They are all gone. Have not tried any of the recipes using the oil yet but intend to!!!</li>
    <li> So many uses for Tea Tree Oil!  Google it &amp; you will find how people use this essential oil.  And the Amazon reviews section will give you many ideas.  You can use this for zits, boils, nail fungus, soothing sore muscles, cleaning, disinfecting &amp; making other products.  I did receive this oil at a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  This oil seems to be a universal do-it-all essential oil.  I&#x27;m going to soak in bath water with a few drop of Tea Tree for my sore shoulder. It really works. Thank You!</li>
    <li> Seem to work well. Only time will tell. Using it as a friend had suggested. Just have to wait and see.</li>
    <li> Great product!  They test the quality before sending it off.</li>
    <li> I love how it has so many uses. Had I know I would have gotten some Tea Tree Oil a long time ago! I haven&#x27;t gotten my free ebook just yet. That&#x27;s the only reason it&#x27;s getting 4 stars. I have diluted it with coconut oil, and used it on my skin. You can also use it to clean with. Just add 1 or 2 teaspoon of oil with water in a spray bottle. It worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this product to review.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil This product was given to me to try please read my review at:[...]</li>
    <li> I have used Tea Tree Oil for years, and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very lucky to test out the Apothecary Extracts 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil. In the past I have used it in many various ways. So to put this one to the test, I used it both on my skin, hair, and in the home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin- During the summer I tend to get a heat rash in the area where my bra rests on my skin. It is just one of those things that happens. I had gotten a bit of a heat rash prior to getting this in the mail, and was having a heck of a time finding a product to clear it up. When this arrived, I gave it a shot. Using a cotton ball, I applied a tiny amount to the rash twice daily. Within 3 days my heat rash was cleared up. I have since used this on a few acne spots, and it dried my pimples up in about 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair- I color my hair regularly, and this wrecks havoc on my scalp. To combat this, I placed some of the tea tree oil on my fingertips and massaged it into my scalp. I do this at night before I go to bed. Within a week my scalp is flake free, and it just feels very fresh, clean and fantastic! A few times a week I add a drop into my shampoo, and use it all over my hair. Just makes my hair feel tingly clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home- This is great to use around the house to clean. I use this to clean my fridge, I add a few drops into the water I wash the floors with, and I use it to wash the counter tops, and table tops. Cleans and disinfects wonderfully without being a harsh dangerous chemical. It leaves a nice scent afterwards, kinda earthy, leafy, natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree Oil is fantastic to keep around the house, so many uses it is well worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> I was given a bottle of Tea Tree Oil to review and I absolutely love it. I have always been a big fan of tea tree oil from using it as a shampoo or to putting it in my dryer balls. The bottle is large and smells wonderful. You don&#x27;t need to dilute it too much but it is nice with another oil to dilute it and make it not so strong. It is a very large bottle (bigger than the usual bottles of essential oils). I absolutely am 100% thrilled with this product and give it an A+</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis, that is one of the main reasons I started using tea tree oil. In combination with my other prescribed lotions tea tree oil helps prevent a buildup of dead skin.  It even has promise as an antimicrobial.  It&#x27;s uses are well known for a variety of ailment including dandruff and acne. This bottle is big too. It is a 4 fl oz bottle which says it will last a year. I personally have purchased a 2 oz bottle for the same price and it was not even as concentrated. The best thing about this Tea Tree Oil is the Recipe Guide that it comes with.I could begin to attempt to try to convey how extensive this guide is but I would fail. It really does contain almost every recipe for tea tree oil that I have seen to date. Not only that but it is written beautifully. Just the guide alone is worth something and it is provided at no cost. One of my favorite recipes is for a tea tree shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What is great is if you have coconut oil in your house you can combine these two ingredients to make almost anything. Moisturizers, shampoo, hot oil treatments, cleansers, body wash, toothpaste among many others.  You can also use it to make household cleaners, shower sprays, disinfectants and sprays. One of the key features for me is there is no other fragrance. Tea Tree already has a strong smell, similar to camphor.  I was also glad to see this is Bottled in the USA. I was very surprised that some studies have been done on tea tree oil and MRSA. It can kill up to 99.9% of MRSA within 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of my skin condition I need natural products to use on my skin. And because this is one of the most versatile products you can buy. I recommend it for every household. Not only can you tell when you use it that it is a quality product, they prove it by testing it. A lot of companies dilute their tea tree oil, but they have it tested to be 100% true tea tree oil.  If you like tea tree oil than this is the brand to try. I did received a sample to review but all opinions are my own.inions are my own.</li>
    <li> I recently received a bottle of Australian Tea Tree Oil to review. Having heard tons of home uses for this product, I was excited to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil arrived in a well-packaged box, sealed and very secure to prevent any chance of leaking. This was appreciated after receiving faulty, leaked products from some providers of other liquid products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The e-Book that is posted with the tea tree oil was a great resource. It includes 50 great uses for the oil such as hair products, health remedies and even stress-relieving aromatherapy applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself contains 4 oz of pharmaceutical grade tea tree oil. The item declares that it is genuine, 100% pure tea tree oil. Be cautious of some brands that advertise tea tree oil and replace the majority of the contents with a synthetic derivative instead. This is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this oil is truly intoxicating. It is relaxing and gives the aroma of a relaxing, calm evening. I placed a bit of the oil in a reservoir on my patio while I had some outdoor torches lit nearby. Very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil also has a very strong antibacterial property. Many researchers believe that essential oils such as this one will play a major role in infection prevention and treatment in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMd8bc57e32b50a9e165150404379b09b2\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Most uses only require a few drops so this big bottle will last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I totally consider myself a novice and most of our oil purchases have been pre-made blends but I have started to branch into essential oils like peppermint and tea tree oil because they have so many uses! When I was given the opportunity to try a HUGE bottle of Australian Tea Tree Oil, I jumped at the chance. Tea Tree Oil (Melaleuca) is so versatile and can be used for a variety of things like hair care, first aid, and sore muscles. Now don&#x27;t get overwhelmed if you&#x27;ve never used oils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a convenient dropper lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apothecary Extracts Australian Tea Tree Oil comes with an e-book with detailed instructions for using it in a variety of treatments. Lip scrub, cradle cap, and even air freshener recipes are included. Keep in mind essential oils should always be diluted before applying to skin and thorough testing has not been done on ingesting oils. The e-book includes information on various testing that has been done with tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label contains lots of useful information about the product including a company email address for questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel certain that you will find one of the 53 uses mentioned in the book will be useful for your family. We often use a water diffuser for our oils. Tea Tree Oil is anti-fungal, anit-viral, and anit-bacterial so perfect for diffusing when there are illnesses in your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> great service, great producct</li>
    <li> Great Service , Great Product.</li>
    <li> About a week ago I managed to cut my big toe with a shovel.  While digging in the yard I set the shovel down so that I could take a rest. Rather than resting the shovel against the fence as I thought I set it down on my big toe.  I didn&#x27;t think I cut it at first.  I tried to brush off the dirt from my toe and then saw the blood.  (Digging with flip-flops was my first mistake...)  I ran to the bathroom and I remembered the Tea Tree Oil.  After cleaning with soap and water, I used the Tea Tree Oil over the cut and applied a bandage.  I was extremely worried about infection setting in.  By the next morning the cut was scabbing over and looking and feeling great.  My skin is tolerant to most topical agents and there were no negative side effects for me.&lt;br /&gt;There are many uses for Tea Tree Oil and Apothecary Extracts includes a Free Recipe Guide.  This is in e-book form which I prefer as it takes up no space and is easy to refer to as needed.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Tea Tree Oil and the high quality standards that the company has in bringing this highly sought after product to us.</li>
    <li> One of the best tea tree oils on the market!  Thanks for the prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> awesome product with ample uses --such as these 53 ways in their easy-to-use guide! love the company&#x27;s commitment to quality, comprehensive testing, and all-natural products!</li>
    <li> I am a new user of Tea Tree Oil and wanted a 100% pure product.  I am so happy I chose Apothecary Extracts.  I have used the tree tea oil so far as a cleansing agent.  I added tea tree oil and vinegar to an empty dishwasher and washing machine to clean and disinfect them.  They came out sparkling clean and did not have the sour smell I wanted to get rid of.  Today I am making the tea tree oil and almond scrub for my face &amp; skin.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
    <li> Great product, good price, fast shipping.  Strong stuff, powerful aroma, but not the sweet aromatic Eucalyptus one might expect.  I&#x27;ve not had it long, but it seems to work on itchy scalp and fungal irritation.  So far I&#x27;ve only used it mixed with Witch hazel, or undiluted on spots.</li>
    <li> Works great but can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product and a bonus recipe book!</li>
    <li> I use this in everyting and everywhere to clean. It&#x27;s really concentrated and so you do not have to use that much so it will last you for a while. Good buy</li>
    <li> I used this Tea Tree Oil on my family several times to test out the many uses.  1. Tea Tree Oil is known to prevent hair loss, treat lice, and treat and eliminate dandruff so I added 15-20 drops of tea tree oil to my full bottle of shampoo and lightly shook it to mix. I wash my hair as normal. The shampoo has an altered scent, not unpleasant. I noticed my hair doesn&#x27;t shed as much as it used to. Since my kiddos are back in school, never hurts to be preventative against community critters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2. My husband has dandruff that shows up really bad when his hair is cut short. I mixed a tablespoon(ish) of carrier oil with a couple drops of tea tree oil and rubbed it into his scalp. After 20 minutes my husband washed the mixture off with a tea tree shampoo. It worked great, dry flaky scalp was gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. My daughter got into Poison Oak and a rash spread up her arm. Since tea tree oil is an anti-inflammatory, putting a bit of pure tea tree oil on a rash will bring down the swelling and redness. Do this several times a day or whenever the itching is bad to get a bit of relief. I found out the bumps were actually an allergic reaction when I took my daughter to the doctor because the blisters spread. Tea Tree Oil DID relieve the itching but she had to take medicine to get rid of the rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my others.</li>
    <li> Extremely pleased with this purchase! I love being able to purchase oils in the larger size. Very happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try a bottle of the Apothecary Extracts 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil (melaleuca alternifolia). Did you know that there are many uses for this wonderful oil? I didn&#x27;t until I read the recipe guide that came with my bottle of the tea tree oil! I was used to putting a few drops in the laundry (I put it in with the detergent in the detergent part of the washer, I have a front loader.) I use it in the laundry for its disinfectant properties. That is one of the main things which I started using tea tree oil for many years ago! You can dilute a drop with a bit of water on a cotton swap and dap it on a pimple. I wanted to try it on my son&#x27;s back first rather than on his face, but he hasn&#x27;t let me attempt that just yet. I think that I have before, but I am going to encourage him this time that it is a natural way of treating skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can mix it in with other product listed in their recipe book, and use it in hair care products, skin care, and brushing your teeth (but DO NOT  SWALLOW!)! The skin care entails sunburn, bug bites, using it for antiseptic spray, and the list goes on. It&#x27;s included in facial masks, those I haven&#x27;t tried yet. I have painted it on my toenails for fungal prevention, with a cotton swab. I hadn&#x27;t thought of using it in shampoo yet, but am planning to one of these days. You can use it in cleaning products, too, and it is another thing on my list of things to do with it. I like this product!</li>
    <li> I recently found out that my daughter has scalp psoriasis! Her scalp is so dry and itchy and she has been digging at it so bad that she was developing sores on her scalp and her hair was no longer there in certain spots of her head. I didn&#x27;t want to put a ton of chemicals and prescription drugs on her skin and into her body....so I did some research! I found that some people use a mixture of tea tree oil and coconut oil to treat it naturally. So I thought....why not give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took about 1/2 a cup of coconut oil and combined it with about 15-20 drops of the tea tree oil extract and mixed them together. I have applied it once a day for about a week and the results are already amazing! I am so happy that I found something natural and less harmful to use on her skin and it works amazingly to treat the areas. She even says that it stops the itching all night while she sleeps! To be completely honest.....I can not stress how happy I am that I found this tea tree oil and coconut oil combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other uses for tea tree oil as well. You can add it to your shampoo bottle and shake it up to combine. This is supposed to help your hair be healthier. It is also said to help prevent lice in kids&#x27; hair! I figure what a great benefit, especially with summer coming to a close and the kids going back to school.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it says!</li>
    <li> It is a very good item, and works well.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This Tea tree oil is one of the most versatile essential oils. Naturally fight Acne, Toenail Fungus, Lice, Yeast Infections, Skin Tags, Cold Sores, Dandruff, Ringworm, Fleas, Warts, and Psoriasis are just some of the things that can be done with tis great flexible oil. I have already used it ezema for my daughter and it has kept them from glaring up on those hot weather days.&lt;br /&gt;You can also use to make your own Shampoo, Lotion, Soap, Face Cleaner, Body Wash, and Toothpaste.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product complimentary for testing purposes and my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> SKIN TAGS BE GONE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also works quite well as a bug dope without the deet!</li>
    <li> I purchased the tea tree oil in hopes of helping my son with his psoriasis.  He has struggled for years with an itchy and embarrassing flakey head. We have tried all kinds of shampoos. Used coconut oil, which he hated. So I convinced him to give this a try. After one day of use, the redness on his scalp was gone. After one week, his head started clearing up. He loves the smell of the oil. I added a little to his JASONS shampoo and it works great.</li>
    <li> Recently I received a coupon offer to try a free bottle of Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil, I also received an E-Book with 50+ uses for the oil.  After reading the book I was amazed!!!  I remember Tea Tree oil from my childhood and now I recall why my Mom sprayed it on my hair; it was to keep the lice away!  Living in the Northwest we do have a problem with lice as our temps are never high enough or low enough to kill off things such as lice and fleas, so we must combat them before they happen.  With my new bottle, I mixed a few drops of the Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil in a spray bottle of water and I am using it on my 7 year old son and all 3 of my dogs.  Now don’t get me wrong, my son doesn’t have fleas and my dogs don’t get lice, but one bottle works for all and that is convenient!  So far the fleas are gone and I don’t have to use the horrible pesticides that are on the market. I think that is what is so great about Tea Tree Oil, it has hundreds of uses and it works for humans &amp; pets alike.  I allow nothing in my house that is a hazard to my pets’ health, with the exception of chocolate of course!&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I have used Tea Tree Oil since I was a kid and I am very pleased with Apothecary Extracts for 2 major reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1. This is 100% pure Tea Tree Oil from the Melaleuca Alternifolia Tree, there are no fillers, additives, preservatives, artificial colors, artificial scents, fragrance, parabens, mineral oil, petroleum and no chemical solvents!!!  Just 100% PURE Tea Trea Oil.&lt;br /&gt;2. This bottle is huge!!!  4 Ounces of 100% pure Tea Tree Oil for a very affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree oil is known for its topical antiseptic, anti-fungal benefits and antibiotic properties which can reduce infection.  What that means is that it can help in the treatment of skin infections, burns, rashes and dandruff and other scalp problems.&lt;br /&gt;Again, I have used Tea Tree oil for years and I have to say that I am most impressed with the Apothecary Extracts brand and I am looking forward to many of the uses.  I am excited to mix a few drops in my shampoo for occasional psoriasis patches which I just learned about.  I am slowly but surely on the road to making my house chemical free.rand and I am looking forward to many of the uses.  I am excited to mix a few drops in my shampoo for occasional psoriasis patches which I just learned about.  I am slowly but surely on the road to making my house chemical free.</li>
    <li> I love keeping tea tree oil on hand at home for a variety of cleaning and personal care uses, and this product makes that easy. The bottle was even bigger than I was expecting, considering that my previous purchases have been less than an ounce! I also like that the glass is dark, which will keep the oil working for longer, but easy enough to see through to gauge how much is left.  I can imagine that this will go a long way when you&#x27;re using drops at a time-- or not, because of the convenient link to a recipe book provided upon purchase. Be warned, however, that the recipes in the book utilize things you might not have on hand, such as additional essential oils or chemicals used to make shampoos. If you&#x27;re willing to put in the time and cost to make your own cleaning/healthcare products, however, I would say this is a great investment!</li>
    <li> Great quality oil in a great size at a reasonable price!  Fast shipping too.  Also, it&#x27;s nice that this size bottle has a dropper/drip top. Am used to seeing that only on smaller sized bottles from most companies.  LOVE that I don&#x27;t have to get a separate dropper out every time I need to use it.  I use tea tree oil for many things...cleaning, air freshener blends, skin care blends, etc.  This is as good as any I&#x27;ve purchased that were more expensive.  Was excited about the ebook which I did not find access to.  Then was sent an email with a link that did not work : (.  Having said that, I would and will order this same oil again, ebook or no.</li>
    <li> I use it to clean my  face. It works well</li>
    <li> Never thought to use tea tree oil till a friend recommended it.  It has a very pleasant fragrance and I was surprised how many uses it has.  My wife and have made our own cleaning supplies before, we tried a couple of the &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34; in the book provided and really liked them.  I originally thought 4 oz wasn&#x27;t going to be enough, but a little goes a long way.  Especially when its 100% oil and not a bunch of fillers.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of this tea tree oil and was really excited to see such a large bottle! It smelled just like the brand of been using for  the last 15 or so years!&lt;br /&gt;I have always been really picky on what brands I use. this seems to work as well as the brand I have used forever would really like to have a third party testing on this brand! I think I will be asking for the results of testing from the company so that I can make a much better opinion on it!</li>
    <li> Ordered this September 24th, received September 27th!!!!!!!  Packaging is great and product safe.  I look forward to using this in my own home-brew for shampoo (sure beats the price of Paul Mitchell @ $35USD for who-knows how many ounces of tea tree oil?!?!?    I will be using the E-book recipe guide for other uses.  Thanks, Red Rover; glad I came over.</li>
    <li> Got it quickly. Book does not mention skin tag treatment</li>
    <li> This Tea Tree Oil is the best value among the other choices that are available.  I was amazed at the size of the bottle for the price.  Apothecary Extracts just gained a new customer, though I received this one for a blog review; when I run out, I will re-purchase.  I&#x27;ve used other melaleuca oils, and they are extremely expensive and in much, much smaller quantities.  This oil is pure and works wonderfully.  I have used it for a headache and for aching feet; the extra benefit to the aching feet...soft feet the next morning, too!  Great product, a must have in every household.  And, make sure you read the eBook that comes with your purchase to fully utilize the oil.</li>
    <li> My only reservation for giving 5 stars for this tea tree is others will buy it too!  I have been using tea tree for 24 years for a variety of things and it used to be so easy to purchase at local stores, but now it is always sold out.  Buying online saves me money and freedom from the frustration of always finding empty shelves.  Great product, I have tried at least ten different brands; this is now my favorite.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality tea tree oil at an affordable price. Plus a bonus guide with recipes for a variety of uses.</li>
    <li> This is the best brand I have ever used! I pretty much use this and witch hazel for everything in my life. A must have!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way:)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the number of things you can make using tea tree oil! It has so many uses, especially if you are into green cleaning and getting those harmful chemicals out of your home. This stuff is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and very useful book on the many uses.. Thank you so much for making it easy for me to find this!  Currently, I&#x27;m using it as a preventative for my preschool-aged daughter for lice.  **so far, so good!!!**</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase, this company sends you recipes for all the uses with yea tree oil. Very authentic, great product.</li>
    <li> I have been slowly adopting new and all natural ways to replace the store bought products in my house and tea tree oil is an essential oil that is needed for many recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use the free ebook to make an all natural antibacterial hand scrub to keep in the kitchen to help with messy hands.  The only problem I ran into was my own fault.  The recipe calls for medium fine sea salt and I used coarse.  It didn&#x27;t work in my pump bottle so I had to use travel bottles I had.  Other than that, it came out great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next recipe I picked out to try is laundry detergent!  This came out great as well.  My clothes are clean and have just a slight smell of the tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle will last you about a year of regular use.  So for $2.50 a month you can start living a healthy chemical free life!!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I love the fact that its pure and potent.  Such an awesome household cleaner but great for health purposes too.  And I love the smell!  Its like aromatherapy.  I use a little bit in a hot bath and it does wonders for my skin and helps relieve stress from the aromas too.  Also....great for bug bites!  I would definitely recommend this product!  Read my full review at TheBeeHiveBuzz dot com!</li>
    <li> I recieved Tea Tree Oil about 3 weeks ago. And to my suprise it has made my skin a whole lot clearer then what it has been and has been a big help with my Rosacea! If you know anything about Rosacea you know it can be pretty harsh especially when the cooler weather gets here [or atleast on my face anyways] I am looking forward to using this product come winter and here on after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Smell is quit strong but wares off with in 3-5 mins or so, it doesnt take your breath away or nothing like that thou.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 7 year old little brother who is asthmatic and it didnt even phase him if that tells you anything! and it doesnt take much. it has also been a very good cleaning solution. it smells kinda like pine sol :) which is my favorite mopping stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I rate this product 10 out 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It truly is a skin savor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> It is definitely working, but it stinks.  My face is accustom to strong peels, but this burns.  I use some coconut oil to calm down the stinging and help with the skin flaking.  I have only been using this for 3 days now, and I am still going through the routine where I get new break outs, but I should be completely clear in a few days.</li>
    <li> I have used Tea Tee Oil since my kids were tiny. In fact they grew up knowing the moment they got a cut, scrape, bite, or basically anything, that I was going to say &amp;#34;Put some Tea Tree on it.&amp;#34; They would actually complain first, then before I could even say anything say it themselves, knowing that was exactly what was about to come out of my mouth. My kids are now nineteen and twenty-one and to this day they still do it! It has become a running joke in our family that I am a Tea Tree fanatic but only in the last few years have they realized mom was right all along! Now that everything from shaving cream, to beauty products have tea tree in them the kids finally believe me! Oh sweet vindication! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love more is a giant bottle of tea tree free for my review, and yes this is a good pure 100% Tea Tree Oil, which makes reviewing it a pleasure because I always warn people when buying essential oils to be sure they are pure, and what the seller says they are! There are a lot of fakes out there, a lot of diluted product by companies scraping by to save a buck! Don&#x27;t buy into big brands just because you have heard of them all over the internet! They don&#x27;t get that big by spending big on their product necessarily or being top quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did when I got my four ounce bottle of Tea Tree Oil from Apothecary Extracts was sniff it. I know what good pure Tea Tree Oil smells like. My daughter was with me when I did this and saw the big smile come across my face. I will admit Tea Tree has a pungent aroma, but I have come to absolutely love it, in fact to me, it is very calming. When you know how good something is for you, your brain begins to process it in a whole new way. Regardless, Tea Tree Oil has an astringent, earthy, somewhat minty aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree Oil is a natural bacteria and germ fighter which makes it perfect for putting on cuts, and scrapes, as well as makes a really good mouthwash if you have cold sores, or any sort of virus. I have well over 100 essential oils in my home but if I could only have one, Tea Tree is the one I would choose! I swear by it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see my full review here:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.fashionbeyondforty.com/2014/09/tea-tree-oil-apothecary-extracts-review.htmls, or any sort of virus.

    <li> I received this product for free to review through BrandBacker. All thoughts are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems as if everything today has tons of chemicals and some of them can do more harm than good. So when I found out I could try out a Tea Tree Oil, I was very excited. I’ve wanted to try making my own skin care with different essential oils, but haven’t found a lot of recipes for the stuff that we need. I’ve taken to making some cleaners and such with non toxic everyday items so it is past time that I try to make some skin care items as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree oil has been used for a very long time. Tea Tree oil has been used a myriad of ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some uses are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin care&lt;br /&gt;First Aid&lt;br /&gt;Household cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Hair &amp; Scalp care&lt;br /&gt;Aromatherapy&lt;br /&gt;Feminine care&lt;br /&gt;Chronic Illnesses&lt;br /&gt;Dental Care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traditionally the Bundjalung Aborigines would crush up the tea tree leaves and inhale them for treatment of the common cold or symptoms such as coughing and wheezing. Crushed tea tree leaves were often rubbed directly into a wound, to disinfect and assist with the healing process.  More commonly however, the leaves were soaked and used to treat skin ailments, wounds and even sore throats. Soaked leaves were the most common, and likely the most effective, way to use the Melaleuca tree for medicinal purposes.  An interesting story about the Aborigines‘ use of the tea tree for healing is that of the healing lakes used by the Bundjalung. It is unknown if they knew it at the time, but research and the oral history indicate the &#x27;healing lakes‘ were in fact lagoons filled with tea tree leaves. These leaves had naturally fallen into the lakes from nearby trees, decayed, and essentially fortified the water with their healing properties, over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I wanted to try using the Tea Tree oil for was hair and scalp care. Some known benefits of using tea tree oil for your hair are; Prevents hair loss, treats lice, facilitates hair growth, treats &amp; eliminates dandruff, treats cradle cap and also unblocks the hair follicles that cause dandruff. The antibacterial and antiviral properties associated with tea tree oil can be used to treat scalp infections and irritations, while the all natural moisturizing properties helps keep the hair and scalp healthy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my daughter we tried the Detangling Tea Tree Oil Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detangling Tea Tree Oil Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What You Need:&lt;br /&gt;10 drops Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil&lt;br /&gt;1 tbsp. apple cider vinegar&lt;br /&gt; Clean spray bottle&lt;br /&gt;1 cup distilled water&lt;br /&gt;Mix It: Add all ingredients to the clean spray bottle and shake well to blend.&lt;br /&gt;Apply It: After shampooing your hair spritz enough detangling conditioner to coat hair and come through damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Add rose, lemon or peppermint essential oil for added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I was very satisfied with how well it worked on her hair. It was very easy to make. After using this her hair was very manageable and I can’t remember when it felt this soft to the touch. I am definitely looking forward to trying more of the 50+ recipes that are in the ebook that comes with each bottle. The best thing I found about Tea Tree Oil is that it is all natural.

    <li> I really like using the oil and the bottle is cute and vintage style. I appreciate the informative, free ebook also... My one complaint is that it comes in one 4ounce bottle, instead of 4 small separate bottles, like it is shown in the photo...</li>
    <li> I was provided a bottle to review along with an awesome book of 50+ Uses for Tea Tree Oil. The book was, well, pretty awesome for me considering the fact that I&#x27;d never actually used Tea Tree Oil before, or any essential oils for that matter. I&#x27;m kind of wary to try things on my skin, especially since mine is really sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was put a little at ease when I was told that since being founded in 2013 Apothecary Extracts strive to represent the best quality and potency available. So, I was actually pretty excited about trying out the oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say is that the company ships really quick! I can say this with certainty because even though I was provided the product for this review, I was given a code for Amazon to place my order(since it&#x27;s sold exclusively through Amazon), so I had the same ordering and delivering experience as everyone else. When it arrived, I have to say I was a little taken back, four ounces really doesn&#x27;t seem like a whole lot. The company seems proud of how big the bottle is and even goes so far as to state that it will last an entire year, which kind of confused me because, hey, have they seen the bottle? Once I started flipping through the e-book I realized that each &#x27;recipe&#x27; didn&#x27;t really take a whole lot. So, I could potentially seeing it last a pretty long time. Whether or not it&#x27;ll last a whole year of regular use? Well, maybe I&#x27;ll do a follow-up post when the bottle does empty, and see what kind of use out of it. Really though, It does seem like a pretty good deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that I have not yet seen any averse effects from using the oil in products on my skin, so that is a definite plus. There are so many things that the book claims Tea Tree Oil is good for that now that I know that it&#x27;s not bothering my skin I can&#x27;t wait to see what else I can try it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, whether you are new to essential oils or have used them in the past, you might want to check out Apothecary Extracts on their website or Amazon!acts on their website or Amazon!</li>
    <li> I found the Tea Tree Oil Soak For Sore Muscles. Follow the direction and enjoy a hot bath. It not only helped relieve back pain but also helped smooth the skin and left the house feeling stress free. So now I will fill the half the recipe and use while I take a shower to help with hurting feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me and the Tea Tree Oil are friends. I had a fever blister (ouch) on my top lip. It was so huge, I had tried using other products, I had used in the past, nothing was relieving the pain or discomfort. I put a small amount on a q-tip and then rolled it around in a small glass of water and applied it to the blister on my lip and felt immediate relief. I was able to go to bed and not hurt, go to work without trying to bother it and now it has healed. So next time I have an unfortunate and sudden fever blister pop up, I am going straight to the Tea Tree Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t suffocate you and it&#x27;s so easy to use. The Ebook has tons of great recipes.</li>
    <li> Amazing tea tree oil.....worked miraculously on blemishes for me and my daughter! Also, using it for keeping ticks away....put one part tea tree oil and two parts water in a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I got this on a very good discounted price. Its a magical product for acne and blemishes. It made my skin clear in few days of use..I am totally in love with this product. You just need a little not much and it will make acne vanish completely.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Came very nicely packaged in a box with information like Suggested use, what it is, warnings, a free book and how to get it and many other useful tips.  Bottle is beautiful, too!  Looks antique.  Very easy directions to follow if you have not used this before.  Great product quality inside, too!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it. We mix it in with the shampoo to give it extra sensation when washing our hair in the shower. She also uses it to remove minor pimples around face, and it works. She has a machine that puts these oils into the air, which she has also used this tea tree. Overall, pretty cool product. I was given a discount to review this product.</li>
    <li> I love tea tree oil.  This is a great item to help people with psoriasis, which is what I use it for and to use on your feet. If you ever get the ucky toe nails, use this to soak your feet, I have bought similar before and the smell was so strong.  This one is not to strong that you cant use, that is why I love this brand.. Great item to buy...</li>
    <li> Over the years I’ve used a few products featuring tea Tree Oil as an ingredient but I was never aware of just how useful it could actually be. This 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil comes with a recipe book to help you explore all of the different possible uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 ounce bottle is kind of huge in terms of pure oils, and can last up to a year with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I was most interested to learn is that it can be used to make safe and effective household cleaners, disinfectants and detergents. With both children and pets roaming the house, some of whom have a tendency to think that the world is best explored just through tasting everything in their paths, I’m always looking for more natural alternatives to harsh chemical cleaners that also actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already knew Tea Tree Oil was a good way to fight acne; facial care products are primarily where I’ve encountered it before. It definitely is effective at clearing up breakouts. I think it will be fun to pass this secret on to the girls and show them that they don’t need expensive acne fighting “systems” to keep their young skin clear and blemish-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a whole other list of uses for Tea Tree Oil that I had no idea about. It can be used to cure toenail fungus, lice, yeast infections, skin tags, cold sores, dandruff, ringworm, fleas, warts, psoriasis, and more.   You can use it to make your own shampoo, toothpaste, soap, lotion- on and on! I haven’t yet tried it for all of these things so I can’t vouch for its effectiveness in all areas, but I will certainly feel better having it on hand to try out if the need arises.</li>
    <li> I rarely give 5 star reviews. This product deserves it and for a few reasons. The bottle is huge and will last forever. The smell is very strong so I can only assume that it&#x27;s a pure essential oil. I used it with Castor oil to help with my occasional dandruff and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> The 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil from Apothecary Extracts has a strong, earthy/woody scent. It has a light brown color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the free guide included with the Tea Tree Oil but I noticed that I don&#x27;t have most of the ingredients on the guide book so I did my own version of the acne spot treatment and anti-dandruff treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the acne spot treatment, I put 1 drop of the tea tree oil on my palm and then dabbed my finger a little bit on the oil and then applied it directly on my BIG acne. I placed it before I went to bed and the next day, the BIG acne didn&#x27;t miraculously disappear but the redness subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my anti-dandruff treatment, I used 3 drops of the 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil and diluted it with 1 cup of water. I then massaged it all throughout my scalp and let it stay there for 5 minutes. I rinsed it off and I noticed that my scalp became less flaky than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how versatile the 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil is and I can&#x27;t wait to try it as a household cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free sample in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil has been useful with some of our family&#x27;s ways of living the healthiest life possible. My favorite use of tea tree oil is to first seek natural, homeopathic methods of taking care of the everyday bumps and bruises, the aches and pains that can be nurtured at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 100% pure Australian tea tree Oil, the familiar saying is true, good things come in threes. Tea tree oil has healing and cleansing properties of serving as an anti-fungal, anti-viral, and an anti-bacterial remedy. Together, tea tree oil can help your body eliminate fungal infections, fight off other types of infections and help to stop bacteria from growing in a natural, topical antiseptic essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apothecary Extracts produces a 100% pure Australian harvested tea tree oil derived from  Melaleuca trees indigenous to Australia. The quality of the oil is Gas Chromatography tested for purity and safety. There are no preservatives, chemical solvents, artificial colors, fragrances, parabens, petroleum or mineral oil.&lt;br /&gt;- See more at: http://www.niecyisms.com/2014/08/check-out-my-favorite-use-for.html#sthash.mYJBjGni.dpuf</li>
    <li> Excellent quality tea tree oil. Great price for 4oz bottle. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping good product.....</li>
    <li> I have been using a pretty basic all purpose cleaner lately. Half water, half vinegar and a few drops of lemon or tangerine essential oil for fresh fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had the privilege of reviewing 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil and it is an amazing addition to my cleaner. It is a natural disinfectant and it smells so fresh! When you order it on amazon you can smell it before you even open the box! It is such a strong smell that it does well to overcome the vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time when I made my all purpose cleaner I used the recipe that came with my new oil (there are a total of 53 ways to use tea tree oil in the recipe guide).  It is very similar to what I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil&lt;br /&gt;2 cups water&lt;br /&gt;6 ounces while vinegar&lt;br /&gt;20 drops of lemon essential oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I poured each ingredient into my spray bottle, gave it a good shake and went to work! My house smells so clean!!</li>
    <li> I got to try this and love that its 100% pure and a wonderful value!  I received this as a gift and was surprised at how fast it shipped and that it was packed nicely so the product wouldn&#x27;t be disturbed in shipping.  I love to use this for skin issues like acne or an itchy scalp - this size will last forever and is the only product I&#x27;ve found at this price and is pure oil with no additives! Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great value.</li>
    <li> Great product, eBook was worth the sales price alone</li>
    <li> I have to mention I got this serum I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson so my opinion is honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this I was really excited since I have read about how this oil can help fight dandruff, at first I used it directly with a cotton ball and put it all over my scalp (BAD IDEA) burnt my scalp :( maybe since my skin is really sensitive, BUT I continued reading and found the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just pour 1 drop on tea tree oil per oz of shampoo (example: If your shampoo is a bottle of 10 oz, pour 10 drops) and mix it well.&lt;br /&gt;It have a strong smell, but it is totally worth it and when you wash it over the odor goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw no immediate result, but now I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 3 weeks and it is almost gone and my dandruff problem was SEVERE, unbearable, I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. Like I couldn&#x27;t stay more than 2 days without washing my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I can stay more than 4 days :D this was really really helpful and I truly recommend it to anyone with dandruff issues. It is a slow process, but totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***The bottle is HUGE so it will last for a loooong while :)</li>
    <li> Very good and very helpful!</li>
    <li> this arrived in great packaging and so far I am loving everything I have used it for.</li>
    <li> I have used tea tree oil for years and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  The Recipe E-book is great.  I have used one of the shampoo recipes and love it. I look forward to trying some of the other recipes.</li>
    <li> The product is very effective and it was delivered in 2 days!!</li>
    <li> Received my order quickly.  Better than what I thought!  This is absolutely perfect.  I love this oil!  And the book is filled with lots of wonderful recipes!  Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better!</li>
    <li> The real deal.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> After reading the recipe booklet for the product--and the many anti-bacterial uses for this product, I was excited to use it on my family&#x27;s scrapes and such--but, since my order arrived, there have been no scrapes or scratches to treat and no skin irritations.  However, we did mix a recipe for the Tea Tree Oil Steam Inhalant as sinus woes struck again this week, and we tried the Tea Tree Oil Sore Muscle Soak.  I also gave it a try in a relaxation bath oil recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent takes some getting used to at first—it’s a little strong and is certainly distinct.  However; I think I like it as an aromatherapy aid for relaxation as well as a topical treatment.  I cannot speak to its healing properties—but, from an aromatherapy/soothing standpoint—I saw benefits from Apothecary Extracts 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend testing the product for skin sensitivity personally before using.  I didn’t have any problems—but, I used it with additional products; diluting the potency a bit.  I will also recommend adding additional scented, essential oils to mask the scent if the scent bothers you (or your housemates).  The scent was my family’s only complaint—but, after adding some lavender or eucalyptus, those complaints diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend Apothecary Extracts 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil?  The free recipe guidebook is a wonderful bonus—do download it and save it as a resource.  The product itself is well priced for the purity and the size of the container.  I do look forward to trying the product in other recipes—especially as a household cleaner.  If you would like to try a 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil, I can say that my experiences with Apothecary Extracts have been positive thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of this product for use in a blog review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> So glad I ordered the tea tree oil!&lt;br /&gt;I will be a repeat customer for sure!</li>
    <li> If you use Tea Tree Oil then this a good product for you. Highly recommend. Premium Quality. Highly recommend the seller. Sent a second bottle right away when I received the first bottle damaged.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really worked for me for my skin specially in the winter.</li>
    <li> seems to work well - it dries out the toe nail, tho.  the bottle has a nipple that, for me, is not convenient.  Otherwise it is OK.</li>
    <li> I like this product. The delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> Great product. I Love it, pleasant scent, smooth on the skin.  Have recommended it to my friends and family. There are many uses to the product as I am still reading the e-book.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently begun to see Tea Tree Oil in all sorts of skincare and even haircare products. So when I had the chance to try pure Tea Tree Oil I jumped at the chance. I was particularly interested that it could be used as an anti-dandruff agent. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had dandruff since kindergarten. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m always interested in anything that is effective against it. I&#x27;m not sure if it is more effective than other over the counter shampoos, but I&#x27;ll see how it performs over the next few months. I&#x27;ve also heard it is great as a hair color protectant. In fact my sister has been told TO use Tea Tree Oil for just this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with not only the generously large 4 once bottle, but the quality as well. A little goes a very long way as it is quite concentrated. I imagine this bottle will last me at least 6 months to a year. If you are only using this for skincare and not haircare this bottle will easily last at least a year! Since I have thick hair, I always go through haircare products faster than most other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, personally, think that the numerous possible use-ages for 100% pure Tea Tree Oil combined with the very generous sized 4 oz bottle makes this a fabulous deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are literally endless ways to use Tea Tree Oil! It can be used in your hair to protect color treated hair from fading, or to prevent &amp; treat dandruff, or to make facial masks, or even as an exfoliating agent! And if you need ideas, a FREE e-book of suggested uses plus helpful recipes is included! I highly recommend Apothecary Extracts 100% Pure Tea Tree Oil!</li>
    <li> I received a bottle to review for my blog!  I used it to make my own laundry soap, which I usually made unscented.  Well, I am hooked.  I love the smell and I love all the amazing properties of this oil.  I have decided to make this a regular post in order to share all the amazing benefits of this product.  I like how the cap lets the oil out one drop at a time so you don&#x27;t accidentally use too much.  It also comes with an extremily helpful booklet on all the ways to use it!  The bottle will last a long time and I know that I will be buying another one after that.  I never knew everything tea tree oil could do! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to tea tree oil. I&#x27;d heard of it before, but I&#x27;d never used it or even seen it in the store. What really impressed me about Apothecary Extracts tea tree oil is the ebook that shows you a bunch of different ways to use tea tree oil (including recipes). I was amazed that tea tree oil can be used for so many things like cleaning, skin care, and first aid. I&#x27;ve been mixing it with coconut oil because it makes a great hot oil treatment for my hair. I&#x27;ve also used it as a bug repellant! I&#x27;m trying some of the cleaning and aromatherapy recipes from the book next and I found some other really great ideas and recipes on Google that I want to try.     I love the bottle that it comes in. It reminds me of \\&quot;snake oil\\&quot; and \\&quot;elixer\\&quot; bottles from long ago. The label is straight to the point instead of being gimmicky. The label clearly tells you what you&#x27;re getting, popular uses, suggested uses, and warnings. Apothecary Extracts is factual about their tea tree oil. There are no taglines or slogans to try to make you buy the product it stands on its own feet.     I also really love the fact that Apothecary Extracts is pharmaceutical grade tea tree oil. It makes me feel better about using it because I know it is pure without added oils or chemicals. This bottle isn&#x27;t \\&quot;huge\\&quot; but a little goes a very long way and I&#x27;m sure this will last me for years. I would most definitely buy again. This is worth trying if you&#x27;re looking for a high quality tea tree oil or if you&#x27;re looking for chemical-free alternatives.     I was provided a coupon for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
    <li> Once I received the Apothecary Tea Tree Oil I put it to use I’m talking about the first day.  I was amazed at how much product you get it’s a 4 oz jar and Apothecary Extracts claims it will last up to a year! So back to my first time using the Tea Tree Oil, I knew that Tea Tree Oil is great for household use so I made my very own cleaner!  Since my Air Conditioner had a weird smell coming out of it, my hubby suggested we clean our AC with the Tea Tree Oil. We did, and the scent was therapeutic. I love it because it made the whole house smell fresh, and clean! It may be too strong when you first open the jar, but it’s a natural scent that you can dilute when using it for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that you can use the Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil for skin care use! I have moderate acne so I like using products that will help to better my skin. Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil does just that. Dabbing a bit on my problem areas has helped my skin big time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another way that I like to use the Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil is by pouring a couple of drops in my bath, with epsom salts. I’m usually a shower person, but I find that taking a bath is a great way to relax plus it’s great for aromatherapy when using an all natural product like Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like and continue to use Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil! The company stands by their claims, and if you are not satisfied and decide to return your Tea Tree Oil you get to keep the free e-Book that includes 50+ uses for Tea Tree Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil was sent to me for reviewing purposes. However, all the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> This is a HUGE bottle of tea tree oil!  I know it said 4 oz,but I am so used to small oil bottles it didn&#x27;t think about it until I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pretty strong. I use it for spot treatment on acne. I definitely recommend putting it on a while before you need to leave.  The smells lingers for a while.  I like the smell though!  Kind of earthy!  It has worked well for me and helped to improve the breakouts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received this for free to review)</li>
    <li> Australian Tea Tree Oil by Apothecary Extracts is 100% pure.  Tea Tree Oil is considered one of the top 10 must have essential oils by many.  Further more, it is one of the most versatile essential oils.  It naturally fights acne, yeast infections, skin tags, cold sores, dandruff, warts, etc.  Use in shampoo, lotion, soap, facial cleansers, body wash, and toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition this oil is used to make all natural household cleaners, detergents, shower sprays, bathroom disinfectants, kitchen sprays etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apothecary offers a Free 100 page guide that offers a variety of ways how to use this amazing oil. The 4 oz. bottle will easily last a year with regular use when used with carrier oils and water. Their oil has been tested for purity and potency.  There are so many remarkable recipes in this guide book, you&#x27;ll be happy you purchased the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite surprised that the Australian Tea Tree was different than what I currently grow in my yard.  I always thought they were the same.  Doesn&#x27;t really matter, just a surprise.  What was quite a surprise was the smell of this Tea Tree Oil.  It was more pungent than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on my face where I had a few breakouts.  I tried it straight without diluting.  Even though I used just the tiniest amount on a q-tip, it was still very strong smelling.  I ended up adding some coconut oil to my breakouts which helped with the smell. And best of all the breakouts went away within 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it best to dilute the oil with coconut oil with using this on my body.  When using this as a disinfectant it is best to dilute it with water.  The smell isn&#x27;t near as strong, but is actually refreshing and clean smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my sons has a big issue with warts.  He&#x27;ll be trying this out soon.  Unfortunately, he no longer lives with us as he is away for school.  My husband has skin tags, and this is helping with those. It works wonders on bug bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree Oil is anti-fungal, anti-viral, and anti-bacterial.  You cannot go wrong with this important essential oil. Even though you can use this oil in dental hygiene, never ingest this oil, it is for external use only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#teatreeoilTree Oil is anti-fungal, anti-viral, and anti-bacterial.  You cannot go wrong with this important essential oil. Even though you can use this oil in dental hygiene, never ingest this oil, it is for external use only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#teatreeoil</li>
    <li> VERY STRONG SCENT... KILLS GERMS FOR SURE!!</li>
    <li> Holistic treatments are so great to have on hand. I love taking care of the small stuff in an easy and affordable way. I&#x27;ve used tea tree oil in the past for remedy uses and it&#x27;s helped me a lot, so I was excited at the great value for this size of bottle and had a hunch that I would love it.&lt;br /&gt;It came with an ebook of 53 uses that cover nearly everything ranging from hair treatment to scrape care for skin. Tea Tree oil is usually used with other ingredients to make what you need. I used my first bit from this bottle to make an aromatherapy bath with some other oils added and I loved the stress melting away. The bottle will last a long time, as you only need small amounts at a time. This is a great item to have in your medicine cabinet to save money on a multi-functional purchase instead of lots of products that clutter the cabinets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle for free to facilitate review</li>
    <li> Very Strong, large bottle....I am finding so mnay uses for this stuff!! AWESOME!!&lt;br /&gt;One way I used it was some sunurn mixed with a body lotion and it healed very quick.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt shipping  and great customer sevice too.</li>
    <li> Excellent tea tree. Probably the best deal there is and the best tea tree to buy. Don&#x27;t bother with expensive brands</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I ordered this product with a discount code and am VERY pleased with the product.  It was packaged extremely well and there was no chance that the product would be damaged in transit. The oil was in perfect condition when it arrive and I immediately used it to make a homemade bug bite remedy. The oil smelled fantastic and it worked great!  I will definitely be buying from this seller again and I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Tea Tree oil!  The scent is very strong with Apothecary and a very small amount goes a long way.  I have a Kirby carpet cleaner and I put a few drops of it in the water exchange and it has my house smelling clean and refreshing.  As well, I am thrilled that this came in a much larger quantity then others that are sold.  Four ounces of the real deal.  This is an actual extract at 100% so do take that into consideration when using it.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this tea tree oil! It&#x27;s high quality and works well for all kinds of different applications!</li>
    <li> Great product! The only downside would be the herb like smell. Other than that, I love that this is a natural alternative to harsh acne products, and it really does work to heal blemishes. There are so many uses for tea tree oil from a lip scrub to a shampoo. I wrote a review on it here if you would like to here the rest of my thoughts: http://ahemitsemme.blogspot.com/2014/08/hot-or-hyped-tea-tree-oil.html</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried multiple tea tree oils. My great grand mother use to put it in my bath and my shampoo. I remember one time there was a big thing at school about lice well I was 5 and I ended up getting it and she used tea tree oil for it. This 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil comes with a recipe book to help you explore all of the different possible uses. The 4 ounce bottle is kind of huge in terms of pure oils, and can last up to a year with regular use. One of the things I was most interested to learn is that it can be used to make safe and effective household cleaners, disinfectants and detergents. With my child and pets roaming the house, some of whom have a tendency to think that the world is best explored just through tasting everything in their paths, I’m always looking for more natural alternatives to harsh chemical cleaners that also actually work. I already knew Tea Tree Oil was a good way to fight acne; facial care products are primarily where I&#x27;ve encountered it before. It definitely is effective at clearing up breakouts. I think it will be fun to pass this secret on to the girls and show them that they don’t need expensive acne fighting “systems” to keep their young skin clear and blemish-free. There is a whole other list of uses for Tea Tree Oil that I had no idea about. It can be used to cure toenail fungus, lice, yeast infections, skin tags, cold sores, dandruff, ringworm, fleas, warts, psoriasis, and more.   You can use it to make your own shampoo, toothpaste, soap, lotion- on and on! I haven’t yet tried it for all of these things so I can’t vouch for its effectiveness in all areas, but I will certainly feel better having it on hand. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> (review via http://vegetarianmadeeasy.wordpress.com)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a huge proponent of a natural lifestyle. It seems like every day there is a new study out showing the dangers of the synthetic chemicals in products we encounter every day, from processed foods to household cleaners. Recently I learned about Apothecary Extracts’ Tea Tree Oil. This stuff is packed with health benefits, most notably it’s ability to kill bacteria, viruses, yeast, and fungi. I was extremely excited to give it a try...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to note that Apothecary Extract bottles their oil in a tinted glass bottle. It seems like everybody is using plastic now days, and I’m trying to avoid it as much as possible. The tea tree oil itself has a distinct smell, very hard to describe if you’ve never smelled it yourself, except that it is slightly astringent, or perhaps a mixture of menthol and clove. Either way, it can be a bit strong, though thankfully you only need a few drops to get the full benefits of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product comes with a free ebook full of recipes and ideas, such as facial masks and acne treatments, dandruff-fighting and moisturizing shampoos, homemade natural soaps, deodorant, toothpaste, and household cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to get started putting this stuff to use, adding it first to my homemade laundry detergent to help fight odor-causing bacteria. I was slightly concerned that all my clothes would smell strongly of the stuff, however I was surprised to find that the smell dissipates, leaving you with nothing but clean, fresh-smelling clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the recipes called for items I typically don’t have on hand (namely Castile soap), so I made a few “cheater” recipes by using my store-bought shampoos and soaps and adding a few drops of tea tree oil and vitamin E to each. I do plan on purchasing Castile soap in the future to make the recipes as directed, making the switch from the chemical-laden store products, and will probably post my experiences and recipes online as they come. Mostly, I’m excited to try the homemade toothpaste and deodorant recipes, as these are some of the worst culprits for toxins in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution, however: PLEASE do not leave Tea Tree Oil where your pet can access it – it can be extremely toxic, even fatal, if ingested in undiluted form by your pet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used appropriately, however, this product is extremely useful for us humans, so don’t be deterred from using it yourself! Just be sure to keep it safely in the cupboard or on a shelf out of reach from your pets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree Oil is a fantastic way of killing bacteria and viruses naturally, and I can’t recommend it highly enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Promptly delivered and as aromatic as could be.  I especially appreciate the Recipe Book because it gives me new ideas about how to use the product For those with no experience, tea tree oil is a HIGHLY effective natural antibacterial substance without the use of harsh chemicals. Truly terrific&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Red Rover Naturals sent me this 4 oz. bottle of 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil for free to try and to write a review on. The big 4 oz. size of the glass bottle is great! I have a bottle of pure Argan oil that is 1 oz., and most pure oils are sold in small amounts to encourage frequent repurchasing. It came in a cardboard box inside of a bubble envelope, and though the envelope and box were wet from rain, the bottle was intact with plastic safety seal around the lid. I like the old-fashioned design of the label on the brown glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having always struggled with a dry scalp, I was familiar with tea tree oil infused shampoos, conditioners, and other hair treatments, but I had never tried it pure on its own and I was curious to how much more effective it would be. The Amazon order of this bottle came with a free eBook download of &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34;. It is 100 pages long, and contains over 50 uses for tea tree oil. I was amazed at how versatile it is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a tea tree oil user for many years now.  I&#x27;ve cured cold sores, ringworm, bacon fat burns, and more.  When I was asked if I&#x27;d like to review this particular brand of tea tree oil - I was excited to do so.  It&#x27;s hard knowing which brand to buy with so many on the market.  I used to use the Melaleuca brand - but that&#x27;s expensive.  Funny thing is - tea tree oil comes from the Melaleuca tree so - what you&#x27;re getting with the Melaleuca brand is from the same tree in this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I took the time to read the free eBook which has a lot of useful information in it.  One of the things I didn&#x27;t know about tea tree oil is that there is a test they can do on a brand&#x27;s tea tree oil product that actually will tell you if you&#x27;re getting a quality product or not.  Some companies won&#x27;t do the test because it&#x27;s expensive and/or they don&#x27;t want you to know how their brand measures up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the smell and consistency of the oil is that of what I&#x27;ve been using in the past. It comes in a dark bottle - which is imperative in storing the oil.  The size of this bottle is 4-oz, which will last you a long time.  I was able to test the product out on a cold sore right after i received the product and can tell you this works as I would expect it to.  Within a couple of days - the cold sore was dried up and when it itched and I applied the oil - the itching went away fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this brand and will be purchasing it in the future.  The guess work has been taken out of - if it&#x27;s a worthy brand to buy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this tea tree oil. It is super potent and you can tell it is super high quality. I&#x27;ve used it as an additive to my conditioner to improve the condition of my scalp, on acne, and on bugbites and I can tell you it works amazingly! I can&#x27;t wait to test it out as a household cleaner too! I love the addition of the free ebook! This is a must have purchase and I give it a million thumbs up. I would definitely purchase this product again. The packaging and size of the product are excellent too!</li>
    <li> Unless you live under a rock you&#x27;ll have noticed that essential oils are all the rage these days.  I admit I&#x27;ve been a little skeptical towards them, but had the chance to try this specific Tea Tree Oil in my home.  I was most excited to learn that it could be used as an antiseptic.  I really like the free guide that came with it for 53 uses.  I actually already made and have been using the moisturizing face wash recipe in it.  It&#x27;s helped keep my facial skin smooth and free from pimples.</li>
    <li> This is terrific stuff.  It&#x27;s quality tested and has been great for sore feet.  It smells a little different than other tea tree oils - but it works better.</li>
    <li> Great service! Thank You</li>
    <li> The best tree oil that I had</li>
    <li> Great product.  The best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> While I have only tried a few brands for Tea Tree Oil, and not all of the highly rated ones, I say with a good degree of confidence that this is high quality Tea Tree oil.  I have used NOW&#x27;s non-organic line, which I also consider totally satisfactory if diluted and applied to non-sensitive areas such as the feet or used in a diffuser or minimally as part of shampoo or bodywash.  I have also used Aura Cacia&#x27;s Tea tree oil to which this is more similar.  The smell is strong, as some have complained, but not like gasoline.  It smells how it should, like tea tree oil.  I have just received it and will amend my review if I have any issue after using it, but I don&#x27;t foresee that being the case.  It is very hard to pick which brand to buy the same product from without seeing/using it, and this has great value, I recommend it as I have found the quality to be good.  The packaging was nice too.</li>
    <li> Initially, I purchased this product for skin tags.  So far, I have seen positive feedback but I’d say, the result is not very noticeable.  However, I found out that this is a great product healing little scars.  Moreover, this product shows dramatic result when used for those little pimples occasionally pop up on my face.</li>
    <li> HELLO AROMA! (Hearts)&lt;br /&gt;I received my bottle and couldn&#x27;t wait to put it to use! I started using pure oil on my face and it feels amazing. (My skin is not very sensitive so I started straight away with pure oil, undiluted). It has a very nice, slightly cooling effect. I am also very excited about all of the uses for tea tree oil. I never knew!!! I am especially in love with this because it has none of the toxins and junk that is in a lot of products nowadays (no preservatives, no artificial coloring, no fragrances, no parabens, no mineral oil, no chemical solvents, no petroleum). Simply for this reason I was initially a fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother beat non-hodgkins lymphoma a few months ago (YAY!) and we have been searching for all natural, no crap, products and this is fantastic! Right now I am using the oil as a moisturizer/healer on my face/hands/feet when I am home in the mornings/evenings. The scent is a little strong undiluted (for wearing out and about), however, I personally LOVE how it smells, the aroma is very therapeutic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on a couple of blemishes that appeared on my face and the redness and swelling went down very quickly (within about 30 minutes!). I don&#x27;t typically have blemishes or acne so I can&#x27;t speak for its use in a more severe skin condition but I would imagine it would help immensely! There are suggested dilutions for trying it initially on your skin so I would recommend doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try making toothpaste and cream moisturizers with it! I am SOOO excited! I will post updates after I make them.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of similar product for reviewing and sharing my honest views.I usually keep essential oils in my home as I love their fragrance. This is the first time I used Tea Tree oil. I have very sensitive skin and I am concerned about product quality before trying directly on skin.I read whole literature on Tea Tree oil and came to know that this oil is popular in Australia and extracted from tea tree plant. It has anti-bacterial, anti-fungal properties which make this oil famous since ancient time.Tea Tree Oil from Apothecary Extracts comes in dark colored bottle of 4 Fl oz size. It has strong smell, it is like natural wood. Even if you apply 2 drops of oil, then you can feel its presence for hours.  I normally put 2-3 drops on Q-tip or cotton ball and then rub on my face. I have some acne on my face, I am applying this oil to treat that acne. I felt that it turns my skin dry. I can feel its cool sensation on my face for hours. I am not using this oil very religiously but yes can say that it is working.I am still having acne, but can see some improvement in my skin.I liked this product and still exploring new ways to make maximum use of this.</li>
    <li> I received my Tree Tea Oil on time and it was packaged safely for arrival.  I&#x27;m really looking forward to using this product.  I was also e-mailed a book to download that has a variety of recipes to use this product in and I can&#x27;t wait to get started and test it out.  So far I&#x27;ve used it to put on my skin because I had heard that it keeps mosquitoes away.  I&#x27;ll be testing out this and more uses and reporting back on those here soon!</li>
    <li> Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree oil is 100% pure &amp; 100% great. I received this bottle to try and test out how good or bad it was. Well! I&#x27;ve used what was called tea tree oil before and it was never as good as Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree oil. This is really the pure stuff. You can tell as soon as you open the bottle, which being a dark glass helps protect the oil &amp; prevent it degrading. The smell is strong, but clean. I tried it as a home cleaner and also reviewed the recipes that are included. Then I tried another recipe that I found of adding approximately 1 drop per 1 ml of shampoo. I was concerned about the smell remaining on my hair, but knew as soon as I rinsed it would not be a problem. In the future I may add a couple drops of a scent essential oil, like lemon or orange, and perhaps some white or cider vinegar. The shampoo performed better than it had without the Tea Tree oil. It left my hair soft, shiny and looking very healthy. I know now that I will only use 100% Tea Tree oil and this brand as it is so much better than so many others that add fillers, preservatives, or chemicals. Try it yourself!! It only takes a few drops (not full ounces) to improve cleaning, freshening, and deoderizing, so this bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have heard so much about Tea Tree Oil, its benefits and its uses. I have used tea tree oil only when it is used in shampoos to help with itchy scalp. I have itchy dry scalp so when the opportunity came around to try 100% pure tea tree oil I jumped at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of essential oils that have been diluted to be able to sell at a cheaper price but that only cheapens the quality of the product that you buy. This is only Tea Tree Oil, nothing else. It is free of preservatives, artificial colors, fragrance, parabens, mineral oil, chemical solvents and petroleum. This is the real deal. Now I have used pure oils such as argan oil, rosehip oil &amp; emu oil in the past but never tea tree so I was a little lost. The company however provides you with a free ebook on the uses (along with recipes) for the oil when you buy their 4oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a brown bottle to maintain potency and has a stopper so that only one drop at a time comes through. By the way, the scent is strong, you won&#x27;t miss it. That alone told me that it was not to be played with. I read that because it was my first time using I should dilute with another carrier oil such as olive oil. My use for it was to apply to my scalp to stop the constant itching. After reading the free ebook about the uses I made my own recipe. I used a combination of essential oils, using a 8oz empty bottle that was previously sterilized I added 2oz olive oil, 2oz coconut oil, 10 drops of argan oil and 5 drops of tea tree oil with 2 drops of lavender essential oil.  Shake it up and use this combination to apply directly to your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there are many other uses besides itchy scalp that tea tree oil is good for (as the book will go into more detail). Besides being a topical agent for your skin, it is great for hair, first aid, household cleaning agent, aromatherapy and disinfecting agent.</li>
    <li> I really love their free ebook. It has so many recipes using this oil, including recipes for cleaner, hair care, moisturizer, scrub, face wash, toner, lip balm, and so many more. This one bottle can use as many different things.</li>
    <li> I obtained an order of the Tea Tree Oil to check out for free.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my chin to help with some acne that pops up there every now and then.  It&#x27;s been working amazingly!  I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts in a long time since using it.  The smell of the oil can be overwhelming if you&#x27;re not a fan of the tea tree scent.  I actually like the earthy aroma so I was fine with it.  I&#x27;m planning to try some of the recipes in the ebook that came with the order to see what other skin benefits I can get.  The item also shipped very fast!</li>
    <li> Now, I have to admit, when I agreed to review I thought it was just a beauty product to apply to my face so, in keeping with my original thought, that’s how I used it but, the recipe book is pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the skin, it does suggest that you dilute it with another type of oil like olive or coconut. I chose olive and it really feels good and it also says not to apply it on broken skin so don’t get a facial (that leads to open pores) or for the men, don’t shave before applying and you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to try a few of the other recipes in time and I’m glad I got a bottle for review because I’ve recommended the product to others as I will do to you guys but, it’s pretty popular and sells out quickly.</li>
    <li> When using this product I specifically used it to help my scalp and hair (because it leaves your scalp tingly and super clean feeling like a scalp massage), to remove skin tags, and as a skin toner or soother.  This is basically an essential oil so the scent/ smell/ fragrance is strong, REALLY strong.  So follow the recipes other wise you&#x27;ll have that smell about you all day long.  As I have been using this product, I have to say I really love the feel of this when I use it for my hair, skin and scalp.  I see really good benefits, when using those recipes.  I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try making the deodorant, detergent, or anything toothpaste/ mouth wash wise.  I also haven&#x27;t been brave enough to make the stain remover recipe either, but I think I will give it a try because I have very active children and stains seem to follow them with all their clothes: school, church, and play.  For the few items that I&#x27;ve tried I have been pleased with the results.  However, there is only one negative thing I can say about this product is that one the bottle&#x27;s label itself it mentions that you can use this product to remove skin tags, but the &amp;#34;How to Guide&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t tell you how, or give you a recipe to make and follow.  I wish there was more information about this specific product use.  Other than that I&#x27;m happy with using this product, and the results I&#x27;m getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil is amazing with its multiple uses. To name a few, it&#x27;s great as a face Wash, as aromatherapy, for household cleaning, etc. It is nice in that it is more natural than the harmful chemicals that are in my cleaners. And it fights bacteria, fungi and viruses. It also is not only great as a cleaner but leaves a wonderful smell as well after cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purchase evens come with a free ebook that shows over 50+ uses for the tea tree oil. To list a few of it&#x27;s many uses; it fights acne, fungus, lice, yeast infections, skin tags, cold sores, dandruff, Ringworm, Fleas, Warts, Psoriasis...The list goes on... It literally seems to be for everything and for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tea tree oil is 100% pure, without any fillers or additives. I&#x27;ve used it to make my own household cleaner, and I&#x27;m not afraid to use it on my face for my acne. The number of uses seems to be endless and I love this product and would highly recommend it as it is excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to review the Apothecary Extracts 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil from BrandBacker. I absolutely love Tea Tree oil! The Apothecary Extracts 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil came in a 4 oz bottle and an eBook with over 50+ uses on how to use the Tea Tree Oil. It really is such a great book full of tips and recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not a chemist or anything of the like but I can tell that this Tea Tree oil is not diluted and it has a very strong, powerful Tea Tree smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in many of my homemade beauty and cleaning products. One of the main ways I used this Tea Tree oil was in my natural deep conditioner that I make. I love mixing it with Shea Butter and Coconut Butter and applying it to my hair. It helps control dandruff and makes my hair super soft and shiny. I also use a few drops in some coconut oil and apply it to my face at night. This helps me not to break out and I have glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are literally many uses for Tea Tree Oil.

    <li> My love affair began when one of my kiddos brought home lice. We could not get rid of the things. We tried everything...then I read about tea tree oil. I added s few drops to our shampoo and within the first 24 hours there was a huge decrease. We have since been using Tea Tree oil for so many things...as a cleaner, a room spray, adding a few drops to lotion. It is wonderful. I loved that every purchase comes with a FREE eBook 50+ Uses for Tea Tree Oil. It has opened so many ways to use tea tree oil to improve our day to day life. We have replaced harmful cleaners around the house and continue to use it in our shampoo for healthy hair. Love, love, love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample in order to facilitate a review. all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Very good product in my opinion.  I would purchase again.  I use tea tree oil for so many things but mainly I add it to a sheen spray I make for my hair.  It seems to be good quality oil so far.</li>
    <li> Disclosure:  I received a free bottle of this tea tree oil to review on my blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not a chemist, so I can’t verify if this is 100% pure or truly comes from Australia.  It does have a powerful tea tree smell, though, and doesn’t seem to be diluted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  only part of this product that I think could be improved is the bottle.  I like the amber glass, which should protect the oil from being exposed to light, but I really wish it had a eye dropper that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead it has one of those plastic inserts of the type they use on bottles for kids’ medicines that are designed to be dispensed with an oral syringe---when it&#x27;s used for medicine, you stick the tip of the syringe in the bottle, turn the whole thing upside down, and pull out the syringe stopper until you have the correct amount.  It works great for that purpose as there’s no waste and no way to spill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the tea tree oil, there&#x27;s no syringe provided.  You can turn it upside down and let it drip into another container, but you have no control over the flow (it comes out pretty fast) and you have to flip it over again to stop the flow (then it can drip down the side of the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For toenail application, I found it works well to stick a cotton swab right at the opening and then turn the bottle on its side.  The swab absorbs the oil, so no mess, but at the same time I have no idea how many drops I’m using.  This isn’t a deal breaker for me, but it could be an important consideration, depending upon how you plan to use the oil.</li>
    <li> I tested this product for Tomoson.com. I loved this tea tree oil. It didn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent unlike other tea tree oils I have smelled in the past. Once it is used with a carrier oil it is nearly undetectable. I will happily purchase other product from Apothecary in the future.</li>
    <li> works good and super service also thanks Jim</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil is one of the most versatile essential oils. It naturally fights acne, toenail and fingernail fungus, lice, yeast infections, skin tags, cold sores, dandruff, ringworm, fleas, warts, psoriasis, and MORE. Tea Tree Oil can used to make your shampoo, lotion, soap, face cleanser, body wash, and toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your home chemical free by making your own all natural cleaners. Many essential oils are diluted to cut costs, however this tea tree oil does not. This oil is 100% pure and pharmaceutical grade. You always want to make sure that your essential oils are pharmaceutical grade and that they always come in an amber glass bottle. Anything that is not in an amber glass bottle is not as natural as regular everyday light will break down the essential oil making it not pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had a cold sore due to the weather and Tea Tree Oil cleared it up super fast. It got cleared up faster then store bought products. I always use this in our shampoo for its extra cleaning benefits and to prevent any dandruff problems. My dog has bad dry skin and dandruff, so I use this in his dog shampoo and it clears it up and keeps it clear. My daughter has psoriasis and this tea tree oil has helped clear it and keep it under control better than any prescribed medication that her dermatologist has given us. This product contains no fillers, additives, bases, or carrier oils that bulk it up and make it unnatural.  For Kitchen and Bathroom cleaning and sanitizing, I use soap, water, tea tree oil, and lemon oil. It sanitizes and smells amazing. I also use Tea Tree Oil with apple cider vinegar, water, and Sweet Orange Oil to make a hair detangler for my girls. This is an amazing product, it gets a 5/5 from my family, and will always be in our house.</li>
    <li> I wanted to take a chance and see how pure this brand was. I was very pleased. I feel that this is one of the most purist forms of tea tree oil. I&#x27;ve tried Now products and all Walgreen and Walmart products and this was the best.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to love it.  But, the service was good.  Came quickly and looks to be a good value.</li>
    <li> Great product and great customer service.</li>
    <li> Tried this for a month and no results.  Smells awful</li>
    <li> OK well I know I like tea tree oil.. but I was hoping it would have a dropper but it didn&#x27;t and I never did get the booklet that was suppose to come with it. SO I wil lbe going to the local drugstore to get a dropper. The product itself is good and it does what I want it to do. But really did want a dropper (I didn&#x27;t ask for it either, so my bad!) and was curious about the other uses it had.</li>
    <li> I really loved the ebook to help me make many things. I printed probably 20 recipes but I only have made 3 so far. Read my full review here. http://www.thegirlfromasmallvillage.com/homemade-deodorant-lip-balm-recipe/</li>
    <li> Great product, but the smell is a bit overwhelming to say the least. Now, I understand this is completely a personal preference on my part, but the smell had a tree, herb like scent and it was hard to dilute it. There are countless uses and benefits for tea tree oil like treatment for cuts and burns, acne, shampoos, etc. I was glad the product came with a How To Guide with many great ideas for all the uses. I have not fully explored all the uses for this products, I have just used the recipe for the acne treatment. For someone looking for a more natural alternative to harsh acne products, this is it. I applied a little drop on a cotton swab and then applied it directly to the acne on my face. The results were amazing! You don&#x27;t need a lot, a tiny drop is all you need and with a 4 ounce bottle, it will last awhile. I am very excited to keep trying different uses for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> What: Tea Tree Oil is a natural remedy with many, many uses.  The product offered by Apothecary Extracts includes a free eBook, referencing 50+ uses.  Their product is 100% undiluted with no impurities. Its many uses include: Acne, Toenail Fungus, Lice, Yeast Infections, Skin Tags, Cold Sores, Dandruff, Ringworm, Fleas, Warts, Psoriasis, Use to make your own Shampoo, Lotion, Soap, Face Cleaner, Body Wash, and Toothpaste, all natural Household Cleaners, Detergents, Shower Sprays, Bathroom Disinfectants, and Kitchen Sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: I found the tea tree oil to have a very strong herbal smell that wasn&#x27;t entirely pleasant. If you are sensitive to smell, this may be irritating as it did sting my eyes a little after application. It is recommended that you dilute it at first, but I decided to just use it by itself. The smell was so strong after applying to a cotton pad and then applying to my face, my husband would come upstairs in the evening and note that he smelled tea tree oil. I applied to some blemishes on my face, but I did not see any remarkable improvement. Things didn&#x27;t get worse, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that this is a miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: I love how versatile this product is, offering dozens of at-home uses. This is a handy multi-purpose product to have on hand. 100% Pure Australian Tea Oil sure sounds a lot better than products with similar uses that are filled with hard-to-pronounce chemicals.</li>
    <li> When I received my bottle of tea tree oil, I was shocked at how big it was. I definitely feel like this will last at least a year if not a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing is that I love that this product comes with an e-recipe book! It gives you so many ideas and different ways to use tea tree oil. I didn&#x27;t realize that tea tree oil had so many uses, I was amazed.  I haven&#x27;t tried any of then yet, but I do plan on making my own homemade cleaner soon. I have used the tea tree oil for three things. I first used it for my acne, but just dabbing it with a q-tip onto my blemish. I noticed that it has definitely helped with my acne. The second thing I tried it on was my eczema. I had an out break on my arm that just wouldn&#x27;t give up, so I dabbed a little tea tree oil on it for a few days and it started to clear up. The last thing I tried was mixing it in with a little bit of shampoo. My scalp had been pretty itchy and dry and I feel like this has totally helped it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue would be the scent is pretty strong, but it&#x27;s not awful. I can live with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this. I also can&#x27;t wait to try out some other uses for the tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Very happy!</li>
    <li> I recently was asked to to try and review Apothecary Extracts&#x27; 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil. Now, I&#x27;ve heard a lot about essential oils over the past few years but I&#x27;ve always shied away from it because of the cost and because I am not the kinda girl to jump onto any old fad. But I&#x27;m always willing to try almost anything once, especially if it is free, so I said yes. I received my tea tree oil in the mail and then it sat on my baker&#x27;s rack, next to the mail tray, foreverrrrrr...until this past Wednesday when I got some weird bug bite on the back of my ankle that caused my entire ankle and foot to swell up like a balloon. Let me just say that it was not a pretty sight. I&#x27;ll spare you a picture. :) But then I remembered the tea tree oil and all the kookie folks online who swear by treating their ailments with something a bit more natural than most medicines. I read in the informational e-cookbook that Apothecary Extracts sent me that tea tree oil has many healing properties, especially related to skin care and first aid. It&#x27;s a natural anti-microbial agent and can help with fungal, viral, and bacterial infections along with reducing inflammation [ewwwww]. So on Thursday, I mixed a dab of coconut oil and a few drops of tea tree oil in my hand and then rubbed the mixture over the bug bite and my ankle. It immediately provided a bit of cooling, therapeutic pain relief. I applied this mixture a couple times per day on Thursday and Friday, and the swelling definitely did go down--especially on Friday. Am I completely better? No, not yet. Did I use the oil alone? No, I also took some Benadryl, iced, and elevated. So while I can&#x27;t prove that the essential oil did anything on its own, I think it did help--even if it was just psychological [and sometimes, isn&#x27;t that half of it?]. Ben even tried the tea tree oil out to help with a few bug bites of his own and he said that he loved the smell and cooling sensation. In the past few days I&#x27;ve read online about tea tree oil and also have learned that it can help prevent lice. Since Ben is working as a teacher now, I don&#x27;t want him to bring any of those buggers home so I put a few drops in our shampoo to hopefully help with that. So all in all, I&#x27;m very pleased to have tried this tea tree oil. Apothecary Extracts is a great company to work with and I&#x27;m excited to try more uses for tea tree oil--a deep conditioner recipe is calling my name! I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever become an essential oils junkie but since I am into eating well and using as many natural products as I can find and afford, the use of some essential oils in my daily life was probably going to happen at some point or another. Thanks to Apothecary Extracts for letting me try out your tea tree oil! It was a treat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a complementary bottle of 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil to try and review on my blog and on Amazon.

    <li> I wanted to try this product for acne.  I have been using it as a spot treatment when pimples start and they literally disappear overnight!  My skin is very sensitive so I diluted it a little bit with water and I have had no reactions.  After seeing all of the other benefits of this product, I had my son start using it on his eczema.  His skin is staying clear as well.  I am happy to have found this product and will continue to find other uses for it in my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for review purposes and was not compensated in any other way.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful. It smells great and I have only used it twice but seems to do a great job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying it out as a skin tag remover, but so far I&#x27;ve found it also has many other uses, like masking smells in the bathroom. The scent can be overpowering a bit when placed on skin, but very pleasant in the sense it&#x27;s a clean/natural scent.</li>
    <li> love this product, awesome</li>
    <li> I love love love this oil! It&#x27;s a life saver.. I have a itchy blister from a previous ringworm (yuck!!!) and I used a drop of this tea tree oil on it, 3 times a day and after the 3rd day, the blister finally stopped itching and was gone! I can&#x27;t wait to also use this in my DIY lotions, face mask and soaps. I have also used this in my diffuser. This is a great product that has so many benefits. You cannot go wrong with tea tree oils. Every household should have one in their medicine cabinet. Also this is a big bottle so it will last a really long time. Great product and great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Product was sent to me free of charge to test and review. All my opinion about it is my own honest one. This is a good oil and very beneficial. deserves a 5 star.</li>
    <li> My daughter has tried absolutely everything to have clear skin.  This product is the only thing that has worked!  I am a fan for life!</li>
    <li> I love this tea tree oil! I was given this for review purposes and I&#x27;m thrilled with it. I&#x27;ve mainly been using it in my shampoo and it&#x27;s helped out a ton with my itchy scalp and dandruff. Another use is cleaning my makeup brushes. I few drops in the Baby shampoo I use to clean them and they smells fresh and feel clean. Amazing stuff and I&#x27;m so happy it&#x27;s in such a large bottle for a great price too</li>
    <li> We enjoyed the scent , although it is extremely strong it just lets us know that it really is 100% Pure. My mom loves making bath salts for the holidays so I was sure to send this bottle over to her. The product is really great and I hope to see more from this company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: We were sent free products for this posting.</li>
    <li> Great quality product. Full pharmaceutical grade. I bout this to treat a skin condition and even after only two days the improvement is incredible.</li>
    <li> So glad I got this to try out! I can&#x27;t wait to try the many uses for this product! I can&#x27;t say that the smell was a pleasing one but it a strong scent. I never knew that Tea Tree Oil had so many uses! From household cleaning and disinfecting, masks, toners, facial washes, body scrubs more, this product is quite handy! It&#x27;s a 4 oz bottle that&#x27;s pretty large and it will def last a long time let alone if you use it daily. You don&#x27;t really need much of it when using it because it&#x27;s pretty potent.</li>
    <li> Thanks so apothecary extracts and tomoson I was able to test and review a bottle of Australian tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt; First of all, I just love the look of the bottle. It looks like a vintage pharmacy bottle and it looks quite nice sitting out. I&#x27;ve used various brands of tea tree oil over the years and noticed that not one bottle I had ever purchased was 100% tea tree oil. It was always a mixture of various lower grade oils such as mineral oil along with a small amount of tea tree. It also had artificial fragrances and other undesirable additives I didn&#x27;t want to be putting on my face. This bottle is 100% pure tea tree oil and it&#x27;s effectiveness is proof. If you&#x27;ve tried tea tree in the past without any results you should take a chance on this bottle! There are so many uses it&#x27;s a wonderful addition to any household. I use it on my face, hair, and hands to wonderful results. It&#x27;s moisturizing and helps with breakouts. It&#x27;s also wonderful for hair and dry scalp. It&#x27;s a perfect cuticle oil as well and keeps your nails looking healthy.  I definitely recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well, is potent.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Sooo goooooood!!! I&#x27;m  so  happy  I found it!!!! The rosacea in my face is almost vanished! !!! In a short time, just one month ago I started with the tea tree  oil, what take years of doxicycline  and metronidazole,  but always came back. Not anymore, even my skin looks smoother !!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Use it daily in the shower to freshen up the ol&#x27; scalp. Like how long the scent lasts when I do this.</li>
    <li> My wife had never tried Tea Tree Oil for anything, but when I asked her if she wanted to review it she said she would give it a shot. She is still amazed at the diversity of this product. The Apothecary Extracts 100% pure Australian Tea Tree Oil is a highly concentrated product that has too many uses to count. Our favorites include mixing it to make natural vacuum powder, bathroom cleaner, skin irritant treatment, and making a natural mouth rinse. (It is important to know this isn’t a product that should be ingested.) I am looking forward to trying more uses this summer that includes soothing sunburns and as a washing machine freshener. I like to do this in the summer as I begin to hang clothes out again. While no one wants to think of the unpleasant things like warts, ticks, ringworm, and insect bites Tea Tree Oil can be a natural remedy for those who like the essential oils approach or are trying to get back to a more nature based lifestyle. This is a great addition to any essential oil collection or is great on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.”</li>
    <li> Best NATURAL oil. I had tried some other similar tea tree oils but this one is the best. The size is very good for the price. I use it mainly for skin remedies and it works like a miracle. Lately my son started to get dandruff and all it took was one application rubbed into his scalp let it sit for about 30min. And the next day it was gone. Really love this product and the many uses you can do with it.</li>
    <li> An effective product that clear up my skin in just days. You can tell that this product is the real deal  based off the results you experience in just a matter of days. My boyfriend also used the product on his arms and saw just as great results. Whether you have mild or oily skin, this product will work wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my whole review at: http://ellewhitney.com/2014/10/08/external-health-apothecary-extracts-tea-tree-oil/</li>
    <li> Great product and price.</li>
    <li> Love it! My girlfriend already used it to make body scrub (with coconut oil, brown sugar and essential oil -&amp;#62; read here:http://estilo-tendances.com/product-review-apothecary-extracts-tea-tree-oil-make-your-own-body-scrub/) and now she is using it for a cleaning product.&lt;br /&gt;We are grateful to have this! :)</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this oil in all of our homemade cleaning products... And it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping and I have already used it and had a great result on a blemish and that is not the reason I bought it.  I have extremely dry skin so hoping with coconut oil and Tea Tree Oil, I will get some relief.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is one of my favorite essential oil.  It has so many uses.  I love the coil retro bottle it comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a free ebook that has over 50 tips and recipes.  I mix mine with coconut oil as a carriwr.  It seems a little string to use directly on skin.  I also like the smell of the coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We get a lot of bug bites at our house.  We spray some of the mixture on the ebotrs and it takes the itch and sting right out.  I love this product and have already ordered another bottle to keep at the cabin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this free during a a promotion  in order to give my free in iased opinion</li>
    <li> I had no clue you had so many options of what to use this with. I originally was only going to use this for skin tags and itchy skin. I will be going back to read the ebook that came with this for the other ways to use this. The ebook give so many ways you would not think you could use this. I am for one curious about them. I have heard really good things in the past of using something with pure tee tree oil. I am happy to say this one is. I am currently having some breaking out of acne so I might go ahead and use it with that too. It does have a powerful scent so if you are sensitive on the scents this might not be the best option for you. It is a big bottle so I am glad of all the ways I will get to use it. I am already thinking I am going need more. If you know someone with itchy scalp or breaking out I would suggest to try this. I mean what can it hurt.  As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> So pure and natural!  Great service too.</li>
    <li> Hoped for a better product.  I have been unable to find the strength, effectiveness and quality of the pure Australian Tea Oil that I have used for years.  This is not the one.</li>
    <li> very fast shipping...i use the tea tree oil to kill mold in my basement and it has worked better than expected...great quality in this product...</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is the work horse of oils.  Good for all types of foot ailments.  Good moisturizing, anti fungus  and &#x27;anti bacterial&amp;#34; use.</li>
    <li> Great product, great service.</li>
    <li> I use Tea Tree Oil for many things as it has a lot of different uses &amp; I found I love this brand the most out of all the brands I tried so far. I love the smell of Tea tree oil &amp; the many different benefits of using Tea Tree oil in all sorts of different ways. I personally love adding it to my shampoo, lotions, soaps etc. I love the Free ebook that comes with it as it has 50+ uses for Tea Tree oil &amp; I learned new ways to use the oil that I didn’t know before receiving this Tea Tree oil to review. All in all I loved this product, Apothecary Australian Tea Tree Oil is now going to be my go to Tea Tree Oil &amp; I will definitely be recommending it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve tried for acne! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Nice and light with a strong odor, my favorite Tea Tree oil so far :)  The vendor also emailed me some Tea Tree oil recipes which I found incredibly helpful.  I was really impressed.</li>
    <li> arrived in perfect shape.  I&#x27;ve used it twice already and it seems to do what it claims</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Took one and one-half years, but it killed off my nail fungus.</li>
    <li> I love using this product to treat my skin when it acts up (pimples!). While researching more into tea tree oil, I was impressed to see how versatile this product is! Please visit my beauty blog, My Pretty Obsessions for a more in depth review on this product!</li>
    <li> Very well packaged.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love, love, Apothecary Extracts Australian Tea Tree Oil. Yes, that’s right I gave it an extra love. I’ve been around many different brands of tea tree oil and I can honestly say that they are not all made equal. Tea tree oil is special, by special I mean its “oh my gawd in your face, man that stuff is super stinky”. When my package arrived I could smell the tea tree so I was a bit frightened to open it. Apothecary Extracts Australian Tea Tree Oil arrived nicely packaged in a box, very cute. When I opened the bottle I did not get that overpowering scent that is usually very familiar with tea tree if you’ve used it before. I was surprised, the scent was milder than what I was accustomed to. I thought that was nice since I cant stand to be around the scent for too long, with the exception of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted in knowing that Apothecary Extracts provided a free 100-page guide. I tried out the recipe for the all-purpose cleaner and have been using it all around my house. I use it on my kitchen counter, floor and bathrooms. I mixed in extra essential oils to disguise the vinegar scent that the recipe calls for, aside from the tea tree (I added peppermint, lemon and sweet orange essential oil). I also used it as a pre-wash conditioner. I took about a tablespoon of cold pressed virgin coconut oil, 1 teaspoon avocado oil, 3 drops of Australian Tea Tree oil, 2 drop of peppermint and viola! I applied it to my scalp and massaged for a few minutes then brushed hair through to distribute the oils to the rest of my hair. Pulled it up in a bun and dilly dallied for about a half hour and washed as I normally do. My hair was not oily after I washed it, my scalp felt great and my hair was soft and manageable. One of the many reasons I love essential oils is that they are so versatile and naturally fight so many germs and viruses; Australian Tea Tree Oil is no exception. It can help with skin conditions like acne, dandruff, and psoriasis. It also works on toenail fungus, lice, yeast infection and cold sores to name a few. You can use it on your pets to rid them of fleas too. You can of course use it to replace all of your household cleaners and detergents. It’s awesome I tell ya!</li>
    <li> This stuff fixes all your problems. Bought for my ringworm, but after that problem went away I used it on pimples. Then I used it in my beard oil. You name it and it seems to fix or improve something. Great product!</li>
    <li> So many uses, it&#x27;s incredible. Plus, the best value on the internet! Come with a free ebook with 50+ uses :).</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a brand that you can trust these days. Some companies are so serious about their brands, while others just want to make a few billions of dollars and just leave us to deal with the damages caused by their products. I recently reviewed this product on my blog, and I had nothing bad to say about it. I just could not find any, to tell you the truth. The product works as promised. I love the fact that it is 100% pure. It starts working right away. It gets rid of my pimples, black heads, blemishes, and product buildups from my hair. I love to use it on my hair, especially when I am wearing hair extensions for a long period of time. God knows what&#x27;s hiding under those tracks! It also leaves my hair feeling fresh. Keep this brand in mind next time you want pure tea tree oil that works.</li>
    <li> Great service and product.Thank you</li>
    <li> This is a quality essential oil and works very effectively. I&#x27;ve used as a topical oil for nail fungus and to soothe bug bites and love how quickly and thoroughly it works. My daughter is a bug bite scratcher and a slight application of this Tea Tree Oil did the trick. It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting and she quickly forgets to itch! Love this stuff! I did receive this product free of charge for a review, regardless, my opinion is 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one for using essential oils, though I&#x27;ve used Eucalyptus oil in the past, this was my first experience with Tea Tree Oil (that wasn&#x27;t already mixed in with something). We used this (thanks to the provided eBook) as a kitchen cleaner and aromatherapy oil to help aid with my autistic daughter&#x27;s sleeping issues. The value on this couldn&#x27;t be better, in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking to purchase Tea Tree Oil for at home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a complimentary bottle from Brand Backer to facilitate my review. This did not persuade me to write a positive review and all opinions are mine.</li>
    <li> I was told about Tea Tree Oil by a friend in Canada. Can&#x27;t beat amazon on this and other products. I just started using the Tea Tree Oil-GREAT STUFF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary D.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil.  I mixed a bit of this along with some bath salts for a soak and it felt great.  The smell of it was very soothing.  I also mixed this with a bit of water and rubbed it into my scalp to relieve the itching.  I use dandruff shampoo so I can&#x27;t say it helps with dandruff, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any ill effects from trying it.  It comes in a nice glass bottle, and says it is 100% tea tree oil.  There are so many uses for this that I haven&#x27;t even been able to explore yet.  I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free sample for review</li>
    <li> Love this product it has so many uses.. I used it as an acne treatment and it cleared my face up in a couple of days! It arrived on time, very pleased thank you!</li>
    <li> Using the tea tree oil for clearing discoloration of fingernails due to chemotherapy. The oil is helping dramaticly.</li>
    <li> i like it. shipping was prompt. thank you i am enjoying this oil.</li>
    <li> Like Everyone says.  This stuff is a mericle in a bottle!  Cured a rash I had for over a decade long.  Spent hundreds at dermatologist and still could not cure the rash.  I used this oil for 5 days mixed with a moisturizer and my rash is healed.  This stuff works.</li>
    <li> Sponsored Post/Review Powered By BrandBacker: This product has a plethora of helpful uses from beauty to household cleaning. Its got 3 Microbial properties that will even help in First Aid! We&#x27;ve used this product (that by the way comes with its own recipe book) in so many different ways, one of the well known is insect repellant, especially great for campers/Girl Scouts. This is a very high potent oil, the scent is strong so a little bit goes a long way. But because it has so many different uses it is VERY handy. See my post here where I share my 5 Favorite Uses/recipes: http://www.immutableramblings.com/2014/11/5-uses-for-tea-tree-oil.html and you&#x27;ll be amazed by the possibilities. Though this is a sponsored post, all thoughts and opinions are my own and my own experience with the product.</li>

    <li> This is beyond amazing product. It arrived before its estimated date, and was packaged very, very nicely. The bottle was dark, as it should be with this type of light-sensitive oil. Immediately upon receipt, I placed 10 drops in a bottle of ear-drops for my dog, who&#x27;s been shaking her head with ear discomfort for 5 days. I cleansed the ears, and applied 4 drops in each ear canal. I rubbed her ears well, she then gave it a good shake, as dogs do, and has been laying down by the fireplace for over 2 hours, with no more head-shaking. I&#x27;m planning on instilling 4 more drops in her ears at bedtime. I have great hopes for this oil, as visit to the vet a week ago produced just the ear drops, but no cure. So we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular seller includes a PDF file chuck full of info regarding the genus of the tea tree oil, processing, what to look for, and uses. I found it very useful and excellent &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; information source. I&#x27;ll be purchasing another bottle, as I can see its many uses depleting this one quickly. Highly recommend product and seller. Well done!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Large size and I&#x27;m seeing result already from using this awesome stuff!! Great customer service and your satisfaction is truly important to them. Awesome!!! But THIS tea tree!!!! You will be happy  :)</li>
    <li> Apothecary Extracts sent me a 40z bottle of their 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil. What impressed me right off the bat was that the bottle the oil came in was made of glass instead of a cheap plastic. A very classy move on their part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sent me an ebook with 53 uses for Tea Tree Oil. I decided to test a few out. I chose to make a Facial Toner of my own recipe, as well as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Tea Tree Oil Soak for Sore Muscles (pg52)&lt;br /&gt;  Tea Tree Oil Diffusers (pg59)&lt;br /&gt;  All Purpose Tea Tree Oil Cleanser (pg72)&lt;br /&gt;  Tea Tree Oil Dryer Sheets (pg75)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My usual facial toner (homemade) works well for me and is made to fit my skin type which is Combination leaning heavier on the oily side. It helps tighten my skin, so my pores appear smaller. It helps with the oiliness of my skin, but doesn’t do what I want it to do for my acne or the many splotches on my face. I wanted to see what would happen if I added Tea Tree Oil to my mixture. After a week of using it daily, along with my usual facial routine, I noticed my acne cleared up a little from a horrible outbreak. My skin wasn’t as red and splotchy as before. Some of my more problem areas on my face that break-out a lot haven’t been breaking-out as much. I still get a few break-outs in those areas, just not as badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been having some serious cramps lately and decided while I took my normal shower to spare a minute, or five, to have a little soak to ease my cramping muscles. I took this opportunity to try the Tea Tree Oil Soak for Sore Muscles recipe I found on page 52 of the eBook they sent me. The Tea Tree Oil added a nice aroma to the bath and the Epsom Salts did their magic as usual. I’m not sure if the Tea Tree Oil had anything to do with my cramps easing up (tremendously!) or if it added a nice aroma to the soak. Either way, I think it was a nice addition to the soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried the Tea Tree Oil Soak for Sore Muscles and enjoyed the aroma of the Tea Tree Oil, I was happy to try the next “Test.” I tried the Tea Tree Oil Diffuser found on page 59. It lends a nice smell to a room and helps eliminate the smell of our two dogs. I think my favorite use, so far, is the Facial Toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptic about using Tea Tree Oil as a cleaner. I thought that was pushing it. I was pleasantly surprised. First, I noticed I wasn’t gagging on chemical fumes, but enjoying the natural smell of Tea Tree Oil. Second, it didn’t leave a nasty sheen on my counters. Also a plus. I felt I could let Captain Little Dude in the bathroom after I was done cleaning without worry of his exposure to chemicals. I am starting to become a serious fan of Tea Tree Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the Tea Tree Oil adds a lovely scent to my clothes, but I am quickly becoming a fan of the scent of Tea Tree Oil. It doesn’t add a heavy, perfume scent to my clothes (which I LOVE!). These are easy to make and the scraps you use are reusable. Which means no more chemical sheets from the dollar store for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my bottle will be used for my Facial Toner since products that do what it does for my face cost LOADS more than $24 per bottle. Specially when that bottle will probably last me a year or more. At my estimates, probably over a year. I also prefer having natural products on my face. My skin is very pale and VERY sensitive. I have to be very careful what I put on it and I prefer not to try my hand at chemical creams and gels and the like.Oil, I was happy to try the next “Test.” I tried the Tea Tree Oil Diffuser found on page 59.

    <li> Very nice...Big bottle. Great product at a great price...</li>
    <li> Is as advertised. Very good product. Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for years. Any scratch, scrape, signs of pimples and most recently soaking in the tub. This product should be in every home.</li>
    <li> This oil came quickly after ordering and in a excellent package.  With this purchase you get a free e-book on how to use, and the many and versatile uses of Tea Tree Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first use is for your body.  Whether it is applied directly to the skin, or added to a soak or bath.  It can also be applied to fungal infected areas topically and has anti-fungal properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly you can use this as a all natural cleaner.  It is effective in disinfecting, and can be added to your ordinary everyday cleaners you already use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is incredible, and this product is great and versatile.</li>
    <li> Supe pure. Great quality</li>
    <li> This is is really premium quality tea tree oil that is extremely useful.</li>
    <li> Ship fast and safely pkg&#x27;d. exactly what I expected. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this tea tree oil!  I am using it to kill nail fungus and after only 2 days I am seeing the improvement I was hoping for.  I will definitely be keeping this awesome oil in my medicine cabinet for all of the wonderful treatments it can be used for.  Cool bottle too!!</li>
    <li> The quality of Apothecary Extracts&#x27; tea tree oil is excellent and I can grantee you won&#x27;t find anything better than this. The old-fashioned bottle is very easy to use and it smells heaven. I also received a free recipe guide. It&#x27;s good to know how to make use of tea tree oil in many ways but I feel a bit overwhelmed about following the recipes. It required me to purchase other ingredients. I prefer simplicity so I use it in my own ways instead of following recipes. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. The free recipe guide is incredible but this well-made, quality oil alone is naturally active and effective so you can use it whatever ways that best suit your needs. I put a few drops in my shampoo and I notice my hair is much healthier; no split end, no dandruff, reduce hair loss. I add 8 drops and 3 spoonful of Epsom salt to relax muscles and detoxify. If I can&#x27;t sleep I put a drop to a small cloth and leave it at a corner in my bedroom. The soothing and healing aroma puts me to sleep right away. I pour a drop into my fungi toe nail and it&#x27;s now starting to heal. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I love this product and plan to re-order when necessary.  I generally opt for more natural based products and this has so many wonderful uses.  I have used it for skin care related issues for myself as well as utilized it to help heal a small scrape on my daughters cheek she received from a small fall.  (I mixed it with coconut oil) I am very excited to try out the other uses in the online guide that is offered.  Plan to try out the natural cleaner very soon! I am overall very satisfied with the quality and customer service as well.</li>
    <li> Love the tea tree oil but did not receive the recipe book.&lt;br /&gt;HELP!  Please send. I can only rate it 3 stars but will change to 5 when I get my book.</li>
    <li> Excellent high quality oil!</li>
    <li> Nice. Thank you for the big size</li>
    <li> Great product ,Used in hair shampoo, Used for toe nails,  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> love this sooo much! i am also very happy, that i was able to receive it for FREE!!  THANK YOU..USING IT IN MY DIFFUSER RIGHT NOW!!!</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with this tea tree oil.  I wasnt expecting this big of a bottle.  We use tea tree oil for a lot.  Thank you again for offering this free.</li>
    <li> Well packaged for transport with valuable information on the box for consumers.  Really appreciated the online booklet with ideas and recipes to make useful products at home with the tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> I especially appreciate the guide to uses for this oil.</li>
    <li> Price was great - free shipping; a real plus - product excellent - delivery exceptionally fast. &#x27;will ordeer from them again.</li>
    <li> I received this bottle as a gift for my blog &amp;#34;The Other Kiki&amp;#34; from BrandBacker.com ... I have been using the deodorant for about a week now, and I love it. The Melaleuca oil really does eliminate the smell, even after physical activity there was no body odor. Great product and great size!</li>
    <li> Fast service and I LOVE the oil!</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil is amazing! I have been using it for months, and even reviewed it on my blog... Self Soul Space.  I found it helps my kids allergy symptoms by putting it in a humidifier, I used as a carpet freshener, an all purpose cleaner, bathroom and toilet cleaner... It also cleared up my sun rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product... Especially if you want your house to smell fresh &amp; clean!!</li>
    <li> Very potent oil I feel very confident using this. I&#x27;m using it for my acne and it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve used that is actually helping my skin clear up and hydrates it too! Now this product will always be part of my skin care regime. (^_^)</li>
    <li> Over the last 5 or so years, I&#x27;ve replaced many of the medicines, foods and products our family used with more natural ones.  I don&#x27;t like the way unpronounceable, cancer-causing chemicals are in everything we buy, especially when natural products are often healthier and work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered tea tree oil when learning about essential oils.  I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s a cure-all oil for every illness, but I&#x27;ve been convinced by using it that it&#x27;s a powerful anti-fungal and anti-bacterial.  I use it on injuries, athlete&#x27;s foot, acne, insect bites, cold sores and even poison ivy.  I put a few drops in a pot of boiling water and inhale the steam when one of us has a chest cold.  We don&#x27;t take it internally, and I haven&#x27;t really explored adding it to cleaning products.  But it&#x27;s an item I keep in our medicine chest and one I reach for often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Apothecary Extracts 100% Tea Tree oil is probably the best brand I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s pure and undiluted, pharmaceutical grade, and very strong.  That allows the user to use it straight, or cut it with another oil as needed.  If I use it on a child, I usually mix it with olive oil so it doesn&#x27;t burn their skin.  And for acne, I mix it with rubbing alcohol.  I could tell by the scent as soon as I opened the bottle that it&#x27;s pure and strong, and it comes in a dark glass bottle to protect the potency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a large 4 ounce bottle sold at a good price and with a money-back guarantee.  The vendor also sends along an email with information on using tea tree oil.  I&#x27;ll be looking for this brand again, when my bottle is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product, for review purposes.  I wasn&#x27;t asked or expected to leave a positive review, and I&#x27;m pleased to give five stars to this strong, pure, useful oil.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and began using it right away, I found it to be very useful in many ways after reading the downloadable booklet. Very surprised! I look forward to continue use of the tea tree oil! The scent is quite strong but subsides after a short period of time. My item was delivered way before the time estimated to delivery. Great service!</li>
    <li> Too early to tell if it works but customer service from the company is exemplary . It&#x27;s a unique smell and keeps the mosquitoes at bay. I can&#x27;t comment on its other uses as its too soon to tell. I&#x27;d buy it again because of great service and genuine concerns that the customer is happy with their product.</li>
    <li> I love tea tree oil. It has so many uses. I&#x27;ve only used it for my face and to apply in some homemade products that I whip up, but I&#x27;m looking forward to using it around the house.</li>
    <li> i love the smell i ordered for aromatherapy for my girl colds it has so many uses that i dint know i love the recepie ebook</li>
    <li> This arrived almost a week before they promised it. it was well packaged and sealed. It is very concentrated so will go a long way in making shampoo and such. I think I will be very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> 100% pure Australian tea tree oil. On the box it says warning: 100% pure Australian – harvested Teatree oil inside. It&#x27;s many natural healing and cleansing properties are coupled with a very distinct aroma. Do not be alarmed. This is mother nature&#x27;s way of telling the germs they are not welcomed here. Pharmaceutical grade!  The smell is very powerful!  Quite overwhelming at times.  You can use with a carrier agent with a 4:1 ratio!  That will dilute it so the smell is then tolerable!  I like to use coconut oil as a carrier agent!  Then the smell is quit nice.  Comes with a great e-book of 53 uses tea tree oil!  I add a small amount to my shampoo and it helps with dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*received for testing and review!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I have terrible acne on my chin, and this always clears it up quickly. I recently started using it on my face because it stays oily, and it has dramatically reduced it. The last thing I used it for was a yeast infection I got under my arm after taking strong antibiotics post surgery. Within a day, it was gone. I know there are tons of other uses, and I&#x27;m excited to figure out more ways to use it!</li>
    <li> Very reasonable price comparing to the capacity.Tea oil is very good.</li>
    <li> Not too long ago I discovered the benefits of using essential oils. Once I started, I realized that there is no better option for my family than to use natural products as much as possible. The Australian Tea Tree Oil is unique because it&#x27;s not diluted. It is 100% pure and that gives you more product for more options. They can prove it with their tests papers. I like that the bottle is pretty big and I can use it in the different recipes without feeling that I am running low. I used  the tea tree oil for mosquito bites, minor irritations of the skin, to calm the soreness of a hang nail, to make deodorant, and I had very good results. Having tea tree oil in your home is very beneficial. I recommend the Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil to everybody.</li>
    <li> When I got the chance to try out this tea tree oil I was so excited.  So many different uses in just one bottle.  I used it first on my sun burnt pealing skin.  I don’t really burn that much but a few spots here and there will burn like crazy.  This worked wonders after using for a few days my skin was feeling better and no more pealing.  I also started using it on my big toe.  I broke my toe years ago and the nail has never been the same.  It always looks yellow and just does not grow.  After using this tea tree oil for a few days my nail has been getting a whole lot better.  I love all the different uses and I am so going to keep on using this for new things all the time.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to review this tea tree oil. Prior to reviewing this I haven&#x27;t had much experience with tea tree oil. I have always heard great things about it but never tried it myself. I personally love it now and am glad I finally got to try it! It works in so many ways around the house, more than I ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I was most excited to use this for first was on my skin. I have very sensitive skin and  usually new products irritate my skin but this is working great. Lately, I&#x27;ve been having so many stress breakouts, and nothing was helping control it. Most acne products I&#x27;ve tried just irritated it more. Since tea tree oil is a promised antimicrobial it has made my skin so much clearer. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results I&#x27;ve been seeing and will continue to use it in place of some of the other products I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another awesome thing I love about this brand is that it comes with a very informative recipe book. It shows you all the ways tea tree oil can be used, and has great tips. Since i&#x27;m new to tea tree oil, this defiantly came in handy for me. The size of the bottle is great for the price that you pay, it last up to a year so your definitely getting your moneys worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many things you can do with tea tree oil. These 10 are my favorite, although I&#x27;m excited to try them all.&lt;br /&gt;1. Treat acne and other skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;2. As an all natural cleaner to use around your home.&lt;br /&gt;3. A few drops in your pets&#x27; crates or beds keep the fleas away.&lt;br /&gt;4. Relieves asthma or other breathing conditions when a few drops are added to a humidifier.&lt;br /&gt;5. Works great as an antiseptic to cuts.&lt;br /&gt;6. Helps people with allergies if you use topically by massaging into the chest, abdomen or the reflex points of the feet.&lt;br /&gt;7.It repels lice, with school starting it will eventually being going around so apply some to your childrens hair before school.&lt;br /&gt;8.Ingrown hairs that appear after shaving. Ehhh.. with it being summer that can be really embarrassing. Add 1 - 2 drops of oil directly to area. Repeat every 2 hours or until signs of infection disappear.&lt;br /&gt;9.Helps heal and soothe sunburns&lt;br /&gt;10.You can also add it to your vaporizer/humidifier to rid sinus infections!hhh.. with it being summer that can be really embarrassing.

    <li> Australian Tea Tree Oil is another one of those oils that every household should have. It has a variety of all natural uses. Most oils are only good for so many things but Tea Tree Oil is one of the most versatile oils! Apothecary Extracts Australian Tea Tree Oil is 100% pure and undiluted. They even have the Gas Chromatography Reports to prove their purity. It contains no preservatives, fragrance, or even artificial color.&lt;br /&gt;But what makes 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil so fantastic is what you can do with it.

It even includes step by step recipes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve thumbed through the guide and picked a few simple recipes that are PERFECT for my own home.&lt;br /&gt;Making an All Purpose Cleaner is one that I will be using every day. I am always concerned about the harsh chemicals that store bought cleaners put all over my home. But by using the Tea Tree Oil I know that what my children are touching is safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great recipe would be Topical Ointment. Just a few items that I already have mixed together with the Tea Tree Oil and I can treat skin problems like acne and toenail fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soak for Sore Muscles recipe is another that struck my eye. I chase after 3 young kids every day so it easy for me to say that by the end of the day my body hurts and I could use a nice relaxing bath. This recipe sounds perfect for me. It even claims to help treat not only sore muscles but vaginal infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for beauty recipes, the Replenishing Hair Mask is a MUST. A quick trip to the grocery store and I was able to make myself a hair mask that gave me body and shine! I felt like it took 5 years of damage off my hair.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s almost nothing that Tea Tree Oil can&#x27;t do. This oil is gonna stay in my secret box of tricks for many years to come.

    <li> Tea tree oil has a very pungent fragrance. It can be a bit overwhelming for a first time user. I enjoy the fragrance. The bottle states it can be cut by different oils, for example olive oil, to test for skin sensitivity. It has many uses that I am just finding out about. I tried it on my dry cracked heals and it quickly helped repair the damage. I also applied it to my toe nails that I believe had some mild nail fungus and it cleared that up very rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut the Australian Tea Tree Oil with olive oil before I applied it to lessen the fragrance. It was messy. I tried the tea tree oil on my skin without cutting it and it worked well. I think to improve this item having a dropper or a better top to apply the oil would be great. I did not receive a 100 page book with my order but I am satisfied with the product. As I learn more uses for this natural product the more intrigued I am with this brand of Tea Tree oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Tea Tree Oil for aromatherapy. I mixed it with water and some spearmint extract to make a nice calming mood enhancer. The oil is very potent, so only 1tsp is all I needed to mix in.    I have a recipe guide that has options for a lot of other uses, but this is great for aromatherapy.    I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It has so many amazing uses. Everything from beauty, house cleaning and first aid! I also received a free recipe book with over 50 ways to use. I have already had the chance to use it too! My step-son burnt his hand so I used the Tea Tree Oil on it and we both were impressed! He said it felt better and healed quickly! I would so recommend this product because the best part about it is that it&#x27;s Natural 100%!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful value of quality tea tree oil. And the ebook is an added n bonus</li>
    <li> Tea Tree oil has been around for years and I have used it for many different things but most recently I had the opportunity to try the Apothecary Extracts brand and I was very pleased with the quality and once again overwhelmed at the uses which were explained in the FREE eBook 50+ Uses for Tea Tree Oil that I received.  I am currently using it for acne and ingrown hairs due to the natural antioxidants found in the tea tree oil.  A few things that sets this brand apart from so many other include:&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I have used Tea Tree Oil since I was a kid and I am very pleased with Apothecary Extracts for 2 major reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This is 100% pure Tea Tree Oil from the Melaleuca Alternifolia Tree, there are no fillers, additives, preservatives, artificial colors, artificial scents, fragrance, parabens, mineral oil, petroleum and no chemical solvents!!! Just 100% PURE Tea Trea Oil.&lt;br /&gt;2. This bottle is huge!!! 4 Ounces of 100% pure Tea Tree Oil for a very affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Apothecary Extracts brand and just to let you know I did receive this product for free, to review and share my opinions on.  I did not receive any monetary compensation, just this huge bottle of 100% pure Australian Tea Tree Oil.</li>
    <li> Very good product, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> love this brand best I have ever bought!!</li>
    <li> I had just run out of my little bottle of Tea Tree oil when Apothecary Extracts reached out to me about sending a sample of their&#x27;s for review. Perfectly timed I knew it was going to be a quality oil as soon as I unscrewed the cap. The scent is extremely pungent. So much so that if I used a mere drop people down the hall would immediately pipe up and ask, &amp;#34;are you using Tea Tree oil?&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s that typical, telltale Australian Tea Tree oil scent but a tad sweeter and tenaciously potent.  I&#x27;ve used it a lot these past few months and I&#x27;ve managed to go through about half the bottle. It&#x27;s great in so many things, from a few drops in shampoo to a foot rub in a bit of olive oil. It&#x27;s also one of the few pure essential oils that you can use neat (i.e. without mixing into another carrier oil such as sweet almond) and this one by Apothecary Extracts has been particularly gentle, never stinging nor irritating my sensitive skin. Next to lemon and lavender, Tea Tree is an essential oil staple I always have on hand and this is a really great one.</li>
    <li> Best Tree Tea oil I have used</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Packaging is adorable, and the tree oils work wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> Good quality of oil. Smells like the tea tree smell when i think of tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Love love!!  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I seriously love the packaging, it has a vintage feel.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is smells amazing. I tried some on my skin and it was quickly absorbed and left my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;I did not know tea tree oil had so many uses from all the suggestive uses provided in their free PDF, I will try using it more around the house.</li>
    <li> I used it everyday for my facial hair and it works wonders!!!</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly, excellent quality.  Good value and the e-book is full of great ideas.</li>
    <li> Love this tea tree oil! The bottle is HUGE and was delivered super fast.  Also love that I got a free recipe book. Can&#x27;t wait to try some new things!</li>
    <li> For years, I&#x27;ve heard wonderful things about tea tree oil. However, until recently, I&#x27;d never tried it for myself. As with all products sent to me for review, I check them out with an open mind. I&#x27;m picky about what I review, so it&#x27;s rare when I actually don&#x27;t like something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll tell you right now, I really like the Australian-harvested tea tree oil I received from Apothecary Extracts. Seriously. I also enjoyed the downloadable &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; book, 54 Uses for Tea Tree Oil, that accompanied the oil and was amazed at the number of things tea tree oil can be used for. I must admit, it reminded me a bit of vinegar in its multiple uses, but it certainly smells better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be used to make household cleaners, detergents, and bathroom/kitchen disinfectants. And it&#x27;s the perfect choice for homemade personal care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I haven&#x27;t yet tried the shampoo, I did use the 100% pure Australian tea tree oil I received from Apothecary Extracts to rinse my hair and I can&#x27;t tell you how much I loved the result! I added couple of drops to a pitcher of warm water and poured it over my freshly washed hair. Once dry, my hair was shiny, tangle-free and amazingly soft. I just might use tea tree oil more often than I use apple cider vinegar as a rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a daughter with long hair, you probably have wanted to take a razor to it at one point or another. It seems tangled hair is inevitable with little girls. Tea tree oil to the rescue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my husband&#x27;s recent bout with gout, in addition to drinking tart cherry juice, he started using the topical tea tree oil treatment and massaging his foot and elbow (yeah, he had a double bout with it) twice a day. It provided significant relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can always Google more uses for tea tree oil, but if you want the 54 Uses for Tea Tree Oil book, you just need to purchase the Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil. Then you get the benefit of both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this seemslike a glowing review, there are some downsides I want to point out. I added 5 drops of tea tree oil to a warm bath on 2 different nights. Both times I had to get out of the tub because my thighs started burning. It wasn&#x27;t bad enough that I had to follow up with a shower, but it was too uncomfortable to stay in the tub. Obviously, I have some kind of sensitivity to the tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other downside isn&#x27;t about the oil itself; it&#x27;s about the booklet that accompanies the oil. While I loved the wide array of recipes, I was a little bummed out that most of them call for additional essential oils, most of which I do not have on hand. That means I couldn&#x27;t take advantage of the recipes without spending more money. That was disappointing. Also, the .pdf file includes lots of color photos, most of which are irrelevant and are simply used as fillers. Because of the photos, it is totally impractical to print the guide and I am one who likes printed copies of things. I simply don&#x27;t like storing things on my computer. If I want to check a recipe, I don&#x27;t want to turn on my desktop to find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s not all good, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
    <li> This product is great and it&#x27;s green! No artificial colors, parabens, chemicals, or preservatives!  Since it is made from 100% Pure oil, and they will send you their testing just in case you have any questions, it really makes it safe and green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be used to clean your floors, clean your face and smooth your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really a nice product and I think it goes a long way.  You think that 4 oz is nothing until you find that you don&#x27;t need to use that much of the oil.  A few drops here and there go a long way to create green and chemical free cleansers and cleaners.  And for the price it really can&#x27;t be beat!  Do yourself a favor and go and get this!</li>
    <li> I love the ability to transform what I believe a product is for and find other ways to use it. One of those ways is on Pinterest right? So I am searching on Pinterest for ideas on how to use Apothecary Extracts 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil. So I sat along side my Free eBook I was given as part of the Apothecary Extracts 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil purchase and my Pinterest. I thought how fun. Let me see all the ways I can use this product and take my review one step further. Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I think I was taken a back as to all the amazing ways to use this truly versatile essential natural oil. For example a astringent for acne, dandruff, and even as a bathroom cleaner. Yes. I too had that reaction. We are talking toe fungus, lice, skin tags, warts, dandruff, yeast infection. I personally tried it on my acne and the next day the blemish was no longer red, inflamed or large. It was healed and not as menacing. I also tried it on my hair. My hair felt so clean, refreshed and free to product build up. It was simply healthy looking and clean. I even used it for my shower to disinfect it. Yes, I went from a beauty regiment to cleaning with the same product. Amazing right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember its back to school time also. Just a couple drops in your shampoo can help the kids go back to school with no worry of head lice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on. There are truly so many ways to use this product and I believe I only touched the surface. Through my experience with the ones I was able to try I recommend this product highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more harmful cleansers, no more skin ailments. Truly amazing undiluted, pure, natural, and truly versatile product. You will get so many uses out of it and not to mention the FREE 100 page eBook that comes with purchase will give you a amazing start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase with confidence.</li>
    <li> I received a large bottle of Apothecary Extracts Australian Tea Tree Oil. I must tell you I was really excited about getting it. I read several reviews and heard a lot of people talking about it. Some of you may know i had a baby in April and another child. So i have been looking into more natural things to use. I have never hard of this product before. However it seems to have been around for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has so many different uses. This product came with  a PDF with recipes on how to make your own shampoo, lotion, soap, facial cleanser, toothpaste and even body wash. I thought was a great plus!. I tried the Replenishing Hair Mask. My hair turned out to be clean refreshed and repaired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now i do have to say at first i wasn&#x27;t too sure because i could smell it through the box. It does have a strong nature smell. Kinda made me feel like i was in a Forrest. After a couple minutes i didn&#x27;t really smell it any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle will last a long time and you don&#x27;t need to use too much. I have to admit im kinda hooked and will be using this in my home. If you would like to purchase this too check it out</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review for my blog and I love it! I had no idea that tea tree oil was so versatile! So far I have used it as a facial toner and as a decongestant. I plan on using the recipe for the cleaner that comes in the e-book soon after I buy some castile soap. I love the recipe book too because it&#x27;s easy to read and follow. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product has so many wonderful everyday uses. We used Tea Tree oil for bug bites. An let me tell you it stopped the itching on contact. Also I  put a drop in our shampoo to help with dandruff and also I have small kids that goes to school I want to prevent them from getting lice. You know how that is... We even put it on our boo boos. That&#x27;s about as far as I tested this product. I must warn you Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil is an awesome product but it smells awful. I can&#x27;t describe the smell seems like I smelled it before somewhere. I just can&#x27;t put my finger on where at or what it was...Grrr don&#x27;t you just hate when that happens...</li>
    <li> i love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I add it to my tooth paste and shampoo for a deeper cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;I made a wonderful lavender srcub for my body with tea tree oil&lt;br /&gt;this is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Ugh, the smell is so strong it stunk my house to high heaven. One thing, you won&#x27;t question its purity. I had intended many uses for it but the odor, even after putting the bottle in a ziplock and storing in a cabinet, was so putrid about two hours after unpacking it that my family insisted I get it out of the house. Better packaging design is needed if the company will sell such large qty of pure tea tree oil to keep the scent bottled up. No one wants to smell like this all the time. Just imagine if it had permeated our clothing and furniture. Sadly, I never got to find out how it works after researching its many uses, for that reason.</li>
    <li> This review was FIRST published on: http://sassygalbeauty.blogspot.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree Oil is nothing new.  It&#x27;s been around for practically forever.  It&#x27;s long been used in medicinal and antiseptic purposes for years.  Some of the things that Tree Oil is known to help:  Acne, to treat cuts and burns, psoriasis, eczema, LICE, staph infections, dandruff and even bad breath.  It also can be used to make household cleaning products that are safe for you and your family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still need to purchase some of the items needed to make some of the treatments that Tree Oil can assist in, but I have been able to use it in my baths as a way to combat dandruff and to help fight against any lurking bacteria.  I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference already in just the short time I&#x27;ve been using it with my HUGE dandruff problem.  I&#x27;ve noticed that it really does seem to be helping the dandruff to break away from my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the things that I haven&#x27;t yet tried, but definitely am going to be trying:  Making household products with Tree Oil, a shampoo, a hand scrub, and an acne spot remover.  I need to compile a list of the ingredients that I need to make some of these recipes!  I may end up doing a follow up post when I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to gather some of these ingredients and update you on my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I&#x27;ve been most excited about is having my son try this out to help him with his acne as well as making my daughter use it weekly to help prevent a LICE infestation.  Moms of little girls know how nerve wracking it can be to fight those pesky critters.  So, prevention is definitely the best and I&#x27;ve heard marvelous things about Australian Tea Tree Oil &amp; Lice Prevention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After learning about all of the harmful little critters floating around us at any given time, I definitely am going to be keeping a ready made supply of Australian Tea Tree Oil at my house.  It will become a staple piece for my household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor of the tea tree oil, can be a tad bit overwhelming, but I&#x27;ve found it doesn&#x27;t take long for the smell to fade.  I&#x27;ve started using it daily I add a little to my bath time to help ward away bacteria.  I also have been using it as the first thing that goes on my face before even cleansing.  Since I&#x27;ve been using it daily with the Rosehip oil, I&#x27;m sure the two products working together is one of the reason I&#x27;ve seen such great improvements with some of my scarring.  I hope that my continued use of this will only help to strengthen these results! I am so happy that I discovered this product.  I had read about it awhile back and had been dying to try it, so when the opportunity presented itself to review it, I JUMPED at the chance!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, I haven&#x27;t gotten to fully explore the wonders of Tea Tree Oil, I am definitely impressed by what I&#x27;ve seen so far.  I think that this is a product I can continue learning about and over time will be able to discover the full potential of it&#x27;s many, many uses.  I truly am excited about this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that natural products are going to only increase in popularity over time, they already are beginning to see a major rise in the beauty world.  I feel so behind, but am starting to seriously educate myself to the uses of natural products.  I look forward to eventually ridding my home and my makeup case of all harmful substances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***  I was provided a bottle for testing and review purposes.

    <li> Amazing!!! Very fast delivery!! Quality product!! Definitely ordering from you again.</li>
    <li> I love the recipe for the hair care as my hair is always dry and breaks very easy. I tried most of them and after using them for a few weeks there is a huge noticeable difference in my hair. My second use of the Tea Tree Oil was as a bug repellent and mosquito bite cure! I simply mixed a teaspoon of Tea Tree Oil and a quarter cup of coconut oil and I had a homemade bug repellent that smelled good and worked pretty well. I also put straight Tea Tree Oil (less then a drop) directly on my mosquito bite and the itching and swelling Tea Tree Oil stopped immediately. It&#x27;s the only product that has ever worked completely and as quickly as it did! It also smells amazing. I received the product complimentary for review purposes and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> Great ! I&#x27;ll buy more. God Bless</li>
    <li> I received a sample of 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil a few weeks ago. I&#x27;m a big fan of natural remedies (coconut oil and apple cider vinegar are two of my favorite household products), so I was excited to try this new-to-me tea tree oil (I&#x27;ve used the drug store variety before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using a bit of the oil mixed with witch hazel as a toner for my face, and my skin has never looked more glowing or felt softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using it mixed with water and more witch hazel as a cleanser for my yoga mat. The smell is pungent, but it&#x27;s much better than sweat and bacteria! It definitely keeps my mat clean and fresh after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m anxious to use this oil in other ways around the house, primarily as a household cleaner and insect repellant. I&#x27;ve already seen how it helps heal skin issues, so I&#x27;m sure it will work in other ways, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to anybody who&#x27;s tired of using chemical-laden cleansers and skin/hair treatments.</li>
    <li> I am new to using essential oils and received a sample to facilitate a review. First I want to say that this product arrived quickly to my house. The product does have a scent to it, but that is expected with essential oils. I love that this particular essential oil can be used for a variety of purposes including preventing lice, treating acne, and dandruff. It can also be used as a toothpaste, mouthwash, and even household cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to test out the variety of uses that this product has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;The eBook that comes with this product shows 50+ uses to the product and includes recipes. This makes getting started with essential oils easier and not so overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I got this product free to share my opinion; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try this product because I have pretty bad dandruff and a very itchy scalp. I can live with the dandruff but the itchy scalp just annoys the heck out of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To try and relieve some of it I have tried several shampoo and conditioners with tea tree oil in them to try and help. Some of them help better than others, some don&#x27;t help at all and just seem very gimmicky. I decided that picking up some pure oil to try by itself would be a good idea so I can see how it would work. If I like it I can keep using it on it&#x27;s own, or try mixing up some of my own concoctions to wash and condition my hair with. So this offer to try out their product came at just the right time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for several weeks now, about once a week it gets rubbed into my scalp very good and by default into my hair as well. I&#x27;m not going to tote this as a perfect cure for anything, so always try things with caution and seek information on your own including consulting medical professionals as necessary. For myself I have two types of dandruff one is dusty fine and one is larger more noticeable pieces. For the dusty fine dandruff it is working great to keep it at bay, which is good because this is the more annoying of the two that is super noticeable on all of my clothing and anywhere I have been sitting recently. This is good to have gone! The larger pieces it hasn&#x27;t completely disappeared, but they have lessened a bit. I&#x27;m hoping with time it will be gone completely. The itch is kept at bay by using it at least once a week, but towards the end of the week it&#x27;s starting to get itchy again so I am thinking about upping it to twice a week to see how that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it is a good product and I would continue to buy this brand out of pocket. It&#x27;s a decent price for a good size bottle. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and have not quite hit the quarter mark so I think it would last me several months. I haven&#x27;t used it for anything else yet, but it came with a recipe book and I have been looking at other recipes on the internet that call for it and would consider trying some of them in the future. I&#x27;m interested in it&#x27;s ability to help with acne as well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I have to say about it is the smell, I don&#x27;t mind it. Hubby hates it. I just caution that if you don&#x27;t add it to another oil or a recipe it is a very strong scent that will overwhelm some people.quarter mark so I think it would last me several months.

    <li> I was sent some of this Tea Tree Oil to test out along with the free eBook for 50+ uses to review for my blog, GlamRiver.  Who knew that Tea Tree Oil had so many uses.  I have been using it on just about everything.  My favorite things I have done are that I have added it to a lot of different facial masks &amp; facials but my favorite use has been for mosquito bites.  This stuff works amazing on mosquito bites, not only did it take the irritation and itching away &amp; bring a TON of relief they also healed a lot faster than they would of had I left them untreated!  Great product and a new staple in my household! :)</li>
    <li> I am always trying to find ways to lessen the amount of chemicals used in my home. That is why I am so excited about Australian Tea Tree Oil by Apothecary Extracts. This amazing and versatile all natural oil can be used to create a wide range of both health and beauty products. Many people (including me until recently) do not know that Australian Tea Tree Oil can be used to make your own shampoo, soap, lotion, household disinfectant, face cleanser, toothpaste and can be used to naturally fight acne, yeast, toenail fungus, lice, yeast infections, skin tags, cold sores, dandruff, ringworm, fleas, warts, psoriasis, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you buy Australian Tea Tree Oil on Amazon you get a free eBook with over 50 recipes and uses for tea tree oil. That is not the only plus side of buying your tea tree oil from Apothecary Extracts. Unlike many essential oil companies that dilute their product to make it cheaper, Apothecary Extracts have Gas Chromatography Reports that prove their product is 100% undiluted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE the fragrant smell of Australian Tea Tree Oil. When used as a disinfectant to clean your kitchen or bathroom it leaves a fresh smell that is so much more enjoyable then the chemical scent that is so strong in most cleaning products. I also have no concern about harmful chemicals getting into my food after using this to clean my kitchen counter tops.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product! The oil is of very good quality and a little goes a long, long way! I use it mainly for cleaning/disinfecting. What I do is to to add a few drops of tea tree oil in a water and vinegar mixture and use it to clean anything and everything from walls, floors, bathroom and kitchen sinks and other surfaces. I also clean my baby&#x27;s toys with it. I just put the mixture in a water spritzer for easy and mess free cleaning!  To keep my house fresh-smelling, I put mix a few drops of the tea tree oil and bergamot oil with water on a spritzer and spray it all over the house!</li>
    <li> this stuff really works, and it is a very good price it would of cost me the same price for 2 oz at the health food store where I bought it last and I liked that shipping was free..</li>
    <li> Apothecary Extracts Australian Tea Tree Oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) comes in a 4 ounce bottle, which will last you over one year with regular use. The value of essential oils is that a little goes a long way. For example, to make a bottle of homemade all-purpose cleaner, you need 10 drops of Tea Tree Oil. I also started adding about 10 drops of Tea Tree Oil to really smelly (moldy) laundry and stinky (ammonia) cloth diapers. The cost of pure and potent essential oils might seem high, but the point that you only need a little at a time and that you will be using the product for a long time are two points that support the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s talk a little bit more about the purity of Australian Tea Tree Oil. The purity of essential oils is a current debate in the world of essential oils. Apothecary Extracts tests to prove the purity and potency of their Australian Tea Tree Oil. It is 100% pure. No fillers, additives, bases or carriers added. A lot of companies that offer cheaper essential oils will dilute them to reduce the cost. Remember that you are paying for what you get. Cheaper is not always better. You will use up diluted oils fasted and will have to repurchase on a more frequent basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree Oil is a great essential oil to have in your cabinet and is a great first investment essential oil. One of my favorite uses of Tea Tree Oil is to make my Lemon Tea Tree All-Purpose Cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree Oil is not only effective as an ingredient in cleaning and body products, but also has strong medicinal properties. I read that for centuries, Australian Aborigines have been inhaling Tea Tree Oil to treat the common cold. I will try this when I am sick next time. The purity and potency of Apothecary Extracts Australian Tea Tree Oil is evident as soon as you open the bottle and take a whiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the product to facilitate this review. No other compensation was received. All opinions are my own and are honest.</li>
    <li> When I got this product in the mail I was, first of all, very taken with the packaging. It looks pretty cool, as if it were a part of a vintage survival handbook or something. The printing on the bottle and the actual bottle itself is very decorative. I also received a free guide on the many uses of pure tea tree oil from the company. This guide was fascinating. A person can use tea tree oil for anything from curing toe fungus to cleaning the house or even brushing their teeth! I have used tea tree oil for my unfortunate episodes of severe poison ivy for quite some time. So I know that it is very useful, but I never knew all of its different uses. As the guide suggested, I tried the tea tree oil in my face wash and hair products and I really like the cool clean feeling it adds. If you don’t already know, tea tree oil has a pretty strong odor, minty almost, but very strong. I have grown accustom to it, due to constantly having to rid myself of poison ivy since I was a small child, so I actually like the smell. But it may be too strong for some people, just for fair warning. I found this product from Apothecary Extracts to be excellent.</li>
    <li> I use this as a scalp treatment and in a face mask and love the results! This product has so many amazing uses. It is a great size and I know this will last for a long time, too! Can&#x27;t wait to try out the other uses tea tree oil has!</li>
    <li> Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary bottle of this Tea Tree oil for reviewing purposes. All opinions are my own. Basically, this is the best tea tree oil I’ve ever used (and I’ve used a ton of essential oils in my life). Unlike many essential oil products, Apothecary Extracts offers uncut tea tree oil. They’ll even show you the proof! Many other places cut their essential oils with other carrier oils, so you basically end up with a few drops of the actual EO and a bottle of carrier. While that is all fine and dandy if you want to use it as a perfume, it’s useless in actual bath recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s sourced from an award-winning Australian tea tree plantation that has the smallest carbon footprint of any other tea tree oil producer. It comes in a dark bottle to protect the integrity of the oil (this is a must, never purchase essential oils in clear vials unless you want them to lose potency pretty fast). Plus, your purchase comes with a fantastic book filled with 50+ tea tree oil recipes for everything from skin care to household cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full review on PrettyOpinionated.com</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already been using this in my homemade cleaning product recipes as well as on Declan who is constantly scraping his knees.  It even worked great on my scaredy cat Dane yesterday when one of the dogs accidentally scratched him while they were playing.  It was the first time I was able to treat a boo boo on him without tons of tears.&lt;br /&gt;Read more at http://www.aluckyladybug.com/2014/09/apothecary-extracts-tea-tree-oil-review.html#mLjL8OQbyvTrqDM0.99</li>
    <li> Recently I was given the chance to try this brand of Tea Tree Oil and WOW was I impressed! I first started by using it on my hair in the shower, which was currently on the dry side due to color treatment, and right away once my hair dried did I notice an improvement in the softness. I also tried one of the receipes in the &amp;#34;Free E-book with 53 ways to use Tea Tree Oil&amp;#34; where it reccomended as an exfoliant to combine almonds, the Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil, and pure coconut butter and not only did it clear up my face of any day to day dirt but left it feeling noticeably softer. If you have not had a chance already, I highly reccomend you give this product a try!</li>
    <li> I am currently using this for a mild case of fungus under my big toe nail. It does seem to be helping, is easy to use and is a much better choice over expensive medication that could affect the liver. I would definitely recommend it for mild cases.</li>
    <li> I received Apothecary Extracts tea tree oil in the mail and immediately started using it. I have used various brands of tea tree in the past. Some better than others. I had high hopes that this brand would be the end all be all of tea tree oil for my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first use was in my foot soak. I was amazed. A little went a long way. The results were wonderful. My dry itchy feet were soothed almost instantly. I then decided to add it to the families shampoo. My Son suffers from fairly severe dandruff, and I hoped this tea tree oil would do the trick. Within a few washes my sons dandruff was gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past month we have used Apothecary Extracts tea tree oil for numerous reasons. I am impressed each and every time. Don’t waste your money on mediocre tea tree oil. Go with this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
    <li> I have been working hard to find natural ways to provide healthier options to my medicine cabinets. Tea tree oil is one item I will not be without again. i will admit, I am not brave enough to try and use this as a toothpaste, but if you want to try, go for it.&lt;br /&gt;However,&lt;br /&gt;1. It works great straight on pimples. For my daughter, we mixed a few drops with aloe vera (I imagine coconut oil would work in place of aloe vera) since straight tea tree oil was a little too harsh for her. Also be aware to keep this out of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;2. Mix a few drops with coconut oil and watch the ringworm go away. Just ask my six year old that ended up with ringworm on his back. His response to the mixture? &amp;#34;It tingles&amp;#34; But we went from a silver dollar size bright red ringworm to a faint pink spot in just 3 days of using this mixture. By the way, it worked on my dog too.&lt;br /&gt;We are now starting a treatment for a wart using this oil. I don&#x27;t have any results because we just started it this morning. I bet the results are just as positive as the other uses I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read reviews about the strong scent. Warning, the scent is strong! But that is normal for any natural product or essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that tea tree oil can be used for numerous ailments in more that enough reason to keep it in my medicine cabinet for whatever may show up on my family in the future.</li>
    <li> I couldn’t wait until my order for this Australian Tea Tree Oil arrived. I was all ready to use the DIY recipe guide and start testing how I could swap out store-bought toxic products and incorporate this oil for anything I could.  Within 2 weeks of receiving it, I wound up getting caught outside in the sun with no sunscreen! (Yeah, not my brightest move…wasn’t planning on staying outside that long, you know how that goes!)  Well the result was a really bad sunburn, on my face no less.  I had a video shoot in a few days and I was in “panic” mode, as you could imagine.  I read that tea tree was good for sunburns so I put it on a beauty, cotton pad and used it morning and night. Only one drop was needed each application.  To my amazement, I did not peel like I thought and it really helped sooth the burn!  So thumbs up for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also added a few drops of this tea tree oil to my alkaline water in a spray bottle.  The alkalinity is a “cleaner” and the tea tree just boosts the effects.  I will continue to do this for my counters and other surfaces around my house.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tea tree oil is so versatile there are many ways to use it for a healthier environment on and around you.  The oil made a huge difference in my healing from a severe sunburn without contributing to my acne issues.  In fact my face has never been so clear.  The oil also helps clean and disinfect my counters and any other surface I use it on.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top on this bottle is hard to see how many drops I am putting in my spray bottle.  The top is designed to only dispense a drop at a time so you don’t over pour.  Possibly a dropper would be a nice addition. However, this is not a deal breaker, just have to get used to the way it pours out.  Also if you’re not used to it, tea tree oil has a strong odor.  It’s worth it for me to get the results it offers and no matter what brand you use, the odor will be the same.&lt;br /&gt;Final Recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with Apothecary Extracts Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil.  I have plenty left and use it in as many ways as possible.  It seems to be great quality and definitely works as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with Apothecary Extracts Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil.  I have plenty left and use it in as many ways as possible.  It seems to be great quality and definitely works as described.</li>
    <li> Great product. It shipped to my APO in Kuwait in 5 days. Packaged pretty well. The bottle is sturdy. My only gripe is that it doesnt have a dropper so if you&#x27;re not super careful you lose some product and for $25 I think it should have a dropper. It does have a plastic cap with a hole in it so it&#x27;s not totally uncontrolled when it comes out. I dont think that should take away from how nice this Tea Tree Oil smells and feels and works tho.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of Tea Tree Oil &amp; quite honestly never knew there was a difference between them until I tried this one. The potency alone is enough to make you know how pure of an essential oil that it really is. But the best part, is the free ebook that comes with it. I never knew Tea Tree Oil could be used for so many other purposes aside from homemade household cleaners!</li>
    <li> I used this tea tree oil because I have a problem with my toe nails. My nail was white and looked like it was going to come off. I thought it wasfrom wearing tight boots. Wrong. I had went to get a pedicure, when my nail tech informed me it was fungus. How embarrassing. This stuff is awesome. My toes are clearing up very nicely. If you have any fungus or nail discoloration I would recommend this product. I have tried over the counter medicines and nothing helped. This is the only thing that has made a difference. I am happt to recieve this oil to review. I love it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had time to explore the many uses of Tee Tree Oil but from the high praises that have been posted it must be a spectacular product.&lt;br /&gt;However, the first time I used it on my hands I was surprised at the strong aroma that reminded me of turpentine. I would not use this and go out without a shower. If there is a way to use this product in a different way to mask the aroma  I would like to hear from you. At this point I would not give it more than three stars.....but I haven&#x27;t given up on it just yet.</li>
    <li> This stuff is STRONG. It will definitely fill up an entire house if you spill it. This was sent to me by the seller for my review. I will say that it definitely opens the nasal cavity. I have used it to clean as well as in my hair and scalp. I was thankful that a manual was included with the product. The label itself is classic. Truly into this oil.</li>
    <li> This comes very nicely packaged in a nice looking box. The bottle it comes in is brown glass, it looks very nice. I love the fact that tea tree oil has so many great uses, the free ebook that comes with it shows so many uses and i have always been a fan of using natural things for ailments. I am glad i was given the opportunity to receive this complimentary and give my honest opinions of it. I have a child in school and lets face it if your child is in school there are occasionally outbreaks of lice and its something i am always paranoid about so i had previously been using a lice free shampoo which is to deter lice so your child wont get them, but that can get costly. I had read that you can add a few drops of tea tree oil to any shampoo and that will work because lice do not like tea tree oil so i was glad to try this out. You just add a few drops to a bottle of shampoo and use it normally. This tea tree oil has a distinctive sorta minty smell which is very strong in the bottle but when you add a little to shampoo its much more pleasant, i would recommend this to anyone with children for that use.</li>
    <li> My wife tried this sample sent to us for review, loved it and wrote the following review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Apothecary Extracts 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil: Unlike lighter formulas of tea tree oil this is the real deal. I used this 100% oil on my toe fungus and within 3 days all the fungus was gone. I also tried using this oil on bruises on my legs sustained from falling on black ice common here in New Jersey in the winter and not only did the oil remove the soreness of the bruises, I could see a noticeable fading of the bruises within 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also applied this oil to my 2 year old Kelpie/Border Collie mix for her fleas and she was flea free within a week. I also put several drops of the oil on her bedding and our kitchen area rugs and those fleas have never come back. I also put several drops of this oil in my bathroom aromitizer and the fragrance is very clean and is similar to being in a grove of Eucalyptus trees in the south of Australia.  This is a pharmaceutical grade Tea Tree Oil and so if you have delicate skin remember to dilute 1:1 with olive oil before applying to your cuts or bruises. Personally I like the 100% formula and prefer the stronger smell and stronger cleaning and disinfecting properties whether it is applied to kitchen surfaces or my skin. Having spent time in Australia, this 100% Tea Tree OIl brings back many happy memories!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I like the product and it work wonders! :)</li>
    <li> I have been using Tea Tree Oil for many years. This particular bottle is double the size of most Tea Tree oils I have used in the past..&lt;br /&gt;The many uses of this Tea Tree Oil is just amazing. Below I list some of the benefits I have found using this quality Tea Tree Oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 I place about 10 drops in a spray water bottle and when I want to freshen clothes in the dryer, I simply spray this on my clothes and place in the dryer for about 15 minutes. Also, I moisten a small hand towel and then spray this onto the town and toss in the dryer on wrinkled clothes for about 18 minutes. Result is the wrinkles lessen, and also the clothes come out freshened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 I place a drop or two on a Q Tip and remove eye makeup (eyeshadow and eyeliner). So so soothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 Also, I place a few drops onto my very dry hands and rub in and my hands feel smoother and far less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 My gums-I recently ate very hot scalding food and burned my top gum (very painful). I rubbed some of this Tea Tree Oil on it using a Q Tip on and off for a couple of days and the pain is gone and gum is much better and healing. What I did was to just place a small amount on the Q Tip and then I massaged it into my gum area. The taste of this is very medicinal and the scent is very medicinal as well.&lt;br /&gt;Note that Tea Tree Oil is in some toothpastes, but one should NOT SWALLOW Tea Tree oil. After I massaged it into my gum-line, I rinsed out my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Tea Tree oil was provided to me for the purpose of testing and reviewing and am I happy to say that this works wonderfully and I recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> This works, I put it on some razor bumps every day for a few days and they improved drastically, the only down side is the smell, it made me gag, hope I can get over it because I want to keep using it.</li>
    <li> The bottle is great! This item is great for cleaning and a little bit goes a long ways when mixed with water. I would suggest researching and see what oils it mixes well with if using on your body as per my research it is not safe to use undiluted. AND I BELIEVE THAT! I have never purchased tea tree oil prior to this order, but I do feel it has a pretty strong smell! I would not use this directly on my body because of it. I was able to receive this product for review. This is a giant bottle and will last me a long time. I&#x27;ve found so many uses for it already. I&#x27;ve been using to to treat some surface acne, I put it in my humidifier at night to help alleviate my asthma symptoms while i sleep, and I&#x27;ve used it to help treat fleas on my dog. This is a great tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is very useful for a number of cleaning tasks.  I have been doing a lot of reading about chemical overuse and antibacterial cleaners and how much damage they can do to our own health because of their overuse in our homes.  I have developed allergies to many cleaning products over the years and have had to learn to use more natural products.  DrWeil’s website describes how to make a lot of cleaning products.  This product also comes with access to a free eBook about the uses of tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil is also recommended by some dermatology journals in combination with peppermint oil for prophylactic use against head lice.  Tea tree oil has left the arena of old wives’ tales. Some studies have shown that tea tree oil and lavender can kill head lice by preventing feeding.  I have seen a study that said “most” of the children treated with this combination were lice free the next day, compared to the pyrethrin treatment which only had 25% clearance.  That number thing made me fairly doubtful because how is it that you are able to count 25% but not say what “most” is?  What number is most?  The other study I saw in  a dermatology journal said that peppermint oil and tea tree oil work prophylactically in combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am often in classrooms with small children and in Michigan, yes it concerns me.  When I did get head lice, after 25 years of successfully avoiding them in the classroom, it took 7 poison treatments and one heat treatment to kill them all. That was when I started adding tea tree oil to my shampoo and a conditioning treatment.  Do I know that it works?  I can’t prove it other than to say I haven’t had any new issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that is important in using tea tree oil is to dilute it.  I generally mix it 4 to 1, olive oil to tea tree oil for any uses on hair or skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something different than the type of lotions I&#x27;ve been trying for my eczema.  It seems that the lotions soak into the skin too fast and don&#x27;t work very well.  I tried this tea tree oil and has taken away the flakiness from my eczema.  It doesn&#x27;t itch anymore which is helping it to heal faster.  I never knew this oil would do this and I&#x27;m glad I was offered this product to review for my truthful and unbiased thoughts.  It stays on my skin for a while to moisturize that spot and isn&#x27;t sticky or yucky feeling.  I would definitely recommend this to some one with eczema.</li>
    <li> I heard once when Jasmine had gotten head lice a while back that Tea Tree Oil was a good Oil to add to shampoos and such to try to help prevent it. Besides that, I had done very little research on it. I hadn&#x27;t actually tried it for that reason either. Lice hating anything to me didn&#x27;t make sense at all, I mean you could be the cleanest person on the earth and still catch it. Yet everyone was raving about Tea Tree Oil still and I wanted to try it. I got really lucky or so my friends say to get this huge 4oz bottle of it from Apothecary Extracts for free to review. This bottle will last a really long time, the company says it may last people up to a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the bottle though I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure how I was going to be reviewing it or testing it. I was really excited that it came with a Free E-Book with 53+ uses for Tea Tree Oil. You really wouldn&#x27;t believe it even if I told you until you try it for yourself. I was having my monthly breakout when the oils arrived, you know the ones that come with all the hormones. Well, anyway here is what happen. I used just the Tea Tree oil with a cotton ball twice daily on this overly huge and disgusting boil type pimple face demon. I openly admit, I am a picker. I just can not help it and when I&#x27;m nervous I pick worse. This usually means I spread the breakouts all over my face. If I use spot treatments I usually break out worse. This Tea Tree oil is just amazing! I used it one day like this and the next morning when I woke up my face demon had drastically shrunk in size. Here is a before and after pic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you apply Tea tree oil directly you want to be careful not to get it around your eyes. I also applied it to the tiny face demon above my left eyebrow, which is now completely gone. In the case, that I would have used anything containing Benzol Peroxide and it being a harsh winter here in Michigan I would have been completely dry and flakey anywhere I was trying to get rid of the acne. With this Tea Tree Oil none of that happened, I never dried out at all but the acne still cleared up really quickly and I would say quicker than if I was using any other product on my face to try to clear these up. I used to think I was never going to be one of those all natural users. Now I&#x27;m really starting to see why people love it so much. Using this for my acne has proven to work faster for me and has been tons less harsh on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from Acne and Lice what else is this Tea Tree oil good for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has antibacterial, anti-fungal and also antiviral effects. This means you can use it to clean your entire house and yourself.&lt;br /&gt; Use it on your hair to prevent lice and to help with dandruff (I&#x27;ll be trying this soon)&lt;br /&gt;Use it on cuts and scrapes. You might want to use Apothecary Extracts E-book for this as it does tend to sting a little when applied to open sores. They give great advice on how to hide the smell of it and how to dilute it so it&#x27;s not so irritating. That&#x27;s what so great about Apothecary Extracts, they&#x27;re not just trying to sell you a product, they give you a ton of free information on how to put this product to use in your everyday life.&lt;br /&gt; Aroma Therapy - This is something I&#x27;m starting to get into more inside my home for the kids. Using a diffuser ( which I do not currently have to try this, but looking to get one soon) and inhaling the vapors of Tea Tree oils can help you fight off common and viral colds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Not all Tea Tree oils will be the same, you have to be careful and read labels. Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil is 100% pure Australian Tea Tree oil and is also pharmaceutical grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Preservatives&lt;br /&gt;No artificial colors&lt;br /&gt;No fragrances&lt;br /&gt;No parabens&lt;br /&gt;No mineral oils&lt;br /&gt;No chemical solvents&lt;br /&gt;No Petroleum&lt;br /&gt;Just 100% Natural Australian Tea Tree Oil bottled and tested in the USA for purity and safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil to anyone looking to start going a little more natural in your home. A lot of cleaners have tons of harmful chemicals, do we really want to be using them around our children or pets? There are so many uses for this oil that you and I both will be able to clean our whole house with it with ease.ooking to start going a little more natural in your home.

    <li> this tea tree oil is awesome, it&#x27;s a generous size for a affordable price.</li>
    <li> I have know of some of the great uses for Tea Tree Oil for many years, but it wasn&#x27;t until my sister started selling Tea Tree Oil products marketed under a specific brand that I found out how good tea tree oil really is.  I&#x27;ll have to see if I can find out what portion of tea tree oil to water that I used as an oven cleaner, but that was by far the best oven cleaner ever.  My husband now has asthma, and we have to watch aerosols and strong smelling cleaners in the house.  I am so happy to have this Apothecary Extracts 100% Pure Pharmaceutical Grade Tea Tree Oil (melaleuca alternifolia).  Some people do not like the smell of tea tree oil, but I love the smell.  I have something that gets on the back of my head just up from my neck that is sort of like a dandruff when it dries, but I went to a dermatologist when I was in high school and he said it wasn&#x27;t dandruff and gave us the diagnosis.  That&#x27;s been too long ago to remember.  At that time, he had me start washing my hair in coal tar shampoo, use some kind of prescription acid product, and then use Scalpacin.  Over the years as this has come and gone, I&#x27;ve found that I can use tea tree oil to help clear it up.  Tea tree oil has so many medicinal uses such as for cuts, scrapes, burns, insect bites, acne and pimples, and athletes foot because it is naturally antifungal.  It also works well mixed with water as an insect repellent.  I read where you can use it to remove skin tags and even warts.  You just put it on a cotton ball and tape the cotton ball down.  My husband will be really happy and will be my test subject for this because he gets so many skin tags that they irritate him, and then he either scratches them until they bleed or has me sanitize and snip them off with scissors.  I guess I didn&#x27;t realize that tea tree oil could be used internally, so I&#x27;m going to have to do a bit more research on that.  However, some of the places online were saying that because of its anti-inflammatory properties that it had been used to heal the gut and also gingivitis.  It&#x27;s also anti-viral as well as anti-fungal.  It can be used for toenail fungi.  I was given an opportunity to try this product at a promotional rate for my true and unbiased opinion.  The opinions I have stated are all my own.  Just by smelling and feeling this tea tree oil, I am assured that it is a very high quality oil.  I&#x27;m waiting on some coconut oil to come in so I can use it as a carrier oil since I do have very sensitive skin.  This has also got me wanting the information about the oven cleaning solution that I used before.  There&#x27;s a website on the box, but I&#x27;m not being able to reach it tonight.  I think I will just email the company and see if they can tell me if the website URL has changed or if perhaps they were just having trouble.

    <li> Excellent.  Gradually seeing results.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Helped very much with acne.</li>
    <li> I buy this a lot. I love to bath in it...so relaxing.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the great name. Thanks for shipping it promptly.</li>
    <li> Fairly new to the world of using essential oils, I jumped at the opportunity to review 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil.  I am so in love with this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many uses for Tea Tree Oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For health applications, it can be used to treat acne, act as an anti-fungal, an antiseptic, and and anti-viral.  It can treat head lice, sinus infections, dry skin, sunburns, bug bites and be used as aromatherapy.  It can also be used for cleaning!  It makes a great addition multi-purpose cleaner, helps control mold, and has a great smell for use with laundry as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been making a multipurpose cleaner for some time with vinegar and water.  The addition of the Tea Tree Oil has given it a much more pleasant smell as well as added the benefits of anti-viral, anti-fungal properties.  I have a renewed love for using this natural cleaner now.&lt;br /&gt;My next step will be to put this wonderful product to use in making a skin remedy for my daughter&#x27;s excema.</li>
    <li> JUST STARTED USING SO DON&#x27;T KNOW IF IT IMPROVES NAIL FUNGUS OR NOT</li>
    <li> I have ordered and used this product, and I&#x27;m impressed with the purity of the tea tree oil and with the great customer service of the company. It DOES have a strong scent, but it&#x27;s a very clean scent. Once you dilute it as directed, it&#x27;s not at all overpowering. I&#x27;ve grown to like it. I also want to caution people that the reviewer who said there&#x27;s no research to back up the effectiveness of tea tree oil in fighting infections obviously did not research very thoroughly.  I quickly and easily found an article in the Journal of Hospital Infection that states that tea tree oil has been effective in fighting MARSA (http://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(98)90135-9/abstract). For those who don&#x27;t know, MARSA is antibiotic-resistant staph, and hospitals have had a tough time trying to eliminate it in their premises using traditional methods. I also found this in the Journal of Microbial Chemotherapy: &amp;#34;Tea tree oil has recently emerged as an effective topical antimicrobial agent active against a wide range of organisms.&amp;#34;  So if its proof you want, there&#x27;s plenty of research from well-respected publications to prove it.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of this tea tree oil for review purposes and while I&#x27;ve used products with tea tree oil as an ingredient in the past, I&#x27;ve never had a bottle of the pure oil around the house before. I&#x27;m terribly skeptical of any product that claims to do just about everything, but I read the guide that came with the product and tried it for skin and cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of using pure oils around the house, but it was tough to get over the very strong aroma of the tea tree oil. I have no way to compare, but the scent is overwhelming and left me with a headache the first time I opened the bottle. My husband that it was overly powerful as well but he was more tolerant and continues to use the oil for his skincare needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t much like the scent, I stopped using my diluted mixture for cleaning in the bathroom, but I have made a few creams and mixed it up as an aftershave and acne prevention toner for my husband, who recently went back to shaving after a long time with a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a useful product. I just don&#x27;t like the scent and we have enough oil in one bottle to make skincare products for my husband for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Delivered faster than I expected. Kudos! Packaging was secure and product, so far, seems to be living up to its name. Would definitely buy again from this retailer.</li>
    <li> I had a great opportunity to review Australian Tea Tree Oil from Apothecary Extracts. The one I reviewed came in a 4oz bottle. This will last a very long time, as a little does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Tea Tree Oil for many years. Mainly as an antibacterial remedy to put on cuts and such. I have also used it in washing our clothing when we have gotten sick again, for it’s antibacterial remedy.  We have also used it successfully as an anti-fungal remedy on ringworm.  When we have had the wonderful luck in getting lice, I put this in our conditioner and was able to get rid of lice without having to purchase those awful chemicals.  I then would put a couple of drops both in the shampoo and in the conditioner to keep lice away while my children were in a brick and mortar school building.  Now that we homeschool, I don’t worry so much about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you also know that you can use Australian Tea Tree Oil to make face scrubs, hand scrubs, to combat dry scalp, and even to use with steam for an inhalant to help relieve nasal and sinus congestion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on making up some recipes in the near future that will contain this brand of Tea Tree Oil and I will share them with you on here.  I promise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the oil in the bath tub. Sorry I am not showing you a photo of that. But will give you the recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rather not scare ya’ll…..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you might appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt; give Apothecary Extracts Australian Tea Tree Oil 5 stars. I think this bottle will last us a long time, and I will order through them again.&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered promptly and as expected.  The eBook is very helpful.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary product for testing and reviewing purposes. I love the smell of this tea tree oil and love the fact that it is 100% and not diluted. I have used this for my facial cleanser and it&#x27;s working for my acne prone skin; i used a clean cotton swab to apply the tea tree oil on my pimples for spot treatment and it literally reduces the size of my pimples the next day. I even used it to make my own disinfectant spray and I love the fact that I can disinfect my baby&#x27;s toys and items in our house without even having to worry about my baby inhaling it or touching what I had just sprayed since it is SAFE to use around my 11 month old. This is a high quality oil to invest in and the bottle will last you a very long time.</li>
    <li> Bought this to treat nail fungus, but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I am a essential oil junkie and I need to have them all and one of my favorites is Tea Tree oil. I was able to try out  Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil. You can use Tea Tree Oil for everything. I like to use it in my laundry to kill bacteria especially in my husbands work and hockey clothing where he sweats alot. It also freshens up the smell. Sometimes I even like to add it to the washer with nothing in it to give the washer a good freshening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review purposes however my opinions are honest.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I have been using it from day one for fleas on my dog, brown spots on my face(works!), and also brush my teeth with a few drops in a jar of organic coconut oil that I keep in the medicine cabinet.  I especially like that it comes with the free E-book with all it&#x27;s uses!  I don&#x27;t think it will last too long as it has so many uses.  Probably will be needing more soon and definitely will be recommending it to all my family and friends as I do whenever I find something I feel I can&#x27;t live without!  It is up there with my eucalyptus oil and frankincense.</li>
    <li> I am officially obsessed. I have been using this for about a month now and my acne has almost completely disappeared. I have struggled with moderate acne for a long time, and could not find anything (prescription or natural) that could clear up my skin. I have tried EVERYTHING. I read the reviews for this tea tree oil and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been mixing about 3-5 drops with my Egyptian Magic moisturizer (you should also definitely try this one too) after I wash my face at night. Immediately I started noticing my blackheads were clearing and my pimples were not lasting as long and as harsh as usual. After a month, most of my acne has cleared up and what is left is extremely minimal. I am amazed. It&#x27;s also a great price considering you only need to use a small amount at a time. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is looking to clear up their skin.</li>
    <li> loved. Worth every penny. Helped with acne.</li>
    <li> I love this TEA TREE OIL! IT has so many uses for natural remedies, hair treatments, and more. This 4 ounce size will allow the consumer to use it many times! I love the packaging as well.</li>
    <li> Disclosure - free sample provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started using essential oils.  I am a big fan of tea tree oil.  We use this for a number of different things.  I actually started using a tiny bit to help repel lice.  I honestly freaked when I found out there was lice at their school.  I was looking for any way to keep this away from my children.  I have heard that tea tree oil is a natural way to repel lice.  I also love the smell of tea tree oil.  Have you tried tea tree oil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apothecary Extracts offers a tea tree oil that is 100% pure.  It is made from with Australian Tea Tree Oil.  I received a 4 oz. bottle.  Tea tree oil really needs to be used sparingly.  This product is going to last me a long time.  The 4 oz. bottle also comes with an ebook.  This book was great.  It gave me so many uses for the oil.  It has uses that include detergent, cleaners, shampoos, lotions, and so much more.  I have even used this to help clear my sinuses.  I put some hot water in a bowl and a drop of Australian Tea Tree Oil.  I put my head over the steam, and I really could breath so well!  What would you use this product for?</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil comes nicely packaged in a dark brown, glass bottle with a top that has a built-in dispenser. I love the packaging, which has a vintage-style label and lots of great information right on the bottle.Try adding a few drops to a bath full of warm water to soothe respiratory ailments.You can use tea tree oil full-strength - for example I use it on a cotton swab and dab it on skin ailments.Or you can dilute it, such as added to water for a foot soak, either to treat something like athlete&#x27;s foot or simply to soothe and refresh tired feet.I also use this in my natural cleaners. As a disinfectant and anti-fungal, it is a great additional to your household cleaning products. You can easily add some to a spray bottle with water, and you have an effective cleaning spray that helps to disinfect.&lt;br /&gt; I am glad to be a part of testing this  product in exchange of my unbiased  opinions .</li>
    <li> I have used tea oil before, but not Apothecary Extracts.  There are all kinds of claims being made about tea oil, but some of them are turning out to be valid.  No one product can cure anything and everything, so if you are interested in tea oil for a particular malady, you’ll have to do your research.  I did check out the Australian standards and listed the basic chromatographic profile below if you care to look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently many are interested because of it’s anti-bacterial properties.  It does have a lovely, slightly medicinal camphor-like smell.  It can be used in many different ways, but I’ve used it in the bath.  Some use it for muscular aches and pains, it can be massaged into the skin, daubed on with a cotton ball (for acne) or used in your bath water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t have any particular aches and pains to cure, but did put approximately 15 drops in hot bath water.  It’s a great way to relax and is considered by many to be an essential oil.  The smell is wonderful, but obviously it’s going to dissipate in a tubful of water.  You can add extra essential oils if you like fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is relaxing, but I can’t vouch as to any of the other claims.  The Apothecary Extract is considered to be pharmaceutical or medicinal grade.  I have spotted some very interesting studies on the Internet, something you may wish to explore before purchase.  This is an essential oil that shouldn’t be dismissed out of hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Botanical Name: Melaleuca alternifolia&lt;br /&gt;►  Plant Part: Leaves&lt;br /&gt;Extraction Method: Steam Distilled&lt;br /&gt;►  Origin: Australia&lt;br /&gt;Color: Colorless to pale yellow clear liquid.&lt;br /&gt;►  Consistency: Thin&lt;br /&gt;►  Aromatic Scent: Tea Tree Essential Oil has a fresh, antiseptic and medicinal scent.

    <li> Tea tree oil is amazing. it has so many uses, but my favorite is in house cleaning supplies and in our shampoo.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! Used on a case of athletes foot that no over the counter medicine touched. It took a little longer but athletes foot is gone! We also used this on acne breakouts and they cleared up redness overnight and acne went away. The smell is like paint thinner but goes away after awhile and the benefits far out way the smell.</li>
    <li> Had no ideal there are so many uses for tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Awesome pure product!  The price was good and packaging is nice! Recieved order 2 days after I ordered(much sooner than expected)!! I always have to have tee tree oil and always try a new brand, but I&#x27;m sticking with this one now :) it&#x27;s not diluted!!</li>
    <li> I started using tea tree oil about a year ago.  I found out it helped keep the lice away and several people we were close with were dealing with lice.  We just put a few drops into the shampoo to detract the lice.  When I knew we were going to really be in close quarters with people infected I also took a cotton swab and added oil to our hair lines.&lt;br /&gt;  When our apothecary tea tree oil arrived I was impressed by it&#x27;s size it much larger then the bottle I had bought from the drug store last year.  It also seemed to have a stronger scent, which I took as a good sign of its quality.  I liked the way the hole at the top is a little bigger then most I was able to dip my cotton swab in to get some oil.  (Make sure if you do this to only use clean swaps no double dipping!)  I found a new use for my tea tree oil last week: poison ivy!  While weeding a flower bed I apparently rolled in the poison ivy and got a large rash down the side of my face.  Oh the itching!!  Several times I applied some tea tree oil this gave it immediate relief from the itching and I feel like it helped it heal faster.  This is a great product if you don&#x27;t have #teatreeoil in your medicine cabinet I strongly recommend you consider buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I Was Selected To Sample Australian #TeaTreeOil From Tomoson And Let Me Tell You I Have Never Used Anything Like This Honestly Anything That Said Natural I Strayed Away From And Never Had A Reason To I Just Didn&#x27;t Tried It Because It Wasn&#x27;t Appealing To Me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I Join Tomoson.com And They Offered Me Australian Tea Tree Oil To Sample And Give My Review, I Thought This Was As Good Of A Time As Any To Sample A Natural Product And Give A Honest Review Because Lately I Have Been Really Wanting To Change My Life Style And Live More Healthier. They Also Gave Me A Free Recipe Guide With 53 Different Uses And I Was Shocked At How Many Their Was (53) Things Like (Moisturizing Face Wash, Facial Toner, Lip Balm. Shampoo, Conditioner, Itch Relief, Air Freshener , And More) And I Was Excited To Read The Recipe Guide And Try Some Of Them Out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The First One I Was Excited To Try Was The Fortifying Air Freshener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What You Need:&lt;br /&gt; 10-15 drops Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil&lt;br /&gt; 2 tbsp. clear gelatin powder&lt;br /&gt; Clean jars&lt;br /&gt; ½ cup hot water&lt;br /&gt; 5 drops peppermint essential oil&lt;br /&gt; 5 drops sweet basil essential oil&lt;br /&gt;Mix It: Stir all ingredients over low heat until the gelatin is fully melted, then pour&lt;br /&gt;into clean jars. Refrigerate until gel has set.&lt;br /&gt;Apply It: Set jars wherever you need a bit of strength or energy; in your office,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bathroom, kitchen or car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To My Surprise It Worked It Really Smelled Nice And Lasted For About 2 Weeks. This Is Something I See Myself Making Instead Of Buying In Scents Or Even Plugins. Also You Can Change The Scents Instead Of Adding 5 drops peppermint essential oil You Could Add 5 Drops Of Lavender Oil, Lemon Essential Oil As Long As You Add 5 Drops Of Whatever Scent You Are Using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Also Looked Into Tea Tree Oil Dryer Sheets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What You Need:&lt;br /&gt; Old t-shirts, flannels or towels cut into 5x7 squares&lt;br /&gt; Container with airtight lid&lt;br /&gt; ½ cup White vinegar&lt;br /&gt; 8 drops Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil&lt;br /&gt; 4 drops lavender oil&lt;br /&gt; 2 drops lemon essential oil&lt;br /&gt;Mix It: Place square cloths in the airtight container, stacked on each other. Pour&lt;br /&gt;vinegar into a large glass bowl and whisk in oils until blended. Pour mixture over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cloths until totally saturated and seal the container until time to use.&lt;br /&gt;Apply It: Remove one sheet and place in the dryer with each load of laundry. Do&lt;br /&gt;not throw away dryer sheets, save them until it is time to make a fresh batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Never Knew That Tea Tree Oil Could Be Use In So Many Ways And I&#x27;m Excited To Try Them Out One By One. I Loved The Dryer Sheets It Really Made My Clothes Smell Great Just Like Lavender But It Didn&#x27;t Last Long The Scent Stayed Around For About A Week Maybe A Week In Half Witch Was Fine For Me Because I Wear The Heck Up Out Of Clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Do Recommend Australian Tea Tree Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Australian Tea Tree Oil Is Something Everyone Should Look Into I Mean It Can Be Use For Many Many Different Things And When I Say Different I Mean It. You Never Need To Use Alot Of It For One Thing So A 4oz Bottle Should Last You 25 Maybe 30 Different Uses Out Of It And Save Money Along The Way And Who Doesn&#x27;t Love Too Save Money.

    <li> I received the bottle today and applied a little drop of it right away to my acne and. The results are fast and amazing! Not only it shrank the acne big time but also itchiness is gone! It&#x27;s really amazing. However, should I be receiving a FREE INSTRUCTION GUIDE with it? I didn&#x27;t receive any and I would really appreciate if I can have 1 because this is my first time using tea tree oil. By the way, this is my first ever online purchase review. I love this tea tree oil so much!</li>
    <li> This product is terrific! Great value and the best tea tree oil I have ever used. Try it . You&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
    <li> One does not even have to open the box to smell this oil.  It is not a strong odor, it is kind of odd to describe, but it smells &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;.  One can tell it is pure.  I love the bottle, and once it is empty, it would fit right in with a country decor, as a decoration, because it has a &amp;#34;back in the day&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;I know it is odd, but when I think of this oil, I think of fine, aged wine.  Smooth smell, does not burn when applied.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this review, and I would recommend this product to family/friends.  Vicki</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard about the Australian Tea Oil for a while now and had the opportunity to try this out.  I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and am battling a face wart for some time.  I&#x27;ve used the Tree Oil aggressively by not diluting.  The wart has considerably leveled (thank goodness).  I received a free ebook of recipes that has more Tree Oil uses and find that the Australian Tree Oil can be an amazing product for various beauty/houselhold uses.  The bottle holds 4oz which is plenty.  After hearing all about and then trying it out for myself, I&#x27;m an Australian Tea Oil Believer!</li>
    <li> Works Great!  Have used it for hair conditioner and a hair mask so far. Love it.</li>
    <li> So I finally got around to using this in the last week or so.  Added bonus is it comes with a free guide with 53+ recipes to try out.  Which was awesome as I had only ever heard of using it in shampoos.  I wasn’t going to try that this time as my hair has become super sensitive over the years and I didn’t want to muck it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t able to try everything (some of the added ingredients were very hard to come buy or rather on the pricey end because I would have had to buy in bulk). BUT I was all about the Tea Tree Oil Steam Inhalant!  I have horrid allergies and I love a good steam to clear out my nasal passages.  Here’s what you need for this one: 4 cups of hot water, 2 drops Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil, 1 drop eucalyptus oil (actually had this one on hand),  1 large bowl, and 1 large towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You take all of the above and do the following to mix it all together: Bring water to a boil and remove from heat. Pour water into a heat safe bowl and add tea tree and eucalyptus oils. Swirl to blend. Cover your head with towel so the steam does not escape.  Sit like that for 5-10 minutes and enjoy being able to breathe again.  I plan to do this at least once a week as I do have Rx sinus sprays that I have to use.  But this I found is a nice break from the medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried out the Tangy Disinfecting Mouthwash, because again I happened to have everything on hand in the house.  For this one you would need: 6 drops Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil, 3 drops of Stevia (optional – I’m not a fan of Stevia so I left it out), 1 1/3 cups distilled water, 5 drops peppermint essential oil.  Again, take all that and combine all ingredients together in a bowl until blended and transfer to a glass or plastic bottle with a lid. Shake well and store in medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this one is again super simple: shake well before each use. Fill lid with mouthwash and rinse as normal. Also they were not kidding about the tangy.  Talk about a wake up call for your mouth!  One important thing to note:  avoid swallowing the mouthwash. Tea tree oil should not be ingested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I did was apply the tea tree oil directly to my toe nails using a cotton swab.  I know it might sound gross, but sometimes I’ve found my nail beds get a little discolored.  But I used the tea tree oil for a week, at night, and noticed a big difference in the color of my nail beds.  Best bet is to cover your feet with cotton socks after applying the tea tree oil so it doesn’t get all over the bed!about a wake up call for your mouth!

    <li> I love it smell tree oil</li>
    <li> I have not see the result yet (I&#x27;m using for my hair) , but the thing that I don&#x27;t like s the bottle has no dropper .</li>
    <li> Works wonders on toe nail fungus!!!!!</li>
    <li> very good and  trusted seller.  I will continue too buy and recommend others to this seller.</li>
    <li> Recipes very helpful.</li>
    <li> I know I have used products with tea tree oil in it and they are very effective at their target&lt;br /&gt;One of the best things about being able to review this Tea Tree Oil is the awesome digital recipe book you get.&lt;br /&gt;There are 77 pages of amazing information about Tea Tree Oil, how it is an anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-viral and the many uses.&lt;br /&gt;In the past my son had molluscum, a type of childhood disease. The only product that worked to cure him had tea tree oil as one of the main ingredients. That was my 1st exposure to tea tree oil. So naturally I want to know everything I can use it for since it had done such an amazing thing for my son.&lt;br /&gt;I was ecstatic to get the pure version and learn so much more about it and try some of the recipes in the digital book.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it as treatment to my blemishes on my face, which I can say is awesome. I love that it is a natural treatment. I just dot it on my problem areas and it is soothing and you can feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;Another amazing way I love to use it is the lip scrub. It is minty and refreshing and the recipe will last a while. Lip scrubs should be a part of everyones nightly routine.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try more recipes. I want to get all the ingredients to try the hair care next. I love products that give the minty feeling to my scalp.</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend to buy Apothecary Extracts because is 100% Pure Australian tea tree oil. They compare the tea tree oil with benzoyl peroxide, and tea tree oil produces much less scaling and dryness. This is the main reason that I get this product, I want to apply it directly with a swab to a pimple or to a zone that has acne problems. The oil absorbs quickly into the skin. If you have sensitive skin this tea tree oil is perfect for you because is completely natural and it avoids allergic skin reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you buy this oil it comes with a free Ebook: 53 Uses for Tea Tree Oil. This books is fabulous because it has all these recipes that will help you treat naturally any of the following skin conditions: Acne, Eczema, Psoriasis, Sunburn, Bug bites, Warts, Skin tags, Ringworm, Boils, Corns, Dry skin/dandruff, Scars &amp; scratches, Calluses, Chicken Pox marks, Dermatitis, Hives, Jock Itch and Staph infection.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil is an essential at my house. I first tried it several years ago, and loved the many benefits it provided my home and family.  I haven&#x27;t found a brand I prefer over any other-until now!  I had the opportunity to review Apothecary Extracts 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil for the past few weeks, and it is now my favorite brand.&lt;br /&gt;There are SO MANY uses for Tea Tree Oil, both personal and household use.  Some personal use examples are: fighting acne, dandruff and warts.  Household use includes making your own detergents and cleaners, or shampoo and body wash.  I use Tea Tree Oil for many things, but probably my biggest use of it is in household cleaners and detergents.  It worked great on my kids&#x27; acne when they were teens too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tea Tree Oil is a powerful essential oil known to be an immune stimulant.  It can fight all three categories of infectious organisms.  When someone in my home is coming down with a flu/cold, Tea Tree Oil vaporized can knock it out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil is a pure oil taken from the Melaluca tree native to Australia.  Many essential oils are diluted, but this is pure, high quality Tea Tree Oil.</li>
    <li> Apothecary Extracts sent me a free bottle of their tea tree oil to try out. I know people recommend putting a few drops in a bowl of hot water, and inhaling the steam, so I figured adding it to my hot bath would probably have a similar effect. I added a few drops of the two essential oils a friend gave me a while back, and within minutes the whole room (actually, the entire upstairs) smelled powerfully of all three oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bath was AH.MAZE.ING, you guys. I almost fell asleep in the tub!! The scent was strong, but not unpleasant, and I could feel my muscles relaxing almost immediately. I soaked for twenty minutes, and when I got out, my headache was gone. I still had toddler-free time on my hands, so I laid down for a little while – and woke up to Serenity-kisses almost three hours later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention that I have the best husband in the world?? ♥&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew up with tea tree oil, and have owned a few bottles myself, from a variety of companies. I like this one because the oil is pure, comes from ethical sources, is affordable, and you get a lot of it for the price. I also really like the nostalgic feel of their products! The label is especially charming, while surprisingly helpful and informative. These guys even offer a free ebook with purchase, that contains a ton of recipes and ideas for using tea tree oil in your every day life. I also love that they don’t use any yucky ingredients like preservatives or dyes, and they’ve been independently tested and verified. Apothecary Extracts is hoping to expand their offerings soon, and I’m looking forward to seeing what they come out with next!</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil is a great deal, because it can be diluted and the last forever, yet still gets the job done!  This oil provides quick, soothing relief for mosquito bites and also can be used sparingly to help clear up acne.  I also like to use it to freshen up my laundry by adding a couple drops to each load.  Very useful for many different reasons!</li>
    <li> Feels stronger than what I previously used. Had an effect right after the first time. Good combination with rosemary oil.</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil comes nicely packaged in a dark brown, glass bottle with a top that has a built-in dispenser.  I love the packaging, which has a vintage-style label and lots of great information right on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil also comes with a free e-book full of uses for tea tree oil.  If you haven&#x27;t used tea tree oil before, you may be surprised just how many uses it has.  Tea tree oil has been used for many years, from the Aboriginal people of Australia, to military uses in World War II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use tea tree oil full-strength - for example I use it on a cotton swab and dab it on skin ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or you can dilute it, such as added to water for a foot soak, either to treat something like athlete&#x27;s foot or simply to soothe and refresh tired feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try adding a few drops to a bath full of warm water to soothe respiratory ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also mix with a carrier oil, such as coconut oil, before applying to skin.  I keep a little container in my bathroom with coconut oil I mix in several drops of tea tree oil (to the strength desired), and I use this every night to keep my skin looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this in my natural cleaners.  As a disinfectant and anti-fungal, it is a great additional to your household cleaning products.  You can easily add some to a spray bottle with water, and you have an effective cleaning spray that helps to disinfect.  It makes a great room deodorizer.  Add a few drops to a spray bottle full of water and you get a terrific scent without all the chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Disclosure: a sample of this product was provided free of charge, however all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is the most versatile essential oil there is. I use it to clear acne (even pesky under the skin pimples) and in various recipes/remedies. The free e-book offered by Apothecary Extracts is a wonderful resource to get even more uses out of your oil. This huge bottle will definitely last!</li>
    <li> Shipping fast, but expired date almost closer, The smell is strong compare to other bland,  it does not work for me .</li>
    <li> tee tree oil is fine ,but didn&#x60;t receive book</li>
    <li> Excellent product quickly delivered</li>
    <li> Love the E-book and have made several recipes for myself and others</li>
    <li> This stuff is good for anything that ails ya&#x27; ! i use it for my cuticles...sometimes have a reaction to acrylic nails..clears it right up ! My foot doctor even recommended it for toe nail issues.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with Tea Tree Oil. I especially appreciate that this Apothecary Extracts 100% Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil has been subjected to Gas Chromatography. As a scientist I appreciate when a company have hard evidence to back their claims. There are so many great use for Tea Tree oil and the bonus recipe book made finding new uses even better. This product was provided to me by BrandBacker and my opinion in honest and my own.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Great product and great price! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Very pure oil compared to others.  Do wish that it came with a dropper since it is difficult to get a few drops out of the bottle to dilute it water for use in wash or on face. It comes with a plug with a small hole that I can&#x27;t remove.</li>
    <li> Excellent product would recommend definitely</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great value so I grabbed it with a promotional coupon.  I was asked to review this product but I am completely honest and forthcoming with my review- I am not forced to give a good review!  I liked that it is bottled in the USA, helps me feel more secure in quality control, etc.  I use Tea Tree Oil regularly but had run out so it was great timing!  The package came a bit beat up so there was a bit of leakage- so everything smells like TTO right now- if you&#x27;ve ever smelled it you know what that is like!  Not horrible but not my favorite either.  Since I was out I put several drops in all of our shampoo bottles- with two kids in 1st grade I live in fear of lice and the TTO seems to be an easy and effective way (knock on wood!) of avoiding it!  I also mixed a little with coconut oil and put it in their hair since tonight isn&#x27;t a bath night.  To me, TTO is a necessary item to keep in the medicine cabinet (do not ingest!) and this brand is awesome- so grab it!</li>
    <li> Have used it in my Free &amp; Clear Shampoo..has made a big difference in my scalp..</li>
    <li> I really love this, not only is the bottle a great size for the price. It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as others! That doesn&#x27;t mean it does not work though! I love using this in my shampoo, or directly on my face to treat acne.  I will be repurchasing this!&lt;br /&gt;Product received for review.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving this tea tree oil, I compared it to another bottle I had from a different brand (Swanson).  It looked and smelled the same, so it definitely appears, at first glance, to be a high quality, authentic product.  I was thus confident I could use it for all the purposes I normally use tea tree oil for and have good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ll talk about three ways I personally used this tea tree oil and discuss my results in each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) For the face.  Tea tree oil is supposed to have antibacterial properties and I&#x27;ve been having trouble with breakouts lately.  I&#x27;ve had some success with spot treatments containing tea tree oil, but wanted to apply it all over my face and hopefully prevent future issues.  So I bought a travel bottle and mixed some tea tree oil with my regular toner.  (It was an alcohol-based toner with witch hazel from Olay.)  I shook it up and it formed a white emulsion (has not separated so far).  I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily for a couple of days and I am already seeing more calmness in my skin.  So I definitely think this is helping to treat/prevent breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Feet.  Tea tree oil is also supposed to have antifungal properties.  I read online that it is at least as effective as tolnaftate (the active ingredient in Tinactin) against athlete&#x27;s foot.  I have a recurring problem with athlete&#x27;s foot.  It&#x27;s mostly under control for now, but I was still having a little peeling.  So I mixed some tea tree oil with foot cream (from Nailtiques) in a travel bottle.  It took quite a bit of shaking to get it to mix (I&#x27;d estimate I used maybe a 5-10% concentration by volume).  I&#x27;ve been applying that between my toes twice a day and the last little bit of peeling skin is going away, so I think this is definitely helping against my persistent athlete&#x27;s foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Breathing.  You can use this in a similar manner to eucalyptus oil to improve breathing when your sinuses/nasal passages are clogged.  I boiled some water, then poured it in a bowl with some of this tea tree oil.  I held my head over the steaming bowl with a towel over my head to keep the steam contained.  I did experience some immediate relief of my congestion (did not last a terribly long time, but then neither does eucalyptus oil, but it would be helpful to use while you are waiting for a decongestant to kick in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the primary ways I use tea tree oil, and this product has performed well in all of them.  Please note that you will almost certainly want to dilute the tea tree oil into a carrier before use (hence my addition of toner and/or foot cream) as it is rather strong.  However, that will also mean you can use one bottle for longer!  Also please note that the tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) is not related to tea (Camellia sinensis) and that tea tree should not be taken internally (it will cause unpleasant digestive side effects).  As with any treatment that you use topically, test it on a small area to make sure you&#x27;re not going to have an allergic reaction before spreading it all over your face!  If you are looking for additional uses, a PDF is provided with purchase that will give you some further ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.n poured it in a bowl with some of this tea tree oil.

    <li> EVERYTHING is the tea tree! Love it! Use it and abuse it!</li>
    <li> This works great on my skin tags!  Quick shipping and accurate description!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:dd08ded0a85dbc8e9b560955599f3f27]]If you&#x27;ve gone to any natural health and beauty store recently, you may have noticed tea tree oil as a prominent ingredient on all sorts of personal hygiene products, like shampoos, soaps, mouthwash, and [[ASIN:B005P0X2Q4 Desert Essence Toothpaste Tea Tree Neem-Wintergreen]]. Despite its name, the tea tree is not at all related to the tea that we drink (Camellia sinensis), but is a member of the myrtle family and is known by its scientific name Melaleuca alternifolia. And being natural, of course, is nothing new except to us silly over-industrialized folk who have filled our homes with cheap chemicals and mass-produced toxic cleaning products and lost touch with Mother Nature. Indigenous peoples in Australia have been using the oils from its leaves for centuries to treat coughs and other ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a beautifully designed cardboard box that references artwork from health products of the 1800&#x27;s. Tea tree oil, because of its antiseptic and disinfecting properties, has many uses for personal hygiene, skincare, and household cleaning. While I&#x27;ve used products containing tea tree oil for years, I&#x27;ve never actually seen or used tea tree oil in its pure form. The oil itself is clear and comes in a brown glass bottle to protect it from light. It is made in Australia and contains nothing else. The odor is quite strong and very distinctive, smelling like a combination of camphor, rosemary, limes, pine needles, and old wet dish rags. It can be used alone as a wipe or combined with other ingredients to make lotions, balms, and home cleaning products like dryer sheets, toilet cleaners, oven cleaner. Apothecary Extracts also provides an excellent 70 page PDF with recipes, history, and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a mouthwash/gargle out of it by mixing a few drops of the oil with 12 oz of water and some salt (I didn&#x27;t have any peppermint oil handy for taste). The taste is quite strong/astringent and the oil can irritate the mouth and throat, so be sure to dilute well and try a little at a time. It left my mouth feeling puckery and clean, with a little thirsty feel and also as if I licked the sap off a pine tree and then had some lime juice from those squeezy bottles. As a topical skin wipe, I used it on my face. It&#x27;s gentle and leaves a cooling but smelly sensation. I have skin inflammation around my forehead and sinuses and it feels good having that tingle. On my forearm, which does not have any inflammation, there&#x27;s no cooling sensation, so something in here is working and acting on my inflamed skin! I can feel it right away. Tea tree oil is commonly used in shampoos and is used widely to treat dandruff and scalp irritation. Just don&#x27;t plan on going anywhere for a few hours after application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are only some of the many uses for this wonderfully helpful medicinal tree.

    <li> My girlfriend uses a lot of essential oils, here is her opinion on the Tea Tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use tea tree oil all the time from cleaning to facial care. The first thing you will notice is this oil smells wonderful. It smells just like the tree. There is no other chemical smells that can come from distillation or to enhance the oil. This is a high quality oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil works great for cleaning my face, there was no redness or burning. It helps to cut back on the oiliness of my skin. For cleaning it works wonders around the house. I use it with vinegar to get rid of mold and mildew in my bathroom. I just love how it leaves my house smelling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a great, high quality tea tree oil, this is the one you need to get. You do get a huge bottle and this price is pretty reasonable compared to other tea tree oil brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn Kovacich&lt;br /&gt;Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Good product for various uses.</li>
    <li> The cold dry winter has left my scalp dry. Tea Tree oil is a wonderful solution for a dry scalp. thanks!!!</li>
    <li> First off, I could smell the tea tree oil from outside of the sealed package before I even opened the mail. Definitely a good sign. Stronger than the &amp;#34;100% teatree&amp;#34; oil I used to buy at Sally&#x27;s, and a much better price since I had paid $10 for the Sally&#x27;s 1/2 ounce container. Also comes in a glass bottle, which I think is very environmentally conscious, and it seals the deal that it came from a small business. Definitely purchase this and I swear you won&#x27;t look anywhere else again.</li>
    <li> My mother uses Australian Tea Tree oil extensively for battling nail fungus/infections, which really does work extremely well, so this bottle went to her for comparative evaluation.  And the feedback was generally pleased although the scent is a bit stronger than what she is used to - yet, one could easily chalk this up to the greater potency.  She did end up using a third less than she normally does while treating her nails once I looked at her other bottles of Tea Tree oil and discovered they were all diluted/cut in some manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my own use, an idea that had occurred to me from web-walking research, is putting a tiny amount in the coconut oil I use for oral oil pulling.  There is a study on dental plaque and Tea Tree oil available on the NIH Gov site, and other studies also strongly support Tea Tree effectiveness in treating periodontal disease and halitosis.  You do want to use caution in using only minute amounts (I use a single drop in a typical tablespoon of coconut oil), but the benefits are definitely there, not only in modern studies, but also borne out by historical use by the Aborigines themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So scent aside and the absolute need to ensure you do dilute the potency to a manageable degree, I certainly must add in my warm recommendation along with my mothers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I received this as a complimentary review supplement with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best.  I am a life long herbal supplement taker with strong interests both in the  medicinal traditions and modern pharmacological aspects of Earth&#x27;s Natural Bounties.</li>
