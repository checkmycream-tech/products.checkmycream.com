      <li>I can put my moisturizer and foundation on right over with no problems.</li>
      <li>The first one was filled to a reasonable amount.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this serum along with their eye cream.  I do see a noticeable change.  The bags under my eye have gotten a little flatter.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin too.  None of these eye creams work miracles but this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> Reduces puffy eyes overnight. I gave it 4 stars because it does not work well with eye makeup, so I use it at night.</li>
    <li> I was recently introduced to Vivo products at a hotel shop in Las Vegas. After being grabbed by the sales person and getting a mini facial I was ready to buy the entire product line - until he gave me the price.  He gave me some samples to take with me that I used for about a week and a half after coming home, I noticed the difference more after going back to my usual moisturizer. My skin was so much softer and smother using the Vivo Per Lei. The eye serum was the item I really wanted because this is my problem area (crow&#x27;s feet and bags) I cannot wait until my order arrives.  I was so excited to find this on Amazon at such a great price!</li>
    <li> There was considerably less than one ounce in the jar, and I had bought 3 as Valentine&#x27;s gifts! Really feel cheated. Is there any quality assurance on this product. The box says made in Japan, but manufactured in California?</li>
    <li> I really like the way this serum makes the puffiness go away.  I put it on, iron my clothes and then I continue with my makeup.  I&#x27;ve had several jars.  Does it totally eliminate my wrinkles? No.  Does it make them look a lot better that before, yes.  I&#x27;d recommend this product and you can&#x27;t argue with the price.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, but very good skin product.</li>
    <li> I wonder about all these great reviews of this product.  I have used it about 9 days and it has made my eyes look terrible.  The dark circles every morning which I didn&#x27;t have before made my eyes look very tired and any little bit of wrinkles on my eyes have not softened a bit.  I don&#x27;t understand why its not working but it&#x27;s not at all!!!!  I don&#x27;t understand what makes me different from everyone else, but it must be something.</li>
    <li> I received my eye serum today and there was only a tiny bit in the bottom of the container. It looks used!</li>
    <li> i am not sure it this serum worked for me or not. i do not feel the differences...hmmm.. i guess it was ok..</li>
    <li> I have just received the eye serum.  I am going to start using it today.  I look forward to removing fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product according to the reviews and thought I would try it. When it arrived it did not look like the pictures at all, it was in a short jar not a long cylinder. It was also oozing out of the container which left about a third of it left in the jar. Sent it back!!!</li>
    <li> I use Vivo Pei Anti-Aging Eye Serum under my eye area where I have a tendency to have puffiness.  It works wonders.  I put it on the puffy area and wait about 5 minutes before putting on my make-up.  For me, it takes the puffiness away.  I&#x27;ve used other products from department store counters, quite expensive ones, I might add; but I find this one to do the job that others claim they will do but don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I wouldnt give any Stars but I had to,  this product was not NEW! There is barely any product inside of this container. .. it is apparent the product had been used or it had been taken out</li>
    <li> goes on ok, no signs of diminishing eye lines.</li>
    <li> Got it fast and it was as described.  It was way cheaper than at the mall.  Not sure if it works yet but seems to make skin firmer.</li>
    <li> After 3 uses, my bags were diminishing and you can feel it lifting the eyes.  Wrinkles appear to be less.  I only use it at night.  Great product and the price at Amazon amazing!</li>
    <li> I did not receive the product as pictured.  The picture showed a bottle with pump top; I received jars.  I feel product was&lt;br /&gt;misrepresented.  I would not buy this eye serum again - nor would I recommend to anyone.  I don&#x27;t think eye serum really&lt;br /&gt;made any difference for the eye area.</li>
    <li> This is said to be a firming serum, and it appears that it is, however, it isn&#x27;t the miracle that will eliminate under eye puffiness.  It leaves a nice finish on the skin and there is no problem applying makeup over.  The jury is still out on its effectiveness, but I would consider purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> While this may not be a miracle product that makes me look 20 years younger, I can  see a difference for several hours after I use it.  The skin under my eyes looks smoother, and the wrinkles are less pronounced.  It dries to a smooth finish, so it can be applied along the brow bone without interfering with makeup application.  I have bought and used a much more expensive serum, and this seems to work just as well as that one and better than others I have tried.  I will continue to use Vivo Per Lei as long as the price is this reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now since I received it. It has not been a month yet but so far I like how it makes the skin around my eyes feel. You don&#x27;t have to use that much. It seems to have taken away my dark circles but as soon as you stop using it the circles come back? That could just be me? During the day if my eyes start to feel dry I will use it and they feel so good after applying. I will keep using this product and see what other results happen. So far I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like it quite much. it can be absorbed quite well. and it doesn&#x27;t feel thick or heavy. the packaging is a bit out of old-designed. but this doesn&#x27;t affect the product itself.</li>
    <li> I am currently using this product every morning under my makeup.  It dries quickly so it doesn&#x27;t gunk up the makeup.  I have been using it for a month now and someone recently asked me what foundation I was wearing and I wasn&#x27;t wearing anything!  They told me my skin looked radiant and clear and it truly does.  I am using the Vivo Per Lei Day Cream, Night Cream, and Facial Peel.  I have been using the day cream for 6 months and recently incorporated the others.  Truly great results.  I will be 33 next week and my skin was looking dull, lifeless, ashen, and I had fine lines under my eyes.  Now, I can look at a picture of myself from 15 years ago and my skin looks more like the picture!  I will ALWAYS use Vivo Per Lei.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Eh, I like the premier eye cream better in the green container. I seemed to get instant results with the other stuff. The Vivo also came in a tall clear squirting bottle with pump. Not like the one pictured here.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I ordered vivo eye serum. However I always ordered it in a pump. When I ordered it this time the picture showed pump but twice I received a pot instead. The first time I send it back not only because it wasnt pump but I got cream instead. It still seems to be a problem that the picture is the pump but you receive a pot of it. So I just kept it and gave up. Dont know if its amazons fault or company. Would be nice to resolve this.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!</li>
    <li> The packaging may change, but the product is a great buy!  Diminishes fines lines with continued use.  I use this every morning after cleansing and before any makeup.  Been using for years.  Will continue to purchase online at great prices.</li>
    <li> I was pretty unhappy with this eye serum.  First, when it arrived, the jar was more than half empty.  I think water is one of the main ingredients, so it must evaporate out.  That would be fine if the concentrated gel that remains was really good, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be.  The thing I like the least is that it stays sticky and wet looking around my eyes.  If I put concealer around my eyes, it beads up because of the gel under it.  Overall, I haven&#x27;t been too happy with the Vivo Per Lei products.</li>
    <li> have not used it enough to give a decent review</li>
    <li> Very effective . Does surpass my wife&#x27;s expectations and will want to order again when needed. this is a very good product.</li>
    <li> There was something wrong with the packaging and I only received a small amount of the product in the bottom of the jar.  Too much money for too little product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this one yet.  I believe that the serum removes the moisture from under my eyes that creates those aging sacs under my eyes.  I&#x27;m wondering if it is too drying for that thin skinned area.  The judge is still out on this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Gave it away to my Mom because she usually loves what I only think is alright, but she said the same thing, it&#x27;s okay. Nothing different and non-irritating.</li>
    <li> This product is not as pictured. Itt comes in a pump, and is a very thin fluid. Definitely not a cream. Not my favorite of this line.</li>
    <li> It is Karen that used this product not Roger and would recommend this product to you and around the eye area the skin is thinner, so it needs that special care.</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed any change in the lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ve used this for long enough (about 7 weeks now) so maybe it&#x27;s a great product, but in the time I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve noticed no difference.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have fine lines in the crow&#x27;s feet area and this serum erased them! I didn&#x27;t find it to be a rich moisturizer so if you are looking for extra moisture, you may want to use another product on top of it.</li>
    <li> I first tried it at local mall. I did like the change I was able to see. I have been using it for about 3 weeks. I would recommend all their products</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to find a cheaper alternative to the Oro gold eye serum. It was a waste of money. There is no detectable effect of this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks. It dries out the skin around my eyes, and in no way produces any kind of cosmetic improvement. I don&#x27;t reccomend it.</li>
    <li> Did not work as advertised.  Tried this product in Las Vegas and when it was put around my eye, within minutes there was results.  This product could be under my eyes for hours and no effects.  Probably replaced product with generic.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Use partnered w/ Intensive Eye Treatment and you will see it work!! I noticed a difference within 3days! I kid you not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just wanted to try this as someone told me it was good for them.  I like it but it is just an eye cream.</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift for friends, it is a quality brand with significant results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is packaged well even without gift options and serves as a very economically efficient present</li>
    <li> My first time using this product....it really works.  After a couple of days I was noticing the reduction of lines underneath my eyes.  Not only do I use it around my eyes but also where I notice facial expression lines.  Love this product</li>
    <li> very good  very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very goodvery good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good I have been using this product now since I received it.

    <li> I notice some changes but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see drastic changes!</li>
    <li> It is good deal and volume. Nicely packed as well.&lt;br /&gt;normally eye lotion/cream is so expensive and small in size.</li>
    <li> I just got this today and i absolutely love it! I got this serum  to go with moisturizing day cream that my best friend got me hooked on in one night. The skin around my eyes have never been so soft and smooth. Its like it fills in the fine lines. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my puffiness or dark circles but because it make the skin so soft and smooth i have no doubt i will no longer have problems covering up those nasty little annoyances.I highly would recommend this product and i have no doubt my makeup will look amazingly over the serum.</li>
    <li> I ordered this by mistake..I wanted the other liquied eye serum..I use this at night and the liquied serum in the day...&lt;br /&gt;It works for me...</li>
    <li> I use this product not only around my eyes, but also on my forhead, cheeks, and around mouth.  It works almost instantly, and I have received great compliments from co-workers, friends and family.  No one knows what my secret is, and I am not telling!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using this product. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feel when I put it on. It has helped with dark circles and fine lines a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> My daughter (under 5) initially was upset with the picture of the early piece, the lion.  But over time, she&#x27;s grown accustomed to the picture and the accompanying narrative - enough so that she frequently listens to both the narrative &amp; music, then music alone, at bed time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly a winner, just requiring some discussion /explanation of the story line to assure her through her jumpy phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly suggest parents at least give this a thought if their little one(s) like orchestral music, simple rhymes and the like.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected.  The Neutrogena eye product was better.  I was looking for the eye serum that the mall guy tried on me.  I like the vivo facial scrub, however, can&#x27;t find what he used for the eye lines and dark circles???</li>
    <li> Not as good as it was advertized</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to this product and to me it seems very thick - almost like a gel - still not sure if I&#x27;m keeping it or not - I love the Per Lei line and I have many other products - but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in this one!</li>
    <li> Nice a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this eye serum. It&#x27;s very sticky and takes a while to absorb into your skin. Once absorbed I really haven&#x27;t noticed a huge different. I am going to stick with this product because I haven&#x27;t been disappointed in a Vivo product yet!</li>
    <li> no effect …. trail period ends here!</li>
    <li> Love this product line. have used it before and will continue to buy this product in the future.  this product nongreasy</li>
    <li> I bought this one because I have hereditary under eye circles, and I was noticing that the skin around my eyes were a bit dry, this is a good moisturizer for that area I saw the difference in just a couple a weeks, the dark circles are a bit clearer , but I know that is going no where, but since they&#x27;re clearer I can cover them up now with a concealer. no biggie there, so far a good product and well price as well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an inexpensive eye product to replace my Orogold eye serum and think I&#x27;ve found it! It is a clear eye gel that stays where its put so moisturizes without irritating my eyes.</li>
    <li> Got a great deal on this when I bought it, which is the only reason I was able to try it. Loved it. Wish I could afford it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I can tell as soon as I put this on my face freezes just like when I had botox several years ago.  I put it on for my husband&#x27;s Company Christmas party and it stayed perfect all evening long.  Just in the past few weeks I have noticed that the one wrinkle I have on my brow is completely gone and the crowsfeet are getting more plumped up everyday.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I first was introduced to the day face cream when I visited Hawaii - I thought it was a fake - but I truley love the day face cream that that&#x27;s why I tried the Eye serum - great stuff - love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks now and like it.  I&#x27;m not sure it does everything for me that others have written.  I do like the feel of it, not greasy though once I may have put too much on and felt sticky.  I do feel that it is helping the creases under my eyes.  I also have the body butter which I really love as well as the face cream, also really love.    I&#x27;m changing my rating down one star due to ordering a second jar and being disappointment in the amount.  I just sent it back.  The first one was filled to a reasonable amount.  This second jar is less than a 1/4 full.  I just sent it back.  Since the first jar wasn&#x27;t this low I know it&#x27;s not supposed to be so little in the jar.  I&#x27;ll try one more time as I know more comes in the jar and I really do like the stuff.</li>
    <li> The product was only half full.  That was disappointing.</li>
    <li> I Love this stuff and I&#x27;m almost 50 and don&#x27;t look it at all! It&#x27;s this serum and the intense cream, also the facial peel! Very Good Service and FAST! I believe they were 4 days ahead of schedule!</li>
    <li> I really like this eye serum.  It is soothing and helps eliminate the puffness under my eyes. I definately recommend this eye serum</li>
    <li> Product looked just like the photo. No results from this eye serum</li>
    <li> Good product, great price, fast delivery, Thanks,</li>
    <li> This is my very first time to try the Vivo Per Lei Anti Aging Eye Serum, so far I have no complaints and the other Vivo Per Lei proucts are super. I&#x27;ll let you know on this as I use it for a while. Thanks again for carrying these on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum twice a day every day for 2 weeks now and while It does not magically make years of aging vanish overnight, there is a definate improvement in the fine lines around my eyes and tightening of the skin. I like that the serum is absorbed quickly and does not leave either a greasy or a sticky feel. I can put my moisturizer and foundation on right over with no problems. Will continue to use as long as I can purchase at reasonable price. I am impressed with the entire line of products.</li>
    <li> great stuff at a very nice price.</li>
    <li> The package was unsealed. The content in the jar was almost empty!</li>
    <li> This product is light, not greasy leaves eyes feeling refreshed. Unlike many other products I tried this product does not leave my eyes puffy. I can wear it alone or under makeup. I have only been using it a couple of weeks and I have already started noticing improvement in my lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This product was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I saw it for sale in Las Vegas.  I love the way it feels on my skin and I think it has made a difference in my appearance.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using it and do far I do like it.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to make a complete determination on its affects... so to be continued.</li>
    <li> This product is a good for using around the eye area.  It is not sticky and goes on very smoothly</li>
    <li> Found this item to be effective and absorbed easily. Probably better used at night. Would recommend for improving skin tone.</li>
    <li> I think this product is great, I was having some sagging problems on my eyelids&lt;br /&gt;and I began to use this product and all I can say is IT WORKS!!! I now use it&lt;br /&gt;in other areas of my face. I highly recommend it .</li>
