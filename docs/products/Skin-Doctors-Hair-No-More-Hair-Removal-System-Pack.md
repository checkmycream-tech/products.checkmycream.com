      <li>Works perfect on bikini/panty line area.</li>
      <li>The best hair remover I&#x27;ve tried today!</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!!</li>
      <li>So when I found this, I was happy.</li>
      <li>Btw, I received my package in great timely fashion.</li>
      <li>Stuff is great.</li>
      <li>Excellent products, the cream for remove the hair won&#x27;t work at all fine, but the inhibitors spray</li>
      <li>However, it does work on the fine hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
      <li>I love the spatula it comes with too!</li>
      <li>I am SO glad I found this stuff!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t much remember to use the growth inhibitor, but the remover is excellent.</li>
      <li>Nice photo though.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>shaving did much better.</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>Im sure</li>
      <li>DEF give it a try!! :)</li>
      <li>and i love it my under arms</li>
      <li>I should have known better</li>
      <li>Overall I am a very happy lady.</li>
      <li>Hopefully by the end of process I will have a greater review.</li>
      <li>Use it on my face also and works very quickly.</li>
      <li>Hair comes off easily and the product is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Everywhere else was fine.</li>
      <li>It works fine.</li>
      <li>All was fine.  </li>
      <li>HUGE difference.  </li>
      <li>its a great product just not for thin fair skin,</li>
      <li>Follow directions for time on face however as it does work quickly.</li>
      <li>Works very well on fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Still using as prescribed so far no results yet, i think i will give it more time to see if it works</li>
      <li>Just started using the product, so far so good during second week!!!!  </li>
      <li>Hair is fading and not growing as fast as before on my very first application.</li>
      <li>the first try</li>
      <li>But that could be just my genetics ;)</li>
      <li>I waited the first 3 to 5mins of application.</li>
      <li>Still debating if I will order more because it has only been two week since I started using hair removal cream.</li>
      <li>This cream is very light on the skin and it did not cause me to have burns or sores on the skin when you keep it on too long.</li>
      <li>Product was easy to use but incredibly toxic: I left it on for exactly 3 mn and the next day, had dots of blood scabs on my upper lip from where product had actually burned the skin!!  </li>
      <li>This product works very well, and I like the growth inhibitor spray.</li>
      <li>but I really see results</li>
      <li>If you are a lady looking for a solution to hair growth on your face and you happen to be like me and the hair grows in fast.</li>
      <li>Only Con is, the hair grows back sooner than expected; the inhibitor spray doesn&#x27;t work as great as I would like.</li>
      <li>only reason i gave it 2 stars is because i have super sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It also smells good, and is less messy since the cream is thicker than most other brands.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin so smooth unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Not only does it remove the hair, but I see a HUGE difference in the amount of hair growing back.</li>
      <li>I have no complaints so far!</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, do not buy this product!</li>
      <li>After use the skin is very soft and smooth excluding the few remaining strands.</li>
      <li>And as far and i can tell the spray has done nothing either.</li>
      <li>This product has helped me so much with facial hair.  </li>
      <li>I then used the hair remover for 2 minutes and it really worked to remove all my facial hair.  </li>
      <li>I used it once on my face and because my skin is sensitive got burned.</li>
      <li>This system works very well unlike the first type I used in the past (Nair).</li>
      <li>this is the only product she has used that she really likes for unwanted facial hair</li>
      <li>I use that stick on those sensitive body areas prior to Skin Doc hair removal.  </li>
      <li>However, after using it several times I have found that  it does not deliver complete hair removal as I hoped it would.</li>
      <li>You do need to rub the Hair Inhibitor Spray in until it dries, but noticed the thick hairs are much thinner and don&#x27;t have near as much hair as before.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m back to say OMG the hair growth inhibitor is worth every single penny I spent on this product.</li>

<li> and I&#x27;m back to say OMG the hair growth inhibitor is worth every single penny I spent on this product.</li>
<li> so I can&#x27;t comment on long lasting results.</li>
<li> Over all the hair doesn&#x27;t come back as thick or as fast when you use this depilatory.</li>
<li> i got this for my under arms because i have super dark and thick hair under my arms and decided to give this product a try its been 3 weeks since i used it</li>
<li> It does not completely removal all of the hair for some reason some of the hairs remain.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, &amp; even if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, at least you didn&#x27;t loose too much money.</li>
<li> The hairs are less course and grow back at a slower rate.</li>
<li> My hair usually grows back daily making for alot of work before my skincare routine.</li>
<li> Now, I will say the hair on my body did come back less &amp; less and much finer (my body hair is blonde &amp; thin already)</li>
<li> Yes, I saw the warning to test it but had tried half a dozen other depilatories without such a &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; result.  </li>
<li> The dilapatory creme works well with minimal burning.</li>
<li> dont start growing til 5day after application when usually it will be growing the next day</li>
<li> no lie and when it does grow back u can hardly see it is like peach fuss</li>
<li> and it slows the growth down</li>
<li> After reading several reviews regarding this product I was very anxious to try it.  </li>
<li> and I had black scabs everywhere.  </li>
<li> Ill get back later.</li>
<li> My face was a mess.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product its not worth anything.</li>
<li> It slowed the growth a little</li>
<li> Wasted money.</li>
<li> and i put it on everyday</li>
<li> I still had to us the tweezer to pluck a few hairs.</li>
<li> I now tweeze and wax once a week and the hair is no longer ingrowing and causing soreness because it is finer and less pigmented!</li>
<li> Not worth the money!!</li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t even bother to write reviews</li>
<li> This is not suitable for hair removal at all.</li>
<li> It was easy to use, and the smell wasn&#x27;t horrible at all.  </li>
<li> my hair is really thick.</li>
<li> But I have thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t work so well.  </li>
<li> As an anecdotal observation it also soothed my poor irritated skin.</li>
<li> but i still get thick hairs comming threw ill</li>
<li> see up to 6 months if all the hair is going to thin out...</li>
<li> I then used the inhibitor and it burned like crazy.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> too bad can&#x27;t get in US&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> After four applications, it didn&#x27;t remove chin hair let alone keep it away. Wasted money. I should have known better</li>
    <li> Still using as prescribed so far no results yet, i think i will give it more time to see if it works</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews regarding this product I was very anxious to try it.  However, after using it several times I have found that  it does not deliver complete hair removal as I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> i know the cream definately works ... but i havnt seen any results for the inhibitor yet tho.. will update the review if it happens</li>
    <li> This is not suitable for hair removal at all. I waited the first 3 to 5mins of application. Then I went on for further, but I found that hair was not gone by the end of 12mins even.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely unsatisfied customer.</li>
    <li> If any one remember the product NAIR which was for hair removal on your legs. This product smells the same. I have already used the product, but don&#x27;t like the smell and it really only removes the hair for one day and then it&#x27;s stubble again. You have to use a lot of it also.  I used it on my chin. Not worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Stuff is great. I don&#x27;t much remember to use the growth inhibitor, but the remover is excellent. Works perfect on bikini/panty line area. Use it on my face also and works very quickly. Follow directions for time on face however as it does work quickly.</li>
    <li> It was easy to use, and the smell wasn&#x27;t horrible at all.  Yes, it didn&#x27;t stop, weaken, or control my hair growth.  Nice photo though.</li>
    <li> While this product did remove hairs after use, the hair seems to grow back faster, thicker, and longer.  If you want something that you do not have to use often, this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> It simply does what it says it&#x27;s going to do! It works! The best hair remover I&#x27;ve tried today! Try it today</li>
    <li> bought for my daughter. this is the only product she has used that she really likes for unwanted facial hair</li>
    <li> Followed the instructions perfectly but it doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product its not worth anything. All it does is makes your skin smell bad.</li>
    <li> I like this product, used it for over a year now. Hair comes off easily and the product is easy to apply. Only Con is, the hair grows back sooner than expected; the inhibitor spray doesn&#x27;t work as great as I would like. But that could be just my genetics ;)</li>
    <li> It works fine. Ive been using it for about 3 months now and i put it on everyday and it slows the growth down but i still get thick hairs comming threw ill see up to 6 months if all the hair is going to thin out...</li>
    <li> I got the product on time, but the product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Works very well on fine hair.  But I have thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t work so well.  However, it does work on the fine hair perfectly.</li>
    <li> It does not work. All it did was burn and the hair just came back darker than before. You might as well bite the bullet and wax.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!! i got this for my under arms because i have super dark and thick hair under my arms and decided to give this product a try its been 3 weeks since i used it and i love it my under arms dont start growing til 5day after application when usually it will be growing the next day no lie and when it does grow back u can hardly see it is like peach fuss i love it i give it another month and i dont think i will ever have shave again</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have used cream type facial hair removal product. This system works very well unlike the first type I used in the past (Nair). This cream is very light on the skin and it did not cause me to have burns or sores on the skin when you keep it on too long. It does not completely removal all of the hair for some reason some of the hairs remain. I still had to us the tweezer to pluck a few hairs. The hairs are less course and grow back at a slower rate. After use the skin is very soft and smooth excluding the few remaining strands. Still debating if I will order more because it has only been two week since I started using hair removal cream.</li>
    <li> I used it once on my face and because my skin is sensitive got burned. I.didn&#x27;t even leave it on the time i was supposed to. How do you do a test on your arm for your face before hand? Im sure its a great product just not for thin fair skin,</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I gave my rating on this product but I really see results and I&#x27;m very pleased.  Hair is fading and not growing as fast as before on my very first application.</li>
    <li> Good&lt;br /&gt;But not for the acne screen</li>
    <li> This product works very well, and I like the growth inhibitor spray. I wish they sold the cream separately though. Over all the hair doesn&#x27;t come back as thick or as fast when you use this depilatory. It also smells good, and is less messy since the cream is thicker than most other brands.</li>
    <li> my hair is really thick. this did nothing! shaving did much better. only reason i gave it 2 stars is because i have super sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all....but it also didn&#x27;t take any hair off. the first try i followed the directions, and the second time i left it on my legs for an extra 8 minutes, still nothing. i ended it having to wipe the cream all off my legs and shaving. And as far and i can tell the spray has done nothing either. DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> Product was easy to use but incredibly toxic: I left it on for exactly 3 mn and the next day, had dots of blood scabs on my upper lip from where product had actually burned the skin!!  Yes, I saw the warning to test it but had tried half a dozen other depilatories without such a &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; result.  If you have sensitive skin, do not buy this product!</li>
    <li> Just started using the product, so far so good during second week!!!!  Hopefully by the end of process I will have a greater review.</li>
    <li> Excellent products, the cream for remove the hair won&#x27;t work at all fine, but the inhibitors spray it is wonderful</li>
    <li> I just started using the hair removal cream and inhibitor spray so I can&#x27;t comment on long lasting results. In the meantime, I can say the cream works wonderfully. It leaves my skin so smooth unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using it and I would definitely recommend it. Hopefully, the inhibitor works but I know it takes time to see results! But for now, I&#x27;d say, go for it! Btw, I received my package in great timely fashion. I have no complaints so far! I usually don&#x27;t even bother to write reviews but I was impressed with the cream!</li>
    <li> I did the skin test for 24 hours as per directions.  All was fine.  I then used the hair remover for 2 minutes and it really worked to remove all my facial hair.  I then used the inhibitor and it burned like crazy.  I immediately washed it off, however, my face turned red like burns and I had black scabs everywhere.  My friends thought I had skin cancer removed.  My face was a mess.  JRL</li>
    <li> It slowed the growth a little but I still need time to fully give a judgement. Ill get back later.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Just gave me a rash.</li>
    <li> I am SO glad I found this stuff! I&#x27;ll just briefly tell you my hair removal venture, briefly bc I know we all don&#x27;t have all day to read these things. I was using Revitol/Dermology, and looking for a cheaper replacement bc it had been well over a year &amp; I still had the majority of my hair growing back. Also, they changed their formula and it burned my face! Everywhere else was fine. Now, I will say the hair on my body did come back less &amp; less and much finer (my body hair is blonde &amp; thin already) but I still had to keep removing it. Rev &amp; Derm don&#x27;t come with the spray to help stop the hair from growing back.  So when I found this, I was happy. Then I used it and was OVERJOYED!  I love the spatula it comes with too! Not only does it remove the hair, but I see a HUGE difference in the amount of hair growing back. HUGE difference.  Haven&#x27;t tried it on my face yet bc I found &amp; like the Olay facial hair removal kit that comes with a pre-removal balm you put on 1st.  I use that stick on those sensitive body areas prior to Skin Doc hair removal.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, &amp; even if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, at least you didn&#x27;t loose too much money. DEF give it a try!! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 days now. I purchased it for the hair growth inhibitor spray and, it works great! My hair usually grows back daily making for alot of work before my skincare routine. This stuff instantly slowed the growth by 2 days which I personally feel is a miracle. As an anecdotal observation it also soothed my poor irritated skin. The dilapatory creme works well with minimal burning. Overall I am a very happy lady. Give this a try&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so it&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I wrote this review and I&#x27;m back to say OMG the hair growth inhibitor is worth every single penny I spent on this product. I now tweeze and wax once a week and the hair is no longer ingrowing and causing soreness because it is finer and less pigmented! Even if it doesn&#x27;t permanently stop the hair from coming back I&#x27;m satisfied. If you are a lady looking for a solution to hair growth on your face and you happen to be like me and the hair grows in fast. BUY this I will :D</li>
    <li> This product has helped me so much with facial hair.  You do need to rub the Hair Inhibitor Spray in until it dries, but noticed the thick hairs are much thinner and don&#x27;t have near as much hair as before.</li>
