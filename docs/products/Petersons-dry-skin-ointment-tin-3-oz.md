      <li>The ointment has a very burned smell, like heavy sulfur, and once I opened the new container, it has turned a dark yellow on top.</li>
      <li>It may be old fashioned, but it is a medicine that is current as today for it&#x27;s benefits.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have ordered this product multiple times for my husband. His fingers crack and split.  He uses it on a regular basis.  Of course, we have used it for other things, but his hands have been the primary use.  It may be old fashioned, but it is a medicine that is current as today for it&#x27;s benefits.</li>
    <li> Peterson&#x27;s ointment has been a household item for as long as I can remember. Whenever we got a sore or an infection, Mom would treat it with Peterson&#x27;s Ointment and the sore would heal with no pain involved. Gets rid of infection practically overnight.</li>
    <li> When I was 10 my mother burned herself fairly bad.  The pharmacist suggested she use Peterson&#x27;s Ointment to help her heal.  Her burns healed very fast so she decided to use it for cuts, bug bites, etc., and that was just the beginning.  I was brought up using this product so when I was running out of it I went to my pharmacy.  When I could not find it on the shelf I asked the pharmacist &amp; after checking he told me he could not get it &amp; I was devistated.  After checking with three more pharmacies I was told the same &amp; I felt lost.  I have tried other products &amp; have been very unhappy with them.  I finally decided to check on-line &amp; when I found Peterson&#x27;s Ointment I swear I heard the sound of fireworks going off.  I am 69 years old and feel great that I again have the best all-in- one product in my medicine chest.</li>
    <li> We have used this ointment in our family for generations. We have a family saying, &amp;#34;Peterson&#x27;s Ointment will cure just about anything&amp;#34;. We use it for insect bites, dry skin, scratches and scrapes etc.</li>
    <li> Women in my family have sworn by this stuff. Its a great salve for a multitude of ailments. Its mentholated so that helps soothe redness &amp; inflammation. Just don&#x27;t put it anywhere near your eyes, I learned that as a kid, haha.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff on everything from pimples to mosquito bites for the last twenty years.  This is one of medicines best kept secrets.</li>
    <li> I have used this before for just about everything.  It is especially useful for when you have rashes or bug bites.  It has been around for years but has been hard to find because most drug stores don&#x27;t carry it any longer.  Thanks to Amazon.com, which carries about everything, I was able to get it.  This is a great product to have in your medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Very good and really works. used this of, and on growing up.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I swear by it!  Few local pharmacies carry it any longer, so I was delighted to find I could buy it from Amazon.  I recommend Peterson&#x27;s as an all-around external medication for everything from sore toes to bug bites.  It is soothing and really works!</li>
    <li> I have personally used Peterson&#x27;s Ointment for over 25 years. I have found a number of uses that they do not even mention, such as Ingrown toenails. Can&#x27;t touch it due to pain, treat with Peterson&#x27; and tomorrow you will be able to extract it! It works better for Piles than the most popular brands....Insect bites, excellent treatment. During the time I was unable to find Peterson&#x27;s I made my own...it is known by the grandkids as Poppy&#x27;s Medicine. Now I am back to using Peterson&#x27;s, no longer made in Buffalo! I buy on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am very happy that Amazon has this product. I first learned about it from my Mother-in-law, and sadly she is no longer alive. I tried to find the product in retail stores but was unsuccessful This stuff is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have been using Peterson&#x27;s Ointment since I was born.  My mother and her family used it before that.  My daughters now use it and this is why I ordered 3 boxes - one for each of my daughters and one for our second home.  Used on any cut or scrape, acne, burns or blemish.  The new &#x27;miracle&#x27; lotions don&#x27;t work as well and don&#x27;t last as long as Peterson&#x27;s.  That little 3 oz. container lasts a very very long time.  It is a staple in our medicine cabinet and am proud that it will live on in our family.  Thank you !</li>
    <li> I have a small tin of this left from my mother and it was getting pretty low... so I looked for it on line and was pleasantly surprized to find the gem of a product... I use it for rashes ... bug bites... even as a drawing salve... great product... I purchased 2...</li>
    <li> I have gotten hemroids since I was a kid.  I have tried many remedies, and this miracle oitment is the only thing I have found that works every time.  It stinks and burns like fire when you first use it, but the relief is immdiate and you will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> All is well, no delay on shipment. Thank you..</li>
    <li> It is Neosporin , burn cream, itch cream, paper cut cream, dry skin, it does it all! It works! It is probably the oldest remedy on earth!</li>
    <li> Ordered for my elderly father who swears by the stuff.  Have ordered this several times and he has been satisfied.  Easy order and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR MINOR SKIN IRRITATIONS.  I HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS BUT IT IS HARD TO FIND IN A LOCAL DRUG STORE.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best.  It promotes healing.  My wife is Polish, and she puts this on every booboo.  It also works great for its intended purpose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing and using Peterson&#x27;s since the 1950&#x27;s when it was manufactured right here in Buffalo, N.Y.  My recent purchase was rather disappointing. The ointment has a very burned smell, like heavy sulfur, and once I opened the new container, it has turned a dark yellow on top. Never had this happen in 50 years. I&#x27;m wondering if they have changed the formula or ratio of ingredients from the original recipe? Probably won&#x27;t buy any more and will look for another product to take its place.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this site. A++ Fast service and just what I expected!</li>
    <li> Great product, better than anything you can get in a drugstore.</li>
    <li> This replaced  a can  I had for around 40 hears, so it lasts a long time.  Very good for drawing infection out and healing. I like it better than the umpteen newer healing creams.</li>
    <li> No kidding, this stuff is practically miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family used to joke about how my grandmother recommended this for all manner of skin problems. I had forgotten all about it when one day it popped into my head as I was trying to think of yet another product I could try to eliminate a rash. Sure enough, this cleared it up really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be fun to have the old tin package just for reminiscence sake, but I&#x27;m really happy to have found the ointment again : )</li>
    <li> Looked forever for this</li>
    <li> Thank you for finding this item.  I actually called the original store listed on the box some years back,  The gentleman said he thought he might have a few on the self.  I heard him pull the ladder and walk up.  He came back and told me he was sending his last two and that they were going out of business.  I was devastated because Peterson&#x27;s is good for blemishes, chapped lips, sunburn, wounds, you name it and Peterson&#x27;s helps the problem.  The only thing that has changed is that the consistency of the product in thinner &amp; a bit oilier.  It is not exactly as before but it is still better than most.  I am thrilled to have it.</li>
    <li> I have been use ing this product for more than 30  years  I love the product  I couldn&#x27;t get the product at Wal Mart any longer due to they no longer order the product</li>
    <li> The ointment had brown spots on the top and there was no expiration date on the container.</li>
    <li> Excellent for cuts, abrasions, chaffing etc.</li>
    <li> This a good product.  It was in our household as long as I could remember and it is a part of my household today.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for scraps, burns, small cuts.</li>
    <li> Great product. My mom used this for our family while I was growing up. Years later it is still in our medicine cabinet. Works well on everything!</li>
