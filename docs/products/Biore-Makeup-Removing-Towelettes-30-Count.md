      <li>It cleanses and removes makeup easily with no irritation or dryness.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t irritate my skin and they take my makeup off easily.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend easy to use and effective</li>
      <li>It did remove makeup without any drying and made my face feel clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Feels clean afterward -</li>
      <li>I am alwasy looking for something to keep my face clean and moisterized.</li>
      <li>because I do like to ensure my face is clean.  </li>
      <li>The had a nice fresh scent and one towelette will wipe off your makeup very well.  </li>
      <li>I confess to going to bed without removing makeup more often than I should, but these towelettes make it so quick and easy that I&#x27;m doing much</li>
      <li>product felt like it removed the oil quite well as well, which will be really good since the humidity is starting to roll in on NYC.</li>
      <li>I much prefer a product that is safe for contact lens wearers.  </li>
      <li>Also, the package size, which doesn&#x27;t take up much room, is convenient for home or travel use (if you are going to be traveling for more than just a weekend getaway).</li>
      <li>towelettes provide a convenient and quick way to cleanse the face.  </li>
      <li>No need to carry liquids on trips and can quickly dispose of the towelettes which lightens the luggage.  </li>
      <li>I have oily skin, I was very pleased that they left no greasy residue</li>
      <li>I can see that this is a product that I will enjoy using when on camping trips or when hiking on a hot day.</li>
      <li>towelettes themselves are strong and lightly textured for gentle \\&quot;scrubbing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The scent is very, very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Makes make up removal super easy and fast.</li>
      <li>Although I experienced a slight burning sensation when using to cleanse my eyes, it never caused any redness or drying in that area</li>
      <li>I use black eye liner and when I have used the wipes to correct any mistakes they work great, and they take off the eyeliner and mascara after too.</li>
      <li>I actually cut the towelettes into four pieces - 1/4 towelette is plenty - removes makeup (including mascara) effectively.  </li>
      <li>Good product delivered as expected.</li>
      <li>The wipes are moistened just right with a pleasant scent and one does the trick for removing all my makeup, other than mascara.</li>
      <li>It would be more functional for me - since I don&#x27;t wear full makeup every day now - to have had them individually packaged.</li>
      <li>It is important to read the information on each brand and product within the brand to assure they are what you need for your particular skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Obviously the package is light and easy to carry, and 30 towelettes last a while (the package lasted the whole month</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of these.</li>
      <li>After trying several brands to me, this one was just ok.</li>
      <li>There are many similar products on the market.</li>
      <li>These were being used side-by-side with Noxzema branded remover wipes, and the verdict was that Noxzema definitely wins out over Biore in the \\&quot;gentle cleansing\\&quot; battle.</li>
      <li>I was my face with face cleaner first, then I get any residue off with these wipes.</li>
      <li>First, the wipes hold their shape well while you&#x27;re rubbing them over your face.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t make the mistake I did and tear open the top.</li>
      <li>I have been using these for a long time and can no longer find them in any local stores - was happy to find on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I had to use every inch of both sides to wash with, and I still felt that everything was not removed, and had to use a hot washcloth.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also good for pre-teens to use on their acne trouble spots.</li>
      <li>cleanser is a bit irritating, though, especially to more sensitive skins.</li>
      <li>I was even more concerned when I realized this product is NOT marked as hypoallegenic.</li>
      <li>However, it did not completely remove my mascara as its packaging claims to remove waterproof mascara (and my mascara wasn&#x27;t even waterproof), it did however remove most of it just not all.</li>
      <li>I also experienced a slight burning or tingling sensation around the eye area only when wiping the eye to remove eye makeup and mascara.</li>
      <li>These wipes really remove makeup.</li>
      <li>fragrance is light but essentially unobtrusive.</li>
      <li>like it really cleans and helps get even stubborn eye make up off</li>
      <li>I also didn&#x27;t feel thet removed eye make up very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a guy, and don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but this product gets thumbs up from both me and my wife.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;-They really remove all of my makeup.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they can easily handle the average makeup most female and drag queens wear.</li>
      <li>She uses to clean off makeup, and to clean up the kid&#x27;s face after a messy meal.  </li>
      <li>You also don&#x27;t get a strong astringent feeling that other alcohol-based products have.</li>
      <li>Second, they leave my face feeling nice and fresh, slightly moist (i.e., not dry), with no perceptable film.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t generally have sensitivity to skin products, but these made my face red and raw feeling after using. I also didn&#x27;t feel thet removed eye make up very well. They work in a pinch, but I will be going back to the other wipes I used before trying these.</li>
    <li> These are fabulous, 30 to a pack, they remove all makeup, waterproof mascara the lot, no more bottles of cleanser that leak in your luggage if your travelling. I have tried other brand but these are the best and the price is great too.</li>
    <li> These work great and even work for most eye makeup.  It may be helpful to note that I only wear foundation on a daily basis.  I still use the same towelettes when I go all out and wear mascara and eye liner.  I sometimes use Simple eye makeup remover to make mascara removal a little easier, but after all day wear these really do the job well.  Definitely was hands after use. It leaves a funny smell on your hands and if you are unfortunate enough to forget and eat something, you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love these things. They leave my skin feeling refreshed and cleaned. I was my face with face cleaner first, then I get any residue off with these wipes. They are wonderful.</li>
    <li> I do like the Biore cleaning cloths. Have used others but still come back to these all the time now.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a long time and can no longer find them in any local stores - was happy to find on Amazon.  I actually cut the towelettes into four pieces - 1/4 towelette is plenty - removes makeup (including mascara) effectively.  I have very sensitive skin and have trouble with a lot of products because of allergies.  Great price - great product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for \\&quot;a friend,\\&quot; but she and I had a falling-out before she told me what she thought of it (but NOT before she told me what she thought of me). So I tried using it myself to get some idea of its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so I tried it on a gummed-up old carburettor I was rebuilding. A couple of towelettes easily removed fifty years of thick, stinky varnish that once upon a time was gasoline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which simply makes me wonder, once again, what exactly it IS that women put on their faces, and why?</li>
    <li> The package was in terrible shape, looked very old and faded. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, this one was a bad pack</li>
    <li> Best makeup towel for men.  No scents.  Just good for washing face without water.</li>
    <li> Good product delivered as expected.</li>
    <li> Biore Makeup Removing Towelettes are non-irritating and do not sting but sometimes you have to use a bit of pressure and time to get off all of your make up.  There are 30 towelettes in the package which is convenient. [Review assisted by my 17 year old daughter]</li>
    <li> I tested this towelette while wearing a full face of makeup, including black eyeliner, black mascara and foundation. I had to use every inch of both sides to wash with, and I still felt that everything was not removed, and had to use a hot washcloth. Also my face felt scratched up after using it.</li>
    <li> ...but it wasn&#x27;t able to remove all of my water-proof mascara (I use [[ASIN:B004JB6R26 Wet n Wild]]) as the product description claimed (even with several passes), so I still ended up with a bit of Alice Cooper eyes. However, it removed all my other layers of foundation, etc with just one pass, and it didn&#x27;t leave any residue behind. Also, the package size, which doesn&#x27;t take up much room, is convenient for home or travel use (if you are going to be traveling for more than just a weekend getaway).</li>
    <li> I use black eye liner and when I have used the wipes to correct any mistakes they work great, and they take off the eyeliner and mascara after too. I highly recommend easy to use and effective</li>
    <li> My wife took these on a trip to southeast Asia and she reports back that they were a sort of minor lifesaver. She toured in some out of the way areas and she made extensive use of these towelettes, not just for removing makeup, but for general freshening up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the package is light and easy to carry, and 30 towelettes last a while (the package lasted the whole month she was away).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, not everyone is going to go to southeast Asia for a month, but just about everyone is on the move at times, and that&#x27;s a good time to carry this package along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did not report any downsides so I go with a five-star rating for usability and practicality while away from home.</li>
    <li> Makeup clothes are makeup cloths, these work fine for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried many of these products as they are wonderful for travel.  No need to carry liquids on trips and can quickly dispose of the towelettes which lightens the luggage.  Love using them when traveling.  It is important to read the information on each brand and product within the brand to assure they are what you need for your particular skin.  This was a bit harsh for my very sensitive skin, hence the 4 star.  However, it is a good product for the right skin.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so I didn&#x27;t have the issues that a few other reviewers did.  My face did tingle after using, but in a pleasant way that felt refreshing.  In a similar vein, after I cleanse my face I moisturize, so I did not notice this product drying out my face.  This was true even when I waited a little bit before moisturizing just to see how my face felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other facial wipes, and this product seems to remove make-up with less effort - and without having to use several wipes before feeling like your face is clean.  I did use 2 wipes, typically, because I do like to ensure my face is clean.  I keep these on my bedside table, and they are a quick/easy way to cleanse and revitalize my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light but essentially unobtrusive.</li>
    <li> These towelettes are good at what they do. Even thicker stage-style makeup gets removed pretty well (though you&#x27;ll likely go through several in one go). And the towelettes are a nice thickness -- no tearing, and both sides can be used without too much bleed-through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is a bit irritating, though, especially to more sensitive skins. These were being used side-by-side with Noxzema branded remover wipes, and the verdict was that Noxzema definitely wins out over Biore in the \\&quot;gentle cleansing\\&quot; battle.</li>
    <li> Best Makeup wipes out there</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an older woman with mixed skin, and probably I don&#x27;t wear enough make-up for these towelettes. I like the idea of a pre-moistened cleaner, but probably I need a gentler product. They&#x27;d probably work better for someone with more oil in their skin.</li>
    <li> WHich knocks my review down to four stars, instea of five. Although the package is supposed to reseal tightly, it doesn&#x27;t actually, which means that once opened, the towelettes must be used within a short time. It would be more functional for me - since I don&#x27;t wear full makeup every day now - to have had them individually packaged. That would make them much easier and simpler to use when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise; good sturdy towelette, does excellent job of removing all makeup without scraping your face raw. The scent is very slight but not unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin, and these towelettes work great for my skin. It helps remove makeup and leaves your skin feeling moisturized. I dont always soap my face after using these. I sometimes rinse my face with water after using these to get the extra moisturizer off, and my skin remains squeaky clean and acne-free till the next day.</li>
    <li> These towelettes come in a package that does not close. I used a clip to keep it closed so that the towelettes would stay wet. The smell is fresh and the surface of the towelette is great. But it has a little rubbing effect on the face and feels like rubbing with a wet paper. Also it absorbs probably 75% of the make up but not all. It does not leave an oily residue. I would probably continue using my hydrophilic oil that removes make up without drying the face.</li>
    <li> I really love these makeup remover wipes. They get my eyeliner and mascara off with ease.</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose.  You have to use at least two in order to remove all of the makeup.  Sometimes it burns my eyes because I use waterproof mascara and it doesn&#x27;t want to come off.  Then I look like I have black eyes.  These are great for traveling and when I am tired and do not want to spend the extra minute to properly wash my face before sleeping.</li>
    <li> These wipes really remove makeup. I often have a lot of mascara left after washing my face and get annoyed by eye remover. So after washing, I use these wipes to get the extra makeup off. Works great and my skin feels smooth after. I do have sensitive skin (acne prone) and haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions despite the wipes containing fragrance and parabens. If you&#x27;re looking for 100% eco product this isn&#x27;t it, but it works great in taking off makeup and cleaning skin.</li>
    <li> I have reviewed three or four types of facial wipes here, and have tried a couple of others that I haven&#x27;t bothered to review. For the most part, they&#x27;re all the same - the wipes aren&#x27;t sturdy enough, so they ball up when you&#x27;re using them (like a wet Kleenex), and they leave a film on my face. These Biore wipes are a vastly better product. First, the wipes hold their shape well while you&#x27;re rubbing them over your face. Second, they leave my face feeling nice and fresh, slightly moist (i.e., not dry), with no perceptable film. I&#x27;m very pleased. I have been trying to find a facial wipe that I like for a long time, and I finally have. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of these.</li>
    <li> I try a lot of these and this one is a favorite. It cleanses and removes makeup easily with no irritation or dryness.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using these for years for nightly face cleansing and makeup removal. They&#x27;re great for when you don&#x27;t have time to use soap and water and can remove sunscreen, sweat, etc. and leave your face feeling refreshed. They&#x27;re also good for pre-teens to use on their acne trouble spots. You also don&#x27;t get a strong astringent feeling that other alcohol-based products have. I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> My wife says they work but burn her skin.. Wont be buying them again.</li>
    <li> Makeup Towelettes are a commodity at this point, so I&#x27;m just going to do a relative comparison:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;Feels like it really cleans and helps get even stubborn eye make up off&lt;br /&gt;Feels clean afterward - no residue left&lt;br /&gt;Thick towels - one gets the job done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;Pretty rough. It kinda hurts to get the eye makeup off.</li>
    <li> These wipes are a good size. They are soft and gentle. Makes make up removal super easy and fast. These are great to have in a gym bag or for use before bed.</li>
    <li> I confess to going to bed without removing makeup more often than I should, but these towelettes make it so quick and easy that I&#x27;m doing much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-They really remove all of my makeup. Even stubborn eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Because I have oily skin, I was very pleased that they left no greasy residue and my face felt truly clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The towelettes themselves are strong and lightly textured for gentle \\&quot;scrubbing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The scent is very, very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret was licking my lips a little while after use.  The taste the towelette left was none too pleasant!</li>
    <li> My wife gave me the feedback for this review since this product falls within her purview. She has naturally good skin, doesn&#x27;t wear heavy makeup, and is a reasonable professional with a JD behind her name and not an actress or something like that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said that if the packaging were such that it would give the opened package a longer life she would have given it FIVE STARS. [Or, if the towelettes were individually sealed]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These [6\\&quot; x 7.3\\&quot;] towelettes provide a convenient and quick way to cleanse the face.  Each towelette is large enough to cleanse the entire face.  They do have a light fragrance that gives them a \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; (as opposed to a strong perfume-like) smell.  Unless you have an acute allergy or aversion to any fragrance, it is unlikely that you would find the fragrance offensive.  They come in a resealable package, but the seal is not air tight, hence the instruction on the package - \\&quot;Best if used within 40 days after opening\\&quot;.  This should not be a problem if the towelettes are being used on a daily basis because there are 30 in the package.  I can see that this is a product that I will enjoy using when on camping trips or when hiking on a hot day. I will probably put a couple of them into a small ziplock bag for those purposes.</li>
    <li> These are simply wonderful to have on hand to remove makeup and are very easy to use.  The only thing I&#x27;ve found wanting is that they are a bit tricky to just get one out of the package and tend to come out multiples at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup seems to come off quite easily but it does take two wipes at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are also super handy when traveling!!!  I love being able to toss these in a carry on since they don&#x27;t have to fulfill a liquid requirement.</li>
    <li> The scent and feel is really nice and clean. Though of course stupid me didn&#x27;t realize that there was a flap on the front/back panels that allows to open and keep moisture in so don&#x27;t make the mistake I did and tear open the top. I fixed the problem by taping up the rip though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product felt like it removed the oil quite well as well, which will be really good since the humidity is starting to roll in on NYC. The extent of makeup I wear is maybe a dot of some coverup for some blemishes and scars that I&#x27;m waiting to heal and these hefty towelettes more than do their job. I&#x27;m sure they can easily handle the average makeup most female and drag queens wear.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitate to try this product. I have extremely sensitive skin, especially on my face. I was even more concerned when I realized this product is NOT marked as hypoallegenic. I was running very low on my existing towellettes, so I decided to give this a try. As soon as I used wipe on my face, it felt like my face was on fire. There was a major burning sensation. I also felt like it really dried out my face. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be using this product again. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, this product might be great for you. But if you do, take my advice and skip this product.</li>
    <li> I first tested these towelettes on the year&#x27;s ultimate make-up removing day - after a Mardi Gras celebration. Though I was wearing multi-coloured eye make-up, and had face painting plus glitter, the Biore product removed the lot! It assuredly is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for make-up removal, and it causes no irritation of the skin.</li>
    <li> I received this Biore&#x27; makeup removing towelettes through the amazon on the vine program. After trying several brands to me, this one was just ok. The wipes are moistened just right with a pleasant scent and one does the trick for removing all my makeup, other than mascara. It did remove makeup without any drying and made my face feel clean. However, it did not completely remove my mascara as its packaging claims to remove waterproof mascara (and my mascara wasn&#x27;t even waterproof), it did however remove most of it just not all. I also experienced a slight burning or tingling sensation around the eye area only when wiping the eye to remove eye makeup and mascara. Although I experienced a slight burning sensation when using to cleanse my eyes, it never caused any redness or drying in that area and I thought it may be due to my moisturizer which has retinol in it. All in all they are an ok choice but in my opinion I have had better.</li>
    <li> I received this product from the Vine Program and was very pleased with it.  These towelettes come in a heavy plastic bag.  The were very moist but not dripping wet.  The had a nice fresh scent and one towelette will wipe off your makeup very well.  I don&#x27;t use heavy makeup but wanted an easy way to wipe my face before retiring.  They also work well in the morning to freshen my face before I add a small amount of creme makeup.  I had a plastic container with a close fitting lid and towlettes fit in so they would stay moist.  You could add a small amount of water when you feel they are getting dry. These should last you a month if you use just for removing makeup as they come 30 to a package.  If you use a face scrub after removing your makeup these work well in freshen your face.  At my age of 87 I am alwasy looking for something to keep my face clean and moisterized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but this product gets thumbs up from both me and my wife.  She uses to clean off makeup, and to clean up the kid&#x27;s face after a messy meal.  I use them to clean up my face, and even though I don&#x27;t wear makeup, it does a great job of cleaning off dirt and oils.  Good product to have by the sink, very gently, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin, pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> You need at least 2 towelettes, still need to wash your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit it: I&#x27;m lazy when it comes to makeup removal. If I don&#x27;t have makeup-removing wipes, then chances are my makeup will stay on my face overnight. It&#x27;s terrible, but it&#x27;s true. So I jumped at the chance to try this Biore product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as makeup wipes go, these are pretty standard (not a bad thing--they just don&#x27;t stand out from other wipes I&#x27;ve tried). They come in a resealable package to keep them from drying out, and they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. They especially remove eye makeup well, and I like that one side of the wipe is textured. There is a slight scent, but I didn&#x27;t find it overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I like these wipes, and I would definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> These makeup removing towelettes are great. I love not having to worry about taking my makeup off at night - just grab one of these towelettes and wah-lah, makeup is gone. They don&#x27;t irritate my skin and they take my makeup off easily.</li>
    <li> There are many similar products on the market. They are all supposed to do the same thing - remove makeup thoroughly without irritation.  This product  did not remove the makeup as thoroughly as I&#x27;d hoped. I noticed that this product was rather dry and not as moist as others I have tried.  These are designed to remove eye makeup and it did remove the eye shadow, but it left a lot of mascara.The label stated that the product should not get into the eyes.  I much prefer a product that is safe for contact lens wearers.  There are much better makeup removing towelettes  on the market.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin burn and irritated my eyes</li>
