      <li>When you are hot and need a little refreshing, this is perfect!</li>
      <li>My friend loves it and in the summer she keeps it in the refrigerator for an extra cool mist of this great splash.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this in the mail that I have not stopped wearing it.  </li>
      <li>clean smelling spray</li>
      <li>The smell Is wonderful and fresh, such a classic scent for anything of day.</li>
      <li>Especially in the winter I douse my sweat shirt in it once and It smells so good for days.</li>
      <li>Miss the cool tin bottle from the 90&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>This is a very natural and refreshing and light scent that is never overpowering.</li>
      <li>I usually found this product for a relly good price but the shipping and handling costs more.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I ordered!  </li>
      <li>Fresh feel on your skin.</li>
      <li>They have discontinued this scent, but it is by far my favorite scent from Bath and Body Works.</li>

      <li>I like using Juniper Breeze because it&#x27;s scent in so fresh, natural and light.    </li>
      <li>Juniper Breeze is one of my favorite scents, but I can only find this online.</li>
      <li>The first time that I ever tried Juniper Breeze I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>Well when I first sprayed it I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
      <li>but i wish it would stood out a little more!</li>
      <li>A little more than I like to pay, but it&#x27;s worth it to me because I like the scent.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
      <li>but after I gave it a few minutes I ended up loving it and have been using it for 10 years now.</li>
      <li>You can get the same bottle on the Bath &amp; Body Works website right now for $4 a bottle.  </li>
      <li>and although I like the new ones they offer they do not compare to what scents they used to sale.</li>
      <li>Miss the old scents!</li>
      <li>this scent never gets old (for me)</li>
      <li>They have brought back their classic scents online.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic and now hard to find.</li>

Which is a plus.The body spray goes great with the lotion and anti bacterial soap.</li>
