### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Amazon has the best deals for this product.</li>
      <li>Great price for a great product !!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great scent...</li>
      <li>This brand of wax is great.  </li>
      <li>Great product, I have used it for over 40 years.</li>
      <li>nice hold!  </li>
      <li>I sport a handlebar and this may just be the best product available!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still as good as ever.</li>
      <li>Works great and blends in nicely.</li>
      <li>I guess the wax is good for some</li>
      <li>But far from perfect so I am still looking for something to fill that role.</li>
      <li>quick service  good product</li>
      <li>However, I would say the fault is more on me for not looking more closely.</li>
      <li>When it was time to order more wax I decided to try another brand.  </li>
      <li>This Moustache Wax by Clubman (Chesptnut) is far superior to the neutral that is sold!</li>
      <li>It is convenient because it is more viscous and goes on easily.</li>
      <li>worked fine</li>
      <li>I would have given a 5 star if it was organic and this cheap.</li>
      <li>I really wish it was unscented or more</li>
      <li>The neutral version is ok but makes my mustache look much more grey than it is.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>Had a nice smell but was not very user friendly.  </li>
      <li>Either way I had to go to a beauty supply store to buy the right color.</li>
      <li>Being right under my nose</li>
      <li>The primary was much like the first wax, it needed to be softened with a hair dryer,  </li>
      <li>the exception of a downpour, I can keep my &#x27;stache looking nice all day, and even after a long workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can get myself looking pretty within 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Aroma was nice but this product does not compare with the other products I tried.  </li>
      <li>no matter how little I use, doesn&#x27;t blend as easily, and it washes out too easily with water.  </li>
      <li>Timely arrival, reasonable price, Thanks!</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d better drink very carefully, as a touch of water will neutralize this.  </li>
      <li>The first wax I tried was all organic made with natural materials.  </li>
      <li>The secondary was very easy to use and really held the curled ends of my handlebar very well.  </li>
      <li>Even though we didn&#x27;t go organically like we normally do</li>
      <li>Although very cheap and shipped very quickly product was very hard and next to impossibile to squeeze out of tube.</li>
      <li>Helps keep the fly a ways down but not strong enough to mold my very straight facial hair..</li>
      <li>I typically groom my moustache with CanYouHandleBar Primary and Secondary Moustache wax, because I love the hold and flexibility.</li>
      <li>and I got natural</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, decent for a necessary refresh if if you don&#x27;t want to heat up a legit wax.</li>
      <li>I ordered the primary and secondary waxes since I am new at the handlebar thing.  </li>
      <li>The neutral wax actually accentuates the grays, makes the whole stache appear waxy and white.  </li>
      <li>this product works well a little darker than I thought but it holds my moustache in place and dose not have a funny smell like others waxes</li>
      <li>It does dry mostly clear</li>

<li> I have been sporting a handlebar mustache for about the last 4 years, and I have a long goatee.  </li>
<li> My only complaint is that it is far darker than I would have imagined from the description and packaging.  </li>
<li> It was also all natural, but had very little odor.</li>
<li> a little dab goes a long way.</li>
<li> My only complaint is I ordered chestnut</li>
<li> that means dark brown.  </li>
<li> Very dried up making me assume it must have been on the shelf for a long time.</li>
<li> The comb it comes with is too flimsy to use with my coarse mustache in conjunction with this very thick, pasty wax.</li>
<li> This wax was to hard to use and the color was not right.</li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> Has some ingredients that I am not sure what they are.  </li>
<li> Did not style well and dried very hard and stiff.  </li>
<li> The chestnut color is hard to find in drug stores.</li>
<li> but I got tired of using it</li>
<li> It is not an unpleasant scent, but it is there non-the-less.</li>

    <li> Works great and blends in nicely.</li>
    <li> This brand of wax is great.  My only complaint is that it is far darker than I would have imagined from the description and packaging.  However, I would say the fault is more on me for not looking more closely.</li>
    <li> Works well. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> See the item description?  It says \\&quot;Chestnut\\&quot; wax... that means dark brown.  They sent me Neutral... which is basically white.  I needed the Chestnut because it helps cover gray hairs in my moustache.  The neutral wax actually accentuates the grays, makes the whole stache appear waxy and white.  Unfortunately I did not find out it wasn&#x27;t what I ordered until I opened the package and used the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller should pay more attention to what product is being sold.  Maybe he ran out of Chestnut and just sent what he had on hand.  I don&#x27;t know.  Either way I had to go to a beauty supply store to buy the right color.</li>
    <li> I sport a handlebar and this may just be the best product available! I Have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this product!</li>
    <li> I typically groom my moustache with CanYouHandleBar Primary and Secondary Moustache wax, because I love the hold and flexibility. I bought the Clubman wax as a way to refresh the hold or regroom during the day without having to heat up my CYHB wax. It is convenient because it is more viscous and goes on easily. However, I do have two negatives, thus the 3 star review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Scent: It is not an unpleasant scent, but it is there non-the-less. Being right under my nose I can still smell it hours later. I really wish it was unscented or more unobtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Tacky: It is really tacky once dried, so it will catch everything. Even lint and dust from the air. It rubs off tacky as well. The wife doesn&#x27;t like kissing me only to find her upper lip is now sticky and smells like Pinaud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, decent for a necessary refresh if if you don&#x27;t want to heat up a legit wax. But far from perfect so I am still looking for something to fill that role.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and it does the job.</li>
    <li> My man loves this stuff for his mustache. Even though we didn&#x27;t go organically like we normally do but he has nothing but praises. I would have given a 5 star if it was organic and this cheap. I couldn&#x27;t complain though.</li>
    <li> Although very cheap and shipped very quickly product was very hard and next to impossibile to squeeze out of tube. Very dried up making me assume it must have been on the shelf for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have used it for over 40 years.</li>
    <li> I recently started sporting a handlebar moustache.  The first wax I tried was all organic made with natural materials.  Had a nice smell but was not very user friendly.  When it was time to order more wax I decided to try another brand.  It was also all natural, but had very little odor. I ordered the primary and secondary waxes since I am new at the handlebar thing.  The primary was much like the first wax, it needed to be softened with a hair dryer,  The secondary was very easy to use and really held the curled ends of my handlebar very well.  Then I decided to try this product.  Has some ingredients that I am not sure what they are.  Aroma was nice but this product does not compare with the other products I tried.  Did not style well and dried very hard and stiff.  Will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> this product works well a little darker than I thought but it holds my moustache in place and dose not have a funny smell like others waxes</li>
    <li> This wax is decent, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan.  It seems to go on white no matter how little I use, doesn&#x27;t blend as easily, and it washes out too easily with water.  You&#x27;d better drink very carefully, as a touch of water will neutralize this.  The comb it comes with is too flimsy to use with my coarse mustache in conjunction with this very thick, pasty wax.</li>
    <li> have used this stuff ... it&#x27;s still as good as ever. The chestnut color is hard to find in drug stores.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is I ordered chestnut and I got natural :/ I wanted it to help fill in my mustache a bit so I wanted it to be tinted. Helps keep the fly a ways down but not strong enough to mold my very straight facial hair.. Great scent...</li>
    <li> Great product. ..thanks</li>
    <li> Have Used Clubman Moustwax For45 Years.</li>
    <li> quick service  good product</li>
    <li> nice hold!  a little dab goes a long way.</li>
    <li> worked fine but I got tired of using it</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted! People do not seem to believe in this product any longer, and that is a shame. Timely arrival, reasonable price, Thanks!</li>
    <li> The neutral version is ok but makes my mustache look much more grey than it is.  It does dry mostly clear but i prefer the tinted versions. My wife hates the smell also.  I don&#x27;t mind it personally.</li>
    <li> This wax was to hard to use and the color was not right. I guess the wax is good for some but I did not like it. It was as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have been sporting a handlebar mustache for about the last 4 years, and I have a long goatee.  I can get myself looking pretty within 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the exception of a downpour, I can keep my &#x27;stache looking nice all day, and even after a long workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chestnut is closer to a brown, and will make you look as if you have a wee bit of dooky on your fingers, so wash up well!  I will not buy this retail, ever!  Amazon has the best deals for this product.</li>
    <li> This Moustache Wax by Clubman (Chesptnut) is far superior to the neutral that is sold! There is no dandruff effect!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it. Great price for a great product !!</li>
