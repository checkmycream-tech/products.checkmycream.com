      <li>I couldn&#x27;t blame her as she loved it so much.</li>
      <li>This soap has a strong, orangy smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was pleased to see that it left a light but pleasant scent on my skin without it being overpowering.</li>

      <li>Not as big as I thought but great smell indeed.</li>
      <li>Fantastic citrus smell and a generous lather.  </li>
      <li>I just started using handmade soaps so still looking for a favorite, but this was worth the price in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Rich lather soothing and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Felt like I was squeezing fresh oranges over myself!</li>
      <li>Great for winter dry skin.</li>
      <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels clean and refreshed after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The soap is not harsh and feels nice on my skin.</li>

      <li>Good handmade soap and the fragrance is lasting.</li>
      <li>Smells EXACTLY like an Orange Crush soda!</li>
      <li>(I also like Mistral&#x27;s and Pre de Provence, but they are a bit bulky the first week or so until you whittle them &amp;#34;down to size&amp;#34;!)</li>
      <li>Smells like fresh squeezed oranges.</li>
      <li>Because it is all natural and DOES NOT produce all of that of drying lather I use more.</li>
      <li>It was a nice size and lasted longer than expected.</li>
      <li>Simple but elegant packaging.</li>
      <li>I refuse to send it back (so that it cannot be sold to others) or sell it to someone else because I the goal is for us to be healthy as a nation.</li>
      <li>I love natural products and I appreciate that this product has no icky chemicals in it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Left me feeling very clean, without the residue-y feeling of some soaps.</li>
      <li>But after a couple of weeks I am ready for a change</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so worth paying a few more bucks per bar to get real soap.</li>
      <li>Gentle on my skin.</li>
      <li>He says it really wakes him up.</li>
      <li>I really like Santa Monica soaps.</li>
      <li>Sodium hydroxide does not produce systemic toxicity, but is very CORROSIVE and can cause severe burns in all tissues that it comes in contact with.</li>
      <li>Hands down the best decision on a present I&#x27;ve made in a long time . . .she</li>
      <li>Sodium hydroxide poses a particular threat to the eyes, since it can hydrolyze protein, leading to severe eye</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>purchased this product thinking that I was receiving an all natural product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Smells EXACTLY like an Orange Crush soda!</li>
    <li> Was bought as gift in a Reddit gift exchange. The stranger seemed to like it per her comments.</li>
    <li> Smells like fresh squeezed oranges. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Yum, what a nice gift that I received. I love the smell. It is terrific. It is so citrusy and refreshing. The soap is hard and will last a lot longer than some of the soaps that I have purchased in the stores. I really do think this soap is much better than those with all the chemicals in them. I am very pleased with the size, shape and especially scent of this delicious soap. Very good product. P.S. I just ordered another bar of this delicious soap. It smells so good. My daughter talked me out of it so it now belongs to her. I let our little grandson smell it and he sniffed and tried to take a bite. It is that good. Another P.S. I had to buy another bar of this soap. The one we had disappeared after my daughter left for a visit. I couldn&#x27;t blame her as she loved it so much. One more P.S. I had to buy another one. They keep disappearing. Somebody here surely loves them besides me.</li>
    <li> Rich lather soothing and moisturizing. Great for winter dry skin. All natural cold processed to retain benefits of the oils. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking to upgrade from the soap I have been using because I know there are chemicals in it that are not good for me. I wanted to know that my soap was safe, was a good value, and was more luxurious than what I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this bar of soap and I am very happy with it. This soap has a bright citrusy scent that is very refreshing. The bar itself is nicely sized and dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to see that it left a light but pleasant scent on my skin without it being overpowering. My skin feels clean and refreshed after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap has lasted me a long time. I would guess about three times as long as the regular soap I had been using.</li>
    <li> The soap my smell good or even be good...I don&#x27;t know because I could not get past the packaging with the ingredients. Now, I specifically looked at the ingredients before I purchased and did not see the following ingredient: sodium hydroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Hydroxide is a very strong chemical that is also known as lye, soda lye, and sodium hydrate. The solid and its solutions are corrosive. Sodium hydroxide is odorless; thus, odor provides no warning of hazardous concentrations. Sodium hydroxide does not produce systemic toxicity, but is very CORROSIVE and can cause severe burns in all tissues that it comes in contact with. Sodium hydroxide poses a particular threat to the eyes, since it can hydrolyze protein, leading to severe eye damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an inorganic compound not consisting of or deriving from living matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product thinking that I was receiving an all natural product. It is not and I am extremely disappointed. I refuse to send it back (so that it cannot be sold to others) or sell it to someone else because I the goal is for us to be healthy as a nation. I will destroy this toxic product and truly encourage you to read each and every label of every product that you use on your body and that you digest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love yourself and your life!</li>
    <li> I really like Santa Monica soaps. This is the second time I have ordered from this company. This soap smells really great and leaves just a light scent on the skin. The Orange Crush is a wonderful scent. My favorite is the Cherry-Almond. It makes me happy when I shower with it!</li>
    <li> Use it on my face, really good soap.</li>
    <li> I love natural products and I appreciate that this product has no icky chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;There is something about a citrus scent in the morning that makes me feel awake, even before my morning coffee.&lt;br /&gt;The product lathers well and I love love love the scent.  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful.  I was looking for an organic and vegen Christmas gift for my coworker; this soap is just perfect</li>
    <li> This soap has the pleasant aroma I was anticipating when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the weight, I think it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is perfect to put in a gift bag with a little tissue paper. When the recipient opens it, they will immediately see the beautiful color of the soap.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have ever used. I have dry skin and not only does this soap thoroughly cleanse, when I get out of the shower my skin does not have that ashy look like when I use other soaps. And there is no residue on my skin waxy or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue is that the bar is small for the price. Because it is all natural and DOES NOT produce all of that of drying lather I use more. So until the bar gets bigger I will have to purchase this once a while as a treat for my skin. Probably in the winter when my skin is the driest.</li>
    <li> We are enjoying the soap.  Love the suds and fragrance.</li>
    <li> Received my shipment from Santa Monica Soap Co and couldn&#x27;t be any happier.  Great soap that reminded me of hand-crafted soap I would purchase every year from a soap maker in Hawaii.  Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  Definitely a great product!</li>
    <li> This was my first experience buying organic soap, and I loved it. With this particular bar, the smell was wonderful. It was a nice size and lasted longer than expected. Left me feeling very clean, without the residue-y feeling of some soaps. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Personally not a big soap guy, but my girlfriend is really big into the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; thing and wanted some nice bath stuff, so I bought her a few bars for her birthday.  Hands down the best decision on a present I&#x27;ve made in a long time . . .she loved it! (Whew!)  I&#x27;m gonna have to buy more because now I&#x27;m using it too :P</li>
    <li> I love anything citrus/orange. This soap is very mild, smells great and I love using it. Nice clean scent too.</li>
    <li> Good handmade soap and the fragrance is lasting. Emollient and lathering. All around great soap.</li>
    <li> Bought this on advice from a friend.  Could not have been more pleased!  Fantastic citrus smell and a generous lather.  Nice bar size was a pleasant bonus.  Look forward to trying their other scents!</li>
    <li> works well and smells wonderful. Love it!</li>
    <li> Nice smell, wish it lasted longer, but dissolves quickly.</li>
    <li> Really lovely in every way.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful .smells so good</li>
    <li> smells great. I have notices after the bar gets about 1/2 way gone it likes to break in two unlike other soaps I use.</li>
    <li> Very nice orange smell. Felt like I was squeezing fresh oranges over myself! Made the bathroom, and me, smell really nice, too. The bar is small enough that it is easy to handle. (I also like Mistral&#x27;s and Pre de Provence, but they are a bit bulky the first week or so until you whittle them &amp;#34;down to size&amp;#34;!) The soap is not harsh and feels nice on my skin. Lathers up nicely. One bar lasts one person two weeks. You get &amp;#34;more bang for the buck&amp;#34; with the brands I mentioned above as they last just about a month. But after a couple of weeks I am ready for a change so I didn&#x27;t mind the &amp;#34;Santa Monica&amp;#34; not lasting as long. Really liked this a lot and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great feeling soap, and smells amazing. We bought this and the Mellon and love both of them!!!!  It&#x27;s so worth paying a few more bucks per bar to get real soap.</li>
    <li> Wonderful orange scent.  This soap has lots of lather.  I&#x27;d recommend it and buy it again.</li>
    <li> Delicious,genuine orange flavor! This will not be the last purchase from this company!</li>
    <li> This soap has a strong, orangy smell. It smells wonderful! The texture is nice and my hands feel clean after using it. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Not as big as I thought but great smell indeed. The color is sort of like orange juice, not as orange and with patterns as in the picture.</li>
    <li> Has an unpleasant under scent . Would not recommend</li>
    <li> Quality product! Simple but elegant packaging. Absolutely fantastic citrusy scent! The soap bar is a decent size so it will last you a while.</li>
    <li> This is a really great smelling soap with good lather.  I just started using handmade soaps so still looking for a favorite, but this was worth the price in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Soap delivery on time. I am disappointed in the faint smell.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loves the smell of orange in the morning. He says it really wakes him up. Most soap that claims to be orange ends up smelling like some perfume my grandmother would say was &amp;#34;Old lady&amp;#34;. This soap smelled so good, and citrus first thing in the morning is the best way to fully wake up.</li>
    <li> Smells Great! Gentle on my skin. The bar stays solid , has not peeled apart.I will buy it again.</li>
