    <li> The brushes make clean lines</li>

    <li> The product is really great. We are enjoying it. The service was great. My granddaughter is very happy with the set for doing nails. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Product came exactly as described and helps with making better nail designs. Content with the product thus far on my nails.</li>
    <li> bought it for a xmas present. wide assortment of brushes to use depending on what kind of design you want to do. Felt it was a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> gave to granddaughter for christmas. She loved it. Everyone in family had fancy nails for quite a while, nice giftt.</li>
    <li> I purchased this simply because it was cheaper than the set I purchased in a retail store and had more brushes, but specifically purchased for the fan brush. Within just a few nails being designed and the brush cleaned each time because of the different colors I was using, it completely disintegrated the glue holding the bristles together and completely fell apart after 1st use and 5 cleanings with cleaning solution! I now have a completely useless tool and an unfinished manicure and the worthless brush is now in the trash can! I will be spending the extra money for an individual fan brush that actually holds up with cleaning. I haven&#x27;t tried the other brushes yet, but if this whole set is made with the same glue as the fan brush, they will be all in the trash shortly, too!</li>
    <li> I luv the brushes and the pretty gold plated dotting tools. Used for the first time last night and was blown away with the outcome. Can&#x27;t wait to try a different design. Can&#x27;t go wrong buying this set, so worth the money.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet. I am looking very forward to start using these tools. My friends are anxious for me to start doing their nails.</li>
    <li> Daughter loved these tools.  Purchased a lot of nail equipment for Christmas and this was definitely a hit.  She said they worked very well.</li>
    <li> This is has tons of brushes and dotting tools. I can created all kinds of different nail art. Super fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> These are great to have if you like to do your own or someone else&#x27;s nails. My grown daughter wants a set now.</li>
    <li> the brushes are awesome the colors are better than expected  it is easy to use  nails were fun to do</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this product. After reading some reviews about not receiving the product as pictured I was worried, but it came exactly as it looks in the picture. The Dotting Kit I really like because of all the different sizes. The brushes are nice too, They come in all different sizes. I don&#x27;t really know how to use the bug huge white brush, but I guess its nice to have too.</li>
    <li> While the quality of the product is excellent, beware of this offer. This offer means you buy four of these sets. I didn&#x27;t realize that this promotion included 4 sets.</li>
    <li> The dotting tools are super cute, and mine did come in gold like it stated. There are a couple repeat sizes, but that&#x27;s really nice for when you want to use more than one color :)</li>
    <li> Item met my expectations</li>
    <li> This brush set has worked out so well for all our nail art ideas. They have done well with all kinds of paint and come clean immediately. Our only complaint about these brushes was if you dip the brush too far into the remover to take the paint off, the black from the handle of the brush comes off as well. None of my other brand brushes have done this. Still a great buy! The dotting tools we have never had a problem with.</li>
    <li> i cant say enough good things about this brush set! i have spent wayyy too much on other sets in the past only to be disappointed by the quality...not the case with this set!!! i use them on nails with both polish and acrylics and they are honestly wonderful. they dont break down when you clean them or shed as you use them like some of the cheaper types. the case they come in stores and keeps them clean and organized well and has the cute cheeky logo on it :-) the dotting tools...oh my goodness i love love love them!!! the 10 sizes are wonderful i have gotten compliments from clients on the gold finish :-) also they are packaged in a cute way with an adorable little fairy tale type story inside the cover of the book-like box!  i made a large order with cheeky and everything was packaged fantastically and it was delivery before expected! i love cheeky and have referred clients and all my friends on facebook and instagram to cheeky.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!!  I am a nail fanatic and could not have asked for anything better than this!  The price is great and the product is great quality!</li>
    <li> Cames like they said, in good conditions and strong beautiful colors, just take a little long to came, but after that everything perfect to me</li>
    <li> well, I got this for one of my friends who wanted this and so she hasnt tried this product out yet, but its odd how this product use to be with a different describitive pic and the price also use to be $3.98 with $6.00 shipping and (so now I think its like $14.00 for this product) so now we are very skeptic if it is the same product we ordered, even though I told her it was so I hope Im right :)</li>
    <li> Been having fun with the tools.Been using them great for the art work maybe will get more stuff from u later.</li>
    <li> I really love the dotting tools even though one of my dotters fell out while I was cleaning it.  And the brushes could have been a little better in quality.</li>
    <li> This set is a steal for the price and has various brushes and dotting tools to give a cute manicure.</li>
    <li> My niece was so excited when she opened this up.  She doesn&#x27;t know how to use the brushes just yet, but will be going on YouTube to see what and how to use.</li>
    <li> My wife used it every day and make her nail look great. Nice little tools for upkeep our nails. Overall good</li>
    <li> There are so many designs that can be done with all of these tools! I love the packaging for storage too. For the price, this is a great purchase for people new to nail art design.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, came before due date! Amazing! Amazing price! It said it was suppose to be due in October, but it came in September! I will be posting a picture with the results of my nail art in the photos above! I am making a YouTube channel for nail art, and these are PERFECT! It came from China so I respect the delivery time..</li>
    <li> زوجتي سعيدة بهذه الريش&lt;br /&gt;My wife happy these feathers</li>
    <li> This set has the most fundamental brushes for nail art. and the dotting tools are perfect. My co-workers keep eye-balling them. The case is awesome and they are so rapidly, I am thrilled to have this set.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who is crazy about nail painting.  She uses this set at least 3 times a week.  This set has worked very well and offers a good variety of different types of brushes.  The only negative I would say is that after only about a month most of the color has peeled off the brush handles.  Really the cosmetic look of this does not bother her or me but I worry about how much longer the handles will hold out and if without the coating on it the wood may also start to deteriorate.</li>
    <li> The problem with this item was that the delivery date kept getting set back and set back, finally by over a month . Granddaughter not a happy camper as the other parts of her birthday wish list came right away. I only gave 3 stars because of the exceptionally (for Amazon) long delivery delay. But, all&#x27;s well that ends well, and I have heard no other complaints regarding this item. It was a great price and that may have been it&#x27;s undoing. Also seemed to be very popular.</li>
    <li> I love giving my friends manicures and petticures so it is quite fun.  I also purchased the set of tools by Cheeky and they work great together.  The reason I didn&#x27;t go all 5 starts is because when I tried to put a design over my polish, attempting a flower, it messed up the polish using the tools.  Although, I may have started the design too fast and not let the other polish dry enough.  Overall great tools and supplies!</li>
    <li> I love my products! Such a great value! Exactly what I wanted! I was so happy when I received my package! I&#x27;m a happy customer! Thank you!</li>
    <li> The price was about $4 (+ shipping) when I purchased this at the end of October. It took about 5 weeks to arrive even though the estimated date was a lot shorter. The dotting tools I received only have 6 different sized dots. The one end of all the tools are the same size, but there is a decent variety of sizes. The brushes seem nice. This price is very good compared to other dotting tools I&#x27;ve seen in stores. I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I wanted the dotting tools, the brushes were the bonus for me. Love all the things I can do with these and have found lots of ways to implement all the different brushes as well. Some haven&#x27;t been used by me yet, but for all you get if I never use them I will still think it was a good deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this item 3 stars only because I didn&#x27;t get what was described.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item over a month ago (it took that long to be delivered- though I was informed it wouldn&#x27;t arrive until Dec 18, which I received it yesterday Dec 6th) So expect to wait for your item. The other issue I had was when I bought this item I was under the impression I was going to receive the brushes in a nice case and the 5 gold tip dotting tool, but instead I received the brushes in a plastic holder and the wrong set of dotting tools.&lt;br /&gt;You can imagine my surprise when I opened up the package and didn&#x27;t receive what I had thought. I contacted seller about this issue and was emailed the next day stating when I bought this item a month ago it was a different packaging and coating dotting tips (when I clearly remember wanting the black and white gold tip dotting tools and brush bag). because I can&#x27;t prove that what I a month ago (I should have printed the page) what I had seen I&#x27;m stuck with the dotting tools I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY TIP FOR YOU IS TO READ DESCRIPTION CLEARLY AND CONTACT SELLER REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE REGARDING THIS ITEM BEFORE YOU BUY.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this set. The dotters are perfect and the brushes are amazing! I have recommended this to many ladies who like doing their nails.</li>
    <li> This is a neat product, well made, brushes are nice too (have only used one so far). I am not that artistic so have not used product to its full potential, but I do like it</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I&#x27;m new to nail art. This is the best set for a beginner or pro. Everything came as the description said, all dotting tips were different sizes, and the brush case is awesome with the tie closure. Perfect.</li>
    <li> It came with everything that was detailed. Wish it would have came with instructions on how to clean the brushes.</li>
    <li> Just started dabbling in nail art, used nail polish with my first set of brushes and they got ruined so I bought acrylic paint for my designs and now my brushes stay nice. the dotting tools are great because they have so many sizes, the first one I bought was way to small to be versatile so this multisize set was a god send. Learn from my mistake and buy once. This was an amazing offer too, very well priced. I love it.</li>
    <li> the brushes are great. some of mine were a little bent, the bristle&#x27;s but I don&#x27;t use those anyways. the box of dotters is a gift so haven&#x27;t used them and cant rate those but they are cute and great gift idea.</li>
    <li> When I first started doing nail art I bought a nail art brush set from Bundle Monster. Then I got this one to try out. Comparatively you get more brushes for your money with Cheeky but they are mostly the same shape but with diferent lengths and widths. The exception is one fan brush and a pin point dotting tool. WIth Bundle Monster you get less brushes but more variety. I have several flat edged brushes, stripers, two fan brushes... and they came in a better case. If you are just getting started and want to try out some brushes go with Bundle Monster. If you already have some brushes, Cheeky brushes have a nice point for detail work.</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected. Good quality. I got all the brushes and tools just they didnt come with packaging as pictured. They came in plastic holders.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes!  It&#x27;s great that they have their own slot in the bag.  Also the dots are awesome and have their own box to keep them nice and neat!  Get this....it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
    <li> I think the brishes are good and i use the dotting tools all the time but mine didnt come in the case shownm just in a plastic bag.</li>
