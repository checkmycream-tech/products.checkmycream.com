      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall the Philips Bikini Perfect (</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does a fair job in terms of performance, but I wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed with the quality of the &amp;#34;grooming.&amp;#34; I felt like I had to go over the area</li>

      <li>/&gt;I was happy with it, but when offered this one, I thought ti might be good to have some more options.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product.</li>
      <li>There are many attachments for a greater range of flexibility, it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and maneuver, and best of all: it works in the shower.</li>
      <li>i love this product!</li>
      <li>amazing trimmer.</li>
      <li>but I recommend using your own instead.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, Kohls had a much better price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been a bit gun-shy of electric razors of any kind.</li>
      <li>It comes with a nice pouch to keep everything together.</li>
      <li>The exfoliation head is great to use after pulse light hair removal or epilation to make sure hairs do not remain.  </li>
      <li>It holds a good charge and is easy to handle.  </li>
      <li>absolutely perfect for sensitive areas.</li>
      <li>I do like that it was safe to use in the shower and the carrying case is nice for storing the groomer and the attachments.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Seems like an easy choice to me!</li>
      <li>The shown on-off switch is handily located and effective although I found it is best to dry the switcher finger</li>
      <li>, it cost much more and was most effective if I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a while.</li>
      <li>tool is very comfortable to hold</li>
      <li>It’s comfortable to hold with a good angle making it easy to reach areas to be shaved.  </li>
      <li>all the attachments are nice, and the rechargeable feature is amazing, but I find the smallest detail trimmer gets very very hot.</li>
      <li>well, mostly.</li>
      <li>But most of these trimmers are made that way too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d either pass on this grooming kit for a better electric one or go with a razor.</li>
      <li>but I like being mostly hairless.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I really do love the exfoliator brush</li>
      <li>and I love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
      <li>This does get closer, but I&#x27;m not just especially thrilled for double the price.</li>
      <li>I want to like this more</li>
      <li>Then after shaving, be sure to moisturize, moisturize, moisturize the freshly-shaven spots to minimize skin freak-outs like itchy rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>After using the different attachments, I found the shaver and trimmer attachments work the best.  </li>
      <li>But when Amazon Vine offered me this one, I figured, &amp;#34;What the heck!&amp;#34; I&#x27;m glad I got it, though, and you might like it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But isn&#x27;t that the case with most electric shavers?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good shaver for this particular *ahem* area for quite some time but could never find one that I really liked.</li>
      <li>Very easy and comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The exfoliating head sounds good, but it&#x27;s pretty basic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is working out pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I mostly use the trimmer with the clear guide and without and it works great both ways.</li>
      <li>However, if you don&#x27;t mind maintaining the hair somewhat more frequently than you would by waxing, and your skin doesn&#x27;t mind the shaving, this is a great tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best part is that I didn&#x27;t get a single cut using it, as some electric trimmers will do regardless of safety features.</li>
      <li>All of these products have not so user friendly handles, but this one is better than most.</li>
      <li>It never got the skin as smooth when just touching</li>
      <li>I think finding the perfect trimmer is harder than it seems.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a good trimmer to have on hand or to pack for a trip but honestly, as nice as this is, a regular razor does a better job, meaning gives a closer shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove the head in case you want to use the others.</li>
      <li>The shaver is easier to use and easy to recharge, and the charge lasts quite a while.  </li>
      <li>This model not only works great, but I like the attachments better.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to handle and hold while shaving.  </li>
      <li>The detail trimmer did allow me to do a pretty nice job</li>
      <li>However, it did work fine as a shaver.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s shaped so that it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand and doesn&#x27;t cause fatigue during use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The trimmer held charge for awhile which is important for me.</li>
      <li>This will not get you smooth like a razor or wax, but will never cause irritation.</li>
      <li>That pouch was the most useful of all the items.</li>
      <li>This Remington is fabulous.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been delighted with it.</li>
      <li>Bought it for a trimming purpose and so far it&#x27;s doing a good job.</li>
      <li>This bikini trimmer offers a lot of attachments, which is nice, but none of them get the job done any better than cheaper bikini trimmers I have owned.</li>
      <li>the heads are super easy to change.  </li>
      <li>It was very gentle and you can do a better job with a loofah.</li>
      <li>shape and size of this little Remington trimmer is quite nice and is very attractive looking as far as shavers go.</li>
      <li>and I found the foil shaver attachment works best for a full trim and the smallest detail trimmer is quite effective for ears, nose and other tight area such as perfect side burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great for quick trims and regular upkeep.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more comfortable, easier to use and nearly as effective as a blade, and I will use it regularly.</li>
      <li>I am prone to ingrown hairs,  it never fails but being able to maintain myself with this product has been a dream for me.</li>
      <li>All told this is another fine product from Remington and worthy of use.</li>
      <li>However, the product wasn&#x27;t as great as I expected it to be</li>
      <li>OK, this grooming kit has a bit too much kit with it, for my taste.</li>
      <li>Not only is it easy to use, it comes with a handy case that you can store it in.</li>
      <li>If this got it close enough to be a real shave, it might win.</li>
      <li>The Bikini trimmer and the detail trimmer were both very easy to use and were the most effective, yet also the most uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>found that the main bikini trimmer was the most useful attachment, but I don’t trust it without the length guide on it, which limits its usefulness.</li>
      <li>Not only does it give a good clean shave, but it is compact, easy to clean, and comes with several attachments as well as a bag to store it in.</li>
      <li>The shape and size is convenient and comfortable, but all of the heads pull at my hair too much for the tender areas I was trying to use them on.</li>
      <li>The exfoliator is a nice addition if only it was workable.  </li>
      <li>The groomer itself has a great shape, easy to hold and long enough to be convenient.</li>
      <li>Her thoughts reflect many of the other reviews in that this is more of a groomer than a close shaver.  </li>
      <li>The interchangeable heads fit into the main unit.</li>
      <li>The interchangeable heads fit into the main unit.</li>
      <li>I only tried it once so far, just to see if it would work, and was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The battery lasts a long time, which is nice.</li>
      <li>It is better than the larger model because the stem and head are more narrow, allowing it to be more maneuverable.</li>
      <li>At first glance this product seems to have a lot to offer.  </li>
      <li>but you would need to use it more often than a traditional woman&#x27;s razor to keep the bikini area neat.</li>
      <li>I actually found the gentle trimmer to be the most useful, but otherwise, my skin was left with more bumps than smoothness.</li>
      <li>I do not plan on using this very often!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is comfortable to hold, and the attachments are a nice small size.</li>
      <li>My daughter dropped this in the shower the first time using it and it shattered.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and economical compared to similar products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love this product! totally recomended</li>
    <li> Bought it for a trimming purpose and so far it&#x27;s doing a good job. It comes already charged which was convenient. it&#x27;s my second Remington model. I have only tried a regular trimming head and a foil shaver. Shaver is useless in my opinion but the manual says it&#x27;s not designed for your legs, only for facial and other small hair areas. Surprisingly, Kohls had a much better price.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Its easier to make my designs..</li>
    <li> OK, this grooming kit has a bit too much kit with it, for my taste. The groomer itself has a great shape, easy to hold and long enough to be convenient. But I think I&#x27;ll use the foil groomer head nearly all of the time and leave the rest in the pretty little case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in its favor, besides shape: it seems to have plenty of power and holds a charge well. It&#x27;s meant to be used cordless, wet or dry (though I prefer dry). Very maneuverable. The foil head is quite comfortable, and small enough for good control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the other heads all pinched or nicked me--except for the exfoliator brush head, which frankly seemed not that useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only electric groomer product I have tried. It&#x27;s more comfortable, easier to use and nearly as effective as a blade, and I will use it regularly. But when it needs to be replaced, I&#x27;ll check the features on other products before making a purchase decision.</li>
    <li> This bikini trimmer offers a lot of attachments, which is nice, but none of them get the job done any better than cheaper bikini trimmers I have owned. Because I only really end up using one of two of the attachments (mostly the detail trimmer) the others just take up storage space. Although the product does come with a bag to keep everything in which helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t find this product to be any better as far as pinching than anything I&#x27;ve tried (in fact, some other products I have tried have pinched less). The detail trimmer did allow me to do a pretty nice job though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer held charge for awhile which is important for me. It does the job but don&#x27;t expect it to be any more pain-free than other products and it&#x27;s not particularly cheap either.</li>
    <li> This is a nice improvement over other groomers that I have used that are designed and marketed for women, but it doesn&#x27;t perform as well as a men’s body groomer. It is somewhat under-powered, and the blades just don’t work that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is comfortable to hold, and the attachments are a nice small size. I like that it is waterproof, so it can be used in the shower. These aspects of the design are very good, but even when it was fully charged I had trouble with it pulling hair instead of cutting it, and it also bites. Bad groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the main bikini trimmer was the most useful attachment, but I don’t trust it without the length guide on it, which limits its usefulness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a bit gun-shy of electric razors of any kind. But when Amazon Vine offered me this one, I figured, &amp;#34;What the heck!&amp;#34; I&#x27;m glad I got it, though, and you might like it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the description says, this is &amp;#34;designed for delicate body and bikini areas,&amp;#34; and it is indeed a small rechargeable unit that is comfortable to hold in your hand. Several trimmers (which snap on and off easily) let you get as close as you want without fear of hurting yourself... well, mostly. While it&#x27;s actually more comfortable to use the &amp;#34;grooming kit&amp;#34; than it is a razor (especially around those &amp;#34;bikini areas&amp;#34;), a regular razor does a smoother and closer shave. However, the increased comfort will mean I continue to use this often.</li>
    <li> I often use trimmers/shavers such as this one because I am very pain-intolerant; I don&#x27;t do waxing or plucking of any sort (too painful!!) but I like being mostly hairless. I even find Nair to be too intense for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool is very comfortable to hold and I love that I can use it in the shower. It comes with extra attachments but I find I only use the regular trimmer head - I have never liked foil trimmers in particular due to the hair-pulling they all seem to do (and this one is no different).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few important points to note: you&#x27;re never going to achieve a *super* close shave with these sorts of trimmers and you will have to deal with the occasional ingrown hair. It&#x27;s just the nature of these things. However, if you don&#x27;t mind maintaining the hair somewhat more frequently than you would by waxing, and your skin doesn&#x27;t mind the shaving, this is a great tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To combat ingrown hairs it&#x27;s important to exfoliate prior to shaving; this tool comes with an exfoliator but I recommend using your own instead. For less-tender areas a brush or scrubby towel will likely be fine whereas for tender areas I can only at most use a soft loofah or sponge; YMMV. Then after shaving, be sure to moisturize, moisturize, moisturize the freshly-shaven spots to minimize skin freak-outs like itchy rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this tool - especially compared to other trimmers I&#x27;ve used. There are many attachments for a greater range of flexibility, it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and maneuver, and best of all: it works in the shower.</li>
    <li> My old trimmer stopped holding a charge and th price to replace the same model of Remington mysteriously went up to $50+.  This model not only works great, but I like the attachments better.</li>
    <li> I mostly use the trimmer with the clear guide and without and it works great both ways. The battery life is very good; I&#x27;ve only charged it once and have used it several times for several minutes each time. It&#x27;s easy to remove the head in case you want to use the others. It&#x27;s a little hard to figure out how to put the clear guide on for certain hair lengths, so I had to kind of use trial and error, so it&#x27;s not ideal but it works.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and shaving the bikini line, for me, is a no go. I have tried many different electric shavers in the past, including the MUCH more expensive pairing of [[ASIN:B00141DEAC Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal Shaver]] with a [[ASIN:B001IZZX1C Cleancut ES412 Personal Shaver]]. While that set up did work well, it cost much more and was most effective if I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a while. It never got the skin as smooth when just touching up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised with this Remington grooming kit. It has many different attachments to meet all your grooming needs, whether you are doing your bikini line or entire bikini area (yes, it can handle it), peach fuzz on your cheeks, stray hairs above the eyebrows etc. It even includes a buffer attachment, which in theory helps remove dry skin and prevent ingrown hairs. I have yet to remember to use that attachment but I like that it was included. I have not used this to do my arms but my personal opinion is that the head is rather small and while I think it *could* handle it, it might take a long time. It&#x27;s not recommended for legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this is a great little tool, especially for the price. It trimmed my bikini hair, and then shaved it smooth, so I was left with the desired result without any rashing or ingrown hairs. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have found the exfoliator and bikini trimmer to be helpful. However, I found it difficult to get a very close shave. I used pretty much every attachment before I finally got it as close as I wanted. I didn&#x27;t experience as much razor burn as I would with a traditional razor, but it wasn&#x27;t 100% razor burn free. I do think the exfoliator helped at bit with that. The attachments were pretty easy to swap out, but I had a little bit of trouble removing the length guide for the trimmer (it allows you to select from two different lengths). I do like that it was safe to use in the shower and the carrying case is nice for storing the groomer and the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a fair job in terms of performance, but I wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed with the quality of the &amp;#34;grooming.&amp;#34; I felt like I had to go over the area several times before it got the job done.</li>
    <li> I really like that this set is the total package, lots of attachments for every use. Best part is that I didn&#x27;t get a single cut using it, as some electric trimmers will do regardless of safety features. Quite simply put, it does what it needs to and it does so rather inexpensively.</li>
    <li> Go with an actual razor blade if doing shaping.  This has a tendency to pinch, especially in delicate areas.  The exfoliating head sounds good, but it&#x27;s pretty basic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one positive is that it has a lot of attachments.  Oh, and it can be used in and out of the shower.  But most of these trimmers are made that way too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the Philips Bikini Perfect (which is what this would be replacing) does a fine job, so no point in changing to a new brand unless the old one is worn out or needs replacing.  Even then, the Philips has lasted a long time with no issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good shaver for this particular *ahem* area for quite some time but could never find one that I really liked. This Remington is fabulous. Not only does it give a good clean shave, but it is compact, easy to clean, and comes with several attachments as well as a bag to store it in. It is easy to use. I like the narrow head of this shaver. It is easier for reaching certain areas that are more difficult to get to. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> My daughter dropped this in the shower the first time using it and it shattered.</li>
    <li> I want to like this more but it simply doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave.  i do like the size and shape of it.  it&#x27;s easy to handle and hold while shaving.  I tried all the attachments, though I doubt I&#x27;ll ever actually use them all.  The two I like the best are the bikini trimmer with the plastic head attachment and the exfoliater.  The others - the foil shaver, detail trimmer, and gentle trimmer - just don&#x27;t save very close at all.  My Daisy disposal does a much closer shave than those, so I&#x27;ll be sticking with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually used the exfoliater on my face, it&#x27;s gentle enough for that and seemed to work okay.  I only tried it once so far, just to see if it would work, and was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, for what I was hoping for with this razor, the bikini trimmer with its plastic head attachment does the trick.  That&#x27;s about all I will be using it for, although I&#x27;ll probably use the exfoliator now and then. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the other attachments could give a close shave, but looks like I&#x27;ll be sticking with using my Daisy disposable in shower for the areas that need a close shave and this Remington when I need to trim the bikini area.</li>
    <li> Product itself is very rough...sharp...not like other razors I have had....disappointing</li>
    <li> Not good quality blades - got repeated cuts.</li>
    <li> From my Fiance&#x27;s perspective. 3 stars for several reasons. Was not happy with the size of the trimmer head and it&#x27;s ability to offer a close shave. The foil attachment was useless and no where near the performance of a regular blade razor.  The Bikini trimmer and the detail trimmer were both very easy to use and were the most effective, yet also the most uncomfortable.Charging life appeared acceptable. I was able to use it for approximately 3 days (30 minutes) before charging again. I have found the exfoliator and bikini trimmer to be helpful. However, I found it difficult to get a very close shave. I used pretty much every attachment before I finally got it as close as I wanted. So as I purchased it under the Vine program I had my Fiance try it as a mustache trimmer on me! It actually worked well and because of it&#x27;s smaller size was able to trim in more detail versus my regular Braun trimmer. So, I guess us guys can use it as well!</li>
    <li> I have an old Remington bikini trimmer that I have been trying to replace, since Remington discontinued the model. I try just about every show shaver and trimmer that shows up in Vine, and have yet to find one as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried this wet in the shower, and it basically sucked. Pulled hair, didn&#x27;t shave most hair, and left a mess that had to be redone with the old trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry was definitely better, but I still had few nicks and pulls, and the length is hard to adjust with no numbers or dials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can work with this, but not happily.</li>
    <li> There sits a dainty, small but full of room, lavender pouch that holds an entire Grooming Kit just for the single purpose of removing unwanted body hair.  And, by golly, it works well.  For that body hair I do not want I have found in recent days that this is my go-to tool for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The groomer body is hefty and well balanced with a hanger on the bottom and a simple indicator to advise of charging status.  The shown on-off switch is handily located and effective although I found it is best to dry the switcher finger so it does not slip.  Remington thought of everything that most if not all of us can use from one time to the other.  Each of the 5 cutting attachments work quite well and I found the foil shaver attachment works best for a full trim and the smallest detail trimmer is quite effective for ears, nose and other tight area such as perfect side burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take all of that into the shower and let &#x27;er rip since the groomer is waterproof.  To get the full effect of the Exfoliator use it by going from left to right or you will find it does not work as well.  And as the instructions say, do NOT use the Exfoliator near long hair unless the hair is tied back and out of the way.  All told this is another fine product from Remington and worthy of use.</li>
    <li> It’s comfortable to hold with a good angle making it easy to reach areas to be shaved.  After using the different attachments, I found the shaver and trimmer attachments work the best.  The exfoliator didn&#x27;t feel like it did much and the length guide attachment was nearly useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it is rechargeable is a plus and it states it works in either wet or dry environments but I only tried it while dry.&lt;br /&gt;If you’re looking for a close shave this is probably not for you.  It does work but you would need to use it more often than a traditional woman&#x27;s razor to keep the bikini area neat.</li>
    <li> Remington should take note that underpowered does not mean gentle, it means noisy and annoying.  I have used Remington products before and I find that because they want the razor or trimmer to be gentle the tool suddenly becomes less powerful.  Unfortunately if a razor is stronger and faster; the cut is cleaner and there is less pain or hassle.  They should also work on better blades, the blades on this trimmer are dull.  The exfoliator is a nice addition if only it was workable.  I get better use of my regular facial brush cleaner than this weak brush.  I prefer to wax than use this trimmer because even though waxing can be painful, the smoothness lasts longer. </li>
    <li> It has its good points and its bad points. Let&#x27;s start with the good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape and size of this little Remington trimmer is quite nice and is very attractive looking as far as shavers go. It&#x27;s shaped so that it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand and doesn&#x27;t cause fatigue during use. It can be used wet or dry but I prefer using it dry. It&#x27;s cordless and holds the charge well. It was a lot of use before I had to recharge it. And it has a decent amount of power to it even when the battery begins to drain a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on, included with this trimmer is a rather flimsy carrying case and also, a few trimmers: a general trimmer, a gentle trimmer, and a foil head. There is a rotating exfoliator brush too. You have to test the heads out to see what works on your individual skin. There was a slight hint of pinching with the general trimmer and not a lot of trimming going on with the gentle trimmer but I did like the foil trimmer a lot and the rotating exfoliator brush is something I&#x27;m finding I use frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good trimmer to have on hand or to pack for a trip but honestly, as nice as this is, a regular razor does a better job, meaning gives a closer shave. But isn&#x27;t that the case with most electric shavers? I don&#x27;t think this is specific to this particular device. I really do love the exfoliator brush so I can&#x27;t complain too much. Very easy and comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice little appliance to have around but I think Remington can tweak this to perfection in the future.</li>
    <li> I like to use it in the bathroom</li>
    <li> I had a female friend try this out because my man hairs would break it.  :)  Her thoughts reflect many of the other reviews in that this is more of a groomer than a close shaver.  You are going to have to stick with blades likely to get the close shave.  The shaver is easier to use and easy to recharge, and the charge lasts quite a while.  I&#x27;d either pass on this grooming kit for a better electric one or go with a razor.</li>
    <li> I really like this grooming kit. Not only is it easy to use, it comes with a handy case that you can store it in. So far, I&#x27;ve been delighted with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this trimmer.  It holds a good charge and is easy to handle.  Like any trimmer you have to be extra gentle in sensitive areas or you will cut your your skin, I&#x27;m careful and have not had any issues.</li>
    <li> amazing trimmer. absolutely perfect for sensitive areas. This will not get you smooth like a razor or wax, but will never cause irritation. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had this before: [[ASIN:B00005JS5C Panasonic ES246AC Heated Bikini Trimmer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy with it, but when offered this one, I thought ti might be good to have some more options. Honestly, I was just has happy with the $19.95 one as this one. If this got it close enough to be a real shave, it might win. This does get closer, but I&#x27;m not just especially thrilled for double the price. I like remington products and this does seem to be made well.</li>
    <li> At first glance this product seems to have a lot to offer.  The kit comes five different attachment heads and a little carrying case. The interchangeable heads fit into the main unit. There is a foil shaver, a gentle trimmer, the main trimmer, hair length guide and the exfoliator.  It is nice and small and suitable for both wet and dry use.  This is my first try with an electric shaver and so maybe I was expecting too much but they all seemed rather dull and not very effective in comparison to my good old fashioned razor.  I actually found the gentle trimmer to be the most useful, but otherwise, my skin was left with more bumps than smoothness. I do not plan on using this very often!</li>
    <li> Well, it has lots of attachments, but the smaller and larger clippers actually drew blood from my tender bits.  Not nice.  However, the larger clipper is okay for everyday grooming, and the foil attachment is okay.  Not great.  I would look around if you want closer grooming (of course you&#x27;ll never get ultra-smooth from a shaver- you have to wax for that).</li>
    <li> This is working out pretty good.  It cuts through hair pretty well and makes a nice close shave without irritating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different heads help to trip/cut different areas on the body and the heads are super easy to change.  The groomer feels good in the hand and my hand doesn&#x27;t get tired holding on to it.  The battery lasts a long time, which is nice.</li>
    <li> I think finding the perfect trimmer is harder than it seems. This trimmer is pretty obviously designed for your under the pants area. The plusses are that it is precisely designed, but getting the job done may take you a long while with a lot of nicks along the way. This isn&#x27;t as good as a general body groomer than can do everything here faster and with less discomfort.</li>
    <li> Purchased this in Burlington for only $20. I was so happy to finally be able to find something less irritating to my skin. I am prone to ingrown hairs,  it never fails but being able to maintain myself with this product has been a dream for me. Now I only shave about every 7-10 days and use this in between. That way I can save myself from the irritability of the razor.  I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The Remington Ultimate Body Grooming Kit is misunderstood.  Several of the reviews gave it a poor rating because it failed to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; adequately.  This is not a body shaving kit.  This kit is meant as a hair trimming and \\&quot;grooming\\&quot; kit.  If you keep this in mind you will not be disappointed.  The kit comes with several trimming heads that make it very versatile even in sensitive areas. The exfoliation head is great to use after pulse light hair removal or epilation to make sure hairs do not remain.  The device is easy to charge and the charge lasts for a decent length of time (over a weeks worth of use if used daily).  In addition this can be used wet or dry which makes it easy to clean up.  As long as you don&#x27;t expect this to provide you with  a super close shave, this grooming kit works very well.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. I especially chose it because of the exfoliating attachment. I think that is the only part I may keep using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with a bunch of attachments that are pretty useless. The interchangeable heads fit into the main unit. There is a foil shaver, a gentle trimmer, the main trimmer, hair length guide and the exfoliator. It comes with a nice pouch to keep everything together. That pouch was the most useful of all the items. The rest have either performance issues or are useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair length guide is a bulky plastic that attaches to the trimmer. It is cumbersome and the size makes it harder to maneuver. It&#x27;s like whoever designed it didn&#x27;t realize women have curves everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmers were a disappointment. They did not have enough power and they ended up pulling on hair. It was downright painful. If you do not mind torture, you are welcome to keep using this. Pain level was just below epilation. It just does not have enough power to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up is the exfoliator. It was very gentle and you can do a better job with a loofah. It you have sensitive skin or you usually wax, this is a good option for exfoliating when the hair is first starting to come in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was very disappointing. It under performed in both power and design. Pass. I will keep using my ten dollar pharmacy bought trimmer.</li>
    <li> The shape and size is convenient and comfortable, but all of the heads pull at my hair too much for the tender areas I was trying to use them on. Far too uncomfortable for me to recommend.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and economical compared to similar products. All of these products have not so user friendly handles, but this one is better than most. Safer than a razor and multi-functional as this kit comes with a few attachments that you can use depending on what function you are electing to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a shaver that can make my life easier. I&#x27;ve had good luck with Remington products in the past and had high hopes for this one. It comes with a few attachments (an exfoliator, foil shaver, delicate area trimmer, etc.) that you can switch out depending on what you want to use it for. I tried the bikini area shaver in the shower and had mixed results. Using it with the &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; guideline really resulted in nothing happening. Not sure if it was because it was a wet environment and that needs to be used in a dry environment. Until I try agin, I wasn&#x27;t impressed. However, it did work fine as a shaver. I also had mixed results with the foil shaver (which they said was for use in the underarm area). It didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Never having used a foil shaver before, I wondered if perhaps I was using it wrong or improperly. (Is it only supposed to be used for maintenance of already &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34; areas?) I did like the delicate area trimmer for using on some pesky facial hair, and I really enjoy using the exfoliator attachment. However, the product wasn&#x27;t as great as I expected it to be and I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the higher price tag that comes with it.</li>
    <li> I like this thing... I hate shaving my bikini area because I&#x27;m horribly prone to ingrown hairs and irritation. This has multiple blades for shaping as well as the cool little brush that helps to exfoliate the area to reduce the likelihood of ingrowns. I love that I can take it in the shower with me, and the fact that it comes with the little carry bag. It&#x27;s also rechargeable, so you aren&#x27;t going to run out of battery power halfway through trimming and be forced to go in search of replacement batteries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And hey, $32 for a grooming kit, or $60 for a wax job that only lasts a few weeks? Seems like an easy choice to me!</li>
    <li> A must have for personal care. Great for quick trims and regular upkeep.</li>
    <li> all the attachments are nice, and the rechargeable feature is amazing, but I find the smallest detail trimmer gets very very hot. I like to use them around my eyebrow area, and I have to do small spots at a time to cool it down</li>
    <li> This product is great. It is better than the larger model because the stem and head are more narrow, allowing it to be more maneuverable. It seems very solid and came fully charged too.</li>
