      <li>I add a light layer of castor oil on top and it&#x27;s a match made in heaven for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(However, if you add some rose water, aloe vera juice or sit the bottle in a cup of hot water, it will loosen up.)  </li>
      <li>Not only does this product add moisture to my hair but it defines my curls beautifully &amp; almost works as a detangler</li>
      <li>Hands down, Shea Moisture Leave in Conditioner is one of the best LIC&#x27;s on the market.  </li>
      <li>They are also shipped item quickly!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It worked great, but as my hair kept growing it became less effective</li>
      <li>I just wish this product was available in stores as well as online.</li>
      <li>I did try another method to help my hair to detaingle and it worked great the second time!!</li>
      <li>I am so glad I finally purchased this product; it is by far the best leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair!</li>
      <li>but so far it seems like a good moisturizer.</li>

      <li>This leave in conditioner is creamy and thick and smells great!</li>
      <li>Okay so I waited until I finished an entire bottle of this product before doing a review....&amp; the verdict is I love this product.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair frizz free and really tames my curls.</li>
      <li>I even have my 88 yr old mother hooked. :-)</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Anyway, as far as the smell is concerned, it is lovely.</li>
      <li>My natural hair seems to love the ingredients in it.  </li>
      <li>But for what it&#x27;s worth, it does what I need it do for a reasonable amount of time &amp; 3.</li>
      <li>Applied it on damp hair and at first was concerned</li>
      <li>NEEDED THANKS !</li>
      <li>hence, the first ingredient is shea butter, it is a sealer.  </li>
      <li>I get better results from using the Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Masque.  </li>
      <li>I have eczema and need to keep my skin clean and moisturized with natural products.</li>
      <li>I lalalove this product....makes my curls super soft!</li>
      <li>This product is pretty much just shea butter.</li>
      <li>this leave in conditioner is full of natural ingredients that keep the hair very moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to finally find the Shea Moisture Leave in that I loved so much from a few years ago.</li>
      <li>, I put some of this on my ends and then wear my hair in two large buns.</li>
      <li>I was able to fit the contents from this 8oz bottle into a 4oz jar, so you go figure exactly how thick the consistency is.</li>
      <li>This a wonderful product for those with thick, coily, dry hair.</li>
      <li>It is now very hard to find in stores, so I am glad I am able to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>My hair is very wavy.  </li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in moisture or softness.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and stops hair shedding.</li>
      <li>They really packaged the product well so that it would not get damaged.  </li>
      <li>I really had to write a review on this Leave-In Conditioner.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is creamy and thick and smells great! I have low porosity hair. This Shea Moisture product helps my hair to retain moisture! I love it! (It&#x27;s a shame that it&#x27;s only sold online.)</li>
    <li> Since using this product, my hair retains the moisture ...does not get dry and brittle as before usage.  My hair appears to have more volume not as fine and thin.</li>
    <li> My hair is very wavy.  I have a hard time detaingling it after washing and conditioning it.  I tried this product and liked it.  I love that it really does not have a scent which is great!  I don&#x27;t like the smell of flowers, perfumes, etc.  It did not detaingle my hair when I tried to comb thru it, but it did provide well needed moisture for a long period of time (about 3-4 days). I did try another method to help my hair to detaingle and it worked great the second time!! After I shampoo my hair, I applied the conditioner, then my coconut oil. I placed plastic cap on my head overnight.  The next morning, I took the cap off and my waves were not tangled!!!  I could run my fingers thru my hair!!!  I want to mention also that I did not experience any build up in my hair as a result of using this product, which is great! My waves are shiny and bouncy as a result of using this product. Will purchase again!  Especially from this supplier.  They really packaged the product well so that it would not get damaged.  They took the time to tape the lid of the product to prevent it from spilling out.  They are also shipped item quickly!</li>
    <li> I really had to write a review on this Leave-In Conditioner. First I must say this is SOME GOOD STUFF!! Hands down, the smell is divine, I love it. With that being said, I probably wouldn&#x27;t order it again (Unless the manufacturers/ sellers/ whoever is responsible for container packaging MAKES A CHANGE IN THE CONTAINER) This conditioner is SUPER THICK, I guess this is really shea-butter. You will have a difficult time getting it out of the bottle. Makes me wonder how they got it in?  I had to get a jar and literally fight with a &#x27;chop-stick&#x27; to get the product scooped out into a jar. This is the only way to go for ease of use. I was able to fit the contents from this 8oz bottle into a 4oz jar, so you go figure exactly how thick the consistency is. Even after doing that, I still couldn&#x27;t get all the product out, so I just added water to whatever was left in the bottle, shook it up really good, and believe me it&#x27;s still fairly thick. I will use that up, before starting on what I put into the jar. I am including a picture so you can see what I&#x27;m talking about. **Well I tried to upload a pic to show you the consistency once scooped into the jar** I hope you see it.</li>
    <li> I buy this frequently. Very moisturizing and stops hair shedding. I just wish this product was available in stores as well as online. But, if it never becomes available in the stores, I will still continue to purchase it via Amazon because it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Works for me... a leave in conditioner that does not feel greasy or weigh you down.</li>
    <li> My hair didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I Love this stuff!!! I have 4b/4c hair and my hair stays sooooo soft and moisturized for days w/o reapplying. I sometimes mix it w/ coconut or olive oil. Its VERY thick and a little goes a long way. I have ordered 3x from this company and packaging is very good as well as speedy shipment. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that keeps moister in my hair longer than 1 day. Me and my natural 4b hair loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> It works but the hassle of having to order it online isn&#x27;t worth it, plus this stuff left white flakes in my hair that eventually absorbed when I wrapped my hair up in a silk scarf and \\&quot;melted\\&quot; it with some body heat.  I get better results from using the Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Masque.  Will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years. Great for medium fine hair. It seems like there&#x27;s been a lot of transition with the product I&#x27;m glad I can still find it.</li>
    <li> Nature and Herbs is a great company to order from.  I usually receive my shipment within 3-4 business days.  I&#x27;ve ordered twice and had absolutely no problems whatsoever.  Product came intact.  I will continue to use Nature and Herbs as I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Truly moisturizes and softens my coarse hair!&lt;br /&gt;Soothes my itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally find the Shea Moisture Leave in that I loved so much from a few years ago. Sadly this is not it. This product is pretty much just shea butter. It sits on top of the hair and doesn&#x27;t soak in, therefore making it look like you just rolled in wet dust.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this if you want a leave in. If you&#x27;re going to wash it out the same day, then maybe, but no thanks. Returned it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years now and it is a great moisturizing leave in conditioner with great ingredients.  It is best for me and my daughter on wet hair.  We add a little amount of oil like castor oil to seal and the hair stays moisturized for the week.  I have tried Shea Moisture&#x27;s new line, but I have to say this product is one of their best.  It is now very hard to find in stores, so I am glad I am able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great smell. But it&#x27;s to hard to get out of the bottle. People with hand issues would have a very hard time getting the product to come out. I think this product would be better off in a jar. Good for certain hair textures. I&#x27;m natural right now and it only worked for me I had a TWA.</li>
    <li> Hands down, Shea Moisture Leave in Conditioner is one of the best LIC&#x27;s on the market.  My 3c/4A fine, coily, thin density, low porosity hair loves this product. My hair does not like the traditional shea butter that many natural haired sisters use on their hair.  So initially, I was skeptical about buying and using this LIC.  I also thought, why should I buy another product.  What makes this LIC better than the others.  Well, let me tell you, I&#x27;m happy that I took the plunge. Yes, it is very thick and very hard to shake or squeeze out of the bottle.  But that is the beauty of the product.  It is not a moisturizer hence, the first ingredient is shea butter, it is a sealer.  (However, if you add some rose water, aloe vera juice or sit the bottle in a cup of hot water, it will loosen up.)  While it may be a sealer, the moisturizing properties are like none other.  After washing and conditioning my hair, I smooth this product on wet hair, from root to tip and my coils are soft, defined ringlets that are shiny and bouncy with absolutely no crunch.  I get 3rd and 4th day hair just by retwisting my hair at night .  I must say that I have only used this product during the spring, fall and winter months because it is a butter and I believe that it would be too heavy for my fine hair during the summer.  Perhaps next summer I will give it a try and post an update.  Anyway, as far as the smell is concerned, it is lovely. It sort of smells like vanilla ice cream but the scent does not linger.  All in all, I love this LIC for the price, the 10 great ingredients, and the final results upon using this awesome product.</li>
    <li> Amazing, nice shipping and quality.</li>
    <li> I find this a dependable leave-in moisturizer; no alcohol, no dyes and thank goodness, no petrolatum. I have been using it consistently for a few years now.</li>
    <li> the conditioner is too, too thick!  I wear a natural hairstyle and this product is not of a consistency to work thru and leave in my hair.  the only way i&#x27;ll probably be able to use it is to add some water or some other hair product to loosen it up.</li>
    <li> I bought this when my 4C hair was only around half an inch long.&lt;br /&gt;It worked great, but as my hair kept growing it became less effective so I had to switch to another product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the approx 4 years and love it.  I have recommended this product to everyone and they all love it. Just wish it was sold in stores like the other She Moisture products</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It is my all time favorite leave-in conditioner. Nothing moisturizes my hair like this product. I even have my 88 yr old mother hooked. :-) Thanks</li>
    <li> This product leaves the scalp too dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approx 1 week now. Leaves the hair soft and manageable all day (i live in the Caribbean - exposed to hot temp and AC all day) Will continue to use as long as the formula works.</li>
    <li> Shea Moisture does it again... features the main ingredient quite well.  this leave in conditioner is full of natural ingredients that keep the hair very moisturized.  Applied it on damp hair and at first was concerned cause I didn&#x27;t feel much slip or a moisturizing feel of hair.  but as hair started to dry while styling it, that&#x27;s when the benefits were in full throttle.  Love it will continue to use and repurchase.</li>
    <li> My hair loves thick butters, especially in the winter time. It leaves my hair frizz free and really tames my curls. I love using this product because not many companies make a thick leave in conditioner. Thank you! This is perfect for my hair. I have used other leave in conditioner with poor results, and they don&#x27;t help my hair retain moisture. But this product is awesome for curly, low porosity hair. Make sure to add this after conditioner while the steam from shower is still going on. The steam helps to open your cuticles and let the product in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone who has low porosity hair and needs a leave in.</li>
    <li> I use this product to seal in the moisture for my hair and it smells great. My boyfriend loves the smell. hehe My hair absorbs this stuff right up and makes it feel sooo good. I put it on at night with twist or braids, but would not use it as a wash and go because its so thick. You can use it with your wash and go but it is hard to mix in with my own wet hair. (kinky coily) I love this product and will continue to use this to seal the moisture into my hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Smells delicious but does not smell strong and does not linger. Scalp no longer itches (from being dry). My hair is healthy and manageable with this product. May efect other hair types differently. I use it twice per day. Sometimes I apply it three times in a single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i now use another product first then I apply this 15-20 minutes or so later. At night I massage this product into my scalp to prevent it from itching from drying out as I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thick so takes a minute to massage into the hair. Buy it and try it!</li>
    <li> Use this on my daughters coarse hair as a sealant. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I love the Leave In Conditioner.  I would not find the conditioner I had been using but this one is better.</li>
    <li> This is a great leave-in that I use with aloe vera gel.  My natural hair seems to love the ingredients in it.  I just wish that I could find it on the ground, but this is a good price with the free shipping.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for about a week but so far it seems like a good moisturizer. I like the texture of the product very creamy and it smells good also.</li>
    <li> I receive this shipment in 2 days wow I did not pay extra for shipment. I used this product and I love it already.  Is there bigger sizes</li>
    <li> Okay so I waited until I finished an entire bottle of this product before doing a review....&amp; the verdict is I love this product. As a relatively new person to the natural hair world, I was looking for a product that would help with the dryness that my hair had after washing &amp; this product was the answer. I use this product promptly after every wash. Not only does this product add moisture to my hair but it defines my curls beautifully &amp; almost works as a detangler (although my hair isn&#x27;t very thick &amp; kinky to begin with). That being said there are some things I don&#x27;t like...1. the smell, kinda has a bannana-ish smell, I don&#x27;t like bannanas (but i recognize that&#x27;s a personal preference) 2. while this product adds immedite moisture to my hair after washing, it doesn&#x27;t last past a day, @ least for me....instead after I apply this product &amp; my hair dries, I apply Shea Moisture masque treatment, the stuff sold @ Target. But for what it&#x27;s worth, it does what I need it do for a reasonable amount of time &amp; 3. I don&#x27;t like the fact that the manufacturers of this product chose such a terrible way of packaging... as you run out of product, it becomes increasingly harder to get the product out of the bottle ( so this time I&#x27;m going to just pour all the product into an empty plastic container to avoid the problem again)....all in all, good product.</li>
    <li> Too thick for me to continually use</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll see a difference by day 3! I have recommended this product numerous times and have yet to get negative feedback!</li>
    <li> Love this product . Softens hair. Apply copious amounts after wash. Hair maintains moisture. Mix with oils.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work on my hair at all. However, I gave it to my daughter and it is perfect for her hair.</li>
    <li> WORKED AS MY WIFE NEEDED THANKS !</li>
    <li> I love the way this product makes my hair feel.  The more I use it, the softer it gets with no build up.</li>
    <li> I use this and other Shea Moisture products for my 1 year old and myself. I&#x27;ve been using these products on my locs for at least 2 years. I started using shea moisture on my daughter about 4 months ago. It keeps her hair moist and manageable.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a rating of 3 stars because it only seems to work well on dry hair. I do not like the way to works or feels on wet or damp hair. I have 4A texture natural coily hair. It is great for refreshing my ends before going to bed. If I wear a twist out and I need to refresh my ends so that the style will last another day, I put some of this on my ends and then wear my hair in two large buns. In the morning my ends are moisturized and aren&#x27;t frizzy.</li>
    <li> Pure shea butter is great. This seems to be more cream or lotion and my hair and I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in moisture or softness. I didn&#x27;t like how thick it was to use it. It is probably good for many others but I will use it and keep looking.</li>
    <li> Nice but not rich and oily, more of a matt feel on my hair that gets stiff after a few days being on hair.</li>
    <li> A little greasy/sticky for me, or like with some products, I haven&#x27;t found the right way to use it yet.</li>
    <li> I see myself using this product for a very long time, once its available. It keeps my natural shoulder length hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> All you sistas out there know that your hair does not just fall in love with any ol&#x27; product - and when you find that ONE, you stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is that \\&quot;ONE\\&quot; for me! I can put this on my DRY 4b/c hair and it will feel moisturized for hours! This is a hard feat when it comes to natural hair. I prefer to just slightly wet my hair first with a spray bottle, then rub this moisturizer/leave-in in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an item that I keep coming back to. Downside: it&#x27;s a little on the expensive side for my budget but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Found it at Walmart.  The lotion, bar soap, conditioners. Nice price. Just happened upon it looking for scented lotions. I have eczema and need to keep my skin clean and moisturized with natural products. Raw Shea butter bar soap with frankincense and myrrh is awesome. I love it</li>
    <li> This products makes my natural hair feel very moisturized.  I don&#x27;t need to use it everyday. And a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Helped so much with my kinky curly hair</li>
    <li> So far so good. It has a very pleasant scent, and it&#x27;s very emollient. I&#x27;ll come back and change my review if it doesn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
    <li> I have been on a trial and error mission for years to help me manage my very dry, coily hair and this product is the perfect consistency and has a great balance of moisture and sealing ingredients! I am amazed at how soft and supple my hair is after using it during this harsh winter. The water I spritz on my hair, prior to using this product, is no longer a wasted effort as this leave-in conditioner helps my hair retain moisture like no other product has been able to for me! I add a light layer of castor oil on top and it&#x27;s a match made in heaven for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked into this product a few years back at my local beauty supply store and since they were out-of-stock at the time (and I was too impatient to wait for another shipment) I never went back and moved on to other unsuccessful products. Boy I missed out on this gem over the years! Dah well! My search is now over and as long as this product is made, I will continue to purchase it and use it year round! Thank you Shea Moisture! This a wonderful product for those with thick, coily, dry hair. I am so glad I finally purchased this product; it is by far the best leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair! Woo-hoo!</li>
    <li> I lalalove this product....makes my curls super soft! Not to mention smells great! ;-)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for my hair texture 4b/c</li>
    <li> this is the best leave in condition for my twist. It keeps my hair moisturized for days.&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses it in his beard also. I always buy the double pack.&lt;br /&gt;great product for natural 4c hair.</li>
    <li> This product is the worse thing ever to my tight coils 4b. It literally had my hair coming out in clumps. I would place it on it after shampoo. My hair felt knotted dry and would split and rip.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PURCHASE&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PURCHASE</li>
    <li> I plan on using it for the rest of my life. It keeps my hair so soft.</li>
