### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This thing is AWESOME!!!</li>
      <li>It was the perfect temp.</li>
      <li>excellent product until now</li>
      <li>The machine works perfectly but it takes about 45 min to an hour, depending on the wax, to heat it up.</li>
      <li>Either way, this thing got to a perfect temp and stayed there, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
      <li>It is very good</li>
      <li>It is a very good product.</li>
      <li>Very good .</li>
      <li>and today just looks great.  </li>
      <li>warmed the wax great</li>
      <li>So I have changed the number of stars because it does seem very handy</li>
      <li>but I always plug it in an hour before I use it just to make sure it perfect</li>
      <li>Very good product, strongly recommended!</li>
      <li>This works fine for me !!</li>
      <li>It takes too much to warm up in my opinion but it&#x27;s a good product, safe and comfortable to use, it has a very good price</li>
      <li>but once it&#x27;s nice and warm the wax does roll on like it should.</li>
      <li>I am sure that with around 30 mins of warming the wax, would be good enough.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>And very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Item is very easy to hold  </li>
      <li>I received this product yesterday, I am from Costa Rica, I used it a couple of hours ago with excellent results, the price is really  really really amazing, I found similar product in the store here in Costa Rica for $120 USD.</li>
      <li>but I hoped the good ones are more true because not everyone can be satisfied</li>
      <li>FANTASTIC and works like a charm!</li>
      <li>I decided I will spend more money on electricity if I use it</li>
      <li>I bought the 8oz clean and easy to give it a try, and it was great, easy and extremely clean and fast to do.</li>
      <li>It works fine</li>
      <li>Received this yesterday and used it last night, it was great</li>
      <li>With this the waxing is easy and quick.</li>
      <li>We did not expect that quality is going to be as such because of the good price.</li>
      <li>one thing I should mention is 2 different brand waxes fit nice and snug in the warmer but 1 brand didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t pull all the hairs out, for the second leg I was an expert and it just felt so smooth and nice</li>
      <li>Thank you, I received my order quickly but it works on itself until tested.</li>
      <li>Just ok, doesn&#x27;t get overly hot have to let it warm up for a long time.</li>
      <li>Since I wrote the first review they have put the wax cartridges available to buy below the item.</li>
      <li>but this is very convenient and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone that wants to save money on waxing!!</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>Keeps the wax at the right temp.</li>
      <li>It takes a really long time for the wax to warm up.</li>
      <li>and it was not near being warm.  </li>
      <li>this does exactly what i had hoped for...</li>
      <li>The item was larger than I pictured so it would be used more for legs and maybe underarm, not face.</li>
      <li>first leg</li>
      <li>Not easy to use, sticky and doesn&#x27;t give good results.</li>
      <li>This really works on heating the wax but it can take an hour.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much in the way of instructions and there are no papers or strips or anything to go with it.</li>
      <li>, i love the size is big enough to hold the 16 oz.</li>
      <li>I really regret buying this applicator and a wax to fit in it as it was a waste of money.</li>
      <li>We were surprised!</li>
      <li>and it  makes the waxing mess free.</li>
      <li>Luckily it was too cold to roll  much, so I did not have to clean a huge portion of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Before buying the product I read some good and some bad reviews</li>
      <li>the only draw back is that you need to plug it in a long time before you want to use it, because it takes it a long time to heat up a full bottle of wax.</li>
      <li>anyways this is way better because i don&#x27;t have to be running to the microwave to reheat it, and I don&#x27;t know about you, but I am poor and don&#x27;t have a microwave in my bathroom.</li>

<li> anyways this is way better because i don&#x27;t have to be running to the microwave to reheat it, and I don&#x27;t know about you, but I am poor and don&#x27;t have a microwave in my bathroom.</li>
<li> it did not work, it does not warm to right temp.</li>
<li> , I had to pass the wax bottle under running water for a little while to cool it off a little.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think the expensive warmers are worth the price if this one does exactly the same thing for way less money than the branded</li>
<li> , I left it for a long time but because I was busy and had read other reviews saying to leave it at least 40 mins, but I think I left it even longer, but was way to much</li>
<li> Wax was ready to go in less than 30 minutes, cap fits tight, long cord...</li>
<li> I just waxed my legs in less than half the time of the traditional stick and pot method.  </li>
<li> Exactly as I expected!</li>
<li> I did leave it plugged in for about 2 hours before I started because of other reviews</li>
<li> I did got a little irritated</li>
<li> *** product..extremely waste..</li>
<li> It is not much good without refills and Amazon needs to look into this and take products out of their site if the sellers don&#x27;t provide all the parts you need.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used wax products for over 10 years and this is by far the worst one.</li>
<li> this thing is really sucks!!</li>
<li> and I ended up having parts of my arm covered with cold wax that was difficult to remove.</li>
<li> but I had no problems with the wax being too cold.</li>
<li> Never heated the wax, it is awful, don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
<li> I was using one of those rollons that you put on the microwave, which I was taking to the bathroom and before 10 minutes it was cold</li>
<li> It makes wax cold and once i applied it was pulling my hair not warming at all.</li>
<li> What the crap!?</li>

    <li> This thing is AWESOME!!! I just waxed my legs in less than half the time of the traditional stick and pot method.  I did leave it plugged in for about 2 hours before I started because of other reviews but I had no problems with the wax being too cold. It was the perfect temp.</li>
    <li> It takes too much to warm up in my opinion but it&#x27;s a good product, safe and comfortable to use, it has a very good price</li>
    <li> Very good . And very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Since I wrote the first review they have put the wax cartridges available to buy below the item. I wish they would have had the cartridges for sale as they do now. So I have changed the number of stars because it does seem very handy and I might go back and buy this again.  The item was larger than I pictured so it would be used more for legs and maybe underarm, not face. But it doesn&#x27;t come with any wax! Not only does it not have wax, but I couldn&#x27;t find any to buy!. It is not much good without refills and Amazon needs to look into this and take products out of their site if the sellers don&#x27;t provide all the parts you need. It doesn&#x27;t have much in the way of instructions and there are no papers or strips or anything to go with it. Try something else.</li>
    <li> What the crap!? Either it&#x27;s user error or this thing is really sucks!! I&#x27;ve used wax products for over 10 years and this is by far the worst one. It takes a really long time for the wax to warm up. No big deal I guess but once it&#x27;s nice and warm the wax does roll on like it should. I knew that.there wasn&#x27;t a temperature gage on it but I moved forward with the purchase anyways. I really regret buying this applicator and a wax to fit in it as it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I had this item plugged in for over an hour and it was not near being warm.  After this one hour of waiting, I tried the roller and I ended up having parts of my arm covered with cold wax that was difficult to remove. Luckily it was too cold to roll  much, so I did not have to clean a huge portion of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Before buying the product I read some good and some bad reviews but I hoped the good ones are more true because not everyone can be satisfied but it was a mistake.I decided I will spend more money on electricity if I use it so I just put it back in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy it, it is like having $15 and throwing it on the street.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. We did not expect that quality is going to be as such because of the good price. We were surprised!</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC and works like a charm! Takes awhile to heat up but I always plug it in an hour before I use it just to make sure it perfect</li>
    <li> It works fine but it doesn&#x60;t hold the wax container inside, so it keeps falling.</li>
    <li> Just ok, doesn&#x27;t get overly hot have to let it warm up for a long time.</li>
    <li> I received this product yesterday, I am from Costa Rica, I used it a couple of hours ago with excellent results, the price is really  really really amazing, I found similar product in the store here in Costa Rica for $120 USD. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> The machine works perfectly but it takes about 45 min to an hour, depending on the wax, to heat it up. So you just need to set it up an hour before you plan to do the waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I used to have one, and it also took a while to heat the wax, so Im used to it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected! Very good product, strongly recommended!</li>
    <li> this does exactly what i had hoped for...the only draw back is that you need to plug it in a long time before you want to use it, because it takes it a long time to heat up a full bottle of wax.</li>
    <li> Not easy to use, sticky and doesn&#x27;t give good results.</li>
    <li> Received this yesterday and used it last night, it was great, i love the size is big enough to hold the 16 oz. I bought the 8oz clean and easy to give it a try, and it was great, easy and extremely clean and fast to do. I was using one of those rollons that you put on the microwave, which I was taking to the bathroom and before 10 minutes it was cold so I had to put my clothes on, to go back to the microwave to heat it again, anyways this is way better because i don&#x27;t have to be running to the microwave to reheat it, and I don&#x27;t know about you, but I am poor and don&#x27;t have a microwave in my bathroom. :p&lt;br /&gt;The first leg I did got a little irritated and I didn&#x27;t pull all the hairs out, for the second leg I was an expert and it just felt so smooth and nice, it was red but used Vaseline and today just looks great.  I don&#x27;t think the expensive warmers are worth the price if this one does exactly the same thing for way less money than the branded ones.&lt;br /&gt;It warmed the wax great, I left it for a long time but because I was busy and had read other reviews saying to leave it at least 40 mins, but I think I left it even longer, but was way to much, I had to pass the wax bottle under running water for a little while to cool it off a little.  I am sure that with around 30 mins of warming the wax, would be good enough.&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.  It is very good</li>
    <li> Item is very easy to hold  and it  makes the waxing mess free.Keeps the wax at the right temp. and it won&#x27;t burn your skin. With this the waxing is easy and quick. I have used heating pot thing but this is very convenient and easy to use.</li>
    <li> excellent product until now</li>
    <li> Such a s*** product..extremely waste..I don&#x27;t have words for it..thermostat is waste...unable to heat wax,even though I kept for two hours..wasted my money..</li>
    <li> I have bought this to use instead of heating in microwave it did not work, it does not warm to right temp. It makes wax cold and once i applied it was pulling my hair not warming at all.</li>
    <li> This works fine for me !! Its convenient to use !</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed! Wax was ready to go in less than 30 minutes, cap fits tight, long cord...one thing I should mention is 2 different brand waxes fit nice and snug in the warmer but 1 brand didn&#x27;t. It would slide out if tipped. So, either you need to hold it so one finger is on the side edge or...take a bread tie or Bobby pin and anchor it in there. Either way, this thing got to a perfect temp and stayed there, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Never heated the wax, it is awful, don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
    <li> Thank you, I received my order quickly but it works on itself until tested.</li>
    <li> This really works on heating the wax but it can take an hour. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to save money on waxing!!</li>
    <li> is not done very well and the wax contaneir does not fit all the type of wax</li>
