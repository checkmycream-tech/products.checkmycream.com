      <li>I pretty much love all things Mychelle.</li>
      <li>I was excited but for some reason my eyes started to sting as soon as I applied this product on my face(not close to my eyes).  </li>
      <li>I wear this every single day, and it has great UV/UB blocking capabilities.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this as I&#x27;ve heard great things about other Mychelle products.</li>
      <li>Also, I now use the whole line of Mychelle products and my face has never looked better.</li>
      <li>Very good not oily doesn&#x27;t pale you out</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a great product, but my skin reacted pretty negatively to it.  </li>
      <li>like how quickly it absorbed into my skin</li>
      <li>On the plus side, I have had success using it as a moisturizer when I mix it with a peptide and rosehip oil.</li>
      <li>It is actually very absorbing.</li>
      <li>I am fair and am outside a lot at high altitude and this sunblock offers instant and really effective protection, but does so without chemicals that can sting your eyes.  </li>
      <li>I love this daily sunscreen...</li>
      <li>My first MyChelle product</li>
      <li>Thanks MyChelle!</li>
      <li>this stuff keeps working well for me, its an absolute keeper!</li>
      <li>It feels a bit sticky at first</li>
      <li>(Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, of course, but I find that if I put on more than that amount at one time, it just doesn&#x27;t blend and I look pretty chalky.)</li>
      <li>and I had loved this product so much in the past</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>and it worked very well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It seems to provide oil control benefits or something, because I didn&#x27;t really have to blot or touch up my makeup all day.</li>
      <li>I believe the company to be ethical and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-No sunscreen smell or other funky smells :)</li>
      <li>I was worried about it being hard to rub in as many mineral sunscreens are, but this product blends in easily, quickly, and without any whiteness.  </li>
      <li>all natural sunscreen do this now because the nano technology is no longer allowed or considered &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended for anyone looking for a non-toxic sunscreen.</li>
      <li>It was still gentle on my sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I am in my early 60s, and Mychelle really helps.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen definitely feels worth the price in quality and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gives full coverage,  feels a little thick going on but then settles in quite nicely.</li>
      <li>This is a great sunscreen, and I like using mineral sunscreens over artificial chemical ones.</li>
      <li>It is going to get pricey if you frequently reapply during sun exposure.</li>
      <li>I used to use an alcohol-based deodorant and started getting severe, frequent migraines, which stopped after I discontinued use of the deodorant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First off, I did order this directly from Mychelle&#x27;s website.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not as much as I can when I have used the Mychelle Daily defense spf 17.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far</li>
      <li>thin and absorbed quickly no bad</li>
      <li>I was looking for a facial mineral sunscreen that was also made of natural inactive ingredients because my skin is quite sensitive.  </li>
      <li>the best:&lt;br /&gt;-truly broad spectrum, protecting from UVA and UVB damage&lt;br</li>
      <li>After learning about the dangerous chemicals in most mainstream sunscreens (check out the EWG&#x27;s website if you&#x27;re not familiar), and after learning that zinc oxide is the preferable mineral sunscreen agent, I&#x27;ve been testing healthy, natural sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I used other products that didn&#x27;t help whatsoever, although they had higher SPF.  </li>
      <li>I have used this for years; it is recommended by my niece who is a buyer for personal and body care at a major natural foods grocery chain AND by my dermatologist.  </li>
      <li>and I am picky about only using natural products.</li>
      <li>I live on a farm and work outside daily under some unreal weather conditions.</li>
      <li>I feel like the consistency has changed over the past few months of owning it, which isn&#x27;t a total surprise with more natural products.</li>
      <li>Other than that, I do really like it and use it exclusively as my facial sunscreen.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the idea of this product that it&#x27;s a healthy sun screen, but the consistency isn&#x27;t great. It&#x27;s a matte finish but easily scrapes or rubs off.</li>
    <li> I had trouble finding sunscreens because they usually are 1) too greasy 2) the wrong type of protection 3) leaves a white mark on the skin (I&#x27;m looking at you, Badger and California Baby) or 4) irritates my skin and makes me turn red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This solves all four of those issues! I&#x27;m unusually pale for an Asian person, so white streaks make me look like a ghost. My face no longer turns red  or greasy. Thanks MyChelle!</li>
    <li> I wear this every single day, and it has great UV/UB blocking capabilities.  I have super pale skin and hyperpigmentation, and I need this badly.  I used other products that didn&#x27;t help whatsoever, although they had higher SPF.  This is a great sunscreen, and I like using mineral sunscreens over artificial chemical ones.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It goes on smoothly on your face and their is no whitish mask afterwards.  There is no smell to it either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got oily skin and sun protection on my face usually makes me break out. Not so with this product. It also goes on smoothly and blends nicely. The secret to blending this stuff is to dot a very little bit (maybe 3-4 millimeters) in a couple of spots and then smooth over your skin. (Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, of course, but I find that if I put on more than that amount at one time, it just doesn&#x27;t blend and I look pretty chalky.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great product, but my skin reacted pretty negatively to it.  I started to get some clogged pores and had to stop using it.  Once I stopped everything cleared up.</li>
    <li> The MyChelle line of products are free of the chemicals banned by the EU! This is a very smooth lotion which I use after toning and before make-up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every SPF on the shelves at Whole Foods, and this one is absolutely the best! After learning about the dangerous chemicals in most mainstream sunscreens (check out the EWG&#x27;s website if you&#x27;re not familiar), and after learning that zinc oxide is the preferable mineral sunscreen agent, I&#x27;ve been testing healthy, natural sunscreens. Here&#x27;s why this one is the best:&lt;br /&gt;-truly broad spectrum, protecting from UVA and UVB damage&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t exacerbate acne, but actually seems to soothe and minimize existing skin irritations&lt;br /&gt;-is not shiny or greasy, and acts as an excellent primer under makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo, MyChelle.</li>
    <li> I love this daily sunscreen...my husband even uses it. It gives full coverage,  feels a little thick going on but then settles in quite nicely.</li>
    <li> I used this on my face while at the beach and it worked very well. I missed some at my hairline and burned, but everywhere else did not burn. It seemed to stay on well enough to prevent the rest of my face from burning, even with dips in the ocean!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and I really like it. The texture is great and I don&#x27;t think this is too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> For those of you who do not use sunblock but sunscreen, give this a try.  I am fair and am outside a lot at high altitude and this sunblock offers instant and really effective protection, but does so without chemicals that can sting your eyes.  It also is only zinc oxide, which is the least irritating to skin.  I find I don&#x27;t need to reapply it unless I have been swimming.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years; it is recommended by my niece who is a buyer for personal and body care at a major natural foods grocery chain AND by my dermatologist.  Don&#x27;t forget it on your ears and hands!  It is one of the few sunscreens that does not irritate my eyes when I have on my contact lenses.  I believe the company to be ethical and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Hope it does what it says. No scent so perfect for sensitive skin, no greasy, no heavy feeling. It is actually very absorbing. It is not a moisturizer with SPF (so be mindful) but perfect for sunprotection. I changed from using Devita and 100%pure sun protection products to this since they changed their formula. Very happy with this product at this moment &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I switched to this sunscreen from the John Masters Organics sunscreen which was wonderful, but leaving my face pretty white. I have super-sensitive dry skin and I am picky about only using natural products. I decided to give this sunscreen a try and I love it even more than the John Masters. My mom tried it and said that it left her face feeling dry and tight, but I use argan oil underneath it and haven&#x27;t felt any dryness with this product. I have also not felt any stinging sensation which I experience with most sunscreens. This sunscreen definitely feels worth the price in quality and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This year I received two tubes of this product that were from the same bad batch. They went on very white and were very difficult to rub in. It was still gentle on my sensitive skin and I had loved this product so much in the past that I kept using it despite the difference. Thankfully I just received a tube from a different batch number and it worked like I previously remembered. Also, I now use the whole line of Mychelle products and my face has never looked better. Despite their inconsistencies I&#x27;ll be sticking with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2015:  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with consistency for the past couple of years. My review is back up to five stars. This sunscreen continues to be the best natural sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried and I always keep an extra tube in hand. Goes on smooth, hydrates without being oily, and disappears into my skin immediately. Of course, great sun protection that has kept my skin tone fair and even. Mychelle rocks!</li>
    <li> No nasty chemicals, goes on smooth, and provides good protection. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a non-toxic sunscreen. My first MyChelle product but now I&#x27;m purchasing more because all their products are phthalate and paraben free.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I live on a farm and work outside daily under some unreal weather conditions. Bright direct sun is no match for this sunscreen. I go to the Cleveland Clinic for some prior sun cancers and have tried even the sunscreens that they gave me, but this is the best ever. It stays on even in a sweat, and all day. No odor , no stinging of the eyes or face. Glad I found this.</li>
    <li> I pretty much love all things Mychelle. I am in my early 60s, and Mychelle really helps. This product is one reason I used &amp;#34;pretty much&amp;#34; as a qualifier. Although it is a light and pleasant cream and I am sure it does an excellent job of screening the sun, it does tend to flake a while after application. This isn&#x27;t a flurry or anything terribly noticeable, but it does sort of roll off if I scratch my face. Other than that, I do really like it and use it exclusively as my facial sunscreen. I trust Mychelle products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on all the good reviews.  I was excited but for some reason my eyes started to sting as soon as I applied this product on my face(not close to my eyes).  I have tried it 3 times and it happened every time.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and not sure why this is happening to me.  Maybe a bad batch?</li>
    <li> One of my two favorite zinc sun products right now. It rates a four for me. It is going to get pricey if you frequently reapply during sun exposure. I try to use screen twice a day in  the summer, and that is still $. Another negative is that I can feel my skin try to perspire underneath the layer of product. Not as much as I can when I have used the Mychelle Daily defense spf 17. On the plus side, I have had success using it as a moisturizer when I mix it with a peptide and rosehip oil. I have also had no issues using eye creams or makeup with it.</li>
    <li> It is not greasy, does not break me out, and hardly leave any white residue (but if you look close like me you know you look a little pale once you applied this- all natural sunscreen do this now because the nano technology is no longer allowed or considered &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34;).  I like that it does not have titanium dioxide so that my skin does not get dry.  It seems to have good quality ingredients for your skin too.</li>
    <li> I may have received a faulty product, because the sunscreen I received is runny, smells odd, and feels awful when applied. The other reviews suggest that the consistency and smell of my product (purchased from Amazon) is not usual. The last time I tried using it, my skin began to sting and I had to wash it off. I checked the expiration, and it was okay, so maybe it&#x27;s an issue with quality control. Regardless, I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> which is good coz i&#x27;m allergic to it so this product has the best ingredient for my skin! and the scientist said the zinc oxide is safer than titanium dioxide and cover both UVA UVB thanks for this wonderful sunblock</li>
    <li> This used to be my favorite sunscreen - it was so light yet felt like it was still moisturizing my skin without being sticky. On top of all that, it had no objectionable ingredients. Sadly MyChelle decided to fix what wasn&#x27;t broken and changed the formulation, and now the first inactive ingredient is alcohol. Why??? I used to use an alcohol-based deodorant and started getting severe, frequent migraines, which stopped after I discontinued use of the deodorant. So, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to try this. Not to mention that rubbing alcohol is a petroleum-based product.</li>
    <li> Ive only been using this product for a few days now but I am impressed with it already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I did order this directly from Mychelle&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how quickly it absorbed into my skin and I didn&#x27;t have to waste time waiting around before applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to provide oil control benefits or something, because I didn&#x27;t really have to blot or touch up my makeup all day. This is a big plus!&lt;br /&gt;Consistency is light and non greasy/runny. Also non irritating to my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-No white cast left behind on the face or balling up when blending.&lt;br /&gt;-No sunscreen smell or other funky smells :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far its the best natural sunscreen I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this stuff keeps working well for me, its an absolute keeper!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this as I&#x27;ve heard great things about other Mychelle products. I feel like the consistency has changed over the past few months of owning it, which isn&#x27;t a total surprise with more natural products. I&#x27;ve tried mixing it up in case anything settled but that didn&#x27;t fix the consistency issue. Moreover, it&#x27;s hard to rub in, feels too thick once it&#x27;s on and gives my skin a slight rubbery texture. Just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
    <li> Very good not oily doesn&#x27;t pale you out&lt;br /&gt;Very thin and absorbed quickly no bad smells&lt;br /&gt;And easy to put make up on</li>
    <li> Perfect under makeup, no stickiness, absorbs into my skin with no residue, does not feel heavy or greasy even u der makep</li>
    <li> Was very excited to try this product.  It&#x27;s fine, but nothing special.  A little thick, a little chalky, but seems to work.  Instructions say to reapply every hour, which is inconvenient but common with mineral sunscreen.  I will continue trying others and have found EWG.org as a guide!</li>
    <li> mychelle brand gets good ratings on ewg,org  ewg &#x3D;  environmental working group</li>
    <li> I was looking for a facial mineral sunscreen that was also made of natural inactive ingredients because my skin is quite sensitive.  I was worried about it being hard to rub in as many mineral sunscreens are, but this product blends in easily, quickly, and without any whiteness.  It feels a bit sticky at first but once it is completely dried it is not sticky anymore. And personally I prefer a little sticky/matte to the super shiny oil slick my last sunscreen left.</li>
