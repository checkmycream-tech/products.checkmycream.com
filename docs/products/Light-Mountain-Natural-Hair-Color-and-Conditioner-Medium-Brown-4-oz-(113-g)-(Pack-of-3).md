    <li> Unlike most of my \\&quot;40 something\\&quot; peers, my hair is shinier and healthier than ever. This completely natural hair coloring requires some effort. It also requires some commitment because you can&#x27;t go back and forth between Henna and commercial colorants. But if you want hair that looks like you are still in your 20&#x27;s - get this product - and wash your hair only with Baby Poof Organic Shampoo. You will be amazed what leaving behind all those chemicals does for your appearance. I&#x27;m not even going to mention how dangerous those chemicals are. Don&#x27;t put anything on your body you wouldn&#x27;t eat. Your skin absorbs it  - and we have an epidemic of cancer. Stay safe, stay natural.  A couple of hints I&#x27;ve learned over the years - 1) to minimize the grassy smell (actually I don&#x27;t mind the grassy smell that much - I just like the deeper color from the coffee), and to also deepen the color beautifully, add a tablespoon full of coffee. Caffeine is great for hair. Organic coffee (not decaf) is best. 2) To make it less grainy, combine with a small amount of agar agar. Agar Agar is a seaweed that serves as a natural binder. It is expensive - I only use a small amount, about 1/2 tsp., and I keep it in the freezer. It lasts a long time and it makes the consistency much less lumpy. 3) To help rinse out the lumps that do remain, I put on some conditioner. The key is not to put the conditioner on the roots, just the sides of your hair. My favorite conditioner is Amazon Organics Volumizing Conditioner, Kava and Lemongrass with Lavender. 4) Finally, make sure the henna does not touch metal. I combine the henna with hot water in a glass bowl with the spoonful of coffee, the 1/2 tsp (roughly) of agar agar, and let it sit for at least an hour, then apply it with a plastic brush specially made for putting on hair dye. I keep it on for about 1 1/2 hours, and I do this 2x a month. I know, it sounds like a lot, but it is SO, SO worth it!! Not to mention - incredibly cheap compared to salon coloring!</li>
    <li> Love it! So easy to use and great color!</li>
    <li> It was on time, exactly as It said it would. Simply did not work for me!... at least, my hair is shining.</li>
    <li> Tired of using the harsh commercial chemical dyes and concerned about possible health risks, I ordered this product directly from the manufacturer.  It came in a very timely manner - about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the mixture looking and smelling like rotten, putrid spinach, there&#x27;s nothing negative I can say about it. Sure, it got a little messy during the application and I did dribble a bit here and there but I cleaned both my countertop and towel right away with a bit of water and there was no staining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the mixture in my hair an additional 20 minutes over the recommnended time and my hair is EXACTLY the color I desired.  Now I just have to see how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was very satisfied with Light Mountain and will definitely try it again....</li>
    <li> I used 3 boxes at once because I have very long hair (past mid back).  I mixed and let sit for a while to develop and left in my hair overnight.  I rinsed my hair outside with a hose because I couldn&#x27;t imagine all of that \\&quot;mud\\&quot; going down my shower drain.  I did further rinsing after applying conditioner in the shower.  You are supposed to wait before washing, but even days later after washing I would find small grassy looking pieces in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I think I need to have a finer sifted henna the next time I use it.  I do plan on using a henna blend again, but it needs to have a finer sift and no grass!  Plus I didn&#x27;t pay attention that this does not cover grays which I need for the front of my hairline.</li>
    <li> I think buyers should realize that this is not a quick chemical hair dye, but definitely a longer and messier process. It was my first time using it and I was a little skeptical, but now I&#x27;m hooked! I had very processed and dry hair with a lot of brassy tones peaking through. I mixed the henna with strong coffee instead of water and let it set only for 15 minutes. I applied with a fan brush and fingers, making sure that my bathroom floor was protected and my face was covered with some oil to prevent stains. I left it on for 4 hours, rinsed and conditioned, and shampooed the next day. The smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as others have described, and while your hair will look greasy until the 24hr shampoo, it&#x27;s really not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Now, my color is a rich natural brown with some red undertones, and it&#x27;s so much softer and smoother. Everyone thinks I&#x27;ve had a keratin treatment or some kind of spa treatment, while I only shampooed my hair and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a henna product. It&#x27;s actually a very involved process, and can get pretty messy. I followed the instructions exactly, with the exception of doing a test strand (for allergic reactions) but the color didn&#x27;t really come through. Maybe due to my dark hair.    I&#x27;ll give it another try but will make some changes to how I put it on my hair, like using a comb, for instance...and standing on an old towel or something so that the henna doesn&#x27;t roll off of my hair &amp; onto my floor staining it.  Oh yes, it stains, so make sure your ears and hairline are lined w. some kind of vaseline (I&#x27;d used a hair polish since I didn&#x27;t have any!)    Overall, pros of using this product outweigh the cons - it&#x27;s good for the environment, good for your skin, makes hair feel good (I also have hair loss issues).</li>
    <li> Messy process but I think it&#x27;s worthwhile. It&#x27;s cheap and so much healthier than most salon products or the box dye crap that may  compromise your health and tends to look synthetic anyway. My hair definitely soaks this muddy stuff up, it covers my few grays, and makes my brassy hair a nice rich, natural looking brown. It&#x27;s smells kinda spinachy, I added some clove essential oil this last time,  it was better but still stinky, although the next day a coworker told me I smelled good (go figure). I recommend it, just be neat, methodical and patient. Anything good is worth working for. BTW, this stuff makes my hair super soft, it&#x27;s growing like crazy too.</li>
    <li> The mixing instructions are more than I expected. Boil water, add other random ingredients if desired, don&#x27;t use metal bowl or mixing spoon, use only distilled water, cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit... But i did it. The mixture turned a nice chocolate brown color and I applied it to my hair. It felt like I was applying a clay mask to my hair. Pretty thick and tangled hair instantly. And yes it did smell like seaweed. But I did it, and waited 10 minutes with my hair under shower cap with blow dryer. At this point my hands were still clean because I wore gloves as instructed. When I got in the shower to rinse, that brief time getting the gunk out of my hair stained my fingernails (lasted a couple days). The resulting color was a medium-dark brown that was pretty solid and not very multi dimensional but a nice color. The gray coverage was okay. I still have a few grays that didn&#x27;t take color. (my gray level is just a tad more than you would ever want to try and pluck out of your head). I went to sleep that night and woke up still bothered by the seaweed smell of my hair and sprayed perfume in my hair so I could fall to sleep. Two days later my nails are almost a normal color and I am happy enough with my color but I don&#x27;t think it was worth the whole fiasco. Almost, but just not quite.</li>
    <li> I put this product on my hair for 2 hours.  I had highlights, which turned a brownish orange, which I am ok with.  My normal is hair is a medium brown, but it turned it to a dark brown, which I don&#x27;t like, but it will wash out over time.  When I saw it was too dark, I hopped in the shower and shampooed it, which lightened it up a bit.  This product does not cover gray.  I am not sure if I will try it again, mostly because of the mess.  I can&#x27;t imagine trying to get the henna out with long hair.  I have short hair and had to scrub it out.</li>
    <li> Love this product because as it washes out, a little bit of gray begins to show and there is not a strong line where dye ends and natural hair starts.  It has a nice herbal smell, some might not like but it is so much better than chemical smells of other products..  I love being able to add egg yokes or yogurt options suggested.  My hair always feels so shiny and full after using this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using henna for many years now and would never go back to the old peroxide type again.  The color is very natural, lasts longer than other coloring methods, and when it does fade, it&#x27;s very subtle.  My hair is healthy and I don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative as hair color.  A little harder to use than the chemical hair colorings, but much safer.  Color lasts for weeks, well longer than a month.  The lighter colors do not &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; on my hair.  Medium brown works very well.  I also like the instructions that suggest using additional natural ingredients (paprika, for instance) to get different highlights.</li>
    <li> packaging is minimal. i quit chemically coloring my hair and was looking for an alternative that produced good results. i have had great luck with this henna. i&#x27;m covering gray. i added 1 tablespoon indigo and 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar to the mix. i feel the henna looks close to my original hair color. the roots actually last longer than professional chemical color. i left in my hair for 45 minutes. it turned out great. the first time i used the henna, i thought it would be hard to mix. it really was not.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair coloring product. All natural, no chemicals, not difficult to use, and very economical. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years, I believe it is the best you can buy. I was at the doctors office today, the staff and the Doctor said how do you get your hair so shiney? It looks awesome! Thanks Light Mountain Henna I love what you do for me!</li>
    <li> SOLD! Thank you everyone for leaving reviews, cause I would have been to nervous to buy this otherwise, which is why I want to share my experience as well. My hair turned out GORGEOUS, and soft, and the color is so pretty, and my curls are perfect and not frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I have naturally curly, fairly thick mid-back length hair. My hair was recently ruined at a cheap hair salon with an awful chemical dye. I wasn&#x27;t even lightening my hair, I was trying to go darker, and left the end light for an ombre effect.  I do not know what I was thinking, and am now very skeptical of yelp reviews. Anyhow, I tried so many deep conditioning treatments, and my hair just wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; it was fried and felt like hay. I used coconut oil, and several expensive deep conditoning treatments to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to Light Mountain (Medium Brown) experience:&lt;br /&gt;My steps:&lt;br /&gt;- I used a large glass bowl and wooden spoon (expect your spoon to get stained).&lt;br /&gt;- One package of the powder.&lt;br /&gt;- 1 egg&lt;br /&gt;- Coffee instead of water&lt;br /&gt;- Nutmeg, cinnamon &amp; ginger spices for scent and added color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I combined all ingredients very well until it was like a nice thick yogurt consistency. I covered in plastic wrap and let &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;(Even though I add the spices, the mix still smells VERY earthy, like grass. You will smell this on your hair for a day, don&#x27;t stress, it goes away).&lt;br /&gt;2. I washed my hair and made sure there wasn&#x27;t any products or conditioners in my hair, and combed it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;3. I put a couple old towels down and wore an old tshirt, since I heard it can get messy.&lt;br /&gt;4. I applied vaseline around my hairline, neck &amp; ears prior to putting my gloves on.&lt;br /&gt;5. Using gloves, I started at my roots at my hair line.&lt;br /&gt;- I didn&#x27;t have a coloring brush and just used my hands.&lt;br /&gt;- The consistency of the color is thick enough that it isn&#x27;t drippy.&lt;br /&gt;- I actually just grabbed a handfull and squished it from roots to ends.&lt;br /&gt;- There is enough product to really massage it through all of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Once I felt it was fully through my hair, I squished my hair up into 4 buns around my head and added the cap they provided.&lt;br /&gt;- I used a hairdryer all around my head for about 5 minutes, then tied a grocery bag up and around the cap, so I was double layered.&lt;br /&gt;- btw, there was no mess for me to clean, if you&#x27;re careful, it won&#x27;t be a big deal. I do recommend washing your bowl and spoon soon after you&#x27;re done though for easier clean-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was a bad ombre when I started, so my ends were lighter. I decided to just leave it on for 2 hours, and used the hair dryer every 20 minutes or so to heat up my head. I was mainly using this product to enrich &amp; condition my hair, so i wasn&#x27;t really worried about what color I achieved. I was hoping to get a nice rich chestnut/golden brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 hours I washed it out of my hair, this is a bit more difficult than normal hair dye, as it is basically mud. It was easier than I thought it would be though. For shampoo I used EO Coconut Lemon Bath and Shower Gel &amp; for conditioner I used SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Intensive Strengthening Masque. I left the masque on my hair for 20 minutes. Rinsed and done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair turned out a gorgeous rich chestnut color, my curls are va-va-voom and no frizz. It has been one week, and my hair is still just as vibrant. I use that deep conditioning treatment 1x week, to help tame my mane. For your ladies with straight and wavy hair, obviously you could skip that step and just use your normal shampoo &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER get my hair dyed at a salon or buy crappy boxed stuff. Light Mountain is amazing!roots to ends.&lt;br /&gt;- There is enough product to really massage it through all of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Once I felt it was fully through my hair, I squished my hair up into 4 buns around my head and added the cap they provided.&lt;br /&gt;- I used a hairdryer all around my head for about 5 minutes, then tied a grocery bag up and around the cap, so I was double layered.&lt;br /&gt;- btw, there was no mess for me to clean, if you&#x27;re careful, it won&#x27;t be a big deal.

    <li> You have to be very open minded if you are willing to try this product! Yes, it will be messy! Yes, it doesn&#x27;t smell so good! Smells very grassy and feels like you are putting on mud, but it is henna so what do you expect?! The results vary on your hairs&#x27; texture and if it has been chemically colored. I bought this product because I have been dying my hair (chemically) for years and as you can imagine, my hair is very damaged so I decided to try something natural. I like that the box is the whole kit, comes with the henna, plastic gloves, and plastic cap. Mixing instructions are included and I decided to add a passion tea bag to the water before microwaving it. Once the water boiled, the water was very pinkish-red and mixed the henna with that. My hair turned out beautiful!!! I love it! Looks brown with hints of red &amp;#34;highlights.&amp;#34; Will def be using this firever!!!!</li>
    <li> Not at all satisfied with this product.  Returned for refund</li>
    <li> This stuff has an unbelievably bad smell.  I mixed the powder with water and immediately thought of the elephant exhibit at the zoo.  I am still carrying the smell a day later.  [[ASIN:B001G7Q0LE Light Mountain Natural Hair Color &amp; Conditioner, Medium Brown, 4 oz (113 g) (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> This powdery product came out thick and turned the human virgin non color treated blonde hair green! I do not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying this brand of henna. It gives off a nice dark brown color without being black. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Love this! two years ago I switched from hair lighteners to Henna because the Store boxed hair colors were damaging my hair.  Using Henna is a little more involved than other hair colors, but worth the results,  It took some research to figure out how to best use the Henna. Definately wear gloves and put lotion around you hairline, Throw old towels down on the floor and counter when you are applying.  But it is worth it to save your hair .  And yes, it does cover my grays.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with it I used day old coffee as the liquid added 4tbsp greek yogurt for conditioning also 1tsp ground nutmeg for scent. I colored on June 25th and no sign of gray yet great color and highlights I used med brown very pleased</li>
    <li> Okay, I was really nervous. I&#x27;m a natural dark brunette, and in the past I&#x27;ve colored it blond with highlights, and colored it back to brown. My hair was so damaged I started to taper off on how often I colored it. In an effort to go more natural for the sake of better hair health, I thought I would give henna a try. I was paranoid because I&#x27;ve heard and read some real horror stories about how it can severely damage previously treated hair. And I didn&#x27;t want RED. Light Mountain Natural, is not a &amp;#34;compound&amp;#34; henna I&#x27;ve learned, so it&#x27;s safe to use on previously colored hair. I did not do a strand test. Stupid of me, I know, but due to lack of time, I just took the plunge based on all the positive reviews I read. I did the hot boiling water, &amp;#34;I used bottled water.&amp;#34; And poured it into the henna mixture. I have shoulder length hair now, and half the mixture was more than enough! So unless you have really long hair, divide the package, it will allow you for another future coloring. After pouring the hot water into the mixture, I used a glass bowl and plastic spoon of course, I kept adding water until it was a yogurt like thickness. I then covered the bowl with plastic and walked away for exactly one hour. I then showered, towel dried my hair. The mixture should now look black on top, I poured the mixture into a squeeze bottle for easier application. I covered my head with the plastic, and applied heat from my blow drier for approx. 15 minutes. Then I watched TV for another hour, and showered my hair with warm water. I then used Infusium as a detangler, and combed out all the extra grit, rinsed again, and applied more leave-in conditioner. The shine and bounce in my hair. WOW! And no red, just a really dark brown that gave my hair lots of shine while covering all my greys &amp;#34;which weren&#x27;t many&amp;#34; but the coverage was even better than the box stuff with all the peroxide and drying chemicals. I am sold on henna. I will never let a salon touch my hair again. If you have never used henna before, and you want to focus on hair health and using something more natural, I swear to you this product will not disappoint.n. If you have never used henna before, and you want to focus on hair health and using something more natural, I swear to you this product will not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I loved this product, the color is beautiful and my hair is not brittle anymore. The shipping was fast and I&#x27;ve received the right product and amount. I have my own system of applying and I have no problems. The color last for 3-4 months and with hair washing the subtle reddish highlights are what I was looking for. I am very pleased and I absolutely recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few brands of medium brown.  I prefer this one as it has the least reddish cast to it.  If you&#x27;re looking specifically for red highlights, consider some red-enhancing tricks or another brand.  But for me, who can&#x27;t really pull off the red look, I like this brand of medium brown.</li>
    <li> I have used this color several times now, and have been very pleased with the results. My natural color is medium brown. This henna color is definitely on the warmer side, and I get red highlights in natural sunlight. The color takes two-three days to develop fully after applying; for me, it starts out very dark brown and goes lighter and warmer over the next several days before settling into the final color of warm reddish-bronze brown. This is not a problem for me, as I like the slightly bronze tone. I leave the henna on to process for 2-3 hours, which helps with gray coverage--I&#x27;m about 5% gray. I repeat every 4-6 weeks. I have noticed (and so has my husband!) that my hair is much softer after henna than it used to be after chemical dyes. I will admit, the process is much more involved, not to mention longer and messier, than traditional chemical dyes. That said, I think the benefits are worth it!!</li>
    <li> Does a great job evenly coloring hair - and calms my scalp - color lasts a long time and fades more naturally - no worries about carcinogens on me or dumped into the water system - a little yogurt helps the consistency, the smell and lessens the messiness -wish they&#x27;d figure out a way to remove it&#x27;s aroma though - smells like a grass fire when wet</li>
    <li> I carefully followed each step on the instruction. And I left it on my hair for about an hour. I have tried twice now, none of them cover my gray hair. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used many varieties but keep returning to Light Mountain. You can&#x27;t beat the price and it really does mix easier and smoother than most. As written, henna is not a short process, and it can be quite messy. But the results of not having chemically burnt hair, and a method that actually makes your hair soft as opposed to brittle is so much more desirable. The first time, you may have to use an entire box, but I have shoulder length hair and my follow ups only require a half of a box! I leave it on my hair for 3 hours with great results. If you&#x27;ve never used henna, give Light Mountain a try and see if you don&#x27;t make a change! I don&#x27;t plan on ever going back to chemical hair coloring again.</li>
    <li> Love the color love the price over health food store. Like henna products alot because they are natural.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I&#x27;m in the process of switching all my products over to cruelty free/no animal testing/ingredients. Which takes time, but I have to start somewhere.  My hair was a light/strawberryish brown and I wanted it a medium brown. My hair is now a beautiful shade of medium brown with slight golden highlights. Easy to use, follow the directions. I mixed mine with chai tea and olive oil. Would order this again.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair color the money can buy. I am an Indian man with black hair and this colored my gray hair perfectly to soft black. I love it ! Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Hair is very shiny &amp; pretty. Coppery highlights. Long, messy process but worth it!!  Nourishes hair, doesn&#x27;t damage it.  Smell of hay lasts a few days. Use a nice smelling conditioner to solve that.  I have dark brown hair with 20% gray.  Lt brown or med brown covers the gray.  Darker shades don&#x27;t cover gray, lighter colors do.  Have never found a product that makes my hair look better than this does.  5 stars if it were easier to apply.</li>
    <li> I bought this henna hair color from Action Development Group and have been trying to contact them about a partial return.  It&#x27;s been nearly a month and they seem to be avoiding me.  Think twice before buying from them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for around 4 years and my hair is no longer damaged and broken like it would be from chemical hair color.  It was hard to use initially, but i have the hang of it now. I put a video on You Tube where I show exactly how I use this product, and the before and after.  You can check it out by searching \\&quot;Henna Healthy Hair Color How to Color / Highlight Your Hair \\&quot;</li>
    <li> Yes, the process is messy and time consuming but the result is so much better than using chemical hair dye.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to hair color dye. Love this product.  I get more compliments from this hair color than I ever did for 20 years getting highlights.  Easier to use after use a couple of times. The time is so worth it</li>
    <li> Tried a neutral henna when a bad perm dried and broke my hair and went to the colors when my hair started turning gray. (somewhere in my 20&#x27;s - yes, young.) I&#x27;ve tried the peroxide colors and they dry your hair and cause breakage.  And the peroxide colors always turned the  gray hair orange (not red, orange. Yech!)  Granted the henna can make the gray a more red/brown, but it looks more like highlights than a bad accident.  And the condition of my hair is better (stronger, more body) than I ever got with a peroxide color.  (And the older I get, the more body my hair looses, so it&#x27;s a win/win for me.)  Been using Light mountain most of the time.  Other henna&#x27;s were not as good at coloring or consistant with their color.  For new/ first time users, it&#x27;s time consuming.  I&#x27;ve found that if I make the henna the cosistancy of honey and use a squeese bottle to apply it, it&#x27;s easier to use.  Now (I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s now) I use it more often than I did in my 20&#x27;s, but will keep using it as long as I am able to (mostly because people don&#x27;t know I color my hair!)</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time a couple of weeks ago on my hair and I am overall pleased with the results. It was my first time using a natural henna hair color (I&#x27;ve only used chemical colorants up until now). I wanted to try something natural because my hair is curly, and the chemical colorants fry my hair and often give it an undesirable orangey color. This product gave my hair a very nice brown color and brought out the natural auburn in my hair (looks extra great in the sun!). Also, I&#x27;ve noticed my hair texture is better than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this was my first time, I&#x27;ve learned some things I need to do differently next time. First, I have grays. This product did not cover grays. I&#x27;ll need to try the companion product made by this company called &amp;#34;Cover Your Grays&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ll see if I get good results. Second, it was very messy to apply. I used a pastry brush to apply the product, and I won&#x27;t do that again. Next time I&#x27;m going to put it in an application bottle and squirt it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to using henna is that it&#x27;s messy and time consuming. VERY messy. And it can stain things. So cover your surfaces well and give yourself half a day to color your hair. Also, I find the smell unpleasant. But after a couple of washes, the smell goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I colored my hair and washed and dried it, I looked in the mirror and saw NO DIFFERENCE. I was initially disappointed that I went to so much trouble and it did nothing. But BE PATIENT! Over the next few days, the color matured and the results were very natural yet noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, although this product comes with some hassle I still give it 4 stars because I&#x27;m quite happy with these initial results. I&#x27;ll be using it again in a couple of months and trying a few tricks next time to hopefully make it easier and more effective.</li>
    <li> Loved that I wasn&#x27;t adding chemicals to my hair and it definately covered my beginning Greys! Smell was a little muh but for not using chemicals it was a fair trade off. Took a few days for the smell to go away but overall my hair looks great. Only used half of the bag and it was plenty. It was a little runny and drippy but I could I added something to help that. Overall I love it!</li>
    <li> it works for me! The first time I used is too thick ( not enough hot water ), so it dried out fast while I was still working on the dyeing.And&lt;br /&gt;when I washed my hair , there were so many hard debris  on my hair. It has been so hard to wash out. The collar  of my clothes were being stained. However, the color stayed on well. Messy!&lt;br /&gt;The second time, I put in more hot water and put it sit in the hot water bowl ( double bowl to keep it hot or warm enough for extensional time.&lt;br /&gt;I put the dye one my hair only 2.5 hours with shower cap and a big towel wrapped it up. The dye kept warm easily even in cold day After washing it out, the color is very good and it stay for few weeks ( just the new grey root grows and shows a bit not matching )It is better than Naturtint and Herbatint ( I used them for 4 years and the color could not stay well on my hair ,2 weeks max.  ) So I decide to switch to Light mountain ( mix with Hanna and / or indigo ) It is all nature and no harm to hair. I like it very much. Not really that messy and ,my head feels very warm while the dye on my hair for 2.5 hours. Some review said it is better let the dye stay longer, but it is really OK for just 2.5 hours for my  hair.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mother whom has some troubles with grays, and has had a very bad reaction from some of the more popular hair dyes I will not raise to mention. But she seems to like this very well. It covers the gray amazingly well, staining it seemingly blond in my opinion. All in all a good product, though mess, as with those familiar with hair coloring, is involved.</li>
    <li> not for me, I followed the instruction n let it sit on my hair for more than 3 hours. but my hair color still the same.</li>
    <li> I am delighted with my beautiful hair, but I&#x27;m sad that I let people&#x27;s opinions about henna (it&#x27;s too hard, it&#x27;s too messy, it&#x27;s too RED) stop me from trying this.  My hair is so pretty.  I love it.  I recommend getting the mixture pretty soupy and I did like the consistency better with a few tablespoons of yogurt.  I left it on my, ummmm, brownish, grayish auburn box color nightmare for about two hours.  I used the whole box and piled it on there, wrapped it up, and made breakfast and watched Amazon Instant Videos.  Next time, I will get a mirror for the shower and apply in there to make cleanup easier.  Be open minded and try this and don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment some.  Say no to chemicals!!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping that it will cover my less-than-5% grays however, after my third application, I have realised it is just not going to do it.&lt;br /&gt;It is by no means an amazing conditioner/treatment for the hair. Ever since I started applying this every 4 weeks, my hair has been shedding much much less, it looks healthier and more beautiful than before. It also gives a nice shade of brown - well, I make the mix with pure espresso coffee instead of water so that helps give the lively colour, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;I am sad it does not cover my grays however; all my hopes are now in their other product &amp;#34;color the grays&amp;#34; medium brown; hopefully I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> I read the guides carefully and spent about 3 hours of processing and coloring.  Well, to make a long story short, I had to see a hair stylist the next day.  Still have 2 boxes left.  Won&#x27;t try again.  Not working for me.</li>
    <li> Yarkkkkkk !!!! It is a bad smelling and bad looking product. I will never put that blend in my hair. Disgusting. Sorry but it is true.</li>
    <li> Using henna as hair coloring isn&#x27;t easy or quick and has a tendency to be messy.  There&#x27;s always a learning curve.  I now EXCLUSIVELY use Light Mountain Naturals (Medium Brown), with fantastic results. This product is easy to work with compared with other hennas. I like the powder as opposed to solid hennas that require more prep. I add an egg and a little yogurt for conditioning and moisturizing, and 3 Tbsp cider vinegar for auburn highlights. I usually make this an all-day \\&quot;stay at home spa day\\&quot; event and have learned to minimize the mess. Now it&#x27;s rather fun, and the color LASTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips from a regular user:&lt;br /&gt;1. I generally let the henna mixture sit for at least an hour before applying. It allows the color to begin setting and makes a better consistency to work with.&lt;br /&gt;2. I don&#x27;t just use the hair bag it comes with. I put a plastic grocery bag over it, air squeezed out, and tied at the top to minimize &#x27;drippage.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;3. I leave the henna in my hair for a few hours. Sit back with an old towel in hand, put your feet up, make a cup of tea, and watch a movie.  I use the opportunity to RELAX AND ENJOY the \\&quot;me\\&quot; time.&lt;br /&gt;4. I also use a q-tip to apply to my brows to match color (which is glorious - my brows look amazing).&lt;br /&gt;5. After I rinse out the the henna, I generally do a deep-condition for an hour with Lush&#x27;s \\&quot;Jasmine and Henna Fluff-Eze\\&quot; - it is colorless, but gives hair luster and softness, and smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Then rinse, towel dry (use a dark or an old towel!) and air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color stays for several weeks, and the results are glorious. I get unsolicited compliments on my hair often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re willing to put in the time, the results are worth it. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t discover this till I was 42.  Great stuff. Messy yes.  So what - it&#x27;s better for you, the environment and it makes your hair feel great.</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly, I am glad to be using your medium brown.  Because I once used a bright red color put by mistake in a box of dark brown henna purchased on line, I open all boxes now and compare the colors of the product to make sure I do not accidentally use a color package that is not what I ordered.  The three boxes I ordered from you all appear to be the same color and tone of product.  I aware that the color mistake in packaging as compared to color given on outside of the box is that of the manufacturer and not the seller, nonetheless I like to hereafter double check when an order arrives.  This order is just fine and I thank you for having it as a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> While I was surprised and ok with the final color.  It is not a product I will be using again.  Extremely messy, looks and smells like horse poo. Even after rinsing and conditioning, (which by the way you have to use conditioner if you want to get it all out of you hair) I had to braid my hair to get it away from my face, because my hair smells so bad.  Not real good covering grey either.  I let product cure in bowl for about 25 mins.  Left on hair about 1hr 45 mins.</li>
