      <li>I love Old Spice the best.</li>

      <li>Nothing works better.</li>

      <li>probably I won&#x27;t be buying it any more.</li>
      <li>I will from now on buy this, I love it.</li>
      <li>Many spray deodorants leave you dripping, this does not.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that buy using a spray product that you do not have to worry about deodorant residue of t-shirts/shirts.</li>
      <li>This works much better then the bars (in reducing sweat) for me</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>My favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>Overall very happy with it</li>
      <li>It is more convenient in a can though.</li>
      <li>It does smell good but doesn&#x27;t stop the sweat as much as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>; It&#x27;s a great room deodorizer, particularly for a man&#x27;s room.</li>
      <li>I was relieved to be able to find it and aquire it from this source so easily.</li>
      <li>This is the original bottle which you no longer can buy in most retail stores.</li>
      <li>Was happy to find it on here for about the same price!</li>
      <li>Just like cheap talcum.</li>
      <li>But it is still a good deodorant, just make sure you are wearing white shirts all the time!!</li>
      <li>It has more aluminum chlorohydrate than Right Guard and I like the aroma.</li>
      <li>Like it as it has a perfect smell and really keeps me dry all day.</li>
      <li>The original Old Spice spray, years ago, was a good smelling clear liquid that was effective..</li>
      <li>First time I have used a spray deodorant in years,and I love it,</li>
      <li>first only my husband used it, but it smelled so good and worked so well that i started using it! :</li>
      <li>But on the good side I love the scent and when I contacted amazon customer service they gave me partial refund.</li>
      <li>And the pure sport scent is my favorite.</li>
      <li>My son has tried many different anti-perspirants, but find Old Spice High Endurance works best.  </li>
      <li>it works good for short time..</li>
      <li>Nothing much to say except, one them was defective and its a non returnable item (even if you are a Prime member).If you read one or two star reviews you&#x27;ll find out that this problem is with most of the orders.</li>
      <li>While this product does smell good, it leaves a white spotting on your shirts, so</li>
      <li>Clean fresh scent...</li>
      <li>I think OLD SPICE is dropping the ball for not making this deodorant more available.</li>
      <li>Seller was quick, and priced well, however one of the three cans was defective, (ie after shaking and checking the valve, nothing happens when depressed).</li>
      <li>They are always delivered quickly and never any issues with spray nozzles.  </li>
      <li>Next I tried the Old Spice and LOVED it!</li>
      <li>This is the only kind of deodorant my husband likes.</li>
      <li>Satisfied with the Old Spice</li>
      <li>,A value two ways and worth the price.</li>
      <li>AND IT NOT ONLY HAS A NICE AROMA</li>
      <li>I used to think that the summer suffering in the deeper south was due to heat, but after using this product I discovered that most of my summer suffering came from sweat discomfort, notably under my arms.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It dries pretty quick like within 10 seconds.</li>
      <li>This was just what I wanted at the right price and the delivery was very fast.</li>
      <li>I tried Right Gaurd Sport first but didn&#x27;t like the smell of it.</li>
      <li>the positive thing is you still smell fresh even if you keep sweating.</li>
      <li>my feet stay warm and dry and as an added bonus my socks/feet don&#x27;t stink at the end of a day on my feet!</li>
      <li>I have used many different deodorants over the years.</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what is made to do.  </li>
      <li>My first experience with it</li>
      <li>Shipped Quickly, Exactly as Described.  </li>
      <li>This is the only deodorant I&#x27;ve been able to find that I&#x27;m not allergic to.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing grapesy fruitsy, nutsy, leathery, stable old boxing glove or jock about it, just a clean scent that suggest a man or men but doesn&#x27;t blunt your nose.</li>
      <li>Good scent but not the same as the stick with the same brand name &amp; scent name.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for a long time and it is excellent but is hard to find.  </li>
      <li>Only down side, I think you use more of it than you would use with the stick, therefore buying it more often.</li>
      <li>Old spice is Old spice...smells good but doesn&#x27;t keep me as dry as the solids.  </li>
      <li>you absolutely need this</li>
      <li>he it keeps him from sweating too much</li>
      <li>I am unaware of any current source for the true Old Spice scent (this is one of many I have tried).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find locally, so I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>had high expectation from it...</li>
      <li>WHile it does not quite last as long as the stick variety, I like it better.  </li>
      <li>Good (not great)</li>
      <li>This deodorant can not be found where I live.</li>
      <li>Oh yeah; the spray on aerosol is quick and goes on dry.  </li>
      <li>My fiance uses Old Spice spray and</li>
      <li>It really lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>the scent is not durable like other old spice products I am aware of.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I HAVE USED THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT FOR A LONG TIME</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This works much better then the bars (in reducing sweat) for me and It seems impossible to find spray that is Anti-Perspirant anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries pretty quick like within 10 seconds.</li>
    <li> Seller was quick, and priced well, however one of the three cans was defective, (ie after shaking and checking the valve, nothing happens when depressed).</li>
    <li> THis is my second order of the aerosol.  WHile it does not quite last as long as the stick variety, I like it better.  Only down side, I think you use more of it than you would use with the stick, therefore buying it more often.</li>
    <li> the scent is not durable like other old spice products I am aware of.&lt;br /&gt;I had high expectation from it... it works good for short time..</li>
    <li> My fiance uses Old Spice spray and he it keeps him from sweating too much and it smells great. It is impossible to find in stores, so I buy it by the case for him online.</li>
    <li> I live in the southern half of Mississippi, and previously used deoderants without antiperspirant.  I used to think that the summer suffering in the deeper south was due to heat, but after using this product I discovered that most of my summer suffering came from sweat discomfort, notably under my arms.  Since I started using this product, I smell great and I&#x27;m tasked to find sweat of any kind under my arms.  The outdoor temperature feels at least 5 to 10 degrees cooler as a result.  Oh yeah; the spray on aerosol is quick and goes on dry.  A+</li>
    <li> They are always delivered quickly and never any issues with spray nozzles.  I often buy these from a local drugstore only to find the nozzle broken.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> I have been using old spice for 45 years and it is hard to find. Im happy you sell it.</li>
    <li> Item not matching to the details shows in buying team.</li>
    <li> I really like this brand of deodorant but find it extremely difficult to find in aerosol form. I was relieved to be able to find it and aquire it from this source so easily.</li>
    <li> i bought this because i used a similar product before (unfortunately, it was under study, so i don&#x27;t really know what brand it would be coming from). that one was really impressive. kept underarm dry, control odor and i didn&#x27;t notice stains on my white shirts which i have problems with gels and solid sticks. anyway, this product did control odor but not underarm wetness. the positive thing is you still smell fresh even if you keep sweating. i like the scent, lasts long. it still stains white shirts. just like any other aerosol product, i think we have to be careful not to inhale it. one time, i got some nasal irritation.</li>
    <li> Nothing much to say except, one them was defective and its a non returnable item (even if you are a Prime member).If you read one or two star reviews you&#x27;ll find out that this problem is with most of the orders. so, technically its a 2 pack not a three pack. But on the good side I love the scent and when I contacted amazon customer service they gave me partial refund. I hope that helps!</li>
    <li> old spice is the best</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT FOR A LONG TIME AND IT NOT ONLY HAS A NICE AROMA, IT MASKS ANY UNDER ARM ODOR.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for over a year now.  I love the fact that buy using a spray product that you do not have to worry about deodorant residue of t-shirts/shirts. It has a pleasant smell without it being overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and it works great and I like the subscription setup for sure!  Will keep ordering no doubt!</li>
    <li> Old spice is Old spice...smells good but doesn&#x27;t keep me as dry as the solids.  It is more convenient in a can though.</li>
    <li> Not very fragrant. Not what I expected from Old Spice. No spicy finish at all. Just like cheap talcum. Given it away as a gift.</li>
    <li> Shipped Quickly, Exactly as Described.  A Great Deal.</li>
    <li> I just cant stop re-ordering this! first only my husband used it, but it smelled so good and worked so well that i started using it! :p&lt;br /&gt;great product!!!!!!!! i hope it doesnt get discontinued because i cant find it in cvs!</li>
    <li> Good (not great) antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just too bad that the original Old Spice scent is merely a memory.  I am unaware of any current source for the true Old Spice scent (this is one of many I have tried).</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product goes on sticky, just as well use a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; stick and save having to inhale the fumes!</li>
    <li> Like it as it has a perfect smell and really keeps me dry all day. Overall very happy with it</li>
    <li> I was having a hard time finding the Old Spice product in Louisville since Kroger&#x27;s discontinued carrying product.  Drug stores never did care this product in the Louisville market.  This was just what I wanted at the right price and the delivery was very fast.</li>
    <li> Many spray deodorants leave you dripping, this does not. I watched carefully and the spray comes out much finer than a couple of other brands I&#x27;ve used. Dries instantly which is a change from waiting for some other spray ons to dry. And the scent. There is one but it doesn&#x27;t bust through you&#x27;re shirt to proclaim, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m A Man Dammit&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s subtle, suggestive, masculine but with a gentle promise that it will work, will keep you dry and has you in mind. And then there&#x27;s this; It&#x27;s a great room deodorizer, particularly for a man&#x27;s room. There&#x27;s nothing grapesy fruitsy, nutsy, leathery, stable old boxing glove or jock about it, just a clean scent that suggest a man or men but doesn&#x27;t blunt your nose. I don&#x27;t know of one other mans deodorant with which you can do this but with Old Spice you can. ,A value two ways and worth the price.</li>
    <li> I never used this before. I will from now on buy this, I love it.</li>
    <li> It leaves a white mark and is complety useless.. The return policy is also nt gud for deos.. I m stuck ..</li>
    <li> This deodorant can not be found where I live. I was happy to see it on Amazon and orderesd it. Thank you for having iut.</li>
    <li> This is the original bottle which you no longer can buy in most retail stores. Im glad that amazon sell it because the scent is refreshing but not over whelming. another plus is it doesn&#x27;t leave rashes on the skin like other deodorants  can burn the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over all amazing deodorant,</li>
    <li> for the money is great. when your on the budget you&#x27;re trying to save, this thing does the job. i didn&#x27;t find anything wrong with it. its not 100% for my taste, but hey you cant have everything.</li>
    <li> I actually use this product on my feet! I have suffered for many years from cold feet caused by sweat. In the winter my feet would be cold and my socks would be ice cold and damp from sweat. I tried cornstarch and a roll-on anti-perspirant which helped but made my socks stiff and uncomfortable.  Then I read a remedy using spray. I tried Right Gaurd Sport first but didn&#x27;t like the smell of it. Next I tried the Old Spice and LOVED it! It has more aluminum chlorohydrate than Right Guard and I like the aroma. It dries quickly and leaves behind a little powder. Used along with cornstarch my feet stay warm and dry and as an added bonus my socks/feet don&#x27;t stink at the end of a day on my feet! Of course i use it on my &#x27;pits too!</li>
    <li> Good scent but not the same as the stick with the same brand name &amp; scent name.  It does smell good but doesn&#x27;t stop the sweat as much as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant. I love the smell and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This has been used for years by men and still around so is good, my hubby and brother use it</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of deodorant my husband likes. It has a nice smell and my husband says its the best working stuff out of all the ones he uses. Unfortunately this is impossible to find in our stores so Amazon is the only place we can get it from.</li>
    <li> Nothing works better.</li>
    <li> My mother taught me that spraying your feet after a bath/shower helps keep them from sweating.  What a great tip!  This was a great price and I can have extras on hand.</li>
    <li> Great product that I have used for years. Kroger and Meier have both stopped carrying it. Was happy to find it on here for about the same price!</li>
    <li> Clean fresh scent...a little goes a long way.  I quit using the stick version of this product due to the sticky residue it left under the arms.  This product does exactly what is made to do.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  No clogging. No clumping. Applies evenly on the body. My first experience with it and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. IT STAINS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you absolutely need this, DO NOT let your clothes get in contact with this deodorant till its completely dry.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant I&#x27;ve been able to find that I&#x27;m not allergic to. It&#x27;s hard to find locally, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. Unfortunately, one of the bottles was damaged during shipping to me due to poor packaging (and probably rough handling by the USPS). When I opened it the lid was cracked and the nozzle was broken off. I tried to put the nozzle back on which actually made the bottle start spraying it&#x27;s contents uncontrollably all over the place. It was quite a mess!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the company was great about getting my problem resolved. They responded very quickly to my complaint and offered to refund my order or send me a new bottle. I chose a replacement bottle since I definitely need this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s unfortunate that mine was damaged, I would definitely recommend the product and even the vendor since they took such good care of me.</li>
    <li> While this product does smell good, it leaves a white spotting on your shirts, so probably I won&#x27;t be buying it any more. But it is still a good deodorant, just make sure you are wearing white shirts all the time!!</li>
    <li> No has pressure, is bad product, I had throw away at the trash and lost my money.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry for your merchandise.</li>
    <li> My hubby loves this deodorant but we can only find it at one store! Found it on here 1) cheaper then the store! 2) saves me time from having to drive all out of my way to get it!!</li>
    <li> Smells good works good</li>
    <li> First time I have used a spray deodorant in years,and I love it,won&#x27;t go back!!!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Only issue its barely ever in stock</li>
    <li> Great value for the price on this 3-pack. I generally go for unscented deodorants but am very happy with this mild and pleasant scent. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> My son has tried many different anti-perspirants, but find Old Spice High Endurance works best.  He used to have breakouts from other products, but never with this one.  It works all day, and he&#x27;ll never go back to the other products.</li>
    <li> None of the grocery or drug stores in my area carry this. Thankfully I&#x27;m able to buy this product consistently at an excellent price. This does not leave a mess and it last all day and night! Best sport deodorant!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance !!! Wifey loves it, and so do I.</li>
    <li> The can lasts quite a while and sprays well, but . . .&lt;br /&gt;It smells bad and leaves a sticky residue that is really hard to wash off.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the Old Spice</li>
    <li> The original Old Spice spray, years ago, was a good smelling clear liquid that was effective.. This is a different product that sprays out a white substance. When I sprayed it on my hand, about a half hour later it started to itch. When they have a good product why do they change it.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> not great, besides they cancelled the subscribtion.</li>
    <li> I have used many different deodorants over the years. I love Old Spice the best. And the pure sport scent is my favorite. It really lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time and it is excellent but is hard to find.  It works well on your feet in warm weather.  I think OLD SPICE is dropping the ball for not making this deodorant more available.</li>
