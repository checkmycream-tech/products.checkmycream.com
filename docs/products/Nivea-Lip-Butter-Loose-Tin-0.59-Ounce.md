      <li>Good stuff.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s really good</li>
      <li>This is really good stuff.</li>
      <li>Love the smell more than anything, it feels great and looks great!</li>

      <li>Love this smells so yummy!</li>

      <li>Smells amazing, hydrates lips.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes well and has a nice texture.  </li>
      <li>it is mosturizing and it smells great, the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave an opaque white film on the lip.</li>
      <li>It has a creamy consistency and a nice texture after application.  </li>
      <li>I wish it had a caramel taste as well as smell - not that I&#x27;d be eating it out of the tin, but flavor on your lips is nice.</li>
      <li>It also smells great and has pretty good staying power.  </li>
      <li>Well, I did, and loved the feeling it left on my lips and the smell is great, too!</li>
      <li>It does kind of &#x27;sit&#x27; on top of your lips.</li>
      <li>So while it is a lot of a good product, for a pretty good price, I&#x27;ll never buy this again for sanitary reasons.</li>
      <li>They both smell and taste great and make your lips feel super smooth!</li>
      <li>and I was very impressed, so I went back to the store and bought two Carmel kiss, and one raspberry rose kiss.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s an okay product but for the price I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
      <li>It makes my lips feel great,I use it every day,This is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff is smells so delish</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m used to being able to reach in my purse, grab my chapstick and apply it, while steering and you just can&#x27;t do that with this</li>
      <li>, It smell great,I love it.</li>
      <li>To me, this is more like a lip gloss.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite flavor</li>
      <li>I love Nivea&#x27;s line of lip products (like their [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try more of the flavors because I love Nivea products.</li>
      <li>My lips are so smooth!</li>
      <li>and I love the flavors they come in.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Scent: The caramel vanilla scent of this product is light and pleasant, not overly sweet like many caramel scented products tend to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Feels great on the lips, smells so sweet, and keeps your lips soft all day.</li>
      <li>This works just fine.</li>
      <li>it keeps my lips fresh and healthy all the time</li>
      <li>But overall its a great product.</li>
      <li>líps are always smooth, winner or summer.</li>
      <li>So, if you keep that in mind and buy it with the intent to use it as a gloss you&#x27;ll probably enjoy it.</li>
      <li>I originally ordered this as a &amp;#34;door prize&amp;#34; for an at home party I was having.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I heard about these lip butters because I pretty much love all of Nivea&#x27;s products</li>
      <li>You also get a good amount of product and the tin is a lot bigger than you&#x27;d imagine.</li>
      <li>i use it in regular basis and it&#x27;s much better than chap stick !</li>
      <li>I have bought into the hype on so many lip products and barely any of them besides</li>
      <li>Use it for daytime lip balm and like it very much.</li>
      <li>not any more fantastic than any other lip balm in my opinion.</li>
      <li>: The lip butter is soft and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>In this area the product is exactly what I&#x27;ve come to expect from the Nivea brand.</li>
      <li>I had first bought the Nivea lip butter in Macadamia  </li>
      <li>The container also stays closed nicely, even when tossed into my purse.</li>
      <li>This particular scent is super yummy.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s really moisturizing, but for this price-it&#x27;s a good option to have a few of them-at your desk, in the car/purse, etc..</li>
      <li>Love the smell but doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as I would like.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the containers to have so much lip butter in them, they last for a long time and they smell really good.</li>
      <li>so my expectations were pretty high.</li>
      <li>I really like the fact that you get a lot of it,  </li>
      <li>Smaller than I thought it would be but way worth the price!</li>
      <li>I love the Macadamia scent &amp; the Carmel Kiss but the quality on the Raspberry scent isn&#x27;t up to par with the other ones.</li>
      <li>B0018MLZMQ A Kiss of Moisture Essential Lip Care]]) and was excited to try this new lip butter.</li>
      <li>This is a decent lip balm.  </li>
      <li>After Nivea saved my lips last year, I vowed to be a loyal customer for life, and so I decided to try their newest product.</li>
      <li>it really keeps them soft and healsmy lips !</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the Macadamia &amp; Carmel.</li>
      <li>I like it enough to buy again, but I do wish the flavor was a little stronger, and it shows up kind of opaque on your lips.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and creamy, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my lips down.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d even go so far as to say I bought it in Sept/October</li>
      <li>: I find this product requires frequent reapplication.</li>
      <li>Moisturises well and leaves lips feeling soft.</li>
      <li>Like Baby Lips, Soft Lips, rosebud Salve, Eos; none of them in my opinion lived up to the hype, they were just overpriced lip balms.</li>
      <li>It keeps my lips soft all day.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because the product makes your lips look white-looking, so you don&#x27;t need to apply much.</li>
      <li>Anxious to get the raspberry one! :)</li>
      <li>This scent is a little sweet for me</li>
      <li>However if you use too much it can leave a silver/white tint on your lips which can look a bit strange.  </li>
      <li>The product is also pretty soft in the tin (not as packed as some other lip products that come in a tin or jar)</li>
      <li>When wearing over a lip stain this isn&#x27;t a huge deal but on my natural lips it leaves a tint that is not very attractive, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I may not buy this particular flavor of lip butter again, but I will be trying the other flavors of nivea lip butter to see how they perform.</li>
      <li>The formula is so moisturizing and leaves my dry lips moisturizes and soft.</li>
      <li>and i live in a very dry place , NEVADA !</li>
      <li>The tin it comes in is a little Tiny but its worth every penny spent.</li>

    <li> i use it in regular basis and it&#x27;s much better than chap stick !it keeps my lips fresh and healthy all the time</li>
    <li> I have this in my purse &amp; so glad the smell is a great pick me up during the day.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought it would be but way worth the price!</li>
    <li> The tin is. little annoying to get off like if your hands are slippery from cream or what not. It leaves a littlw white cast on the lips too which is annoying. You&#x27;d have to use just a little. can&#x27;t just slather it on. But it is a little moisturizing. not any more fantastic than any other lip balm in my opinion. but it does smell.delicious!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff is smells so delish I have all the flavors now will b buying these forever !!!</li>
    <li> Delicious &amp; moisturizing without being in any way sticky. Keeps my lips from being chapped. Also, it&#x27;s not so gooey that you have problems with your lips sticking together while wearing it.  The container also stays closed nicely, even when tossed into my purse.</li>
    <li> Love the smell but doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as I would like.</li>
    <li> it left white residue and flavour or scent just average</li>
    <li> I like this, and keep it in my purse at all times. I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s really moisturizing, but for this price-it&#x27;s a good option to have a few of them-at your desk, in the car/purse, etc..</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. My lips are so smooth! This scent is a little sweet for me but I still used it until the tin was empty.</li>
    <li> I like it and it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
    <li> After Nivea saved my lips last year, I vowed to be a loyal customer for life, and so I decided to try their newest product. The lip butter is smooth and creamy, makes my lips feel great, and it smells so good I&#x27;m tempted to eat it, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue with the lip butter is the package it comes in, however. The little metal tin is oftentimes difficult to open and it&#x27;s not very user-friendly, as the lid is difficult to lift open while I&#x27;m doing something like driving. I&#x27;m in the car for hours a day (I commute) so I&#x27;m used to being able to reach in my purse, grab my chapstick and apply it, while steering and you just can&#x27;t do that with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/17/2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I bought this product BEFORE December, I&#x27;d even go so far as to say I bought it in Sept/October sometime... I still like the product but at this point, I haven&#x27;t made any dent in it whatsoever, and the jar is starting to get gross. Dirt has built up around the crevices between the lid and the bottom of the tin and now when I open it up, I notice that there are little specs from the lid, getting into the product. Mind you the only place this tin has ever been is in my purse, and after about four months of use, I&#x27;m just going to let this go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll take a lot of lips to get through this product, and I don&#x27;t even want to know how icky the container will get by 6 months.... or even worse, a year. So while it is a lot of a good product, for a pretty good price, I&#x27;ll never buy this again for sanitary reasons. At least with the tubes, I know I&#x27;ll finish them off. Also, this product doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen in it, which I don&#x27;t think I noted in my earlier review.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this as a &amp;#34;door prize&amp;#34; for an at home party I was having. When Mr. Mailman dropped off this off, I just couldn&#x27;t resist to check it out. Well, I did, and loved the feeling it left on my lips and the smell is great, too!</li>
    <li> Bought this lip butter with the Vanilla and Macadamia one. They both smell and taste great and make your lips feel super smooth! This lip butter, thankfully, isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky. I&#x27;ve tried other lip butters before but they felt thick and sticky like cheap lip gloss. Not these ones! This particular scent is super yummy. It smells kinda like cookies! You also get a good amount of product and the tin is a lot bigger than you&#x27;d imagine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this it was sticky and smells weird.&lt;br /&gt;Next time i will try another flavor bad choice.</li>
    <li> It makes my lips feel great,I use it every day,This is my favorite.I will order again, It smell great,I love it.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this lip butter. It goes on smooth and creamy, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my lips down. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because the product makes your lips look white-looking, so you don&#x27;t need to apply much. Overall, it arrived on time. I may not buy this particular flavor of lip butter again, but I will be trying the other flavors of nivea lip butter to see how they perform.</li>
    <li> Love the smell more than anything, it feels great and looks great!</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff. I seriously could not stop smelling/licking my lips after applying it lol It&#x27;s really good like I wanted to eat it. get It!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate lips and feels very nice on</li>
    <li> i like it and i used a lot when i dont want to use my lipstick  , like during the day at home . it really keeps them soft and healsmy lips ! at least in my modest opinion and i live in a very dry place , NEVADA !</li>
    <li> it is mosturizing and it smells great, the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave an opaque white film on the lip. (like the bodyshop lip butter does).</li>
    <li> Feels great on the lips, smells so sweet, and keeps your lips soft all day. There&#x27;s some shine to it but it&#x27;s not like lipgloss.</li>
    <li> This wonderful! It&#x27;s not sticky and it guides on your lips with your finger. Buy it&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful keep this in my bag as well under your lipstick or on your lips</li>
    <li> This has probably been said numerous times by now but I agree with some of the other reviewers: I don&#x27;t get all the rave 5 star reviews. To me, this is more like a lip gloss. Something to put on over your lipstick to give a bit of shine. It&#x27;s not very moisturizing. It does kind of &#x27;sit&#x27; on top of your lips. This is not a lip balm type product that&#x27;s meant for chapped or dry lips. I was underwhelmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This variety; Caramel Cream Kiss, does smell really good though. And not that you should eat it obviously but it does have a very nice flavor. So, 3 stars for the flavor and scent and overall usage. To me, this a beauty product, it&#x27;s not really meant for &#x27;lip care&#x27;. So, if you keep that in mind and buy it with the intent to use it as a gloss you&#x27;ll probably enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Very smooth with a pleasant scent. Perhaps a bit expensive but you get what you pay for in this case. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Love this smells so yummy!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, hydrates lips. No taste. I wish it had a caramel taste as well as smell - not that I&#x27;d be eating it out of the tin, but flavor on your lips is nice.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t recommend this lip butter/gloss enough! The vanilla-macadamia flavor is delish! It seems to protect lips longer than other types I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Only problem is it is a bit hard to open and then you have to stick a finger in or try to use the tin as an applicator, but the Nivea lip butter is very good.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I heard about these lip butters because I pretty much love all of Nivea&#x27;s products and so I couldn&#x27;t wait to try them. I really like the fact that you get a lot of it,  I didn&#x27;t expect the containers to have so much lip butter in them, they last for a long time and they smell really good. Not much of a flavor to them though which is a downside for me.</li>
    <li> This is a decent lip balm.  It has a creamy consistency and a nice texture after application.  It also smells great and has pretty good staying power.  However if you use too much it can leave a silver/white tint on your lips which can look a bit strange.  I&#x27;ve been using it overnight because of this and it has helped relieve my chapped lips during the winter.</li>
    <li> Makes my lips feel great and I love the flavors they come in. I put it on every morning and every night.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well and has a nice texture.  I like it enough to buy again, but I do wish the flavor was a little stronger, and it shows up kind of opaque on your lips.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite flavor but it does moisturize good.  I&#x27;m going to try more of the flavors because I love Nivea products.</li>
    <li> Use it for daytime lip balm and like it very much. Prefer the Macadamia one over the others. Lasts long time also.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of lip balms and glosses in the arsenal but since I&#x27;ve tried Nivea Lip Butter this is my go to. It keeps my lips soft all day.</li>
    <li> excelente product. i just can&#x27;t love wirhout it !!!&lt;br /&gt;my líps are always smooth, winner or summer. i love it</li>
    <li> good afternoon&lt;br /&gt;I do not get this product</li>
    <li> I love Nivea&#x27;s line of lip products (like their [[ASIN:B0018MLZMQ A Kiss of Moisture Essential Lip Care]]) and was excited to try this new lip butter. I&#x27;ve found Nivea&#x27;s lip products to be wonderful for the most part so my expectations were pretty high. Unfortunately this product fell short in a few areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: The caramel vanilla scent of this product is light and pleasant, not overly sweet like many caramel scented products tend to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel: The lip butter is soft and goes on smoothly. In this area the product is exactly what I&#x27;ve come to expect from the Nivea brand. It feels great on my lips and is a nice consistency once applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: This product is off-white/cream in color and unfortunately tints my lips with this hue. When wearing over a lip stain this isn&#x27;t a huge deal but on my natural lips it leaves a tint that is not very attractive, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not long lasting: I find this product requires frequent reapplication. The product is also pretty soft in the tin (not as packed as some other lip products that come in a tin or jar) so each application seems to require a fair amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s an okay product but for the price I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> A good lip butter has a great smell .and w orjs great.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! I had first bought the Nivea lip butter in Macadamia  and I was very impressed, so I went back to the store and bought two Carmel kiss, and one raspberry rose kiss. I love the Macadamia scent &amp; the Carmel Kiss but the quality on the Raspberry scent isn&#x27;t up to par with the other ones. I highly recommend the Macadamia &amp; Carmel. The formula is so moisturizing and leaves my dry lips moisturizes and soft. I have dry skin &amp; lips and I&#x27;m putting my stamp of approval on this product. I have bought into the hype on so many lip products and barely any of them besides Nivea lip butters have lived up to that hype. Like Baby Lips, Soft Lips, rosebud Salve, Eos; none of them in my opinion lived up to the hype, they were just overpriced lip balms. Finally I&#x27;ve found a holy grail lip balm!</li>
    <li> This works just fine. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Moisturises well and leaves lips feeling soft. I put it on at night to prevent overnight drying of my lips. My only problem with it is that it smells weird when it first goes on. I&#x27;m not sure why. But it also smells the same way in the tin. But overall its a great product.</li>
    <li> The tin it comes in is a little Tiny but its worth every penny spent. I brought this and the vanilla one. And omg lemme tell you, a little goes a looping way. Anxious to get the raspberry one! :)</li>
