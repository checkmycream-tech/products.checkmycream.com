      <li>* Make sure you have a good quality ceramic flat iron</li>
      <li>Yes it is the real product! :-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so so many styling products over the years and dropped a pretty penny</li>
      <li>My hair looks healthy for the first time in years....</li>
      <li>I was excited to see it on Amazon because I was spending almost $50 on it at the salon.</li>
      <li>Love this for when my hair is straight</li>
      <li>I rub this product into my hair before I blow dry and it makes my hair straight, smooth and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>The article also said to get a relaxer, and Davines Defining Relaxing Fluid was the one with the best reviews overall.  </li>
      <li>I really needed a product that would help keep my hair relatively smooth and free of frizz.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited to have finally found the magic combination!</li>
      <li>The first time I did this my hair looked so healthy and naturally straight for days, since beginning using Davines products</li>
      <li>Good product to smooth and just give you a little grip.</li>
      <li>My daughter and I have natural curly hair and using this product gives us more control with styling.</li>
      <li>My hair is straight on the top layer but really curly underneath.  </li>
      <li>This product is worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>I love love love the Davines line but especially the Defining Relaxing Fluid.</li>
      <li>In fact, I love the whole Davines series--I also use the invisible styling cream and the Love deep conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Not sticky and not perfumed, this is by far my favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>No product can beat the flat iron, but this comes amazingly close.</li>
      <li>After my hair is dry, I use several drops of Davines Oil Absolute to seal in the softness and makes my hair shine and smell wonderful.</li>
      <li>I was given a half used tube of this stuff when a friend moved away, and I loved it.</li>
      <li>Excellent smooth results when I blow dry with big round brush.  </li>
      <li>live in south Louisiana where heat and humidity absolutely wreak havoc on  my naturally curly hair, so my saying this works wonders is a tried and true testament!</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using too much</li>
      <li>It really does seem to help straighten it.</li>
      <li>and it is reasonably straight.  </li>
      <li>The delivery on this product was fast too.</li>
      <li>I really started hating my hair.  </li>
      <li>have used it numerous times and my hair would look nice for a short time and then it would become very frizzy.</li>
      <li>The product doesn&#x27;t say it is for frizz control, but it does that very well.</li>
      <li>I apply it to my towel dried hair and use my hot air round brush (only on my top layers) and it works great.</li>
      <li>Davines products are more expensive but you will use less and they are very good at controling and straightening curly/frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s coincidence, but the very first day I used the Relaxing Fluid</li>
      <li>The instruction written on the bottle is super tiny and kind of faded on the background color; makes it hard to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it for anyone with curly hair for blow drying</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how a pea sized amount of this stuff made my hair look normal again.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair (bleached and colored) smooth and straight without feeling sticky or weighted down.</li>
      <li>After trying so many other products to control my frizzy, fine, slightly loose and super long hair, I finally settled with Davines.</li>
      <li>I grew up in the North and now I live in the South.  </li>
      <li>I live in an area that has a lot of humidity.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have fine curly hair and this is the only product that makes my hair sleek and manageable when blow-drying or when using a flat iron.</li>
      <li>Following this routine I have cut my styling time down to 30mins from 1 hour with better results.  </li>
      <li>Before finding this product, I never wanted to leave the house without first using a flat iron on my hair.  </li>
      <li>We live in Florida and for years I have suffered with frizzy curly hair 5 minutes after flat ironing it pin straight.  </li>
      <li>I use it with Davines Oi and together they make my style last so much longer than without using anything.  </li>
      <li>my 25-year old daughter with curly hair and I (65)</li>
      <li>My hair feels extremely soft and has no frizz.</li>
      <li>I use this product after I towel dry my hair, then I blow dry my hair using a blowdryer with a wand attached and it is unbelievably smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>I use the relaxing fluid as a leave-in before I blow dry or mostly as a way to control my frizzy hair when I air dry.  </li>
      <li>My hair lays flat and straight</li>
      <li>, next use Davines thermal protecting shield spray as you flat iron in sections with a hot flat iron (I do up to 350 degrees) as you finish each section spritz with a little light hair spray if its really humid or going to rain.  </li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t damage hair at such a high heat</li>
      <li>If you are like me and you live in the Deep South and are upset with how you do your hair and then 15 minutes after you leave your house</li>
      <li>Evidently, they are not from the south where the humidity is unbelievable and the heat is steaming because this product did absolutely nothing for my hair.  </li>
      <li>When my hair air dries, it&#x27;s totally manageable but also soft not heavy with product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews but at 33, I have finally found a series of products that make my extremely long, thick and curly hair feel amazing.</li>
      <li>I use this in combination with a dab of Layrite superhold pomade to get a decent hold on my hair and push it back without making it too shiny/frizzy or giving it a slicked back look.</li>
      <li>I will use the direct from Amazon method and just get regular shipments of it.  </li>
      <li>I found an article from Southern Living Magazine online that said if you live in the deep south and you are having problems with your hair being frizzy in the summer, you might think you don&#x27;t need to condition it</li>
      <li>I paid half of what I paid for my first bottle at the salon.  </li>
      <li>With only a small amount of product, was able to tame wild and woolly hair suffering from the summer frizzies.  </li>
      <li>DON&#x27;T apply too much or it weighs your hair down.</li>
      <li>everyone else wrote, a little of this product goes a long way, thus worth the price.</li>
      <li>For naturally curly hair it doesn&#x27;t straighten my curls but relaxes them a bit when I air dry.  </li>
      <li>Other cheap products can contain wax which weighs your hair down and makes it look oily not to mentions doubles the time it takes to blow dry your hair.  </li>
      <li>next blow dry completely</li>

    <li> If you have curly hair........THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT YOU&#x27;LL EVER USE!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  With only a small amount of product, was able to tame wild and woolly hair suffering from the summer frizzies.  Also, doesn&#x27;t result in having to wash your hair more often.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! My daughter and I have natural curly hair and using this product gives us more control with styling. The price through Amazon is much better than buying it at the salon.</li>
    <li> I love love love the Davines line but especially the Defining Relaxing Fluid. I was very excited to find it on Amazon at a better price than my salon. Much more convenient than driving across town to the salon! Yes it is the real product! :-)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s coincidence, but the very first day I used the Relaxing Fluid my friend asked what I did different to my hair. It really does seem to help straighten it. I have coarse, thick, unruly hair, and this in conjunction with my hair dryer and flat iron makes my hair look absolutely straight and slick!</li>
    <li> Davines has an incredible line of products..pricey, but truly quality. It&#x27;s unfortunate that they decided to discontinue this product--it works very well and keeps my hair (guy) under control and non-frizzy. I use this in combination with a dab of Layrite superhold pomade to get a decent hold on my hair and push it back without making it too shiny/frizzy or giving it a slicked back look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so so many styling products over the years and dropped a pretty penny and finally I&#x27;ve found a company that put&#x27;s my hair in place without weighing it down. In fact, I love the whole Davines series--I also use the invisible styling cream and the Love deep conditioner.  I use the relaxing fluid as a leave-in before I blow dry or mostly as a way to control my frizzy hair when I air dry.  I use just a few drops and it goes evenly through the hair.  When my hair air dries, it&#x27;s totally manageable but also soft not heavy with product.  If you&#x27;ve got semi-wavy or frizzy hair give this product a shot!</li>
    <li> Love all of the Davines products...my 25-year old daughter with curly hair and I (65) both appreciate the quality of these products.</li>
    <li> I was given a half used tube of this stuff when a friend moved away, and I loved it. Yes, a little goes a really long way as another reviewer mentioned, so though it is a little pricey, it will last a long time. I have fine curly hair and this is the only product that makes my hair sleek and manageable when blow-drying or when using a flat iron. I hated straightening my hair before I used this product because it always either completely frizzed out or got a crazy wave back in some spots. Not sticky and not perfumed, this is by far my favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> After trying so many other products to control my frizzy, fine, slightly loose and super long hair, I finally settled with Davines. The product doesn&#x27;t say it is for frizz control, but it does that very well. I almost forgotten that I have frizzy hair since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I believe this is a heat-activated product --it doesn&#x27;t say on the bottle, but it says to blow dry after applying. I apply it to my towel dried hair and use my hot air round brush (only on my top layers) and it works great. Leaves my hair smooth, shiny, and healthy. Otherwise IT WON&#x27;T work (I tried without heat and the frizz was there). The instruction written on the bottle is super tiny and kind of faded on the background color; makes it hard to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As everyone else wrote, a little of this product goes a long way, thus worth the price. DON&#x27;T apply too much or it weighs your hair down.</li>
    <li> Before finding this product, I never wanted to leave the house without first using a flat iron on my hair.  My stylist recommended I try this, and I am shocked at how well it works!  I can blow-dry my hair and it is reasonably straight.  No product can beat the flat iron, but this comes amazingly close.</li>
    <li> I grew up in the North and now I live in the South.  I really started hating my hair.  I am a white woman in my mid 40&#x27;s, and I get my hair dyed about once a month at a salon.  The texture of my hair started becoming quite frizzy and dirty feeling (as in never washed and dry).  First I thought it was the water where I am living (hard), then my shampoo (and I use good shampoos like Bumble and Bumble and Pureology). Then I thought it was the conditioner and that maybe I was over conditioning it, so I stopped.  Then I thought maybe it was the dye the salon used in my hair.  Finally a woman that I worked with told me to \\&quot;just get a relaxer and flat iron it\\&quot;.  I had no idea what a relaxer was, other than my mom used a relaxer to straighten her hair when I was younger so I googled it.  I found an article from Southern Living Magazine online that said if you live in the deep south and you are having problems with your hair being frizzy in the summer, you might think you don&#x27;t need to condition it but you do. The article also said to get a relaxer, and Davines Defining Relaxing Fluid was the one with the best reviews overall.  Also, Amazon had the best price and awesomely fast shipping.  I was amazed at how a pea sized amount of this stuff made my hair look normal again. When I went to my stylist she commented on how my hair looked.  When I told her what I did she said she never would have suggested it (obviously).    If you are like me and you live in the Deep South and are upset with how you do your hair and then 15 minutes after you leave your house you are slapping on a head band because you can&#x27;t stand how your hair looks when you see your reflection in a mirror, you need to try this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is meh...made my hair look dirty. However, it did make my hairstyle last longer.</li>
    <li> as described. well packagedd</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that can be frizzy and wild the first day I wash it.  I use this product after I towel dry my hair, then I blow dry my hair using a blowdryer with a wand attached and it is unbelievably smooth and soft.  After my hair is dry, I use several drops of Davines Oil Absolute to seal in the softness and makes my hair shine and smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> Keeps my fuzzy hair smooth even in humid weather! It&#x27;s so asy to apply to damp hair then blow dry.</li>
    <li> I really needed a product that would help keep my hair relatively smooth and free of frizz. I live in an area that has a lot of humidity.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it numerous times and my hair would look nice for a short time and then it would become very frizzy. It was easy to use and has a nice scent to it but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I think this product might be better for someone whose hair isn&#x27;t prone to a lot&lt;br /&gt;of frizz. I also would like to recommend that the directions on the tube be larger so it&#x27;s not so hard to read them.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a magazine...which gave it raving reviews.  Evidently, they are not from the south where the humidity is unbelievable and the heat is steaming because this product did absolutely nothing for my hair.  You could never tell that I had product on my hair.  I gave it at least 6 attempts...and what can I say...NOT!  If you are going rave about a product for hair and humdity...I would suggest manufacturers to conduct their studies in the SOUTH!</li>
    <li> It Controls hair and frizzed without being greasy. Would highly recommend it for anyone with curly hair for blow drying</li>
    <li> I am from the south, and let me tell u (It Works) frizz control.. My hair looks healthy for the first time in years.... Buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been one who uses styling products but this is wonderful.  It helps so much tame my extremely thick hair.  I use it with Davines Oi and together they make my style last so much longer than without using anything.  I have used the cheaper brands found at Target and such but none have the effects that this does.  I paid half of what I paid for my first bottle at the salon.  I won&#x27;t order from this store again, they did not ship it on time but sent a shipping email saying it had shipped a week before they actually shipped.  I will use the direct from Amazon method and just get regular shipments of it.  If you have thick hair prone to frizz, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I gave this a try after reading one persons recommendation on a message board, and I&#x27;m thrilled  that I did! It leaves my hair silky smooth and frizz free!&lt;br /&gt;I live in south Louisiana where heat and humidity absolutely wreak havoc on  my naturally curly hair, so my saying this works wonders is a tried and true testament!</li>
    <li> Love this for when my hair is straight or when I curl it. Good product to smooth and just give you a little grip.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using too much but it seems to weigh my hair down and leave a build up. After blow drying I wanted to wash my hair again. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use this product again.</li>
    <li> My hair is straight on the top layer but really curly underneath.  I rub this product into my hair before I blow dry and it makes my hair straight, smooth and beautiful.  The delivery on this product was fast too.</li>
    <li> I tried these products because my Mom has been using them and her hair NEVER goes curly/frizzy (she has curlier hair than me and hers always looks straight and perfect).  We live in Florida and for years I have suffered with frizzy curly hair 5 minutes after flat ironing it pin straight.  She loaned me her Davines line while I was staying at her house and after she explained her routine I too have the same AWESOME straight, never curly or frizzy (even in the rain) hair in FLORIDA!!!!!!!!! So hope this helps heres the routine.....After washing/conditioning use Davines Relaxing Fluid (little goes a long way apply from ends to root), sometimes she uses Davines oil but i use Biosilk oil on the ends, next blow dry completely, next use Davines thermal protecting shield spray as you flat iron in sections with a hot flat iron (I do up to 350 degrees) as you finish each section spritz with a little light hair spray if its really humid or going to rain.  The first time I did this my hair looked so healthy and naturally straight for days, since beginning using Davines products my hair is easier to straighten the more I use them.  Other cheap products can contain wax which weighs your hair down and makes it look oily not to mentions doubles the time it takes to blow dry your hair.  Following this routine I have cut my styling time down to 30mins from 1 hour with better results.  Davines products are more expensive but you will use less and they are very good at controling and straightening curly/frizzy hair.  ** Make sure you have a good quality ceramic flat iron so you don&#x27;t damage hair at such a high heat**</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews but at 33, I have finally found a series of products that make my extremely long, thick and curly hair feel amazing. I wash my hair 3-4 times a week and straighten it after each wash. I use about a quarter size amount of this which seems too small considering how much hair I have but using too much makes my hair feel too thick and takes too long to blow dry. My hair feels extremely soft and has no frizz. I can&#x27;t even tell that my hair has products in it! My magic combination is Kerastase Bain Oleo Relax Shampoo with any higher-end conditioner, this and Davines Melu Mellow Thermal Shield. I&#x27;m so excited to have finally found the magic combination! I also love Davine&#x27;s Salt spray for adding a litle texture.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a year or so on my wild and crazy hair - it tames it just enough and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Just what I expected!</li>
    <li> Excellent after shower and towel drying product.  For naturally curly hair it doesn&#x27;t straighten my curls but relaxes them a bit when I air dry.  Excellent smooth results when I blow dry with big round brush.  If your hair is dry add a drop or two ( max) of oil to nickel/quarter size dollop of product while in your palm.  Mix then work through hair.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it. It has some curl in it and can be quite big. My stylist introduced me to Davines defining relaxing fluid about 5 yrs ago and I LOVE IT.  I only use a dime size on my wet hair before I blow dry. (My hair is past my shoulders.) My hair lays flat and straight and I hardly ever use my straightener. I was excited to see it on Amazon because I was spending almost $50 on it at the salon.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Doesn&#x27;t get sticky or leaves a product in your hair looking like you haven&#x27;t washed in days.</li>
    <li> This is Awesome!! It leaves my hair (bleached and colored) smooth and straight without feeling sticky or weighted down. I just ordered more &amp; will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for styling and straightening my wavy hairy.  This product is worth every penny.  I love this!</li>
