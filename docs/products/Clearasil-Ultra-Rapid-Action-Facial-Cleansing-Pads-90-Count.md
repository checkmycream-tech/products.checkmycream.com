      <li>son &#x27;s best friend now days.</li>
      <li>CLEARSIL IS STILL THE BEST...</li>
      <li>great gift at a good price</li>
      <li>Skin care is one arena where there are still good bargains to be had out there and Clearasil is one of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It might be that I am just too fair, but I wish they had given some sort of warning that the tint is not for all skin complexions.</li>
      <li>Great love that it&#x27;s tinted....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
      <li>After having perfect skin for all my life, suddenly I developed acne at the age of 31.</li>
      <li>so when I opened that tube to fine that warm tint, I was overjoyed.  </li>
      <li>I happen to love that, &amp;</li>
      <li>As a lifetime sufferer from rosacea, this stuff is better because it helps cover the redness.</li>
      <li>It was more like coverup than a tint.</li>
      <li>I have to make sure I get the one without sulfur.</li>
      <li>THE TINT IS MORE SKIN TONED.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>where many of the others do not...</li>
      <li>It clears up the pimple rapidly and more importantly covers it up during the day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that Clearasil re-formulated the product to fit a paler skin tone.</li>
      <li>it help very quickly oily pimple skin .My</li>
      <li>The benzoyl peroxide was fine-</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth again, and glowing.</li>
      <li>I have had occasional acne throughout my life (65 now) and have used this product with great success for many years.</li>
      <li>I liked the ultra rapid action tinted stuff better, but this works well too.  </li>
      <li>still go to this quick and easy stand-</li>
      <li>You might be fine if you have medium to dark skin, but fair people stay away!</li>
      <li>And my acne has cleared up significantly.</li>
      <li>by it works and it is priced right!...</li>
      <li>Works fine for me, but I would CAUTION someone who is using it for the first time to just try one tube and see if the color works for you.</li>
      <li>Not everyone is going to be happy or have the same experience with the same product</li>
      <li>I had purchased this item at Rite-Aid drug store and the one in the store is tinted, but it&#x27;s very, very lite.</li>
      <li>#34;I’ve just been outside enjoying the sun look&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the three tube set the first of this month.  </li>
      <li>When a new pimple comes up, it quickly goes away.</li>
      <li>and I found that when I use my moisturized or sunscreen, I found that the product blends very well.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really blend with my skin or cover blemishes.</li>
      <li>Dab it lightly and it softens the look of blemishes when dry.  </li>
      <li>I started using this product along with the clearasil daily facial scrub and the results have been fabulous!</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This tends to get a little thick and cakey when you get close to the end of the tube, while the ultra rapid action stuff stays more smooth and liquidy.  </li>
      <li>I have long time Clearasil in long tube&lt;br /&gt;and is light brown in color.&lt;br /&gt;Current</li>
      <li>Our 14 year old son uses this product and it works well.  </li>
      <li>Since using this particular tinted Clearasil product, total strangers stop me wanting to know what I use on my skin to make it look so even tone.  </li>
      <li>But since they only have the vanishing stuff now in the ultra rapid action, this will have to do....</li>
      <li>I tried a lot of the tinted acne creams; the last was “Adult Acnomel Tinted Cream”.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After having perfect skin for all my life, suddenly I developed acne at the age of 31. I started using this product along with the clearasil daily facial scrub and the results have been fabulous! My skin is smooth again, and glowing. When a new pimple comes up, it quickly goes away. My skin is never oily when using it either. I&#x27;m very pleased and I&#x27;ve also now started using the acne &amp; marks face wash, as a mask to help prevent marks.</li>
    <li> Our 14 year old son uses this product and it works well.  Only complaint is the color, we thought it was skin color but our son is very pale and the color is too dark (biege).</li>
    <li> I have had occasional acne throughout my life (65 now) and have used this product with great success for many years. It clears up the pimple rapidly and more importantly covers it up during the day. I appreciate the comments of the others who say the shade did not work on their skin tone. Works fine for me, but I would CAUTION someone who is using it for the first time to just try one tube and see if the color works for you. I&#x27;ve found it difficult to find in stores these days, maybe because of the color issue.</li>
    <li> The benzoyl peroxide was fine- It works just like any other 10% cream. My problem came with the tinted color. It was more like coverup than a tint. It came out extremely orange on my skin. It might be that I am just too fair, but I wish they had given some sort of warning that the tint is not for all skin complexions. I do wish that I didn&#x27;t buy the 3 pack. I&#x27;m using it only at night now, when I don&#x27;t care if I look like a pumpkin. You might be fine if you have medium to dark skin, but fair people stay away!</li>
    <li> CLEARSIL IS STILL THE BEST... for an over the counter fix on ZITS or other troublesome lesions/rashes...  this coming from a retired Paramedical Aesthetician who owned Clinical Wellness and Anti-Aging Centers for decades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still go to this quick and easy stand-by it works and it is priced right!... Skin care is one arena where there are still good bargains to be had out there and Clearasil is one of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works on the Candida rashes... where many of the others do not...&lt;br /&gt;Which includes the most expensive allopathically prescribed versions... that do not work!&lt;br /&gt;[i.e.  $$$ doctor office visit... $$$ prescription that does not work! And worst of all you still have the rash on your face or...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOD BLESS AND BE WELL !!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the three tube set the first of this month.  The tubes I received all have the expiration date o August 2014!!!</li>
    <li> Not like the ones I used to buy in the store (but can&#x27;t find anymore).  Doesn&#x27;t really blend with my skin or cover blemishes.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this item at Rite-Aid drug store and the one in the store is tinted, but it&#x27;s very, very lite. I&#x27;m sure that Clearasil re-formulated the product to fit a paler skin tone. I have medium/fair skin so when I opened that tube to fine that warm tint, I was overjoyed.  I put it on, you only need a little at a time and I found that when I use my moisturized or sunscreen, I found that the product blends very well. I happen to love that, &amp;#34;I’ve just been outside enjoying the sun look&amp;#34;.  Since using this particular tinted Clearasil product, total strangers stop me wanting to know what I use on my skin to make it look so even tone.  I tried a lot of the tinted acne creams; the last was “Adult Acnomel Tinted Cream”. I guess it worked, however, I found the product to grainy and to lite for my taste.  Not everyone is going to be happy or have the same experience with the same product…let your skin be your guild. Oh! And my acne has cleared up significantly. I hoped this helped some of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I liked the ultra rapid action tinted stuff better, but this works well too.  This tends to get a little thick and cakey when you get close to the end of the tube, while the ultra rapid action stuff stays more smooth and liquidy.  But since they only have the vanishing stuff now in the ultra rapid action, this will have to do....</li>
    <li> used this since I was a teen, cant get this in stores anymore, I dont know why. I have to make sure I get the one without sulfur.</li>
    <li> I used this for years up until it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t carried anywhere (I suppose it wasn&#x27;t).  The key thing with this product is to not try to cover blemishes fully.  Dab it lightly and it softens the look of blemishes when dry.  I use the white formula at night.</li>
    <li> Like all oxy creams, Clearasil works on acne if you use it daily.  As a lifetime sufferer from rosacea, this stuff is better because it helps cover the redness.</li>
    <li> Might just be my skin type, but I used this after every day after washing my face with the Clearasil Daily Clear Facial Scrub and had very poor results. The only thing this cream did was dry out my skin and leave brown-colored flakes on my face. My skin felt like leather every day to the point where it was uncomfortable to make facial expressions. I have been using this for 6-8 weeks now and am still getting break outs - this is the worst acne product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great love that it&#x27;s tinted....only problem can&#x27;t find it anywhere locally</li>
    <li> I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE THE  COLOR OF THE TINT WAS ORANGE.  THE SMALLER TUBES THE TINT IS MORE SKIN TONED.  WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PACKAGE.</li>
    <li> The tinted cream is too dark. I have long time Clearasil in long tube&lt;br /&gt;and is light brown in color.&lt;br /&gt;Current cream I recently received is almost  red in color and I am mixing this one with vanishing&lt;br /&gt;until empty.&lt;br /&gt;Mike.</li>
    <li> my son use everyday to cover his youth. it help very quickly oily pimple skin .My son &#x27;s best friend now days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was in my teens. I&#x27;m 28 now. I&#x27;m from the Caribbean and this product makes my skin look like I&#x27;m glowing without the application of any makeup. Love it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  works well</li>
    <li> great gift at a good price</li>
