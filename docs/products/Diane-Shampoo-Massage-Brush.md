### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>si probably the best way to do it.</li>
      <li>but really, it&#x27;s priceless.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>Great deal.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo scalp massage brush works great.</li>
      <li>: since i have 24 of these, i tried one out as a cat brush, and it works great.  </li>
      <li>Very nice experience.</li>
      <li>and it feels good, too.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re that good.</li>
      <li>This product is nearly as good as the same/similar product that is made in Australia.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m delighted to have these--and, I now have \\&quot;spares\\&quot; in case I lose one.</li>
      <li>GOOD PRICE.  </li>
      <li>i never thought they were a good buy for ~$3.96</li>
      <li>If you knew how good your head, scalp, temples felt after using one of these, you&#x27;d be ordering one as I write this.  </li>
      <li>ALSO GOOD AS HAIR BRUSH.  </li>
      <li>Good product and</li>
      <li>great product exactly as ordered thank you</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Finger ring holder works flawlessly compared to others who have open ended rings that slip of your fingers.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find it on   amazon.com</li>
      <li>It has many more fingers than the predecessor massage brush.  </li>
      <li>I was glad to be able to order them online.</li>
      <li>There  were too many in one package, but dueto their uit cost it</li>
      <li>Simple, effective design that feels great on the scalp.</li>
      <li>Soft plastic six pack of Shampoo Scalp Massage Brushes work perfectly and are exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>they were easy to find.  </li>
      <li>they work good as a very compact, straightforward item, like an inexpensive comb.  </li>
      <li>The brushes themselves are fine.</li>
      <li>Aside from that they came quickly and  I was satisfied.</li>
      <li>These goofy little things have just the right stiffnes in the bristles to give a perfect head scratch.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the old style you got from your barber, but good enough for the gym bag.</li>
      <li>But when I finally needed another one and couldn&#x27;t find any, I was thrilled to find it on amazona!  </li>
      <li>Glad to have more of these as my dog chewed up my old one.</li>
      <li>Again, this one was great and the vendor was kind enough to answer my email prior to me buying this item from them.</li>
      <li>the price was very reasonable!  </li>
      <li>at less than $1 each, that was a great deal.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;march 1, 2015 update: i have since ordered a $25 pet brush for my cat, and it is okay, removes more hair, but this little brush made for humans removes significant cat hair and the cat loves it.  </li>
      <li>The product feels just right.   </li>
      <li>The Chinese made products available today are much flimsier than the ones sold under the Goody hair products name that we bought many years ago.</li>
      <li>it is very easy to remove the cat&#x27;s hair after brushing her by peeling the hair back with my thumb starting at the edge and keeping this up in a circular direction until most of the hair is peeled off of the bristles.  </li>
      <li>Our short hair cats possitively love it.</li>
      <li>was very happy to find these at an affordable price but was upset to find that they were quite a bit smaller than  what I have had and did not realize from the description they were small.</li>
      <li>I have more than I can use for a low price.  </li>
      <li>Besides, it just plain feels good.  </li>
      <li>The ones sold by eStores are EXACTLY like the ones in the picture - complete with the solid ring on top.  </li>
      <li>Very stimulating to the scalp and a very efficient shampoo applicator.</li>
      <li>she doesn&#x27;t like the pet brush nearly as much.  </li>
      <li>The brushes do the job they are designed to do very well.</li>
      <li>Very misleading.</li>
      <li>FAST DELIVERY.</li>
      <li>Conceived as a massage brush this item is very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I ended up getting a more expensive, less hard-plastic-y scalp cleaning brush that he liked a lot better in the end.</li>
      <li>$3 is a high-reasonable price for this tiny plastic brush, the price i paid of less than $1 each was fantastic, and a price of $5 or more gets two stars from.</li>
      <li>DECENT QUALITY.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and this vendor too.</li>
      <li>Massaging  stimulates the scalp, gets the blood flowing and stimulates new hair growth.  </li>
      <li>This price is amazing and the purchases of a few may last the rest of my life.</li>
      <li>The pictured items show a closed ring that you slip onto a finger to hold the brush which is more secure than the handle on the brushes that were sent that have two open half rings.</li>
      <li>I got this one to replace one I bought from a barber years ago and its pretty similar in quality.</li>
      <li>Love these brushes, I have super thick long hair.</li>
      <li>The quality brings a whole new low to the stamp \\&quot;Made</li>
      <li>the description talks about natural boar bristles and a wood handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jan 4,</li>
      <li>it is possible to do this because the plastic bristles are very flexible.  </li>
      <li>Seem very well made, and, since they&#x27;re one-piece, should not fall apart after time, as reported in reviews of similar items.</li>
      <li>Thanks for offering a big set of these.</li>
      <li>These are pretty nice for what you pay for them, but they are a little spikey and can hurt if you rub too hard.</li>
      <li>The main advantage with this one is that the postage is about 25% of the postage for the Australian product.  </li>
      <li>They are economical if you like them, I believe they came 6 to a package for a very low price, but they are not particularly durable</li>
      <li>Great if you&#x27;re hair is getting a little thin.  </li>
      <li>Shame on the seller for deceiving buyers (update the photo to the item you&#x27;re actually selling) and for not standing behind their product and allowing returns (you obviously know you&#x27;re selling cheap, sub-standard products)...and shame on Amazon.com for allowing them to conduct business like this and take advantage of loyal Amazon customers.</li>
      <li>I guess the rings had to be big enough to fit everyone, so I can put both my ring &amp; little fingers into a ring!  </li>
      <li>Cheap, hard, scallop-shaped plastic with no finger loop, but rather a two-finger open stirrup that pops off with each use.  </li>

<li> Cheap, hard, scallop-shaped plastic with no finger loop, but rather a two-finger open stirrup that pops off with each use.  </li>
<li> believe me, this item is not worth anywhere near $7.99.  </li>
<li> Got one from a friend a long time ago.  </li>
<li> The only difference is that the bristles on this one was a little shorter than the one I had.</li>
<li> They have a plastic piece (wobbly, by the way) that you put two fingers under, which makes the brush harder to hold.</li>
<li> This order was received before expected.</li>
<li> It definitely helps remove any dead skin since I don&#x27;t have to comb or brush my hair</li>
<li> Well, the ones I received were as pictured, with closed rings.  </li>
<li> The bristles are too sharp.  </li>
<li> doing this, all of the hair lifts off in a single clump to be thrown away, leaving little to no hair on the brush.  </li>
<li> for that reason, i raised the stars from 4 to 5, based on a price of less than $5.  </li>
<li> each, the selling price for just one brush at that time, much less the $7.99 Prime that is being charged now.  </li>
<li> so unless she is in a stage of losing a lot of hair, i will continue using this little brush on her.  </li>
<li> I then tried it on myself (much less hair) and found it unacceptably hard and sharp.</li>
<li> Very hard, non-flexible bristles, so stiff you couldn&#x27;t possibly use them on your scalp.  </li>
<li> These brushes are sharp, hard and brittle, not like what I bought years ago.</li>
<li> After you put shampoo in your hair, take one of these babies and scrub your scalp a little with it!</li>
<li> This brush was very stiff.</li>
<li> I first noticed the problem while shampooing my long-haired dog--she hated it.</li>
<li> What&#x27;s to go wrong?</li>
<li> They are uncomfortable to use.  </li>
<li> I returned the order and was totally disappointed.</li>

    <li> The pictured items show a closed ring that you slip onto a finger to hold the brush which is more secure than the handle on the brushes that were sent that have two open half rings. The Chinese made products available today are much flimsier than the ones sold under the Goody hair products name that we bought many years ago.</li>
    <li> We looked everywhere for these - used to be they were easy to find.  My husband especially loves them.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRICE.  DECENT QUALITY.  FAST DELIVERY. ALSO GOOD AS HAIR BRUSH.  TRY IT, YOU WILL LIKE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JIM ANDERSON</li>
    <li> Great deal.  I have more than I can use for a low price.  The product feels just right.   I am going to give them as gifts.</li>
    <li> Well, the ones I received were as pictured, with closed rings.  I guess the rings had to be big enough to fit everyone, so I can put both my ring &amp; little fingers into a ring!  And while 6 is plenty, I thought \\&quot;24 count\\&quot; meant I&#x27;d get 24.</li>
    <li> Only one massage brush came in my order. There was supposed to be 24  I returned the order and was totally disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these for YEARS!  But when I finally needed another one and couldn&#x27;t find any, I was thrilled to find it on amazona!  It&#x27;s the only one that works and the price was very reasonable!  Thank You</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to go wrong? Soft plastic six pack of Shampoo Scalp Massage Brushes work perfectly and are exactly as pictured. Funny--they were delivered in a padded package covered with &amp;#34;fragile&amp;#34; and caution tape. You could run these over with a truck and not hurt them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the same massage brush for over FOUR YEARS and it hasn&#x27;t lost a tooth. Great product!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a replacement for a shampoo scalp massage brush I accidentally left at a motel while traveling.  I couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere locally.  I found this 6-pack on Amazon.com.  I&#x27;m delighted to have these--and, I now have \\&quot;spares\\&quot; in case I lose one.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to locate this product for years. I was glad to find it on   amazon.com</li>
    <li> This brush was very stiff. It scrapped while using it in the bath. Our short hair cats possitively love it. They cheek it and rub themselves along it. They purr and slobber when I brush them with it.</li>
    <li> Product shipped is not at all what is pictured.  Cheap, hard, scallop-shaped plastic with no finger loop, but rather a two-finger open stirrup that pops off with each use.  Very hard, non-flexible bristles, so stiff you couldn&#x27;t possibly use them on your scalp.  Even our dog wouldn&#x27;t allow us to use it on her when we tried to salvage the purchase and use it as a dog scrubber for bathing her.  The quality brings a whole new low to the stamp \\&quot;Made In China\\&quot;, plus the seller has a NO RETURNS policy.  Shame on the seller for deceiving buyers (update the photo to the item you&#x27;re actually selling) and for not standing behind their product and allowing returns (you obviously know you&#x27;re selling cheap, sub-standard products)...and shame on Amazon.com for allowing them to conduct business like this and take advantage of loyal Amazon customers.</li>
    <li> Good product and I use it every time I wash my hair.  There  were too many in one package, but dueto their uit cost it si probably the best way to do it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo scalp massage brush works great. Finger ring holder works flawlessly compared to others who have open ended rings that slip of your fingers. I got this one to replace one I bought from a barber years ago and its pretty similar in quality. The only difference is that the bristles on this one was a little shorter than the one I had. I use one for shampoo scalp massaging in the shower and another one to use as a hair brush. Again, this one was great and the vendor was kind enough to answer my email prior to me buying this item from them. I highly recommend this product and this vendor too.</li>
    <li> I have these around the house for scratching my head. These goofy little things have just the right stiffnes in the bristles to give a perfect head scratch.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use these as not only as a brush to keep in my purse, but as a scalp massager! After you put shampoo in your hair, take one of these babies and scrub your scalp a little with it! It massages your head and gets the excess buildup of products out as well!</li>
    <li> The picture of the brushes shows a ring that you put your finger through to hold the brush, but the ones I received were different. They have a plastic piece (wobbly, by the way) that you put two fingers under, which makes the brush harder to hold. The brushes themselves are fine.</li>
    <li> These are pretty nice for what you pay for them, but they are a little spikey and can hurt if you rub too hard. Not as good as the old style you got from your barber, but good enough for the gym bag.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for this item for YEARS - could not find in stores.  The ones sold by eStores are EXACTLY like the ones in the picture - complete with the solid ring on top.  Seem very well made, and, since they&#x27;re one-piece, should not fall apart after time, as reported in reviews of similar items. Would definitely buy this one again.</li>
    <li> was very happy to find these at an affordable price but was upset to find that they were quite a bit smaller than  what I have had and did not realize from the description they were small. Aside from that they came quickly and  I was satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great if you&#x27;re hair is getting a little thin.  Massaging  stimulates the scalp, gets the blood flowing and stimulates new hair growth.  Besides, it just plain feels good.  Got one from a friend a long time ago.  It finally fell apart and I&#x27;ve been looking for them for ages.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This product is nearly as good as the same/similar product that is made in Australia.  The main advantage with this one is that the postage is about 25% of the postage for the Australian product.  It is a FOUR+/5.  GBP.</li>
    <li> Very misleading. Wouldn&#x27;t spend time or money on this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the concept in washng my hair for years.  This price is amazing and the purchases of a few may last the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Nothing like getting your scalp massaged while you&#x27;re washing your hair. Very nice experience. I use it every time I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
    <li> If you knew how good your head, scalp, temples felt after using one of these, you&#x27;d be ordering one as I write this.  They&#x27;re that good.</li>
    <li> Simple, effective design that feels great on the scalp. It definitely helps remove any dead skin since I don&#x27;t have to comb or brush my hair (too short to require it).</li>
    <li> The bristles are too sharp.  They are uncomfortable to use.  Some of the bristles broke off after only 3 uses.</li>
    <li> These brushes are sharp, hard and brittle, not like what I bought years ago. I first noticed the problem while shampooing my long-haired dog--she hated it. I then tried it on myself (much less hair) and found it unacceptably hard and sharp. These are going back.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It has many more fingers than the predecessor massage brush.  Very stimulating to the scalp and a very efficient shampoo applicator.</li>
    <li> Glad to have more of these as my dog chewed up my old one. Thanks for offering a big set of these.</li>
    <li> on 10/11/13, i purchased a bulk order of 24 of this item for $19.45 prime from amazon seller Haire Supplies.  i repeat, 24 of them for $19.45 including shipping.  at less than $1 each, that was a great deal.  my rating of 5 stars is the value i assign to the purchase made at the price i paid.  however, at a purchase price of $5 each and up, i would give them two stars.  they work good as a very compact, straightforward item, like an inexpensive comb.  i never thought they were a good buy for ~$3.96 each, the selling price for just one brush at that time, much less the $7.99 Prime that is being charged now.  believe me, this item is not worth anywhere near $7.99.  however, i just noticed that the description doesn&#x27;t match the product, so maybe there is an error in the posting.  the description talks about natural boar bristles and a wood handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jan 4, 2015 update: since i have 24 of these, i tried one out as a cat brush, and it works great.  it is very easy to remove the cat&#x27;s hair after brushing her by peeling the hair back with my thumb starting at the edge and keeping this up in a circular direction until most of the hair is peeled off of the bristles.  doing this, all of the hair lifts off in a single clump to be thrown away, leaving little to no hair on the brush.  it is possible to do this because the plastic bristles are very flexible.  my cat enjoys being brushed with it; it doesn&#x27;t hurt her at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;march 1, 2015 update: i have since ordered a $25 pet brush for my cat, and it is okay, removes more hair, but this little brush made for humans removes significant cat hair and the cat loves it.  she doesn&#x27;t like the pet brush nearly as much.  so unless she is in a stage of losing a lot of hair, i will continue using this little brush on her.  for that reason, i raised the stars from 4 to 5, based on a price of less than $5.  $3 is a high-reasonable price for this tiny plastic brush, the price i paid of less than $1 each was fantastic, and a price of $5 or more gets two stars from. me.gets two stars from. me.</li>
    <li> I got a package of these for my husband at his request, for washing his buzzed-off hair. He found it to be quite scratchy and only used it a time or two. They are economical if you like them, I believe they came 6 to a package for a very low price, but they are not particularly durable so you may need all 6 if you use them often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting a more expensive, less hard-plastic-y scalp cleaning brush that he liked a lot better in the end.</li>
    <li> Conceived as a massage brush this item is very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be use in the bath, in the shower, as a comb or a hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes use it as a backscratcher !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It costs pennies but really, it&#x27;s priceless.</li>
    <li> great product exactly as ordered thank you</li>
    <li> This order was received before expected. The brushes do the job they are designed to do very well. Having 24 of them around gives me the option of replacing one instead of trying to dig my hair out of them.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It does massage the scalp, and increases blood flow....and it feels good, too.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, I have super thick long hair. I even use them on my pets to remove excess hair.</li>
    <li> Couldnt find these any where. I was glad to be able to order them online. They were made well for the price.</li>
