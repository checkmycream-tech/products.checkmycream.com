### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>Been hunting for the best tanning product for years.  </li>
      <li>Best tan towel I have found!</li>
      <li>Work great!!</li>
      <li>Excellent!!  </li>
      <li>I agreed, she looked great.  </li>
      <li>excellent coverage and so handy</li>
      <li>Purchased these on tv and found this great price.</li>
      <li>Great tan, smells good and lasts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found lotions with good tan color, but that were so perfumed they were unwearable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good buy.</li>
      <li>I had used Tan towels years ago and loved them.  </li>
      <li>I like the full body towels the best, and I got the moisturizing face cream.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27; and one towel works great for me top to bottom</li>
      <li>as promised, on-time, very satisfied</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>I love my tan in a towel!  </li>
      <li>Also, make sure to not saturate your elbows or knees because it absorbs the tanner a lot and thus can leave you with orange elbows and knees!</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>The full body towels are quite good sized for my use on legs, arms, shoulders and chest.  </li>
      <li>Tan Towel Classic Full Body is a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>It took me two or three towels before I could master evening out the color, but I got many compliments.</li>
      <li>Make sure to do it in a circular motion as the directions state.</li>
      <li>:  I was pleased to discover that the expiration for using this product effectively is better than the lotions I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
      <li>Simply the best tan towel on the market.</li>
      <li>so maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for most people, but did want to warn on that.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brands and this is the best!</li>
      <li>to say, Jergens self tanner lotion is the best price bargain of the OTC products, especially since they solved the smell problem this year, but the color for that product and some others does tend to be orangey.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know for sure,</li>
      <li>Though I love the product, the description says it is a 3 pack with 45 towelettes.  </li>
      <li>Be sure it dries before getting any water on you.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>My favorite part (along with NOT looking streaking or spotty)  </li>
      <li>Too many signs lining up</li>
      <li>more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Loreal Sublime towelettes are a much better choice</li>
      <li>Love, love, love Tan Towels.</li>
      <li>realize I sound like a paid shill for this product, but honestly, I just like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the full body tan towels!</li>
      <li>Also, don&#x27;t forget to SCRUB your hands (especially your fingers) because they will turn bright orange otherwise!</li>
      <li>Itt&#x27;s so cool!</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t absorb easily, get&#x27;s sticky</li>
      <li>My skin just has a light tan, but they come in darker colors as well.</li>
      <li>which is what I originally used.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff -- works well -- once dry,</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received so many compliments, and the cool thing is I feel like my skin is better in general.  </li>
      <li>Could just be a mental thing, but I am happy.  </li>
      <li>Subtle color, layer for best effect.  </li>
      <li>Also don&#x27;t wash your hands quickly afterwards.</li>
      <li>Great coverage very natural color and no strange &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>The whole tan fades pretty fast but gives nice color on your face</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin and  have not been able to be in the sun for very long since 2000, as I had basal cell carcinoma excision surgery on my right wrist - NOT fun!</li>
      <li>These worked really well and quickly.</li>
      <li>She said they are so easy to use and not messy or greasy.  </li>
      <li>My daughters and I all have different skin tones but we all love it.</li>
      <li>The best fake tan.  </li>
      <li>Way better prices elsewhere for only a 15 pack.</li>
      <li>*, dries super fast, seems to develop color fast too, no residue on clothing -</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my subtle tan</li>
      <li>it is the closest thing I have ever had to a real tan aside from spending a week on vacation at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic.</li>
      <li>(I put the sections that I&#x27;m not using folded up in the bag), this allows me to get my whole body with one towel.</li>
      <li>after 1 use of the towel within hours I had an even looking tan across my body, and even my face (and it wasn&#x27;t TOO much on my face or sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I also recommend using a light bit of moisturizing lotion on feet/ankle areas and other places</li>
      <li>So I am going to be cautious and by a small supply for this year first to see if that is true.  </li>
      <li>Towel is much less orangey on my skin - gives me an even, tan-like color, especially if I rub it in a bit more after applying with the towel.  </li>
      <li>She gets a natural looking, even tan.  </li>
      <li>It dries completely in about a minute</li>
      <li>Jen mentioned she used tan towels rather than a professional spray on tan or anything</li>
      <li>These towels are nice for a subtle tan!</li>
      <li>I recommend smoothing up and down and around areas right after application for smoother color look and to avoid any unevenness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But generally this has not been a problem.  </li>
      <li>pull the towel out of the package, open it up completely and wipe as directed.  </li>
      <li>Towel product is not cheap and you need to price out the package deals, paying attention to whether it is for full body towels or half, etc to see what you are really paying per packet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They are always extra moist and in an instant provide a natural looking tan.</li>
      <li>see the more recent review from this year says the product has changed for the worse.  </li>
      <li>Apparently this only comes in one lower color range?  </li>
      <li>I sometimes cut the towel in half or quarters because they can dry-out fast</li>
      <li>The tan last much longer than if you use the half body towels,</li>
</ol>

<li> The tan last much longer than if you use the half body towels,</li>

<li> no odor -- easy to use -- doesn&#x27;t look fake.  </li>
<li> So I would advise not to buy these or any other self-tanner on sale at the end of the season to use next year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have dry eye syndrome</li>
<li> Once I shower and Dry off, I Tan Towel.  </li>
<li> Left me streaky and horribly uneven tan:(&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t</li>
<li> I&#x27;d never use any other self-tanning product.</li>
<li> I start with my legs or stomach until the product on the towel isn&#x27;t so saturated, then I move to other areas like my face.</li>
<li> only tiny quibble is the towels are slightly stiff (remind me of travel hand wipes in packets) and can be a bit hard to maneuver to avoid getting tanner where you don&#x27;t want.  </li>
<li> If you want a *dark* tan, I guess you need to apply this product</li>
<li> Which means a *firm* date because the chemical properties of the tanning solution will change and become a new chemical that can be irritating to the skin and no longer create color.  </li>
<li> I am very pale skinned and really look silly if I try to use a bronzer.  </li>
<li> In a few hours..</li>
<li> I learned this the hard way.  </li>
<li> Lately</li>
<li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad and you don&#x27;t have a long wait-time before putting on your clothes.</li>
<li> /&gt;You apply in a circular motion (I use very thin rubber gloves) &amp; wooola.</li>
<li> I have always avoided self tanners because I was afraid of staining my hands and not having an even tan across my body, as well as looking orange.  </li>
<li> No streaks and fake look!</li>
<li> It caused awful blood shot eyes for me that lasted days - getting in them from pillow case, I guess.  </li>

    <li> Might have to have someone else do it for you unless you want to have orange hands. Also don&#x27;t wash your hands quickly afterwards. The whole tan fades pretty fast but gives nice color on your face</li>
    <li> excellent coverage and so handy</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Will be purchasing again soon!</li>
    <li> Excellent!!  I love my tan in a towel!  Sun baking is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;You apply in a circular motion (I use very thin rubber gloves) &amp; wooola. In a few hours..you&#x27;ve got a tan!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat it.  Itt&#x27;s so cool! My niece said I looked tanned were&#x27;d I go, so I told her.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t absorb easily, get&#x27;s sticky</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Work great!!</li>
    <li> Left me streaky and horribly uneven tan:(&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t ever order that product again.</li>
    <li> The shipment arrived in a somewhat timely manner.  I had used Tan towels years ago and loved them.  The quality now is not what I remembered at all.  Loreal Sublime towelettes are a much better choice</li>
    <li> Purchased these on tv and found this great price.</li>
    <li> Simply the best tan towel on the market. I&#x27;ve tried several brands and this is the best! Great coverage very natural color and no strange &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The best fake tan.  My daughters and I all have different skin tones but we all love it. Good buy.</li>
    <li> These towels are nice for a subtle tan! I start with my legs or stomach until the product on the towel isn&#x27;t so saturated, then I move to other areas like my face. Make sure to do it in a circular motion as the directions state. I sometimes cut the towel in half or quarters because they can dry-out fast (I put the sections that I&#x27;m not using folded up in the bag), this allows me to get my whole body with one towel. The smell isn&#x27;t bad and you don&#x27;t have a long wait-time before putting on your clothes. Also, make sure to not saturate your elbows or knees because it absorbs the tanner a lot and thus can leave you with orange elbows and knees! Also, don&#x27;t forget to SCRUB your hands (especially your fingers) because they will turn bright orange otherwise! Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my subtle tan and I will continue to use them!</li>
    <li> Tan Towel Classic Full Body is a wonderful product. The tan last much longer than if you use the half body towels, which is what I originally used.  I received the product when they said I would. I will be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> Subtle color, layer for best effect.  You&#x27;ll need a mitten to apply without staining your hands.</li>
    <li> as promised, on-time, very satisfied</li>
    <li> I have always avoided self tanners because I was afraid of staining my hands and not having an even tan across my body, as well as looking orange.  However I don&#x27;t get outside as often as I wish, and tanning beds cause different fears for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was watching Chelsea Lately and Chelsea complimented Jen Kirkman&#x27;s tan.  I agreed, she looked great.  Jen mentioned she used tan towels rather than a professional spray on tan or anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low and behold, the very next day, my Birchbox arrived with a Tan Towel sample.  Too many signs lining up, I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after 1 use of the towel within hours I had an even looking tan across my body, and even my face (and it wasn&#x27;t TOO much on my face or sensitive skin areas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately bought a box on amazon.  I like the full body towels the best, and I got the moisturizing face cream.  Once I shower and Dry off, I Tan Towel.  (Don&#x27;t forget to wash your hands after you apply so they don&#x27;t stain darker).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received so many compliments, and the cool thing is I feel like my skin is better in general.  Could just be a mental thing, but I am happy.  My favorite part (along with NOT looking streaking or spotty)  I am NOT orange.  it is the closest thing I have ever had to a real tan aside from spending a week on vacation at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic.</li>
    <li> Best tan towel I have found! No streaking!!</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and  have not been able to be in the sun for very long since 2000, as I had basal cell carcinoma excision surgery on my right wrist - NOT fun! Then, I found Tan Towel and I love it! Wipe it on and in four hours the tan begins and it is not orange at all. My skin just has a light tan, but they come in darker colors as well.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Great tan, smells good and lasts.</li>
    <li> Been hunting for the best tanning product for years.  An acquaintance alerted me to this product this summer (2013).  This self-tanner fits the bill for color, ease of use, *no smell*, dries super fast, seems to develop color fast too, no residue on clothing - no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to say, Jergens self tanner lotion is the best price bargain of the OTC products, especially since they solved the smell problem this year, but the color for that product and some others does tend to be orangey.  I&#x27;ve found lotions with good tan color, but that were so perfumed they were unwearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tan Towel product has no discernible odor at all - no \\&quot;woody\\&quot; smell, no chemical smell, no perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tan Towel is much less orangey on my skin - gives me an even, tan-like color, especially if I rub it in a bit more after applying with the towel.  Apparently this only comes in one lower color range?  I am very pale skinned and really look silly if I try to use a bronzer.  I applied one towel, once a day before bedtime.  If you want a *dark* tan, I guess you need to apply this product more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just pull the towel out of the package, open it up completely and wipe as directed.  I recommend smoothing up and down and around areas right after application for smoother color look and to avoid any unevenness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash hands ( I always use a nail brush with all self-tanning products).  Be sure it dries before getting any water on you.  It dries completely in about a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is not a lotion and is not oily at all.  Seems almost like an alcohol-type composition, although *no* alcohol smell or astringent feel.  The full body towels are quite good sized for my use on legs, arms, shoulders and chest.  not sure of the coverage for a large person over all their body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only tiny quibble is the towels are slightly stiff (remind me of travel hand wipes in packets) and can be a bit hard to maneuver to avoid getting tanner where you don&#x27;t want.  But generally this has not been a problem.  I also recommend using a light bit of moisturizing lotion on feet/ankle areas and other places you don&#x27;t want a line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tan Towel product is not cheap and you need to price out the package deals, paying attention to whether it is for full body towels or half, etc to see what you are really paying per packet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found I cannot use it on my face before I go to bed.  It caused awful blood shot eyes for me that lasted days - getting in them from pillow case, I guess.  I have dry eye syndrome so maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for most people, but did want to warn on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added warning note:  don&#x27;t know for sure, but I presume this tanner also has a \\&quot;use by\\&quot; limit of about 6 or so months as the rest of these products do.  Which means a *firm* date because the chemical properties of the tanning solution will change and become a new chemical that can be irritating to the skin and no longer create color.  I learned this the hard way.  So I would advise not to buy these or any other self-tanner on sale at the end of the season to use next year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA 2014:  I was pleased to discover that the expiration for using this product effectively is better than the lotions I&#x27;ve used before.  I kept my leftover packs from summer 2013 until now (June 2014) and it works just the same.&lt;br /&gt;I realize I sound like a paid shill for this product, but honestly, I just like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see the more recent review from this year says the product has changed for the worse.  So I am going to be cautious and by a small supply for this year first to see if that is true.  Will come back and add additional information.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love Tan Towels. I&#x27;d never use any other self-tanning product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff -- works well -- once dry, no odor -- easy to use -- doesn&#x27;t look fake.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27; and one towel works great for me top to bottom -- someone larger may want to use two.</li>
    <li> No streaks and fake look!</li>
    <li> This item is a TOTAL RIP OFF.  Though I love the product, the description says it is a 3 pack with 45 towelettes.  Not so, there are only 15.  Way better prices elsewhere for only a 15 pack.</li>
    <li> My wife bought these and loves them.  She said they are so easy to use and not messy or greasy.  She gets a natural looking, even tan.  She will be buying these again and again to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> These worked really well and quickly. It took me two or three towels before I could master evening out the color, but I got many compliments.</li>
    <li> I love the full body tan towels! They are always extra moist and in an instant provide a natural looking tan.</li>
</ol>
