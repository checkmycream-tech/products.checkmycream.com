<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was skeptical about tongue scrapers but this little piece of plastic is legit. I have always brushed my tongue but never thought much about how it is not really removing bacteria. Using the scraper removes the bacteria, improves breath, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Good tongue scraper very strong.</li>
    <li> I ordered it. It&#x27;s hard to use. It is right clean the tough, but I fell vomiting.</li>
    <li> Always have had a problem with the &#x27;white&#x27; bacteria on my tongue... this is helping a lot. Very large, cleans the entire tongue. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price !</li>
    <li> Its so convenient usually there when i need to do something in a hurry with it. So its very accessible and entertaining at most times of the day seems like i find endless uses for it...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years, I ordered two more because finally after years worth of use, they do break from pressure. Unfortunately they sent me two of the same color (purple) so its hard to differentiate between mine and my husbands. They showed that is was available in multiple colors so I assumed they would send two DIFFERENT colors so two people sharing the same bathroom could use them (common sense here!). But these are a much have to good oral hygiene. They help with bad breathe and clean bacteria off your tongue. Once you SEE what it scrapes off you&#x27;ll be addicting to using it, same with flossing your teeth, I digress. Anyway, I recommend this product to anyone and everyone, again it&#x27;s a must have staple for oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Really cool product. Call me weird but I like looking at all the bacteria that I get to scrape off my tongue with this thing.</li>
    <li> Best tongue scraper i&#x27;ve ever tried.  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This freshens my breath immediately with the swipe of this cleaner. Very happy with the product and will buy again if needed. This is a great quick fix for social situations and personal encounters. It&#x27;s also quite satisfying to see all the gunk come off my tongue, as gross as that may sound.</li>
    <li> I am glad I decided to give this product a try, my tongue feels so much more clean now.</li>
    <li> I like this because it covers the entire tongue and it is hard plastic so it doesn&#x27;t bend when you use it.</li>
    <li> Searched for months to find a replacement for my tongue cleaner and finally found it here. Thank goodness - it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Do you want your breath to be so fresh and so clean, clean? Then, this tongue cleaner is the one to get! I recently lost my previous tongue cleaner that my dentist gave me on a trip, so I obviously came to Amazon to look for a replacement---and I was surprised at the number of options out there. Do I get a metal one? I thought about it, but read some reviewers complaining of cuts for some products. No thanks! I figured that I should stick to plastic, but which one? The Tongue Cleaner stood out because of its unique design and positive reviews, so I gave it a shot. After 1 month of use, the results have been excellent. Why? The Tongue Cleaner is sturdy, has a comfortable handle/grip, and the cleaning section does an amazing job of removing plaque quickly and effectively. What about the results? So far my breath has improved, esp. after not having a tongue cleaner for a few days. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> this is damn good quality tongue cleaner! works great and is very handy! i ordered two, for me and my wife. i would have appreciated if they would have send me two different colors because it is difficult to differentiate which one is mine and which one is hers. 4 stars for not having the presence of mind and shipping me different color ones.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money, just do yourself a favor and use your toothbrush instead, much quicker and actually works. I don&#x27;t think this thing worked at all.</li>
    <li> just used mine for the first time. so disgusting. my mouth feels a bit cleaner now. this tongue scraper is good. just don&#x27;t apply too much pressure when scraping.</li>
    <li> Bad breath comes from the tongue, get rid of it with this.</li>
    <li> Beware, Do Not buy This One. Reason - This tongue cleaner (tc) has a bad design, it has a big diameter at the side entering the mouth.  Because of the big diameter you have to stretch your mouth to use this tc, thus hurting the muscles that open and close your mouth. Eventually your jaws will hurt. I have been using tc all my life and all the other tcs I used had thinner design making it easy to clean my tongue without hurting my jaw. I am pretty big adult 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; , 230 pounds - so this cannot be used by children and adults with smaller mouths. Useless product !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst thing is that I thought it is gross to return a one time used tc - I just threw it away. I wasted $8 and frustrated ...huh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone else would have written a similar review before I bought this one.</li>
    <li> Its a great product but every time I use it I feel like I&#x27;m going to throw up.  Its good if you don&#x27;t have a bad gag reflex like I do, but that&#x27;s my problem and has nothing to do with the product.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t have a case to put it in when you are done.</li>
    <li> So much better than the samller ones.  This works great and so recommend!</li>
    <li> Have been trying all the different ones available at Wal Mart and other stores around here ever since one I had that was just like this one broke on me a while back. None of the others compared, all basically rubbed instead of scraping. This one works great. The one I had like this before that broke had been in use for several years, so I have no complaints about it either.</li>
    <li> why spend 25 bucks on a stainless steel version of this thing, this works great for way less, internet shopping rocks, and no sales tax to boot</li>
    <li> The best tongue cleaner I ever had. It feels great after every brush. I will recommend to a friend or family member.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect product. Without grossing anyone out with the details, i will just say its perfect for the purpose and everyone should get one of these.</li>
    <li> I threw away my last tongue cleaner because I thought I could find another one at Wal-Mart or Target but they now have flimsy ones. This tongue cleaner is just like the one I threw away, it&#x27;s hard and plastic and works great! A tongue cleaner is a must to keep your mouth fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> After having attempted to use several different tongue cleaner devices commonly found at drug stores, Walmart and Target, I came across this one several years ago.  It provides the most comprehensive cleaning of the tongue, over the widest-possible area, and while doing it in a manner conveying strong confidence in its presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the first time I became a fan of it, the Tongue Cleaner has become unavailable at any store near where I live.  Finding it online helped diminish my worries that I&#x27;d have to resort to an inferior product.  Thanks for providing it online, and with excellent shipping &amp; handling time.</li>
    <li> This is the best tongue scraper I have ever bought. Be careful when you first use it, it&#x27;s a little sharper than other ones but it does an amazing job and seems to last forever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much easier than the metal version - so easy that a young child could incorporate this into their dental routine.</li>
    <li> Makes your mouth feel so clean. Takes a little getting used to...but worth it. Should have gotten one ages ago.</li>
    <li> most tongue cleaners are more compact. this one was too large. I gave it to goodwill!  it was very fake feeling</li>
    <li> BEST EVER...I mean EVER. This is the 6th tongue cleaner I&#x27;ve bought and I LOVE it. It&#x27;s my favorite design and material. Other tongue cleaners are too weak or way to strong and painful. This one is just right. It&#x27;s durable, perfect size, just strong enough and I will never try a different one again. I am a customer for life for this product. I wish I could find them at a store near me.</li>
    <li> If Amazon is going to be persistent it is going to get the God&#x27;s honest truth. 5-24-13 will be a date that will forever live in infamy. A misadventure ended up with the untimely destruction of my previous implement. I limped along in life and oral hygiene until this bad boy made its way into my life. It scraped some disgusting crud off my tongue to a degree that made me question my worth as a sapient being. Would have given 5 stars, except there was no warning provided for the existential crisis. Really Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugs, Lollipops and fresh breath blown kisses,&lt;br /&gt;Clean Tongued Citizen</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it and then breathed on somebody who I had breathed on before I used it.  I do brush my tongue when I brush my teeth.  The result - she said there was absolutely no difference.  If you don&#x27;t brush your tongue it might be useful, but I doubt it.  All dentists tell you to brush your tongue because of the bacteria on it after you eat.  Do that and don&#x27;t waste your money on this gimmick.</li>
    <li> Use these everyday during my morning and night brushing routine. After using this you will find others who do not gross!  Pros:  *very easy to use, comes in an assortment of colors  *very durable, have been using just 1 for about a year  *very affordable for the hygienic/aesthetic benefits this provides (cleaner feeling and physically looking tongue)  *converted my significant other who was interested in me using this to use it in their own brushing routine  *much better material and longer lasting than a metal one I used before  Cons:  *some people might find it \\&quot;weird\\&quot; if they see you using it, but if you give them one as a gift they will not be able to brush without it!</li>
    <li> I read about tongue scrapers on Reddit.  Did some research and ordered this baby.  Once you get one of these, you&#x27;ll never regret it.  My mouth never felt so clean.  Perfect width and just enough edge to scrape hard, but not too hard.  I recommend everyone has one of these.  Buy one, now.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tongue scraper on the market.  Other tongue scrapers are too flimsy or narrow.  I couldn&#x27;t find this in Walmart where I bought my first scraper so I was very happy when I found it at Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> The picture was perfect as described, but if caused bleeding when I used it on two occasions, because it seemed too sharp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very diligent about brushing my tongue since I was a kid, and I always get waaay back there. If I don&#x27;t gag a few times then I know I&#x27;m not doing it right. But I recently read that \\&quot;it&#x27;s not possible to reach all the way back with a toothbrush, you need a tongue scraper to really do the job.\\&quot; So I ordered this one. It&#x27;s at least an inch shorter than my toothbrush, so I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting any further back with it. And even after multiple scrapes on the easy to reach front area, it doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as clean as when I give it a good brushing. I&#x27;m going to keep using it and give it a fair chance, I&#x27;ll update if I change my mind. Right now I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m going to look for a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: After a couple of weeks I decided to try the Dr. Tung scraper. It&#x27;s made of metal, better designed, and does a much better job. That&#x27;s the one I recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, I was hesitant at first, but this really works. I use it mornings, or sometimes at  night. For the money, it is definitely worth it. Also, I have a paper towel that I use to clean it every use, then I wash it with hydrogen peroxide. thats just me.</li>
    <li> This is a great item.  It leaves my tongue clean and fresh.  All of the girls just love to kiss me now.</li>
    <li> I had bought this in the hopes that it would get rid of the &amp;#34;white tongue&amp;#34; some of us may experience. However, I just ended up with a sore tongue. The tongue cleaner did not clean very much off of my tongue and definitely did not make it pink like I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have had a similar experience with other tongue scrappers, I suggest using the TUNG brush and gel. It worked for me and I love it.</li>
    <li> Not fond of plastic items, but this tongue scraper is strong and durable. I have trouble get the back of my tongue with my brush, this does the job.</li>
    <li> This product is a good investment to get all of the extra gunk and bacteria off of your tongue.  If you still have bad breath, I would suggest telling your dentist and changing your diet.</li>
    <li> Handy, easy to clean AND inspect. The handle may not be the perfect fit, but overall i have no complaints. I like the length of the handle. I used the straps previously, but will only re-order or gift this particular type.</li>
    <li> Using mouthwash, flossing, brushing your teeth, and regular cleanings are not enough for day-long lasting fresh breath.  Don&#x27;t believe me?  Next time you brush your teeth rinse your mouth out and stick your tongue out and look at the back half of your tongue.  I bet it looks nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These may make your poor little tongue sore for about a week but you&#x27;ll be amazed what you scrape off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To prove the point even farther...have a cup of coffee in the morning and then perform your morning oral hygiene routine.  Brush your tongue with your toothbrush and rinse your mouth out clean.  Now use the scraper.  You&#x27;ll be amazed what you missed with your toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Much better than rubber or metal tongue cleaner. I have been seraching for this for a long time! I bought four pieces just in case...  Absolutely recommended!!</li>
    <li> I had purchased one of these a couple of years ago from my drug store but now I can&#x27;t find them. After tyring other types, I found this one on Amazon and I&#x27;m glad I purcased it. Works great.</li>
    <li> This was the first tongue cleaner that I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and impression I got was that this product does the job well for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a toothbrush just for tongue cleaning(flat brush kind).  Problem is, while this product certainly cleans, gets good traction and everything, it is not as effective as my toothbrush, at least for me.  So...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  No gagging while cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Con:  Was not as effective as my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like tongue cleaners, I can recommend this cleaner.  If you&#x27;ve been using toothbrush to clean your tongue like me, I think you might also prefer to just stick with the brush.  Then again, it&#x27;s less than five bucks to try it anyway.</li>
    <li> I really love how this gets rid of my tongue gunk! I can actually see it after scraping a few times. This keeps my breath feeling fresh and mouth clean.</li>
    <li> My husband just love it And want use anything else.</li>
    <li> It works price seems bit more steep for a plastic like this. I&#x27;d say 3 for $5 is a reasonable price point.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as you would think. Scrape your tongue then pull all the nasty tongue gunk out with it and your breath will be all nice and fresh,</li>
    <li> Love it.  Cleans my tongue very efficiently every time!  I&#x27;ve tried other cleaners and they aren&#x27;t as good for this cheap of a bargain.</li>
    <li> This thing scrapes all the stinky stuff off of your tongue so you can have fresh breath. I eat lots of food like garlic and onions so this is essential for me. I use it everyday and it is still going strong. If you have a problem with bad breath I recommend giving this a try.</li>
    <li> if you have hot breath and need some help, try cleansing your tongue where a lot of bacteria is harbored. I have been using for 4 years and haven&#x27;t had any complaints especially after using this. i would recommend.</li>
    <li> this tonque cleaner is one of the best I have ever used it get all the nasty scraped off my tonque in the am and when ever it feels funky, I use it mostly before I brush and it helps with your breath too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 different &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; shaped scrapers that basically look like shaving razors for your tongue which worked OK, but I was curious of this and boy does it work.  It&#x27;s wider than most scrapers so you get a large area and it pulls a thick yellow film off of my tongue every night.  I get way far back.  Nasty?  yes, but nastier to leave that stuff in your mouth.  I never have a bad taste or poor breath in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these tongue cleaners in a drugstore about 5 years ago.  They are no longer sold in the drug store chains near us.  So I went on line and found another.  It works well, removes a lot of bacteria, is gentle, and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job. I would have given it a 5 if it were made of metal. This will eventually break due to stress, but it&#x27;s working fine now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did before I started using this. It cleans my tongue like no other tongue cleaner I&#x27;ve ever had. Others either didn&#x27;t work or hurt my tongue. I like to get all the way in the back where the huge taste buds are and other tongue cleaners would seriously sometimes rip those off. This one is gentle, yet effective.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find in stores. The ones that you do find are too flimsy. You will be very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great product but mines didn&#x27;t come blue, it arrived white.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, is kind of too wide, is a little uncomfortable to use but it gets the job done nonetheless. Just be aware there are better products out there, the &amp;#34;Tongue sweeper model P Stainless Steel Tongue Cleaner&amp;#34; for starters, now THAT was my favorite.</li>
    <li> Works as described.  Handle can break over time.  My husband prefers this stainless steel one found for him later, stays clean, never breaks or loses shape.  This one, maybe will last a year depending on how much force you use.  What do you expect its plastic.  But for what it is, works fine.</li>
    <li> Was kind of sceptic about how effictive this could be. My tounge always looked yellowish, now it looks nice and clean. Worked better than expected.</li>
    <li> The width of this is HUGE, almost the width of my entire mouth. Makes it impossible to reach the back of the tongue, which is what I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  I could no longer find this exact Tongue Cleaner in Wal-Mart or any other place that I usually shop at.  Thank goodness, I found it on Amazon and purchased 2 of them.</li>
    <li> I was brushing my tongue for years until my friend told me about getting a &amp;#34;tongue scraper&amp;#34;.  We went onto amazon and he helped me pick out the one he has at home.  I ended up with one!  It&#x27;s very easy to use and clean.  The design allows me to keep it right next to my toothbrush so I never forget to use it.  And I am able to soak it in mouthwash to clean it without getting my hands dirty!</li>
    <li> I have tried several of these and this is by far the best and one that holds up a long time.</li>
    <li> Holy crap, this really works, better than a toothbrush ...such a simple instrument, and I use it in the morning to deal with the furry tongue...and the edge is effective..not painful...a couple of good scrapes, a rinse and u can feel the difference!  Yeah, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These are the best type of tongue cleaners.  Fuhgeddabout the rest.  This one has that reinforcing cross bar which will hopefully make it last longer than my last one, which broke where the loop meets the handle, admittedly after a few years of use.  Might be a good idea to kind of reinforce that area with a finger while scraping.</li>
    <li> Best tongue cleaner on the market in my opinion. Always use it after I brush my teeth, and it always gets that little film left on your tongue after you eat/drink. Also does wonders for my breath, this tongue cleaner is a must have.</li>
    <li> I use this daily before and after brushing my tongue. I occasionally get dry mouth due to medications, and this helps remove buildup. I prefer this to other tongue scrapers as it has very little give and the handle is long to help you get as far back as possible.</li>
    <li> I use a tongue cleaner every time I brush. This one is sturdy and has lasted me for more than 2 years. I&#x27;ve taken to buying them as gifts so my friends can experience the ecstasy of cleaning one&#x27;s tongue. It&#x27;s akin to using a Q-tip. You know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a replacement for a broken item, and this was exactly what I needed. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> It works ok just make sure you pay attention and when you pull you pull gently because if you don&#x27;t it will hurt.</li>
    <li> I prefer the edges of the scraper to be a bit sharper, as that makes it easier to &amp;#34;scrape&amp;#34; the back of the tongue clean. This thing is hard plastic with the edges nicely rounded, so the scraper just glides on top of the tongue and does not do its job.</li>
    <li> Using this is pretty gross. It scraps off a gross looking stuff from your tongue.   I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working, as it&#x27;s said you can&#x27;t smell your own breath.    I haven&#x27;t had anyone smell my breath much either.    It&#x27;s inexpensive and does pull off gross stuff.  I would recommend this, especially if you are dating ect to use before a date.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my dentek scraper that I had used for a year and was blown away by how much better this one was.  I really appreciate the width as it means less passes down the tongue to accomplish the end goal of cleaning.  I also like that the edges have some bite to it so that it is actually scraping the tongue rather than smoothly rubbing over the surface.  For the price it is hard to beat this deal.  At the same time I bought this one I bought a metal one too but it was only about an inch wide.  While it was good I find myself using this plastic one far more often.</li>
    <li> Gross how well this works! I hate tongues.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace one I was given as a Christmas gift (my family is weird like that). My uncle is a hygiene freak and will always give us a gift with hygiene in mind in addition to something else. That year, we all got tongue cleaners. Mine worked well until i snapped it, and the replacement one I bought didn&#x27;t leave me with that clean feel. I ordered this one because it was exactly like the one my uncle got me. I could care less about the color, and they said that the color wouldn&#x27;t be guaranteed so I was cool with it. I&#x27;ve had this one for a while now, and i just disinfect it regularly. I love the way my mouth feels after I use it. I use it every time I brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> It really does what it claims, is a great product&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anybody</li>
    <li> Best tongue cleaners around!  I&#x27;ve tried them all, but always come back to this one.  If they ever stopped making these, I&#x27;d be really bummed!</li>
    <li> These tongue cleaners are amazing - how do people not have / use them.  I have told everyone I know to get one.  Also, make sure to get the strong - big plastic one like this one.  The little rubber ones don&#x27;e clean jack ;]</li>
    <li> I admit, the plastic cleaner is not as effective as the stainless steel version. However, I have found that this object will get your tongue clean and get rid of stinky breath.</li>
    <li> I so excited to have found this product I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve been looking for it for about a year</li>
    <li> Works better than other designs</li>
    <li> My tongue cleaner came in red and it&#x27;s very useful. You use it to scrape your tongue in a downward motion. Keeps breath smelling fresher than normal.</li>
    <li> Being a semi-germophobe I purchased this product hoping to eliminate the occasional bad breath situation.  From what I can tell the tongue cleaner removes any film on your tongue and leaves your mouth feeling much cleaner.  However, a few scrapes across is all it should take as the plastic edge can be a little rough if you aren&#x27;t careful.  Overall, its a very simple well made product that everyone should consider for complete oral health.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend had one and I looked everywhere for this. Once I found out the name had changed bought a couple. They seem to work great at removing unwanted food and helping with bad breath.</li>
    <li> Does the job!  Its sturdy a durable.  This is a must have for personal hygiene.  Make sure you own one.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, these scrubbers are not that easy to find! Mine broke during a recent road trip, and I tried for weeks to locate another at a CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, etc. but to no avail. I found it here on Amazon and was so happy to get it. It really plows the stuff off your tongue that makes people go \\&quot;ewwwwww!\\&quot; Definitely a MUST!</li>
    <li> This item is great! Considering that this is a tongue cleaner there isn&#x27;t much to say. It works like a tongue cleaner should.</li>
    <li> It took me about 10 years to wear out my first one of these...they are the most effective, safe and easy to use tongue cleaner on the planet.</li>
    <li> works great and does not hurt like some others... GEts the tongue good and clean</li>
    <li> Sturdy and quality made !</li>
    <li> Back up, ridged toothbrush backs. Move over, overrated handsaw. This is the only tongue cleaner that I&#x27;ll touch. I will never understand why these are so hard to find, and not in every bathroom across the world! I felt a hole in my life when I didn&#x27;t have one for several years, and now I am so glad to have another one again. I swear by this kind, and no other kind of tongue cleaner will do for me. Thrush, Hairy Tongue, Bad Breath, Morning Breath - it helps it all. Cleaning your tongue should be up there with flossing when it comes to importance and a little scrape from the back of my toothbrush ain&#x27;t going to do anything. Stop kidding yourself, Colgate.</li>
    <li> I like the wider surface area---compared to the alternatives. Not flimsy. I would buy it again. It is a tongue clearer...what more can I say?</li>
    <li> Before I bought this I asked my dental hygienist if she used and a tongue cleaner.  She said she did and that is was a good way to get rid of bacteria in the mouth.  That was enough reason for me to search Amazon and pick out one that would work for me.  This scraper works really well.  It is easy to use and easy to clean. I don&#x27;t know how they could make it any better.</li>
    <li> They are not making this style anymore- and these really work.</li>
    <li> Good ones, sharp enough and strong enough to actually scrape the gunk off!!!</li>
    <li> Will be getting a new one of these as needed... Been using a long time but can no longer get in my area.... Which sucks because these are awesome, You wouldn&#x27;t believe what gets left on your tongue after brushing!!! So glad to have found it reasonably priced online! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Great and just the right shape ,</li>
    <li> This is actually much better than I anticipated. It is strong and easy to clean. Does the job just fine!</li>
    <li> This is a perfect item to use to keep your tongue clean and healthy! I use it every time I brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> It gets a little bit off but not enough to make a difference. It too rounded and maybe isn&#x27;t positioned correctly or \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; enough to actually get whatever off. Does a very poor job and I will probably get something different that might work better because this doesn&#x27;t do the job right.</li>
    <li> I have used one of these tongue scrapers for years, but my last one broke and I couldn&#x27;t find another one in the drugstores.  I was thrilled when I saw these on your site and purchased two.  I love the way they clean my tongue.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what i expected.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference from using it and not using it. It helps clean my tongue and not make my breath smell a great deal. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I saw a TV show where a doctor said that using a tongue cleaner is good for oral care so decided to try it out. I didn&#x27;t realize how big this was till it arrived. I do have a fairly small mouth and it was hard to reach the back of the tongue. It might be more useful to someone who has a bigger mouth. Overall, I used it once and it&#x27;s been collecting dust.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular brand when it was Pureline and could buy in local store, and this is the only one that actually work for me.  Others are too small, don&#x27;t clean well, etc. but this one is large enough you can make a few passes and get the gunk off.  A must for coffee drinkers!  They last a good while, I have to replace every year or so, so I may stock up while they are still cheap.</li>
    <li> i tried this for a week, thinking i must be missing something given the great reviews.  it does absolutely nothing.  sorry i wasted $4.</li>
    <li> As long as you don&#x27;t reach back too far to trigger the gag reflex, it works pretty well. &amp;#60;-- Just don&#x27;t take that sentence out of context, please.</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic. Stopped using it after few days as I started  getting throat infection. Doesn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Finally found a tongue cleaner that works. I recommend this product.  Don&#x27;t know why the ones I find in my local retailers are all flexible.  This one is not and it is much more effective.</li>
    <li> I feel like I have to have a tongue cleaner specifically this type, as apart of my oral hygiene products and routine. I would recommend this product for basic oral hygiene. This tongue cleaner is easy to use and affordable.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect and does its job. I just found it to be too expensive for the product given. I&#x27;ve bought one just like this in a 99 cents store before but can&#x27;t find them anywhere now. If money is not an issue I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great little producty that works well for cleaning bacteria off your tongue. If you a like me and drink coffee, tea or eat foods that tend to stick to your tongue and not go away easily even after brushing this is an absolute necessity. Price is ok. It&#x27;s just plastic people.</li>
    <li> I really like this tongue cleaner.  I had on before, but the handle snapped on it, so I decided to give this one a try.  It&#x27;s really sturdy and cleans very well.  I&#x27;d buy another one for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had a similar one of these for about 7 or 8 years and it finally broke. I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement in stores and I was really bummed because other tongue cleaners just aren&#x27;t as effective as hard plastic ones with a larger loop. My sister sent me a link to this and I ordered it immediately. It is just as awesome as my old one. I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> HAVE TO HAVE SEVERAL OF THESE.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this tongue cleaner.  It was hard to use and didn&#x27;t make my tongue feel any better.  I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Received timely and a great price.</li>
    <li> This proves that simple can be great. These work wonders for bad breath and are so easy to use. No brushing your tongue. UGH You will only try that once but these make it a simple process. WOW</li>
    <li> This works just as advertised. It&#x27;s durable and effective, but not so abrasive as to hurt your tongue. I use it once a day before bed and it makes a noticeable difference beyond simply brushing your tongue.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent tongue scraper. It is hard and flex plastic material. Why the manufacturer Dentech stopped this product is a big mistake.  I bought the new replacement round soft rubber scraper Dentech and it does NOT do the job as designed for its purpose. If you want a good oral hygiene tongue scraper; this is it.  Five Stars!</li>
    <li> I like this tongue scraper and it does the intended job.  I prefer the really large ones to be able to get the very back of the tongue and this did it.</li>
    <li> Seriously. Take a look at your tongue. If you see white gunk -- EWWW! Get this. It will erase your tongue&#x27;s dirty leftovers onto the sink and make your breath smell good but make your tongue look fresh! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> My problem is actually this vendor - Vita4less.  After much trouble, this product finally arrived and it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;Pearl White&amp;#34; as advertised - it&#x27;s GAS STATION GREEN. And I can not return it.</li>
    <li> It was worth the money. I ordered 5 so everyone in the family could have one. They arrived very quickly and work well.</li>
    <li> Mine broke after a year.  Inherently poor design for durability (stress concentration where handle meets v-loop).  Other than that, it was great and I loved it.  Next time I will find something more durable.  Planned obsolescence at its finest.  Consume-consume-consume.</li>
    <li> Nearly useless because it doesn&#x27;t quite dig that deep into the tongue.  I have a scoop that has been tough to replace because these scrapers don&#x27;t collect much at all.</li>
    <li> MY FAMILY LOVES THE TONGUE CLEANERS.  WE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THEM FOR A WHILE.  RECEIVED THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER.</li>
    <li> These are the best tongue cleaners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This product is very durable, and is made of hard plastic.  There is no clean up, and works perfectly. Love it</li>
    <li> My wife is very particular when it comes to tongue cleaners.  This model is just what she likes.  It fits comfortably in her hand and provides the optimum blade to effectively clean her tongue.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> this product is so hard to use , you can find better ones in the pharmacy...do not lose your time buying this stuff through here.</li>
    <li> I wish i knew about this years ago, you honestly can not go without this. It cleans your tongue very well and leaves your mouth very fresh afterwards. I have seen some people complain that it hurt their taste buds but honestly i haven&#x27;t had that problem at all, i must imagine they must be using it too harsh but who knows, what i do know is that I&#x27;m very happy with it, works great and is very cheap, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ordered it on Sunday, got it on today-- Wednesday. I bought this exact tongue cleaner at a walmart 3 years ago and used it everyday until it broke last year. It&#x27;s a simple product, but I looked all over for this particular one and the only replacements I could ever find at local stores were way too slim and they had no real grip on the tongue. I see some reviews complaining how big it is. Well don&#x27;t try to swallow the thing! Just gently but firmly use the edge . It has great coverage. Mine came in a darkish pink and I love it.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. You can use either side to scrape your tongue. And it washes easily.</li>
    <li> I had one for years before I finally pushed too hard on my tongue one day and broke one of the sides. Searched at every store I could think of with no luck - finally thought to look here and found it. It gets my tongue so clean. At first I gagged on it every time, but I&#x27;ve either gotten used to it or figured out how to do it quickly so it doesn&#x27;t gag me anymore.</li>
    <li> This works Great. I had a thicker one but lost it. Avoid the metal ones; they almost cut your tongue in half or give you a tonsillectomy.</li>
    <li> it really do clean the tongue.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING! IT&#x27;S STURDY AND SOLID SO YOU CAN GET MAXIMUM RESULTS. MY TONGUE FEELS SO CLEAN AFTER USE AND MY FOOD TASTES BETTER.</li>
    <li> It seems like it works really well, but this is my first tongue cleaner so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> It got all of the gunk off  of my tongue. It works great.</li>
    <li> My daughter got this sue to a fascination with tongues, and she is quite satisfied with it. We never experienced tongue cleaners before so have no idea how to make a comparison.</li>
    <li> My hubby loves this. I&#x27;ve used one and it doesn&#x27;t make me gag at all, which is amazing.</li>
    <li> Works great, highly recommended!  Use it day and night.  I prefer this one over the other popular metal one available here.</li>
    <li> Best tongue scraper on the market.  It&#x27;s sturdy enough and large enough to be useful.  I&#x27;ve used other products that were either too small or not sturdy and the tip bends back as you apply pressure to your tongue.  Plastic is firm so it may snap when placed in a travel case in your luggage, hence buy extras just in case.</li>
    <li> Once you use this and see what your scrape off of your tongue, you&#x27;ll think you were gross your entire life until that point.</li>
    <li> Works better than other ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I had to order online because i can not find it in stores! Last a long time. Great product. Shocked to see how gross a tongue can be.</li>
    <li> I had purchased one for myself at Walmart. Months later, my husband wanted one too. Walmart didn&#x27;t have them anymore. Neither did anyone else! Found this and it is just like mine. When you are feeling sickly and your tongue is not it&#x27;s usual pink, this helps to remove the nasties. I believe it helps to get over a cold sooner.</li>
    <li> I just recently started using a tongue cleaner and this one is better than the metal ones.  I hesitated because it is plastic but it works very well.</li>
    <li> The best one around.  It works really well.  The smooth plastic is nice, and it covers the proper area needed.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. Is an easy product to use. Is slightly difficult to clean properly. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This little fella works wonders. It makes your mouth feel totally clean after brushing. I have used one for years.</li>
    <li> so far so good, this item is raking my tongue alright. i will purchase again if i needed one. i like it</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it was intended to do, it scraps your tongue of all the nasty gunk that causes bad breath!</li>
    <li> I had purchased one at CVS years ago. Never found them again at the stores and was very disappointed by others I bought. The edges on this one are very sharp and give your tongue a very good scrape. Others have rounded edges that just slide on top of your tongue and do not clean it. Bought one for everyone in the house now and some to give away.</li>
    <li> This works really well.  I have been hanging on to about a 12 year old tongue scraper because the ones you can get today in the store don&#x27;t put enough pressure on your tongue to clean it.  This one does, you can put as much pressure or as little pressure as you want.  I finally was able to throw out my old one...  It was well overdue and had chips in it from dropping it on the counter.</li>
    <li> This is a great little tool &amp; does what its supposed to do, clean the tongue.  If you have never scraped your tongue your in for a big surprise.  Its pretty gross actually but if you&#x27;ve ever been told you have bad breath or your tongue in looking funky in color this is the cure!!  I had both of the above issue and I can tell you that after one use my tongue looks pink again. I have no doubt I will have better breath.  This is now part of my daily routine after every tooth brushing. Yah!!!! I&#x27;m so happy:)) And it was only 5 bucks!!!!</li>
    <li> I had used and loved my Dentek Breath Remedy for years until it broke.  Although this replacement from Pureline Oralcare works, it&#x27;s a bit sharp and cumbersome with its support bar.  I&#x27;ve hurt the back of my tongue a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dentek 1st Generation Breath Remedy (Triangular head w/ dual scrapers) was much more pleasant and effective, but unfortunately is no longer in production.  Definitely take a few moments to first find any remaining 1st Gen Dentek Breath Remedy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I found them in closeout and bought a few! I threw the Pureline Oralcare one away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0087ALXTC (2 Pack) Dentek Dual Action Tongue Cleaner Scraper Remove Germs Recommended By Dentists]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0087BE4UG (3 Pack) Dentek Dual Action Tongue Cleaner Scraper Remove Germs Recommended By Dentists]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0087BEO3I (6 Pack) Dentek Dual Action Tongue Cleaner Scraper Remove Germs Recommended By Dentists]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a better tongue scrapper, but this one has worked well.&lt;br /&gt;75% of your bad breath problems are most likely related to tongue based bacteria, and this allows you to remove all of that bad smelling stuff from the surface of your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too sharp, and does it&#x27;s purpose well. Good Product.</li>
    <li> This product came quickly and was exactly what I was looking for. It is by far the best tongue cleaner out there.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these at my supermarket but they stopped selling them. Glad to find them here! I have tried other tongue cleaners and this one is by far the best because it literally scrapes everything off your tongue. It can be rough depending how hard you scrape but it definitely does what it is intended to do.</li>
    <li> I little big for my mouth</li>
    <li> I was looking this product everywhere in my area and finally I thought you should have...&lt;br /&gt;I was using this exactly same one and Iiked only this one...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad you had... Now I know where if I need it again...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  ET</li>
    <li> I bought this because I got tired of gagging while cleaning my tongue with my toothbrush. This does the job very well, but be warned: the goop this scrapes off your tongue is nasty looking! Very worth it.</li>
    <li> I have looked every where for this item the stores stopped selling them. Thank you for having them, they work so much better than any thing else.</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I each have one of these. They&#x27;re the perfect size for cleaning the whole tongue at the same time, instead of some of the smaller ones where you have to use it multiple times.</li>
    <li> The best and only truly effective tongue scraper.</li>
    <li> i dont know why they dont sell these in stores.... i know a lot of people that need to use this. affordable and the perfect addition to my daily oral hygeine routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better tongue scrapers. It&#x27;s almost too large. I don&#x27;t use it as often as I had planned. It was cheap and you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> Exquisitely well designed--seriously!</li>
    <li> Thanks.  Great product&lt;br /&gt;  Love it.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and came just as descrided, the shipping was fast. Just used it and am impressed with the results, will certainly be recommending this to friends.</li>
    <li> Wish more people use this and it&#x27;s available in stores. Sturdily built. Lasts a while. I like this better than angular ones.</li>
    <li> I had one for years that I purchased at WalMart and can no longer find them in stores.  I was so happy to find them at Amazon.  Plus my daughter was looking for a good one so getting 2 was perfect and she loves hers.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for this product for a long time with no luck.  Happy I found it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s a great product.  I have tried others but this one is the best.  Price is good also.</li>
