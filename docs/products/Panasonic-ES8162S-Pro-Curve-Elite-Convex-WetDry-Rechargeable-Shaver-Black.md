### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best electric razor</li>
      <li>Panasonic keeps improving their design, and I think the Panasonic ES8162 is the best razor made, and here is why:</li>
      <li>thing my research taught me was that beards and skins differ, and no shaver is going to work best for everyone.</li>
      <li>as a bonus the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; cleaning feature works perfectly as well.</li>
      <li>The best I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Excellent shaver.  </li>
      <li>Cleaning with soap and water is great.  </li>
      <li>Takes 2-3 wks for your beard to adjust but then great shaves in the shower</li>
      <li>For years I was using Braun shavers and was happy with them but decided to try competition.</li>
      <li>which is a great relief.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Did not buy this shaver from Amazon, had a great experience with another online store since Amazon was out of stock at the time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, the one piece design of the shaver foil isn&#x27;t great either.  </li>
      <li>Great pivioting head&lt;</li>
      <li>Arced Foils is not a gimmick, works great</li>
      <li>Battery life is great</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve found an electric that does every bit as good job on me as I ever got with a blade.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s that good.</li>
      <li>The price on Amazon was not as cheap as the Amazon price before Christmas, but it was still the best price on the web at the time.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t good.  </li>
      <li>This Panasonic is superior.</li>
      <li>Charge time is excellent- 55 minutes for a full charge.</li>
      <li>and I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>Perhaps the latest Braun would have made me happy, too, but I won&#x27;t be switching back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll miss sanding carpentry projects with my face, but being able to kiss gals without causing permanent injury is a welcome novelty.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s been getting the closest shave of his life, BETTER than a blade!</li>
      <li>Great Shave; below the shin smooth &lt;br</li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried a Panasonic, this is the way to go, but if you have the best, then don&#x27;t expect all the new-fangled stuff to really improve the shave.</li>
      <li>(so nice just to drop it in).   </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t look as nice and feels a bit cheaper</li>
      <li>But the glycerin-based shaving soap feels so much better on my face, leaves it smooth and clean, and is the perfect lubricant for shaving with the Panasonic.</li>
      <li>this razor gives a superb shave wet or dry--actually as close to a blade as i think an electric could ever shave--not perfect but pretty darn close to it.</li>
      <li>The good thing is you don&#x27;t need some fancy liquid to clean it.</li>
      <li>It feels great in the hand, and gives me super-close, quick, comfortable shaves.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;You would expect more shave for $100.</li>
      <li>Even better than the Gillete Fusion razor.  </li>
      <li>Mine has a lithium ION battery, I wanted it, but I dont know if its really better (for a shaver application)..  </li>
      <li>I love this razor...</li>
      <li>I dont know if its really better</li>
      <li>I do believe the curve is at leasat partially responsible for the great performance..   &lt;br</li>
      <li>Better Design; lighter, pivoting head, better ergonomics.  </li>
      <li>i was torn between buying this unit or one of the better brauns.</li>
      <li>There are two things why most people choose blades over electric shavers: 1.</li>
      <li>the 8162 did even better.</li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t imagine a better shaver for me than this one.</li>
      <li>; I love the fact I can shave in the shower or tub.</li>
      <li>The trimmer does not seem to be that great on mustaches, as the motor seems to be running to fast for a clean cut.</li>
      <li>Quite happy wih it so far.</li>
      <li>shaves never seemed to get as close, they irritated my skin while trying to get a good shave, and they weren&#x27;t very durable.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t superior to Panasonic&#x27;s old system at all and seems to be more problem plagued.  </li>
      <li>Better battery; lasts longer, and charges quickly.</li>
      <li>Ultra Easy to clean</li>
      <li>Easy cleaning; water clean up and your done. &lt;</li>
      <li>i read the prior reviews for this shaver and figured i&#x27;d give it a try not expecting great results.</li>
      <li>The build seems great - I had problems with Braun&#x27;s fragile screens, and Panasonic&#x27;s seem beefier.</li>
      <li>It is much lighter now, and it charges faster, while giving many more shaves on a charge.  </li>
      <li>30 seconds into my first shave, I knew I had made a great choice for my new razor.</li>
      <li>come on people, it is an electric motor working at 13,000 rpm, there will be sound but this shaver is not bad at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(that&#x27;s why I switched brands in the first place), but in retrospect, it does seem to have been the better shaver for me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;He had tried many, many electric razors over the years and they always ended up in a drawer, but his sensitive skin didn&#x27;t do well with a blade.</li>
      <li>Far better than the latest Braun 360.  </li>
      <li>Better motor, higher speed, better blades, reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Aside from the shaver, the trimmer is quite good and much better than my previous Panasonic razor.  </li>
      <li>but it operates much better and actually gives a better shave.  </li>
      <li>Charges quickly.</li>
      <li>reading many reviews, I chose the Panasonic and WOW!</li>
      <li>The Panasonic takes LONGER for a similar close shave, and it leaves razor burns more easily.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I look forward to it now, but it&#x27;s certainly become an experience with its own modest pleasure.</li>
      <li>I know the convex blades are controversial, but in my opinion, they&#x27;re a major reason for this shaver doing such a good job on my neck and under my chin.</li>
      <li>Shave is very close and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>The 8162 is the first one I&#x27;ve owned that&#x27;s able to do so without &#x27;chugging&#x27; like a mower in wet grass or outright getting tangled to a stop and ripping out hair when I move at more than a snail&#x27;s pace.  </li>
      <li>in this day it&#x27;s rare to find a product that really does perform as well as advertised.</li>
      <li>Now, three weeks later, I&#x27;m even more elated than I was during that first shave.</li>
      <li>can finally kiss his face without getting a rash :) &lt;br</li>
      <li>and the charger is the standard pronged type and not the newest induction charging like many electric tooth brushes.</li>
      <li>bought the es8162s (I dont know why it seems so many reviewers get model&#x27;s mixed up)..  </li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>It gives a nice close shave, is easy to clean and can be used wet or dry.  </li>
      <li>Yes, I love being able to shave wet with a little shaving cream or liquid soap, but, to my surprise, dry shaving gives me equally great results.</li>
      <li>And I really love the fact it washes clean in a jiffy with just a little soap and water.  </li>
      <li>Mine has lasted a total of 6 months before becoming plagued with issues and problems.  </li>
      <li>So far I am quite satisfied with the user friendlyness, price, and ability to use and clean the shaver in wet environment.</li>
      <li>The shaving brush is pure indulgence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Wet And Dry cut is great</li>
      <li>My old model has always cleaned fine with water only, and with out the turbo feature (high speed to help clean it)..  </li>
      <li>is fine, it runs quiet and you get 5-7</li>
      <li>i really want to congratulate the product engineers at panasonic for developing such a fine product.</li>
      <li>The shaver is very efficient and I can shave my head and face faster than using a blade.</li>
      <li>would recommend this shaver to absolutely anyone who prefers to use an electric.</li>
      <li>However, when using it in the shower without shaving cream, it doesn&#x27;t produce a very close shave.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The shaver is also much louder than the Norelco.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper at 80 bucks and let me still you...</li>
      <li>For starters, the blades move at a consistent speed, which is higher than my old Braun.</li>
      <li>It did a great job, but came with an unnecessary cleaning station and didn&#x27;t have the new convex blades.</li>
      <li>really miss the induction charge cradle of my older razor</li>
      <li>so effortlessly I&#x27;m sure it uses less power to run it.  </li>
      <li>is the Panasonic ES8162S Pro Curve Elite Convex Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver alright to use with sensitive skin?</li>
      <li>I really really hope Panasonic is planning on phasing the old shavers out and replacing them all with these \\&quot;well-intentioned\\</li>
      <li>But despite all the new curves and pivots and springs, the shave is pretty much the same.  </li>
      <li>other thing I love is being able to shave wet or dry.</li>
      <li>It does not feel cheap though (as some other reviewers have said).    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> To answer a question that it took me weeks to find out, this ES8162S Elite is the same razor as the more expensive ES8163 shavers from Sharper Image and Brookstone, just a different color,no digital display(only has the battery level indicator in 20% incriments...very helpful and acurate!) and the charger is the standard pronged type and not the newest induction charging like many electric tooth brushes. These trade offs are not a big deal for the $150 price difference (this is comming from someone who normaly likes the toys and buttons)  The Elite has the newest Arced foil just like on the more expensive Sharper Image and Brookstone models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont be swayed with other shaver brands that have a cleaning base, this shaver is so easy to clean with hot water and liquid hand soap...only takes under 30 sec.  Also, a few other reviews on the web complained of the noise level...come on people, it is an electric motor working at 13,000 rpm, there will be sound but this shaver is not bad at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not buy this shaver from Amazon, had a great experience with another online store since Amazon was out of stock at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proformance:&lt;br /&gt;1. Arced Foils is not a gimmick, works great&lt;br /&gt;2. Great pivioting head&lt;br /&gt;3. Had a rotary shaver last and this Panasonic Arced Foil, unlike other foil shavers, can cut in any direction...up, down, left, right just like a rotary.&lt;br /&gt;4. Battery life is great&lt;br /&gt;5. Wet And Dry cut is great (others have said wet cut is better than dry with this shaver...both suit me great)&lt;br /&gt;6. Ultra Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;7. Easy to hold and use, skinner handle than previous modles&lt;br /&gt;8. Includes pop-up trimmer(I just use my beard trimmer instead of pop-up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always do your online reaserch at multiple sites.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  The best I have ever used.  Far better than the latest Braun 360.  Even better than the Gillete Fusion razor.  It takes longer to shave but no cuts and after a week or two no irritation in the neck area.      Other than the nano-particles (what ever those do) and the cleaning base, this is the exact same shaver sold at Brookstone for $249.00.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift but the recipient likes it and would recommend it he says.</li>
    <li> My husband has a tough beard that grows in many directions, always had a 5 oclock shadow. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He had tried many, many electric razors over the years and they always ended up in a drawer, but his sensitive skin didn&#x27;t do well with a blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After reading many reviews, I chose the Panasonic and WOW! He&#x27;s been getting the closest shave of his life, BETTER than a blade! And *I* for once am not getting &#x27;beard burn&#x27;..which is a great relief. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can finally kiss his face without getting a rash :) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Previous Panasonic model had a frictionless stand charger, could store / retrieve with one hand.  Present model needs two hands, minor hassle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaving works well enough.</li>
    <li> I love this razor...It gives a nice close shave, is easy to clean and can be used wet or dry.  Nothing to complain about here!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Panasonic shaver to replace my old Panasonic electronic razor that used the same linear wet/dry shaving technology.  I had been satisfied with that one for ~5 years, but the battery would not hold a charge any longer and the blades were dull.  This new Panasonic razor produces a closer shave (at least in comparison to an old dull electric razor - hard to remember what it was like when new) but is not exactly the same.  It seems to produce a much closer shave when using shaving cream/gel in the shower, and an intermediate shave when using it dry.  However, when using it in the shower without shaving cream, it doesn&#x27;t produce a very close shave.  I have soft facial hair, so maybe it works better on thick beards ... maybe.  On the postive side, I&#x27;ve had no problems with razor burn.  Aside from the shaver, the trimmer is quite good and much better than my previous Panasonic razor.  The charge on this razor seems to last for days (maybe &gt; 7 days?).  I have found no problem in lacking the digital power display on the higher priced (\\&quot;identical\\&quot;) razors marketed through other retailers.  The price on Amazon was not as cheap as the Amazon price before Christmas, but it was still the best price on the web at the time.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and have tried a variety of blade and electric shavers over the years.  The only electric shavers that have every really worked for me are Panasonic - Norleco and Reminton shaves never seemed to get as close, they irritated my skin while trying to get a good shave, and they weren&#x27;t very durable.  The last Panasonic I bought, some 8 years ago, was a quantum leap above.  But, it was time for a new one with the battery losing charge and the need for new blades again.    I expected the Pro Curve Elite Convex to be a another leap ahead.  It wasn&#x27;t.  It is much lighter now, and it charges faster, while giving many more shaves on a charge.  But despite all the new curves and pivots and springs, the shave is pretty much the same.  In other words, it still beats the rest, but it isn&#x27;t that much of an improvement.    If you haven&#x27;t tried a Panasonic, this is the way to go, but if you have the best, then don&#x27;t expect all the new-fangled stuff to really improve the shave.</li>
    <li> It took about a week for my face to adjust to the shaving head. At present it far outpreforms my Norelco floating head shaver. &lt;br /&gt;If it were a bit quiter I&#x27;d give it a 5.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Panasonic Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver since March 2005 (model 8152S). Before that, I used the Norelco Quadra 7864XL, but moved to Panasonic after reading rave reviews about the shavers. Must say I&#x27;ve been disappointed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My experience tells me the Norelco gave closer shave. The Panasonic takes LONGER for a similar close shave, and it leaves razor burns more easily. It also leaves nicks and cuts almost always, a problem I NEVER had with the Norelco. (Note: I have sensitive skin.) And it seems impossible to shave in the hollow of the throat with the Panasonic - the hair just don&#x27;t go! &lt;br /&gt;The shaver is also much louder than the Norelco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I seem to be unwittingly pitching for the Norelco brand, so one caveat: the Norelco shave was not great either (that&#x27;s why I switched brands in the first place), but in retrospect, it does seem to have been the better shaver for me.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;End note: Neither Norelco nor Panasonic gives a shave as good as with typical razors, so maybe its best to stick with them (unless a normal razor leaves a bloody mess everytime, as in my case). &lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> It was everything you said it would be.</li>
    <li> There is a reason this product has a list price of 229 and can be bought for 139. It isn&#x27;t good.  Mine has lasted a total of 6 months before becoming plagued with issues and problems.  Also, the convex cutting system will probably NOT catch on.  It isn&#x27;t superior to Panasonic&#x27;s old system at all and seems to be more problem plagued.  I bought a Pro Curve Linear Pivot.  Much cheaper at 80 bucks and let me still you...it doesn&#x27;t look as nice and feels a bit cheaper but it operates much better and actually gives a better shave.  I really really hope Panasonic is planning on phasing the old shavers out and replacing them all with these \\&quot;well-intentioned\\&quot; but faulty and disappointing convex systems.  Also, the one piece design of the shaver foil isn&#x27;t great either.  I had a previous Panasonic with this design and it also disappointed.</li>
    <li> is the Panasonic ES8162S Pro Curve Elite Convex Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver alright to use with sensitive skin? thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver about one year ago. For years I was using Braun shavers and was happy with them but decided to try competition. In spite of few people on internet who mentioned short lifespan I gave Panasonic a try. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaving is fine, it runs quiet and you get 5-7 shaves with one charge.  After about one year it started making strange noise and you get only 3-4 shaves with one recharge. Month later slowly went dead. Exactly as some other people wrote on bulletin boards, what make me to believe to those people writing reviews.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You would expect more shave for $100. Today I went to buy Braun shaver. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I was requested to write a review by Amazon. I felt this request was premature since I used this product only for a month. So far I am quite satisfied with the user friendlyness, price, and ability to use and clean the shaver in wet environment.</li>
    <li> Bought it a month back. Quite happy wih it so far. The good thing is you don&#x27;t need some fancy liquid to clean it. However a few tiny patches of stubble do get left uncut. I take care of them with the trimmer.</li>
    <li> 30 seconds into my first shave, I knew I had made a great choice for my new razor. Now, three weeks later, I&#x27;m even more elated than I was during that first shave. After using Braun shavers for my last two, this Panasonic is a revalation. I researched new shavers for a couple hours, and narrowed it down to this Panasonic and the comparable (and comparably expensive) Braun system. Perhaps the latest Braun would have made me happy, too, but I won&#x27;t be switching back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I like about the ES8162? For starters, the blades move at a consistent speed, which is higher than my old Braun. The blades maintain speed, even when the shaver&#x27;s battery is low, something that plagued my old Braun, which in the end I had to keep plugged in 100% of the time. The consistently high speed of the Panasonic means less razor burn, at least on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I love is being able to shave wet or dry. I thought this was a \\&quot;nice to have\\&quot; but I have quickly become addicted to shaving wet, with my Geo F. Trumper shaving soap and a real badger brush. Talk about a crazy combination of retro and modern! But the glycerin-based shaving soap feels so much better on my face, leaves it smooth and clean, and is the perfect lubricant for shaving with the Panasonic. The shaving brush is pure indulgence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to hate shaving. I wouldn&#x27;t say I look forward to it now, but it&#x27;s certainly become an experience with its own modest pleasure.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used  -I didnt get the scratched up neck other complained about..  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought the es8162s (I dont know why it seems so many reviewers get model&#x27;s mixed up)..  Panasonic tells me all blades use the nano technology (and some models just advertize it in the write up)..  I had a very difficult time comparing different razors..  TIP: you can call panasonic and ask what replacement blades are used (to compare by the blade end of the razor)..   Mine has a lithium ION battery, I wanted it, but I dont know if its really better (for a shaver application)..  Mine has curved or arced cutting head..  I dont know if its really better but it works so damn well I dont want to mess with it..  I do believe the curve is at leasat partially responsible for the great performance..   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really miss the induction charge cradle of my older razor (so nice just to drop it in).   I would gladly have accepted a little larger razor (if needed) to make the induction thing work.   In fact, this, and the razor is so small and light, that I wish it was a little larger and heavier, is my only [small] complaints.   It does not feel cheap though (as some other reviewers have said).    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The charge stand that came with the razor is a little piece of plastic about a half inch high..   You plus the power cord into the stand, then plug the razor into the stand (by pushing it straight down)..  The power cord also fits into the razor directly (I believe)..   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I did not get a model with a cleaner station..  It seemed so unnecessary to me..  My old model has always cleaned fine with water only, and with out the turbo feature (high speed to help clean it)..  Possibly the 30 degree blades creates a nook for dirt to gather and stick..  I&#x27;ll keep an eye out for this.. and if it happens I&#x27;ll start using ordinary liguid soap (as the directions say to do) and run it in turbo mode for 30 seconds)..  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The blades are really sharp (Ialmost cut my finger checking them out)..  My old panasonic was (I believe) 90 degrees (from visual inspection) versus these new 30 degree cutters..  I believe (too small for me to see) that the 30 degrees is created in the edge of the blades (which still stand at 90 degrees)..  I admit my old blades were dull (very dull).  But even new they were never close to these.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I cannot comment on battery life since I&#x27;ve only had it 2 days..  But the sharp blades seem to cut so effortlessly I&#x27;m sure it uses less power to run it.  Also, from the sound of it, Im guessing it has been engineered to use less battery power too..    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I did not find the razor unusually noisy as some reviewers complained..</li>
    <li> i have never written a review before for any product. i was a blade shaver for 40 years. i have tried electric razors in the past (including a panasonic wet/dry shaver about 15 years ago) with poor results. recently my doctor told me to switch to an electric shaver due to the blood thinner medicine i am on. i read the prior reviews for this shaver and figured i&#x27;d give it a try not expecting great results. boy was i wrong. this razor gives a superb shave wet or dry--actually as close to a blade as i think an electric could ever shave--not perfect but pretty darn close to it. and no nicks or cuts to boot! i was torn between buying this unit or one of the better brauns. i went with this one due to the wet/dry feature that the braun did not have. i really want to congratulate the product engineers at panasonic for developing such a fine product. as a bonus the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; cleaning feature works perfectly as well. in this day it&#x27;s rare to find a product that really does perform as well as advertised.</li>
    <li> I always hated blade shaving, but the cheesy electrics I used never did a good job on my pretty tough beard. Finally, I did a lot of research and decided to try a Panasonic wet/dry from a local store. It did a great job, but came with an unnecessary cleaning station and didn&#x27;t have the new convex blades. So I returned it and ordered the 8162 from Amazon. And - though it might have been partly a matter of my face getting used to Panasonic&#x27;s system - the 8162 did even better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One thing my research taught me was that beards and skins differ, and no shaver is going to work best for everyone. But I can&#x27;t imagine a better shaver for me than this one. It feels great in the hand, and gives me super-close, quick, comfortable shaves. Yes, I love being able to shave wet with a little shaving cream or liquid soap, but, to my surprise, dry shaving gives me equally great results. I know the convex blades are controversial, but in my opinion, they&#x27;re a major reason for this shaver doing such a good job on my neck and under my chin. The build seems great - I had problems with Braun&#x27;s fragile screens, and Panasonic&#x27;s seem beefier. Charges quickly. And I really love the fact it washes clean in a jiffy with just a little soap and water.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Downsides? I really wish it were cord/cordless, so when the battery goes into inevitable decline, I won&#x27;t have to face replacing it. And replacement blades and screens seem bloody expensive. On the other hand, expensive cleaning solutions are superfluous. And, oh yeah, it&#x27;s a bit tricky fo shave just below my sideburns. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary, of course. In fact, since shavers have trial-period return policies, you might want to try out different brands bought at your local brick-and-mortar. But I&#x27;ve found an electric that does every bit as good job on me as I ever got with a blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day for three weeks and I am very pleased. I bought it as an upgrade to the Panasonic ES8066 that I&#x27;ve used for five or six years. I use this shaver mostly wet. The moving head is definitely an improvement. The  shaver does a better job of shaving my neck and under the chin, though minor clean-up with a razor is (sadly) still needed.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only unfortunate thing about this shaver is the charging stand, which is a flimsy plug-in type, as opposed to the sturdy induction kind on my old ES8066. However, the charge lasts for a very long time so the stand doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver to absolutely anyone who prefers to use an electric.</li>
    <li> There are two things why most people choose blades over electric shavers: 1. quality of the shave and 2. skin irritation. &lt;br /&gt;What I found using this Panasonic shaver the results are identical to regular blades. It shaves as close as regular blade. Not 80%, not 95%, it is exactly 100% as regular blades. And there is no skin irritation what&#x27;s so ever! (at least for me). &lt;br /&gt;What else can you ask from electric shaver? &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I would buy another Panasonic ES8162 tomorrow, if something happened to this one. I previously had a Panasonic ES8023. Panasonic keeps improving their design, and I think the Panasonic ES8162 is the best razor made, and here is why: &lt;br /&gt;1) Better motor, higher speed, better blades, reasonable price. &lt;br /&gt;2) Better Design; lighter, pivoting head, better ergonomics.  &lt;br /&gt;3) Easy cleaning; water clean up and your done. &lt;br /&gt;4) Better battery; lasts longer, and charges quickly. &lt;br /&gt;5) Great Shave; below the shin smooth &lt;br /&gt;6) Wet/Dry use; I love the fact I can shave in the shower or tub. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only disadvantage is the new charger is a little bit of a hassle to get the shaver in and out of, but the shaver is well worth it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Shave is very close and comfortable.  Cleaning with soap and water is great.  Haven&#x27;t tried the wet shave yet.  The trimmer does not seem to be that great on mustaches, as the motor seems to be running to fast for a clean cut.</li>
    <li> I bought this model when the battery in my ES8023 stopped holding a charge (which is common judging by the other comments.)  I&#x27;ve got a hide like a badger, so nicks, scrapes and sensitivity issues are irrelevant; I only care whether a shaver can mow through the 24-gauge steel wire that masquerades as my beard.  The 8162 is the first one I&#x27;ve owned that&#x27;s able to do so without &#x27;chugging&#x27; like a mower in wet grass or outright getting tangled to a stop and ripping out hair when I move at more than a snail&#x27;s pace.  It shaves close, too.  I&#x27;ll miss sanding carpentry projects with my face, but being able to kiss gals without causing permanent injury is a welcome novelty.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;As close as a blade\\&quot; to describe electric razor we have heard for years.This Panasonic is superior.For anyone on asprin therapy or blood thinners a nick with a blade is a problem to which the answer is this razor. If it had an induction charger it would be a five star,small nit pick. I believe the newer model has this feature. Takes 2-3 wks for your beard to adjust but then great shaves in the shower</li>
    <li> This electric shaver has convinced me that an electric shaver can shave closer than a standard razor. I selected this shaver after a 3 weeks of reviewing shavers. The first time I used this shaver I was not aware that the shaver was so efficient, an so I cut myself from pressing too hard. I have used this shaver on my face and on my head (shaved head) and I would say it is comparable to a 5 blade razor. The shaver is very efficient and I can shave my head and face faster than using a blade. If this shaver ever breaks I will buy me another- it&#x27;s that good. Charge time is excellent- 55 minutes for a full charge. Generally a charge will last me a week because I shave my head 4 times per week.</li>
