      <li>It&#x27;s a roll on, which I&#x27;ve never used, and it works wonderfully.  </li>

      <li>I wonder why when it really is one of the best and most effective products on the market.  </li>
      <li>Love, love this deodorant!</li>
      <li>That being said, this is by far the BEST aluminum-free deodorant out there.  </li>
      <li>This was the most effective non-aluminum deodorant ever.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best aluminum-free deodorant out there by far.  </li>
      <li>as far as I am concerned, this is THE PERFECT DEODORANT/ANTIPERSPIRANT!  </li>
      <li>Since there have been some questions about safety regarding aluminum in deodorants, it&#x27;s good to find a product that is aluminum free yet does the job.</li>
      <li>I recently discovered that it isn&#x27;t wise for me to wear deodorant with aluminum anymore, so when I searched Amazon for aluminum free, I was so happy to see it again!</li>
      <li>I wish this product was still available in the store, but am glad I can purchase it online!  </li>
      <li>and I love the smell of it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be sticking with this one for sure.  </li>
      <li>Better yet, my underarms don&#x27;t itch at all</li>
      <li>I love this deoderant, I just wish  you didn&#x27;t take it off the shelves.  </li>
      <li>Well, this deodorant moved to the top of the list.</li>
      <li>I love the cotton technology, and the no-aluminum.  </li>
      <li>I love this brand.</li>
      <li>I have been using the origional adidas aluminum free deodorant for quite some time now, but I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere!</li>
      <li>I recently rated Desert Essence at 5 stars for being the best yet...</li>
      <li>As someone who has perspiration issues I thought this would be a sure shot to help with my wetness.</li>
      <li>I think you will be pleased with this purchase, I just hope they never stop making it</li>
      <li>So, I reached in her bag and borrowed her Adidas deodorant real quick</li>
      <li>I just switched to this deodorant from using antiperspirants for my entire life, and I&#x27;m really impressed.  </li>
      <li>Nothing works better have tried everything.</li>
      <li>Many of them don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than everything else out there on the shelves.</li>
      <li>I do wish it had a more feminine scent, however.</li>
      <li>Adidas if you are reading this please bring this back, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
      <li>it lasts way better than any of the others, and D)</li>
      <li>I will buy more.</li>
      <li>Then my body went through withdrawal of anti-persperant and sweat more.</li>
      <li>Some days after work I have to reapply it but mostly because the scent faded, not because I smell.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ve also found it at Top Food and Drug.  </li>
      <li>Glad to have it though.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s probably because they think that just because there&#x27;s no aluminum that it&#x27;s organic or safe.</li>
      <li>I am soooo glad I tried it.</li>
      <li>Also love that it doesn&#x27;t have Aluminum in it.</li>
      <li>This deodorant is an effective aluminum free deodorant.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only aluminum-free deodorant I ever found that works really well over 24 hours.  Sadly, I can&#x27;t get it locally.  I believe it only comes from Canada, but I&#x27;m happy to get it through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of non-aluminum deodorants.  Many of them don&#x27;t work for me.  Some are awkward &amp; hard to use.  This one is just like the antiperspirants.  Rolls on easy &amp; it works.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this product because I had been having a hard time with deodorant since my skin is extremely sensitive. I put it on and it started itching IMMEDIATELY, so I stopped using it. However Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Deodorant (Aluminum Free) Unscented, 2.5 Ounce Stick (Pack of 4); http://www.amazon.com/Toms-Maine-Deodorant-Aluminum-Unscented/dp/B000MATC5M/ref&#x3D;sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1278320523&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1-fkmr0&lt;br /&gt;ended up working for me. May this be of help? I hope so...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through the Tom&#x27;s phase and crystal deodorants-but this is the best long term smelling anti-aluminum deodorant so far.&lt;br /&gt;The others smell good when you first put them on, but if you are like me and discovered that with out the aluminum you are a sweatier person, this makes you feel more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that your body actually can go through withdrawal symptoms with out the aluminum, and for me it was a shock to be sweating so much. This is an excellent buffer to ease into the difference between anti-perspirant to deodorant.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and was excited when it came in because it smells great!  That is a major factor for me when buying deodorant.  As most of you know this deodorant is aluminum free which is why I purchased it.  I have never had an allergic reaction to any deodorant before until this!  After one use I got a huge peeling rash under both armpits where I was walking around with my arms out for three days it hurt so bad!  I read several other people have had the same issue but decided to purchase it anyway thinking they must have sensitive skin (I luckily do not).  I would suggest to anyone the first time they use it to use it sparingly until you know if you are in the clear or not instead of walking around looking like Frankenstein holding your arms out like I had to!  Besides the rash (obviously) I really liked the deodorant and would have ranked it higher, but then again I am not a big sweater.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but that&#x27;s how good this deodorant is.  Go figure.    If you want to be completely dry, this is not the product for you.  It won&#x27;t keep you completely dry, but it does relieve some of the wetness issues and does a great job with odor.  However, for women with breast cancer history/concerns, this has NO ALUMINUM and is the best non-aluminum deodorant I&#x27;ve found to date (and I think I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all of them).      I only wish I could find it in a store.  For whatever reason, after a short time on the shelf, the only place I can find this product is on Amazon, and I worry that it won&#x27;t be available at all soon.</li>
    <li> I just started using this deodorant a few days ago &amp; it works great. I had been trying to find one that would act as an \\&quot;antiperspirant\\&quot; but without the potentially harmful aluminum as the active ingredient, &amp; this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that works &amp; smells great, too. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> At the instruction of my chirpractor, I stopped using deoderant with aluminum.  It was causing me lots of aches and pains in my shoulders, neck, and back, and some confusion. Metals in your system can do that and using a standard aluminum deoderant is allowing metals into your body through the very vulnerable area of your body-your armpit.  Finding a good deoderant without aluminum was a challenge.  The Adidas, aluminum-free deoderant met the challenge for a number of reasons.  Decent price, works very well (I need a deoderant that can provide wetness protection and odor protection, and this one does), smells good, and I no longer have those aches,pains, and confusion.  I also threw out my Gold Bond Body Powder, it was made with metals.  I started using cornstarch baby powder.</li>
    <li> This is the best deoderant. It actually works! No other deoderants work on me. AND it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it!</li>
    <li> I used to get Adidas Deodorant from Walmart a few years ago, and was quite sad to see it leave the shelves. It is the only deodorant that ever worked for me. I recently discovered that it isn&#x27;t wise for me to wear deodorant with aluminum anymore, so when I searched Amazon for aluminum free, I was so happy to see it again! Great smell and keeps me very dry. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as long lasting as it used to be, so when I come home from work I have to reapply some.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked all over for a deodorant, not an antiperspirant, because I don&#x27;t want to use aluminum on an every day basis.  It&#x27;s really hard to find - at least it is where I am.  I&#x27;m grateful to have found this, and it works as good, or better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for about 3 years now, and I absolutely love it!  It&#x27;s the best aluminum-free deodorant out there by far.  I was disappointed to see that my local Walgreens had stopped carrying it (they said it was discontinued), but I was delighted to find it here on Amazon.  I was a little confused as to how it was still being sold here if it had really been discontinued, but I called the manufacturer today and they confirmed that it was discontinued at the end of last year.  So I guess companies are just selling off their remaining inventory now.  It would be nice if Coty would come to their senses and bring it back in the future, but I&#x27;m definitely not counting on that and am taking this opportunity to stock up.</li>
    <li> Searched and searched for a healthier deodorant, and hoped this might be it. But it is extremely sticky and sticky smelling. And expensive. Cannot recommend.</li>
    <li> I wish I could still by Adidas for women locally.  It works really well and it&#x27;s non-irritating.</li>
    <li> My wife is super sensitive to pretty much anything you put on your skin.  She tried all kinds of different brands of Anti-Perspirant deoderants and eventually, she was happy with the Cotton Infused Trader Joe&#x27;s deoderant, but it was recently discontinued.      When I saw this deoderant, we decided to give it a try...and we&#x27;ve found a winner!</li>
    <li> Very sad to see this go! This is the most effective aluminum free deodorant I have ever used and it smells great too! I am trying queen helene deodorant now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of metals, and regular deodorants make my face break out.  The new extra-strength versions give me hives.  This makes me sad.  What makes me sadder is when I waste good money on a natural deodorant (such as Tom&#x27;s of Maine or Herbal Clear) that doesn&#x27;t work for more than a few hours.  This Adidas deodorant makes me happy.  It actually works, doesn&#x27;t leave gunk on my clothes, and my face and body are blessedly rash and blemish-free.</li>
    <li> After much research, I am pleased to have found this product.  It is the only thing that works for me.  Unfortunately, they have discontinued it, so it is worth its weight in gold :P</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best Aluminum Free deodorant out there, very pleasant smell and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;I received it as a part of a gift set a while back and because I had a stocked up on another brand&lt;br /&gt;that I was using at that time, I didn&#x27;t get to using it until I used the other ones. From the moment I started&lt;br /&gt;using Adidas I loved it. It was so nice smelling and wasn&#x27;t discoloring my white tops, also it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so sad I run out because I just realized that they don&#x27;t carry it anywhere in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;Little bummed, because there is so much nasty stuff out there and finding a goo aluminum&lt;br /&gt;free deodorant that actually works and doesn&#x27;t make you want to puke is hard to find.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years now. It may not work for everyone, but it works for me, when nothing else really does. I used to have to switch deodorants every few months as they stopped working, until I tried this one and it has been great. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s gotten harder to find recently, so I was very happy to find it here. Product was delivered quickly and was exactly what I ordered. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It is almost impossible to find a women&#x27;s  deodorant. There is only antiperspirents, so you are forced to pay too much for a deodorant like this one.  Good product, just way overpriced!!</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot.  I admit it.  And my sweat is smelly.  And I do not want to use a product that solves that issue by covering it up with some reeking over-scented perfume or cologne.  If I wanted to reek of perfume, I&#x27;d bathe in it.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this in 2008, and have tracked it down through stores as it disappeared from their shelves.  I buy 3 or 4 at a time, in case it finally disappears completely.&lt;br /&gt;The scents are light and unobtrusive, it keeps me dry and not stinky, it doesn&#x27;t smear all over my clothes or require that I stand with my arms over my head so it can dry in my armpits, it washes off in the shower, and it has continued to do all of these things even after 2 years of use.  I can&#x27;t say this loud enough- as far as I am concerned, this is THE PERFECT DEODORANT/ANTIPERSPIRANT!  Now, to find it in stores, so I don&#x27;t have to pay these kinds of ridiculous prices.  I love the cotton technology, and the no-aluminum.  If they made an unscented version I would rent a storage unit and buy every stick of the stuff I could get my hands on.</li>
    <li> This product is the only aluminium free deoderant that I have found to actually work against odor ALL day. It also does a pretty decent job as an anti-perspirant due to the cotton.</li>
    <li> I recently rated Desert Essence at 5 stars for being the best yet...I&#x27;ll have to bump that one down to four. That one, like most \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; deodorants only gives me odor protection for about half the day. I thought that was the best I could get for an aluminum-free deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I tried this! It&#x27;s not \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; but it is aluminum-free. Regular deodorants make my armpits itch and burn, so I swapped to aluminum-free deodorants. Unfortunately, they just don&#x27;t work as well to keep the odor down. I&#x27;ve tried about ten different brands, and nothing has come close to a regular deodorant. BUT, this Adidas stuff seems to finally make the cut. The scent is a little strong at first, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant. The important thing is that at the end of most days, I can take a sniff and not smell any body odor. If I&#x27;ve had a long day with lots of exercise, I might smell a LITTLE, but the scent of the deodorant covers it up pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a aluminum-free deodorant and you don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s not listed as \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; or an antiperspirant, this is the stuff for you. I will be re-ordering, though I may give the other scents a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I bumped this down to 4 stars because it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find. Also, I tried out another brand, Silver Shield roll-on and have to say that THAT one is the best aluminum-free deodorant. This one is still good, but because of the availability and after trying the Silver Shield...the five stars has to go to Silver Shield.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to control odor during the summer months. I have a stressful job and I am outdoors frequently this product work.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the other fragrances, but this \\&quot;Pure Lightness\\&quot; smells like a combination of insect killer and the kind of cheap, chemical-laden air freshener one might encounter in a public restroom.  Big disappointment!  I really wanted to like this product, but it&#x27;s going back ASAP.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST non-alumin deo I have used. It works GREAT, washes clean off your skin, no stickness and no white marks on your clothes. I had a hard time finding this and thought it was discontinued. I just called the company today (10-7-09 at 1-800-715-4023) and was told they repackaged it and changed the scent around a bit. It is still the COTTON-TECH formula, scent is Pure Lightness, which can be used for men or women. Even thought it does say for women, this will work for men as well- Adidas did discontinue the Cotton-Tech version for men. The company told me they are distributing this through Walgreens currently. Don&#x27;t pay dishonest greedy price  gauge sellers. I called my local Walgreens and they have it on the shelf and was on sale at $2.50. I have used the Pure Lightness and it works fantastic!!</li>
    <li> A previous reviewer complained that this product is not the old product, 1.6 oz and labeled aluminum-free.  It is in fact 2.6 oz as clearly advertised, and the contents list reveals NO ALUMINUM.  Both of these are good news to me.  It is apparently a new product from Adidas, and the moisture absorption technology is different from the first.  It works fairly well for me, is not causing me any underarm irritation, and satisfies my desire to avoid applying aluminum compounds to such a porous and sensitive body area.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter has really had a problem with perspiration and hoped this would solve the problem, but it wasn&#x27;t any better than some regular strenghth products that she&#x27;s used and the fragrance was not very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have issues with deoderants not working.  This unfortunately was one of them.  I felt like I smelled halfway through the day!</li>
    <li> I like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t keep odor away.  After 3 or 4 hours, I can smell a bit of body odor.  I don&#x27;t sweat, but need a product that will keep odor as well as wetness gone.</li>
    <li> I was helping a friend get ready for her wedding (lots of bending over and putting on her shoes, buttoning a thousand buttons on her dress, running back and forth fetching things), and, not gonna lie, I got a little gamey pre-wedding. Hey, being a bridesmaid is not for the faint of heart. So, I reached in her bag and borrowed her Adidas deodorant real quick (we&#x27;re close like that), and within about 30 seconds, I felt like someone had thrown a couple Molotov cocktails in my armpits. Holy hell, it was like Icy Hot on steroids. I wouldn&#x27;t say I have overly sensitive skin, but I every couple years I find something that doesn&#x27;t work for me. Well, this deodorant moved to the top of the list. A few days later, the skin under my arms actually peeled like a sunburn. No me gusta. I understand it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it, and, thus, keeps the stains away from your clothes. However, I&#x27;d buy a new t-shirt anyday over having Hades itself spring up under my arms. Beware!</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant that I have found without aluminum.  It really keeps you dry and it smells nice.  I had to come to the internet to buy it, because I stopped seeing it sold in stores.  I wonder why when it really is one of the best and most effective products on the market.  I hope that it indeed is also one of the healthiest. you wont be disappointed when you by it, like I have with so man natural deodorants in the past.</li>
    <li> I wish this product was still available in the store, but am glad I can purchase it online!  Received as ordered and in timely manner.</li>
    <li> I have looked high and low to find a good non-aluminum deodorant and heard through internet reviews that this was a good product. Initially, it seemed to smell nice and work better than the pink crystal brand sold at places like Walgreens. Then my body went through withdrawal of anti-persperant and sweat more. Now it seems the product wears off after a few hours. It does not work well with heavy work outs or times of strenuous activity. Buy this product to use doing day-to-day activities and your stronger products when you know you&#x27;re going to sweat real bad.</li>
    <li> I have an allergy to aluminum, so I am hard-pressed to find a deodorant without it, and that works. I worked nights for 5 years. Before I found this, during the summer I would often times have to change my shirt before heading to work because of gross armpit sweat stains. That was when I used Arm and Hammer, and other natural deodorants. Then I found this. What a difference! I&#x27;ve never had to change my shirt again because of gross armpit sweat stains! Did I mention it smells great?!</li>
    <li> i loved the product as both meanddaughter are extremely alergic to the aluminum in other  products. scouring the internet to find  a compatible item that smells good and performs as well. Unfortnatelly we are not as lucky. I find it outrageous that the price of these items found here on these sites is so high!! product had been discontinued almost 7 years ago!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;To pay so much for an item that old and then appy to the skin................. yeah nope thank you!&lt;br /&gt;That is a rip off.&lt;br /&gt;How do you sleep at night?</li>
    <li> No cancer! They have been putting crap like Aluminum in our deoderant for years and the heavy metals build up and cause all sorts of dieseses. I love this brand. Thank you Addias for GETTING IT RIGHT.</li>
    <li> Overall I was very glad to find this product, the natural deodorants weren&#x27;t cutting it for me, and I have tried them ALL. This serves as a great anti perspirant and a deodorant, which is very hard to find in an aluminum free product. I wish the scent weren&#x27;t so strong but it is something I am willing to deal with. I think you will be pleased with this purchase, I just hope they never stop making it or I&#x27;m back where I started.</li>
    <li> I got this product because it&#x27;s Aluminum free, but I can&#x27;t stand the smell so it went right in the trash.  I am very sensitive to smells, though, so some people may not mind it.</li>
    <li> If I could give it 10 stars I would! After reading the reviews I said why not. I am soooo glad I tried it. After two weeks of using it it has really cleared my armpits. I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I cannot BELIEVE that this stuff doesn&#x27;t have aluminum. I am drier than I EVER was with other antiperspirants. I still believe that re-routing sweat the way any antiperspirant does is probably a bad thing, but I am happy to know I&#x27;ll no-longer be depositing aluminum into my brain. It&#x27;s just wonderful, I&#x27;m going to buy the other scents. It smells really nice. It works for a full day, at least!</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I have ever used</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an absorbent deodorant that is aluminum free.  I&#x27;ve finally found what I&#x27;m looking for!  Other natural deodorants leave me with sweat marks and Adidas actually works.  I just wish I could find this at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for and trying many aluminum-free deodorant products over the past few years, and this is *definitely* my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;After learning of the negative effects of aluminum, I tried several other products, including baking soda, rock crystal and other \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; types.  They all smell good, but the deodorant ability usually wears off after a couple hours (my daughter said they lasted until about lunchtime!) plus there was always sweating.  BTW, if you are new to aluminum-free deodorant products, it is usually the aluminum zirconium or other aluminum ingredients that make something an \\&quot;anti-perspirant.\\&quot;  Anything else is really just a \\&quot;deodorant,\\&quot; keeping you smelling fresh but not (necessarily) preventing perspiration.  Anyway, this Adidas deodorant has lasted all day long in the fresh smelling department, and also has the best record of any I&#x27;ve tried at keeping me dry.  During my elliptical workout, I definitely had some wetness, but the rest of the time I have been pretty dry.  I do not think any aluminum-free product will ever keep you completely dry, but as long as you smell good, who cares?  This stuff smells great all day! Also, this scent \\&quot;Pure Lightness\\&quot; is not too flowery, so it could be used by men as well as women.  It pretty much smells like any pleasant soap or cleansing bar.&lt;br /&gt;I found this product at my local grocery store, but if they ever quit stoocking it, I would buy it at Amazon.  I will be buying this for my kids as well--no aluminum side effects for us!&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I changed my rating to four stars from five, because this product made me a bit itchy.  I don&#x27;t know what ingredient was the culprit,  and I am not especially sensitive, but it was not bad enough to make me stop using the product.  I used it until it was gone.  It&#x27;s still hard to find in stores, and that is my preferred way to buy deodorant, but I would use this again.</li>
    <li> I was using an aluminum free deodorant from L&#x60;Occitane, which had a great sent, but did not last after a couple of hours.  I&#x27;ve read lots of reviews on the cotton tech product but only could find it on Amazon.  I took the plunge, and it works really well.  Pure lightness is a fresh smelling sent, that goes on smooth with no film or staining to my cloths.  I think I will be buying a second one of these before this one runs out.</li>
    <li> One of the only aluminum free deodorants that actually lasts most of the day. Great for extra active people who sweat more than the average person.</li>
    <li> Title pretty much explains it all. I used Tom&#x27;s of Maine; but after a few days, even that created burning/itchy/peeling red rash in the pits. So, I was in search of something that felt better, would last longer, and to be aluminum free. My reaction to this product was even worse than Tom&#x27;s of Maine product. I thought at first maybe I had razor burn; but my pits kept getting redder w/ every application. Finally, the skin started peeling. The itching feeling turned into a quite painful burning. I&#x27;ve never had allergic reactions to under arm deodorants before, let alone any other reactions really. This kind of reaction was a first. I don&#x27;t understand what it is w/ these two products; but, upon reading reviews for both, I&#x27;m not the only one this has happened to. So, needless to say, the search for aluminum free/natural deodorant (that I don&#x27;t have to take a loan out to buy) goes on.</li>
    <li> After using antiperspirants for years, I noticed that my underarms were always itchy. If I gave in to the itch, I ended up scratching them red and raw. I did a bit of internet research and got the idea that maybe the increased amount of \\&quot;active ingredient\\&quot; in antiperspirants was causing my sensitivity. I decided to test out my theory, since I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a lot of luck with using a plain deodorant crystal, but I wanted something \\&quot;stronger\\&quot; for days I was out running with people (for their sake!). I tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine and although their deodorant smells nice and feels luxurious, it doesn&#x27;t actually work to combat underarm stink. Additionally, if I applied it in the morning and then reapplied it in the afternoon, my underarm would look like it was peeling. I could never tell if it was skin peeling or deodorant peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lucked out on finding this Adidas deodorant because it actually does the job. There WAS a bit of initial \\&quot;reaction\\&quot;, for lack of a better word. I think my underarms were unused to something that wasn&#x27;t an antiperspirant, and there was a week of redness and sensitivity. But once all of the \\&quot;active ingredient\\&quot; in antiperspirants was out of my system, there&#x27;s been no more redness or peeling. Better yet, my underarms don&#x27;t itch at all AND I can run with confidence that I won&#x27;t be stinking out my colleagues.</li>
    <li> So I read the ingredients on the back of the deodorant stick and found a couple interesting things like Lithium Magnesium (both are ingredients used in anti depressants), butylphenyl (dangerous to skin when used in high concentrations), and other ridiculous synthetic fragrances that&#x27;ll set your skin on fire. It&#x27;s cool that everyone else gives this stuff a 5/5 but it&#x27;s probably because they think that just because there&#x27;s no aluminum that it&#x27;s organic or safe. It&#x27;s most certainly not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what caused it, but I had a BAD reaction to this product.  I am extremely allergic to nickel and aluminum (hence trying to find a non-aluminum deodorant that isn&#x27;t a men&#x27;s product) so perhaps it&#x27;s just my sensitivities.  However, I applied the product and within 30 minutes I was almost screaming from the burning sensation and bright redness in my armpits.  I washed it off and within 10 minutes the burning was gone.  I can&#x27;t comment on its performance since it was on for such a short period of time.      Feel free to try it for yourself, but if you are buying this product due to skin contact dermatitis issues (aluminum allergies), be aware that it may cause a bad reaction.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t stop over-perspiration, but it works great for sports related usage, it smells fresh and is all natural. Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the high price though.</li>
    <li> I bought this becasue I was looking for a non aluminum based product.  True, there was no aluminum in this, however there are close to 20 other chemicals in this one stick and since I was looking to keep chemicals out of my body, I saw no reason to even use this ... tossed it in the garbage and have continued looking for the holy grail.    Toms of Maine caused burning and irritation, so that was a pass...    My suggestion is to move on and keep looking - check out the ewg . org website to see what&#x27;s really in your cosmetics - scarry stuff!</li>
    <li> Like a few other people reviewing this product, it made my armpits feel as though they were on fire and being stabbed by knives. My skin is fair but never sensitive to health or beauty products. The skin around my armpit peeled off leaving a sensitive red area for about a week. I will not use this product again and am currently experimenting with other aluminum free products which have not had the same reaction to my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the origional adidas aluminum free deodorant for quite some time now, but I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere! I came across this one, which seems to have replaced the origional. I think it works just as well, but the fragrance is soooo strong, that it intereferes with other fragrances you may be wearing. It also gives me a headache. Adidas, you should have left well enough alone!</li>
    <li> This product works great , smells great and NO aluminum ! I stay dry all day and no offensive odor. Good Bye deodorants with aluminum . Just wish I could buy it locally to avoid shipping and handling.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have been searching for a woman&#x27;s deodorant without an antiperspirant.  After using the product for awhile now I am not totally sure that it doesn&#x27;t have antiperspirant in it, but it smells nice and usually does its job.  I may be on the look out for a different deodorant however, because I am not sure the cost is worth it.</li>
    <li> After reading these reviews, I see that people are having trouble buying it in stores.  I just happened to run into Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and there was a whole stock of them!  I hope it works well!</li>
    <li> I had breast cancer and although scientific evidence merely points at aluminum as a potential contributing factor, that is enough for me. I really like the aluminum-free deoderant and wondered why it is so hard to find? Why would anyone even want to take a risk (no matter how small) with aluminum when alternatives work just as well?</li>
    <li> I was a regular user of the Adidas cotton tech women&#x27;s deodorant and was saddened when they were nowhere to be found in ANY store in California (trust me, I hunted)!  I resorted to ordering this one online and although its a bit different from the one I was using, it hasn&#x27;t failed me. The scent is great and it does an awesome job controlling wetness. I love the fact that its aluminum free and having tried ALL other organic/natural type deodorants, they just didn&#x27;t do the job quite as well as this does. I will DEFINITELY be purchasing more of this in the future!!</li>
    <li> This is the best Deodorant!!! Nothing works better have tried everything.Very difficult to find no stores in this area carry it.</li>
    <li> This is the best non aluminum deodorant I have found. Lasts all day, pleasant scent. I would recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is an effective aluminum free deodorant.  It is not an antipersperant, so don&#x27;t expect not to sweat.  But you don&#x27;t smell, and the deodorant scent stays fresh all day.  I bought this deodorant as an alternative to other chemical filled deodorants, so I was a little disappointed to read the ingredients and find Triclosan in it.  I&#x27;m guessing the way this deo works is the Triclosan kills the bacteria from your sweat so you don&#x27;t get odor.  But at least it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it.</li>
    <li> It works and without aluminum.    Tip for 1st time users-- you&#x27;ll have to detox yourself from your aluminum based deodorant when you switch.  Your system has gotten use to all of that aluminum in your deodorant and it will take about a week or 2 to adjust.    Give it time. Once your body acclimates you&#x27;ll be fine.    I roller skating for 3 hours and it still works beautifully.  So we don&#x27;t really need that aluminum.    I&#x27;ve used all 3 or so scents.  I like fresh powder the best.  Adjust for summer months.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t been able to find it at any grocery stores nearby or even in stores in other cities  for the past 2-3 months :(</li>
    <li> I love that Amazon sells this item.  It is by far my favorite deodorant to wear under white and light-colored clothing. Shipping was fast. A little on the pricey side for a deodorant, but I&#x27;m willing to spend the money since I cannot find it in any local stores.</li>
    <li> I love this because it keeps me dry like an antiperspirant, but it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum. It lasts all day, and the smell is perfect--not deodoranty.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job without the aluminum which is why I wanted it.  Herbal deodorants do not do the job as well, and this was a very good alternative.</li>
    <li> Ok, first of all - why is this product so expensive here on Amazon?? $17.95? I just got two of these at Fred Meyer for $5/each. Don&#x27;t pay this price before looking around at stores...I think I&#x27;ve also found it at Top Food and Drug.  That being said, this is by far the BEST aluminum-free deodorant out there.  I&#x27;ve tried Toms of Maine, Kiss my Face, and others; this is the best odor and sweat protection without the aluminum!</li>
    <li> Always wanting something that works without  aluminum in it and found this to work really good, but it is so hard to find.  Used to be readily available at Walgreens and such, but has not been for years and Amazon is the only place I can find it.</li>
    <li> This was the most effective non-aluminum deodorant ever.  I&#x27;m so sad its now unavailable.  I tried the other scent -- pure powder, and it does not work as well.  Very sad.  Adidas, please re-issue this product!</li>
    <li> For a Aluminum Free deodorant this is the best.  I don&#x27;t understand why they stopped making it.  You can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  I know some of my friends use to buy this at the store but are disappointed they took it off the market.</li>
    <li> Since this deodorant is aluminum-free, I assumed (wrongly) that this was a natural-type deoderant.  That would have been easy to look up, but it just didn&#x27;t occur to me.  The smell was a little on the strong side (though not an unpleasant one).  I still sweat just as much when wearing it.  I&#x27;ve already purchased the Thai deodorant stone since it&#x27;s natural and has had great reviews so far.</li>
    <li> I just switched to this deodorant from using antiperspirants for my entire life, and I&#x27;m really impressed.  I&#x27;ve used it now for a couple of months and it smells great (Pure Lightness scent) and keeps me fairly dry.  In the extreme heat of summer I end up using my old antiperspirant on the hottest days, but the Adidas Tech works very well the rest of the time.  The only reason I docked it one star is because of the outrageous price.  Even though I like it, I won&#x27;t buy it again unless the cost drops considerably...twelve bucks for one deodorant is just too much.</li>
    <li> If I get kinda sweaty afternoonish.... I just wash &amp; reapply. Writing this review because my armpits are BURNING from it right now. Shaved with a dulling razor last night. Ouch! Big day today too. Def keep back up</li>
    <li> but its discontinued now and im so depressed. It really solved my sweat issues better than anything else out there and i&#x27;d tried them all and it blocked odor it was awesome. Wish they&#x27;d bring them back. Stupid people and their rashes ruin everything for the other people whose lives were blessed with an amazing deodorant.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help with odors, also doesn&#x27;t help with wetness...so the price is too much and it&#x27;s not a great product.</li>
    <li> I searched far and wide for aluminumm free anti-persperant due to the health effects the aluminum containing kind. This is the best one. The only complaint I had was in the beginning it made my armpits a little red. It actually almost made me stop using it. After a while my body got used to it, and it stopped bothering me.</li>
    <li> My wife got this as another try at a deodorant that wouldn&#x27;t discolor her blouses. Nothing has worked so far.  However, she is very happy with the Adidas Cotton Tech product.  No discolorization and it works like a deodorant is supposed to.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 4-23-2010: I called the manufactor today. They discontinued this product Summer 2009. I had stocked up on it because Nov 2008 it was hard to find.     Seems like I have tried every aluminum-free deodorant from the local health food stores to no avail.   One day I was at a discount store and saw this adidas Cotton Tech Aluminum-Free which immediately caught my eye. Tried it and loved it.   Recently I tried to buy some more, but couldn&#x27;t find the exact same designed product. After reading some of the reviews here this last weekend I emailed the maker of this product, to ask about it.  Here&#x27;s part of the response I received the next day:     \\&quot;Please be advised that our entire collection of adidas® Absorbent Deodorants with Cotton Tech+ has been currently re-designed and re-packaged, which may account for temporarily low inventories at some stores.  Although it does not state \\&quot;aluminum-free\\&quot; on the new packaging, please be assured that all adidas® Absorbent Deodorants are in fact aluminum-free. We are sorry, but we cannot accept any direct orders from consumers.\\&quot;    I bought some, read the ingredients, AND it is still aluminum free!!!</li>
    <li> This product is so good!  I use it to get away from aluminum-based antiperspirants, which I believe are harmful, based on my experience.  This deodorant works extremely well and I just love it.  In fact, when my store stopped carrying it, I bought at least 12 here online to stockpile it.  I and my teen and pre-teen daughters use this product.</li>
    <li> This does pretty well to keep B.O. away; I work out 3 times a week and I never smell bad in the pits. However, I still sweat pretty badly (even without exercise) as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing this, so it&#x27;s not very good as an anti-perspirant for me. I might have a sweating problem though, so it may work better for those who sweat less.</li>
    <li> I TAUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT SORRY COULDNT USE IT IT BURNED UNDER MY ARMS WENT BACK TO USING SECRET AGAIN ....INTO THE TRASH IT WENT SHAME!!!</li>
    <li> Ever since I hit puberty I have noticed that I sweat more than the average person, even when I&#x27;m not doing any strenuous psychically activity. I have tried nearly every \\&quot;extra strength\\&quot; or \\&quot;clinical protection\\&quot; product to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;The cotton on this product is what attracted me. Cotton is absorbent, so I hoped it would help reduce the noticeable wetness on the underarms on all my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, I was in love with this product. It went on clear and didn&#x27;t leave any marks on my shirt. I didn&#x27;t have to apply it before bed. It didn&#x27;t smell like a perfume shop or men&#x27;s cologne. AND it actually prevented me from sweating through my shirts, which no other antiperspirant has done.&lt;br /&gt;Only one downside, if you get the product on your hand it will feel slightly grippy and weird. But a very tiny price to pay for the most effective antiperspirant on the market!&lt;br /&gt;In short, I 100% recommend this to anyone, athlete or not, who has sweat issues.</li>
    <li> seems to last longer than other natural brands, good for those who are wanting to steer clear of aluminum. You will not stink as long as you reapply more than once per day. smells nice. I will use this forever as I can no longer wear aluminum deodorants. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> This product caused a bad reaction in my arm pitts the itching and redness was intense, and to make matters worse I sweat like a animal it didnt work at all it was like i didnt use deoderant at all. PASS on this one.</li>
    <li> Love, love this deodorant! I just wish it was still available, it keeps you dry and it protects your white blouses &amp; shirts.</li>
    <li> My daughter needs the aluminum free deoderant and this adidas product works pretty well for her; although I think it could be a little stronger.  Maybe next time, we will try the men&#x27;s stuff..</li>
    <li> Since there have been some questions about safety regarding aluminum in deodorants, it&#x27;s good to find a product that is aluminum free yet does the job. Such products are hard to find.  I do wish it had a more feminine scent, however.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for 5 years and it work for me great.I&#x27;m planning to keep using it as long as I can find it online</li>
    <li> After Bed Bath and Beyond stopped carrying this deodorant I couldn&#x27;t seem to find it ANYWHERE. Of course my next thought was to head right to Amazon, and there it was! I love the smell and it definitely lasts throughout the day, or through a heavy workout at the gym. Seller packaged it well and it shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I had to stop using it and threw the remaining away. It gave me pimples in my underarms, I&#x27;m not used to that and it was irritating. The scent was great and I&#x27;m trying to move away from Al free deodorant, still looking...</li>
    <li> I really like this deodorant, but you just need to be careful with sensitive skin.  It can make your skin red and hurt, so make sure you dont overuse.</li>
    <li> I love this deoderant, I just wish  you didn&#x27;t take it off the shelves.  It&#x27;s light and I love the smell of it. And there&#x27;s no aluminum.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great. Keeps you smelling fresh all day long. Also love that it doesn&#x27;t have Aluminum in it. Hard to find in stores so was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product about 3 years to avoid aluminum antiperspirants.  This Adidas product does a decent job.  It&#x27;s no longer available in the stores I used to find it in, so I had to resort to buying online and paying a bit more.  Glad to have it though.</li>
    <li> Does the job very well  without poisonous chemicals even when sweating a lot. Can last the entire day with no problems.</li>
    <li> This is not very nice. I am pretty disappointed that I spent this much money on deodorant that isn&#x27;t good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, and it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum!!! I wish I could find this in stores. It works and does not seem to get on clothes. I would definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Ran out of this in Dec. 2008....have looked EVERYWHERE since and FINALLY found it today @ Walgreen&#x27;s....Plus it was on sale for $2.99 and had a $1.00 off coupon attached to it!   I have tried Tom&#x27;s....Crystal deodorant...and even the men&#x27;s Adidas deodorant, but it did not have the cotton tech and did not absorb the wetness as well.....I am sooooo happy to find it...hope they never discontinue it again!</li>
    <li> This is a great aluminum free deodorant.  It is pricey though.  I haven&#x27;t tried any other aluminum free deodorants to compare.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been at war with deodorants, especially bar deodorants, so I was initially skeptical about trying it. I had used clinical protection for a couple years and until this deodorant, clinical protection was the only type of deodorant that worked well for me. However, the ingredients in clinical protection, I recently found out, are highly toxic. I wanted to switch to something less toxic, and I wanted to make that transition as smooth as possible. So many people switch to organic/safe/natural deodorants only to be disappointed because their bodies aren&#x27;t used to it, and as such, those deodorants prove ineffective. This is a good transition deodorant. On a scale of 1-10 in terms of toxicity it isn&#x27;t nearly as high as clinical protection but also not as low as some of the more natural deodorants out there in the market. It works well, does it&#x27;s job, and I&#x27;m not as worried about health repercussions. Good transition deodorants for those of you looking to switch from standard deodorants to natural ones.</li>
    <li> My underarms broke out in a red rash after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using this product and red rash disappeared.</li>
    <li> Hard to do as well as anti perspirant.  Purchased because of no alluminum.  I do like that it goes on dry.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Aluminum free. great scent...and it actually works!!!&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t say enough good things. I have told all my friends about it.</li>
    <li> THis product, which I love, is no longer produced, so it was great that each of the three I bought was separately tightly wrapped for freshness.</li>
    <li> I have tried more than a few aluminum-free product and this is the best one, doesn&#x27;t leave a residual on your clothes, doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction, and it actually WORKS GREAT as a deodorant without a strong artificial scent. It&#x27;s the only one that really works. I have looked everywhere and can&#x27;t find them anymore. I&#x27;m stocking up. Adidas if you are reading this please bring this back, it&#x27;s a great product! It&#x27;s better than everything else out there on the shelves.</li>
    <li> Admittedly, we clicked on the wrong item when we ordered this deodorant.  We were looking for alum-free, but this was way too pricey.  When it arrived, labeled for women, I left it to my wife to try.  When asked about her experience, she said that the product left such a moist feeling under the arm that it was difficult to determine its effectiveness in keeping one dry.</li>
    <li> After reading all the great reviews on this product I decided to buy it. As someone who has perspiration issues I thought this would be a sure shot to help with my wetness. It actually did the complete opposite and made my armpits extremely wet and goopy. I really do not recommend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent some time trying to find a deoderant w/out aluminum that works.  This was one of the brands I tried and it worked for most of the day, but not all and I found that toward the afternoon I had an unpleasant odor.  I&#x27;m not a sweaty person so I have been surprised at how much I sweat using a natural deoderant - obvioiusly I&#x27;ve gotten used to the anti-perspirant.  I like the way this deoderant went on and how it smelled at first application.  But it&#x27;s not for me.  I have found a natural deoderant by Aubrey Organics called E Plus High C.  It&#x27;s a roll on, which I&#x27;ve never used, and it works wonderfully.  It has a good odor and lasts all day.  I would recommend the Aubrey Organics product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Contains triclosan, avoid.</li>
    <li> ...but that&#x27;s about it. I live in a humid area and I&#x27;m a sweater. I didn&#x27;t find this kept me dry all day nor did the scent last. Needs to be far more outlasting.</li>
    <li> No point in being delicate here. I LOVE this stuff!! It has taken care of funk that totally kills other non-aluminum brands - Desert Essence, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, all the assorted stones, etc. I bought all the hype that Aluminum is a bad guy for health reasons (they may be false, but I&#x27;m not gonna risk it). This stuff, keeps me delicate and ladylike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sure hope it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued, because that will mean the search for a replacement and I pity those who are working out next to me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for an aluminum free deodorant for a while now and have tried several. Most with the claim to be \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, which I didn&#x27;t care so much about. I just didn&#x27;t want the aluminum that&#x27;s been ruining my clothes anymore.  I also didn&#x27;t want to give up dryness either, so after failures with Toms of Maine, Arm and Hammer, and Le Stick I found this one. It&#x27;s a little pricey for a stick of deodorant but A) it keeps me dry, B) it smells great, C) it lasts way better than any of the others, and D) it&#x27;s aluminum free.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with this one for sure.  I give it only 4 stars because it could last a little longer and makes the skin under my arms peel so I can&#x27;t use it every single day. Some days after work I have to reapply it but mostly because the scent faded, not because I smell.</li>
    <li> The only effective deodorant I have found. I was almost in a panic when I thought it had been discontinued. For the folks upset that it doesn&#x27;t keep them dry, it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little thick. I prefer the salt crystal over this. However, I must say, that the one I received seemed like it was really old... And it burned my armpit for a few seconds right after I put it on. Forgot about returning it. Into the garbage it went.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shying away from using regular deodorants since they&#x27;ve been making my  armpits dark as of late, so I went on an internet voyage to find an Aluminum free deodorant. Lo and behold I came across Adidas and ordered it.  What&#x27;s with the overpowering perfume smell? Why does it smell like a MAN&#x27;S deodorant?  Why is it INEFFECTIVE with eliminating odor causing bacteria? So many questions, no answers and a basket full of disappointment. Not a good buy.</li>
    <li> Manufacturer apparently has discontinued this product so very happy to be able to order, price reasonable compared to other sellers.</li>
