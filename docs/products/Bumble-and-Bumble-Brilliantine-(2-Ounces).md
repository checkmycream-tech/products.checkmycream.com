      <li>you&#x27;re looking for something to give your hair texture, light hold, and a satiny look, go with B&amp;B&#x27;s Grooming Creme.</li>
      <li>Light and adds shine.</li>
      <li>This always works to smooth my hair without making it oily.</li>
      <li>and you have will enjoy smooth shiny hair all day.  </li>
      <li>This styling product is a great finish to my daily styling!</li>
      <li>I really is a great after first day wash - gives shine and a bit of second day hair glory!</li>
      <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever loved.</li>
      <li>It does provide a neat sheen, but if I&#x27;m going to pay this much for shine and shine alone, I&#x27;d expect much more shine than this delivers.</li>
      <li>Fast service and genuine product!</li>
      <li>I normally have very fine, curly hair</li>
      <li>I have always had mildly frizzy hair</li>
      <li>I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutely worth it.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff--makes my hair have much more body without feeling gooey or wet</li>
      <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>It lasts forever, too, which makes the price worth it.</li>
      <li>My hair will absorb a pool-full of anything and everything and continue to frizz right through it.</li>
      <li>Does have a slight perfume smell but it smells good.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all - very light.</li>
      <li>This is a holy grail product for me - I love how it tames my fine, wavy, sometimes frizzy dark hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine blonde hair that&#x27;s healthy and soft.  </li>
      <li>The perfect finish for keeping thick, sometimes wild hair smooth and a little more under control.</li>
      <li>The only redeeming quality is the smell: it smells divine, like a tropical flower garden.</li>
      <li>It reduces the frizzies and makes your hair feel soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Other than that I love it!</li>
      <li>Product arrived on time and was exactly what I had ordered.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, gives me beachy textured hair and cuts back on the frizz.  </li>
      <li>just make sure to use a small amount and add more if needed.</li>
      <li>I gently brushed through my hair with a bristle brush (which usually causes the most frizz with my braided waves) and was delighted when I ended up with hair that looked like I belonged in the 1920s.</li>
      <li>Good product...can make hair a little greasy if you use too much</li>
      <li>couldnt live without, use small amount every day in hair for shine and that slept in look, great quality and packaging</li>
      <li>Using this creme is pretty much the equivalent of misting your hair with a non-sticky shine spray.</li>
      <li>Normally when I brush it out of a braid it turns into a huge, puffy mass of voluminous frizz, so before I used a brush I applied more than my normal amount (which is still not much) of brilliantine.</li>
      <li>Good for long and short hair and adds shine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently transitioned from long to short hair and am learning the ins and outs of short hair products.  I am zero fuss and low maintenance, and don&#x27;t invest in product just for sake of trying something new.  My stylist used this to give the ends of my hair a &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; look.  It&#x27;s absolutely worth it.  It makes my fine, limpy hair into an edgy, textured look with very little effort.  I&#x27;m sensitive to smells (I can wear maybe 3 perfumes) and this is a fragrant, but not overpowering - similar to gardenia or Kai fragrance.  If I had one product to buy for my hair, it would be this one.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my granddaughter, aged 16, who uses it all the time.  I have used it on the ends of my hair and like the soft effect and the very pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> While I am color treated, I have naturally blonde hair with a fine, super soft texture. It has a bit of a natural wave so I usually wear it blown straight and ironed flat. A dime-sized dollop of Brilliantine rubbed between my palms and then rubbed into the ends of my long hair gives it great texture and shine. If it is weighing your hair down, don&#x27;t put it near the roots! I never put creams or serums near the root of my hair because that removes all body. Haircare 101 people!</li>
    <li> Works really well on my hair, I&#x27;m a guy with fairly short, black hair, and it keeps it looking good during the day, but not too shiny.  Will buy again, but $20 for a bottle is not cheap!  I also like Potion 9, and sebastian laminates.</li>
    <li> good, fast service.  although the package smelled like it had been soaked in old lady perfume.....</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product!  I moved and changed hair salons as a result of the move. I am so glad I was able to order this product online!  This styling product is a great finish to my daily styling!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have been using it for yrs. It is the perfect product to give texture to your hair (helps bring out any highlights or low lights you have). A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have always had mildly frizzy hair and it just became worse as my hair grew long, so I always ended up cutting it back.  Now I have long hair and use just a little of this daily (I had the 2 oz. tube for a year and my hair is at least 15 inches long) and my hair looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> If your hair is curly or dry, this is NOT the product for you. \\&quot;Use sparingly\\&quot; my eye... I would need to use 1/4 of the tube to get anything close to the effect I thought I&#x27;d get from this product. Using this creme is pretty much the equivalent of misting your hair with a non-sticky shine spray. It doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING else: no hold, no separation, no style or texture at all. It does provide a neat sheen, but if I&#x27;m going to pay this much for shine and shine alone, I&#x27;d expect much more shine than this delivers. I even got FRIZZ after I used this. Not at all what I was looking for. The only redeeming quality is the smell: it smells divine, like a tropical flower garden. However, I do not want to pay $10+/oz for frizzy-yet-flowery hair. Sorry B&amp;B, but this is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to give your hair texture, light hold, and a satiny look, go with B&amp;B&#x27;s Grooming Creme. Now THERE&#x27;S a product that actually works. I would ONLY recommend Brilliantine if you have very short hair and simply want a shiny &#x27;do with no strings attached. Long haired folks, save your money!</li>
    <li> Be very careful how much you use....it does weigh your hair down if you use too much.  While I like B&amp;B products, I don&#x27;t see myself buying this again.  No real benefit to using it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product and as the description says it is hard to describe. A finish and outcome that leaves a sexy tousled look. Good for long and short hair and adds shine. Pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I love B&amp;B products and I wear my hair in varying lengths. I have thick hair with good body but some wave and no natural curl.  Right now I wear it short, layered and tousled.  I wash daily it in True Red shampoo and Leave-In conditioner (very light product) which I wash out.  After I towel dry, I rub a finger-tip squirt of Brilliantine in my palms and fingers and start tousling.  Air-dry and voila! I look ten years younger.  Another great B&amp;B product.  I go from short pixie to one-length mid-back straight-cut with everything in between and I always find the perfect B&amp;B products for every style. Great stuff and worth the extra money to look this good.</li>
    <li> Expensive but strong holding separator.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the spray</li>
    <li> I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great seller and a great price</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have long thick hair, tends to be dry and a bit wavy. This can change a bad hair day into a good one. Separates out the locks, gives a softer, shinier, look, and smells good too. I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Gives hair shine without being greasy or slimey.  Also can be mixed with all other bumble and bumble products.  But be careful, use too much, and you will weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> i am picky about using cream that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy afterwards, i LOVE this stuff!! great for taming fly aways and giving your hair a healthy shine.  and it lasts forever because you only need a small amount, the size of a pea, to rub in your hair.  and that&#x27;s for my long, down to my waist, thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have relied on brilliantine for several years now and have never been disappointed with my results.     I have a TON of long, slightly wavy hair that varies from very thick/coarse to very fine/smooth hair texture and I almost always has some level of frizz occurring.  I use several products to reign in my volume and almost always use this one to finish everything off. It works especially well on flat ironed hair and completely eliminates any strays that want to stick up or out.    I decided yesterday to try out how it would work with a more challenging job and used it to smooth my hair after it had been in a braid all day. Normally when I brush it out of a braid it turns into a huge, puffy mass of voluminous frizz, so before I used a brush I applied more than my normal amount (which is still not much) of brilliantine. I gently brushed through my hair with a bristle brush (which usually causes the most frizz with my braided waves) and was delighted when I ended up with hair that looked like I belonged in the 1920s. This morning when I awoke the waves were still tamed and my hair looks amazing.    I have found that this product does not work alone, so plan to use something else to add control and use this as a finishing product. My go tos for control are Bumble and Bumble Grooming creme, Bumble and Bumble Styling lotion, TIGI After Party, TIGI Hard to Get Paste and Moroccanoil.</li>
    <li> My go to product for a little bit if texture and that slept in hair look. Does have a slight perfume smell but it smells good.</li>
    <li> Works well to give your hair texture but beware to only use a very small amount or you will want to take a shower all over again.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I only use a pea sized amount on my (long!) hair and it creates beautiful waves.  Add some shine to the ends, and you&#x27;re ready to go.  It lasts forever, too, which makes the price worth it.</li>
    <li> Brilliantine is one of those staple products I&#x27;ve been using for years and it never ceases to make me happy. I find it to be the perfect hair cream and between the delicious smell, the gentle hold and the wonderful sheen it gives I am loyal to the bone. This stuff simply rocks. I could seriously be a spokeswoman for it. My short hair just loves it like mad.</li>
    <li> Works ok for a textured look. Be careful to layer the product.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, frizzy, wavy [past my shoulders] hair which without tons of taming is frazzled, tangled, and medusa-esque. I have tried a gazillion other products. My hair will absorb a pool-full of anything and everything and continue to frizz right through it. I&#x27;ll layer things on bit by bit. I get frizz. Frizz. Frizz. Frizz. Greasy frizz. Really? How is it even possible for hair to be greasy AND frizzy? Doesn&#x27;t this defy some law of physics?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliantine is the only thing that tames my unruly locks. The description on the front of tube says it all: \\&quot;It gives hair polish and a sort of languid, slept-in, sexy look.\\&quot; Well I agree. This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever loved. Whether I let it air dry curly [with B&amp;B Curl Conscious Creme mixed in] or blow dry and straighten, Brilliantine comes to the rescue. Just a little bit goes a long way... and on the flip side, just little bit more has never hurt. My hair never feels greasy. Medusa is subdued. And I don&#x27;t feel like I lose any days between washings with this product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with a little moroccan oil when my hair is wet after the shower, let it air dry and it is awesome!! My hair is so silky and shiny after I flat iron it. I normally have very fine, curly hair but I straighten often and this product has been a great find.</li>
    <li> Great finishing lotion - makes my hair shine!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years to finish a styling and give my cut some definition. Light and adds shine.</li>
    <li> My go to for longer hair styling. Great for ponytail days and quick fix styling days. Been using this product for years. Hope it never goes away as its a miracle cream. Have yet to find another product that comes close to this quality. I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all - very light.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this by a past hair dresser years ago and it&#x27;s the one product that continues to help with my hair&#x27;s frizziness. I dye my hair so it&#x27;s frequently dry. This always works to smooth my hair without making it oily.</li>
    <li> Very little of this product is needed to add a finishing touch to any hair style. This is my second tube and my stylist was out of them when I needed a replacement BUT a</li>
    <li> From the reviews, I wanted to love this product.  It&#x27;s good, but not great for my individual hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this is a thin hair cream, not an oil, as I had anticipated, so you do need to use more product than the Bumble &amp; Bumble Let It Shine (oil).  It definitely gives volume, that&#x27;s a plus for my fine thin hair.  It also makes my hair look somewhat moisturized and provides some styling control.  The downside is that my always seems dull or matte by the end of the day, making it appear older.</li>
    <li> The texture is not good for my hair.</li>
    <li> Products will respond to different hair types. I have curly, fine, highlighted hair. Yet it looks like I have a lot of hair when I wear it curly. I tried using this product sparingly but it still didn&#x27;t do the job. There are other products in the market that work better. For styling, I like bumble and bumble curl conscious. For shine, Phyto makes a good a good shine spray. I also use biolage gelee which I really like. I&#x27;ve never gone wrong with ANY Kerastase product. However, B&amp;B brilliantine product underperformed and unimpressed me.</li>
    <li> I love all Bumble &amp; Bumble products, but this one is my favorite.  Mix a dab of it with their styling creme before blow drying and you have will enjoy smooth shiny hair all day.  Also works great as a finishing creme - lightweight non greasy formula prevents frizz during humid summer days.</li>
    <li> have used all kinds of hair products, but I have to admit this one goes on light and manages my hair quite well without feeling goey or greasy.  Really like this product will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but not wort the price. My hair is mostly straight with some frizz, and when i use this on slightly damp hair it does help it stay smooth looking. Still looking for a better product tho.</li>
    <li> Good product...can make hair a little greasy if you use too much but it definitely is good for thick frizzy hair...just make sure to use a small amount and add more if needed.</li>
    <li> couldnt live without, use small amount every day in hair for shine and that slept in look, great quality and packaging</li>
    <li> Adds shine and dimension. I have about 5 different shades of hair right now range from dark brown, to white (I&#x27;m growing my gray out) and this stuff adds dimension and gives my hair a tousled look. I have been using this stuff for a few years now and I love it!  Even though the price seems steep, a little bit goes a long way, so the product will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a holy grail product for me - I love how it tames my fine, wavy, sometimes frizzy dark hair. A dime-sized amount on my dry hair keeps my hair smooth, and smells wonderful. Highly recommended. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I read in a magazine about this product and had to get it. Its a great product. I love the smell and it makes my hair nice and shiny. Its 2 ounces so a little goes a long way. The only negative thing I have to say is the price for 2 ounces is ridiculous. Other than that I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, gives me beachy textured hair and cuts back on the frizz.  I use it everyday, just wish it was less expensive.</li>
    <li> Shiny as heck. Subtle texture change;  looks great.  I have fine blonde hair that&#x27;s healthy and soft.  This gave it more control, better texture and INSANE shiny-ness, to th point that my hairdresser asked what I was doing yo get this result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would/WILL buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Even with fine, blonde color-treated hair, if I used small dime-nickel sized amounts, I had NO problem with bulk, stringy hair or any other problem.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this by my stylist for my midlength-to-long hair. It has reduced my hair&#x27;s errancy while allowing it to not appear styled. As a professional male, I operate according to the dictum that the less my hair is noticed or talked about the better. Brilliantine keeps me looking presentable without the hints of oilyness that dog other products.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product; just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and was exactly what I had ordered. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have fine hair and a lot of \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; products can leave my hair greasy or weigh it down.  A little of this goes a long way.  It leaves a nice shine in my hair and just a little hold.  I will definitely keep using this.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS HAIR PRODUCT.  HOLDS VERY WELL AND IS NOT GREASY</li>
    <li> Fast service and genuine product!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a product that adds shine and makes your hair seem fuller this is the product for you. I have used Brilliantine for about 2 years now and whenever I want to refresh my hair I just add a very small amount and presto I look terrific.</li>
    <li> Helps smooth texture, just need to figure out the best amount to use per individual.  I work a little bit through on partially dry hair in stubborn areas and blow dry out very briefly, then smooth a little on the ends and leave on.  As others have said, a little goes a long way so start out sparingly.</li>
    <li> Like all Bumble and Bumble products, this does not disappoint at all.  It is not greasy, weightless and provides a nice finishing touch to my hair after washing &amp; styling.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It reduces the frizzies and makes your hair feel soft and smooth.  Your hair will shine like the hair you see in tv commercials.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This made my hair feel gunky, and I don&#x27;t recommend it.  Maybe for other hair types or styles, it would work, but I&#x27;d definitely try it out at a salon before buying it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, smooths hair without stiffness or too much oil</li>
    <li> I love this stuff--makes my hair have much more body without feeling gooey or wet</li>
    <li> I heard o much about this product. I really is a great after first day wash - gives shine and a bit of second day hair glory!</li>
    <li> This product is OK, but must be used very sparingly, as hair can become a little sticky and limp.</li>
    <li> Tames my dry flyaway hair</li>
    <li> Been using this for years now, love it and a tube lasts me 6-9 months on average.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It really smooths out my hair, not leaving it greasy at all. It smells great too! The perfect finish for keeping thick, sometimes wild hair smooth and a little more under control.</li>
    <li> Brilliantine is a hair-finishing product that sort of defies categorization.  Brilliantine has a light, pleasant, &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; scent.  It adds shine and a little bit of body but it is not sticky and heavy like a gel or mousse.  I use a tiny amount (pea-sized drop) and run it through my hair after it&#x27;s blown-dry and before flat-ironing it.  I also take a tiny, tiny bit on my fingertips and use it to separate my bangs so they look &amp;#34;piece-y&amp;#34;.  Too much product will make your hair heavy and greasy looking: better to start out with small amounts and work your way up to your optimal amount.</li>
    <li> Great styling product especially for thick hair. Only need to use a little teeny tiny bit at a time, so it will last a long time! I was hesitant because of the cost but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. Buy!</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance, and it is a good product, but expensive for a small amount.  I think $8 is quite a lot for shipping and handling for a 2 oz tube that you could almost put in an envelope.  This is the first I have tried of this brand of products, and I am always looking for ways to handle my long, thick, curly, colored hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It shines and smooths and I can not do without it on those 95% humidity days!</li>
    <li> Great for fine hair (on the ends)- Gives a great texture and the scent is amazing!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff that will separate your hair without looking greasy. Thrilled to have found this product!</li>
    <li> Great for creating shiny ends, a little but goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Perfect for finishing touches!  The smallest amount does exactly what B&amp;B claims--gives a &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; look and soft control. And it has a subtle masculine scent!</li>
    <li> This product is my all time favorite now for deconstructing texture. It adds a gloss and tousle to my hair, and when I mix a little bit in with a wax pomade it works even better as a texturizer. Worth the price.</li>
