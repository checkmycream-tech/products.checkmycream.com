      <li>and it is really good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a good conditioner to pair with it.</li>
      <li>The best does not come cheap $$$$$.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair smell good as well helps it grow longer quicker.</li>
      <li>DS Laboratories products make you feel that you are doing good investment.</li>
      <li>But it is a good product</li>
      <li>I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>Love these hair care products, they really work!!!!!!</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells very nice and builds a very impressive lather allowing a modest portion to be used.</li>
      <li>My favorite shampoo ever!  </li>
      <li>It smells great, keeps my hair from thinning and comes in this huge size so that you don&#x27;t have to keep buying shampoo so often.  </li>
      <li>If I am going to pay this kind of money for shampoo I would expect the seller to be honest and say the correct amount.</li>
      <li>My visible scalp is slowly becoming invisible!</li>
      <li>I had it before, now i returned to it because of the good deal and the nice clean feeling you have after the wash.</li>
      <li>He talked about how his original manufacturer bottle was supposed to be the good stuff.</li>
      <li>After using this product for the first time my hair looked and felt great.</li>
      <li>No way am I paying more than $85 for a liter of shampoo.</li>
      <li>Glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Love it-&lt;br</li>
      <li>The larger quantity from Amazon is the best deal around.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for over 4 years and paid top $ from Health Food Stores.</li>
      <li>However, I think it has helped to prevent much more hair loss, hence the four star rating.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for more than a year, along with the conditioner and a hair tonic from DS laboratories.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I am more than pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more thankful.</li>
      <li>It works, it make my hair grow stronger but you need spectral as well for better results, i def recommend revita</li>
      <li>I am a satisfied user of this product : )</li>
      <li>Unlike most shampoos you leave this on your hair for about 3-5 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you use it as directed,  lather and massage it in.</li>
      <li>Life expectancy is rising, more people are living the majority of their lives fat and bald.</li>
      <li>I have been buying this shampoo for a long time now and still think that it&#x27;s the best.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is perfect for someone who is loosing their hair due to hormones or stress like me.  </li>
      <li>This is hands down the best hair care product you will find.</li>
      <li>My hair has always been fine</li>
      <li>The back of my hair looks and feels great</li>
      <li>Smells nice, and really works.</li>
      <li>I hope that I can continue with this regime as it seems to be a genuine hair loss remedy.</li>
      <li>It has had some consistency issues in the past but is still the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I like the way this shampoo leaves my hair clean.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m still relatively young and still have plenty of hair), but this is definitely one of the best shampoos that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>After each time, I find I am losing more hair (twice or triple) than just using pure water.</li>
      <li>very strawberry blondie :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll post again after going through a full bottle.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything about promoting hair growth, but my hair looked good and my usually dry scalp felt really good, not dry or itchy at all.  </li>
      <li>We are loyal users now.</li>
      <li>long as you have viable hair follicles-this product will keep your hair in perfect shape and reduce any further receding.</li>
      <li>Otherwise pretty nice shampoo and clearly reduces dandruff.</li>
      <li>I also like it because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and feels fresh on my head.</li>
      <li>The cost isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>This product I purchased was much more fluid than his original bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely giving this an honest shot, using exactly as directed to see if I can see results.  </li>
      <li>Nice hair thickening, but not seeing new hair so far...</li>
      <li>It has no many great qualities to it to name, just go to the product website to read.</li>
      <li>Its a bit pricey, but hey It really works for me, my hair is thicker and full of body now and a lot stronger...</li>
      <li>Back to good old Dove Shampoo.</li>
      <li>First little hairs strung up and now my hair is thicker and looks really good.  </li>
      <li>I bought this larger bottle because I wanted to keep my scalp healthy but</li>
      <li>And with the copper peptides, it actually promotes healthy hair.  </li>
      <li>First heard about the shampoo on Dr. Oz.  </li>
      <li>and I am still on my first 32oz bottle.</li>
      <li>I alternate using this and a top shelf Salon shampoo.</li>
      <li>Good chance that this killed my hair.</li>
      <li>Not yet sure if Revita will actually stimulate new growth, or just maintain what I have without thinning any more, and I&#x27;ve only been using it a month or so</li>
      <li>Ultimately it&#x27;s a nice product but perhaps not worth the expense.</li>
      <li>how much you rinse</li>
      <li>would recommend it to those who really care about their look.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Excelent product arrive on time, Thanks</li>
      <li>it really works well.  </li>
      <li>it costs o freakin much</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for over a year and the results are real.  </li>
      <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll have to review it again later when results will be available.  </li>
      <li>The thickness of my hair has increased, but I think that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not shedding as much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome awesome awesome shampoo. It works wonders on dry itchy flaky scalps.</li>
    <li> This product definitely reduces the amount of hair I find in the sink after I wash my hair.  Not only does it seem to slow the hair loss, it leaves it feeling both thicker and softer after I use it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s working to recover hair growth.  Used with growth stimulator, little evidence of success after 14 months. Nice hair thickening, but not seeing new hair so far...</li>
    <li> Good price, great delivery time.  Just not sure of the product itself!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my hair stylist.  I have used Nioxin for years and been very happy with that and still use it once a week or so in combination with Revita.  Not yet sure if Revita will actually stimulate new growth, or just maintain what I have without thinning any more, and I&#x27;ve only been using it a month or so so I&#x27;ll have to review it again later when results will be available.  But at the very least, it is void of all the chemicals that cause harm, and it leaves my hair smelling fantastic as well.  I&#x27;m definitely giving this an honest shot, using exactly as directed to see if I can see results.  I&#x27;ll post again after going through a full bottle.</li>
    <li> It works, it make my hair grow stronger but you need spectral as well for better results, i def recommend revita</li>
    <li> LOVE the smell, my sister said she noticed her hair falling less.</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrible product. Good chance that this killed my hair. Buy Nioxin.</li>
    <li> Excelent product arrive on time, Thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It really works. I bought for a friend and noticed his hair grew in a month more or less. He continues using it.</li>
    <li> great shampoo. Works well with the associated conditioner</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used.  My wife tried after I had used it for awhile, and that is all she uses now. It leaves your scalp feeling clean and hair fluffy and manageable.  And with the copper peptides, it actually promotes healthy hair.  First heard about the shampoo on Dr. Oz.  Thought I would give it a try. Glad I did.  Make sure you use it as directed,  lather and massage it in. Let stay in the hair about 1 to 2 minutes. Then rinse then lather and massage a small amount again. Let stay in your hair for 3 to 5 minutes while you finish your shower. When you go to rinse you will be surprised, there is hardly any thing to rinse. Your scalp feels great and your hair feels silky. Get it in the 925ML pump bottle, it lasts for about 5 to 6 months.</li>
    <li> My hair is healthier than it&#x27;s ever been. My stylist started me in this shampoo but she didn&#x27;t carry the liter size bottles. I&#x27;m in my second year using this product and I get complements on my hair all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a shedding period. It made me nervous so I wrote the company. They assured me this was normal. It lasted about 7 weeks. I&#x27;ve experienced this both years I&#x27;ve used this. I still shed thru the year but nothing like I did before using this shampoo. The thickness of my hair has increased, but I think that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not shedding as much. I have seen some new hair growth in the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about this, commit a year or longer before you pass judgement. I&#x27;m very happy, will recommend and continue to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and this was the same. It makes my hair smell good as well helps it grow longer quicker. Love it</li>
    <li> For my husband &amp; it does work somewhat.</li>
    <li> Okay Product!!!! Would like for it to be cheaper for what you get. The cost isn&#x27;t worth it. That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> Ordered this on the advice of a friend after I got a horrible hair cut and I needed to grow my hair out as quickly as possible.  Between this and all the supplements I am taking my hair has literally NEVER been so soft, thick, and manageable.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Hair feels soft but no new growth. Been using it for one month. Maybe too early to judge.</li>
    <li> I can definitely see that my hair is thicker than it was before I started using it.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than a year, along with the conditioner and a hair tonic from DS laboratories.&lt;br /&gt;My hair seems thicker and falls less. I hope that I can continue with this regime as it seems to be a genuine hair loss remedy. My visible scalp is slowly becoming invisible!</li>
    <li> I am more than pleased with this product.  I can see a definite difference in hair loss since using.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo ever!  My hairdresser recommended this shampoo, and he did not disappoint.  It smells great, keeps my hair from thinning and comes in this huge size so that you don&#x27;t have to keep buying shampoo so often.  My husband even loves it.  We are loyal users now.</li>
    <li> DS Laboratories Revita Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo 1 Liter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very competitive product. I have been using it for over a year by now and my hair loss has been minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to those who really care about their look.</li>
    <li> nothing to this  waste of time/money</li>
    <li> If you have thinning hair this shampoo is for you.  It helps prevent hair loss and breakage.  Unlike most shampoos you leave this on your hair for about 3-5 minutes.  It really did wonders for my  hair after I went through a bad bleach job on top of alot of stress.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I thought when I bought this item it was going to be 1 litre or 33 ounces like the ad described, however, it is only 925ml.  If I am going to pay this kind of money for shampoo I would expect the seller to be honest and say the correct amount.</li>
    <li> On my 4th bottle and swear by the product. It has definitely slowed my hair loss.</li>
    <li> I like the way this shampoo leaves my hair clean. I don&#x27;t think it has really helped any to grow back, though, which is kind of disappointing. However, I think it has helped to prevent much more hair loss, hence the four star rating.</li>
    <li> No it didn&#x27;t make my hair grow back, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be falling out as fast either.  It is what it is...</li>
    <li> The best shampoo ever</li>
    <li> Very good product, it seems to effectively work. I feel that my hair is slowly growing again and I&#x27;m happy about it.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this shampoo for a long time now and still think that it&#x27;s the best. It has had some consistency issues in the past but is still the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve used. I don&#x27;t know if it has any benefit to thinning hair or not but I don&#x27;t care because it makes my hair feel so good.</li>
    <li> I bought one bottle and follow the instructions to use it. After each time, I find I am losing more hair (twice or triple) than just using pure water. After two weeks, I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Big fan.  Not sure if it actually works to regrow hair (I&#x27;m still relatively young and still have plenty of hair), but this is definitely one of the best shampoos that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it! Best shampoo I have found. I have been using this for over 4 years and paid top $ from Health Food Stores. The larger quantity from Amazon is the best deal around. I alternate using this and a top shelf Salon shampoo. You only need a small quantity to create a generous lather. The normal aging hair loss has practically stopped and all signs of receding have diminished.&lt;br /&gt;As long as you have viable hair follicles-this product will keep your hair in perfect shape and reduce any further receding. Love it-&lt;br /&gt;If you want to prove it works- after three weeks-part your hair when dry and hit it down flat with the palm of your hands. Look in the mirror and if you see tiny hair spikes coming fro the scalp- you have new active hair growth.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, and really works. However, it leaves my hair very dry feeling. I&#x27;m still looking for a good conditioner to pair with it.</li>
    <li> this is the second bottle we buy. We have seen the difference in our hair after using it.</li>
    <li> Need to see if there will be hair growth or false claim...</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo- have been using it for a couple of years nows. BUT... what the hell? The price jumped 50% since my last purchase in April. No way am I paying more than $85 for a liter of shampoo.</li>
    <li> The best does not come cheap $$$$$.</li>
    <li> Pipe dream in a plastic bottle</li>
    <li> Works!  Been using it now for years.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it on line.  The hairdresser said, &amp;#34;Looks like you are using Revita&amp;#34;.  I said, &amp;#34;How did you know?&amp;#34;  She said, &amp;#34;Look at all the new hair growth&amp;#34;.  I did and said, &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> D.S. Laboratories should change the name of this shampoo to &amp;#34;Shamazing&amp;#34;...it really works well.  Took care of my dandruff problem too.</li>
    <li> I &amp;#34;HAD&amp;#34; scalp psoriasis for the past 15+ yrs  plus having thyroid issues, all contributed to my hair loss. I have a friend who worked for this manufacturer and suggested I try this shampoo. So I did and I have had EXCELLENT results and I am still on my first 32oz bottle. It works by improving your scalp health to allow the hair to grow. My hair is growing like crazy on behalf of this shampoo and the supplements I am taking specifically for hair health.  I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with scalp psoriasis and/or thyroid hair loss. My scalp P has been gone for a few months and I couldn&#x27;t be more thankful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in it for the long haul. Life expectancy is rising, more people are living the majority of their lives fat and bald. Now, with this product, both can be changed. Change your life! lol</li>
    <li> The bottle is damaged</li>
    <li> as a dandruff shampoo, it works well. but in my case it has not helped my hair loss. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now, and have to see how long it will last to decide if I should buy it again. the only issue is it price, I can buy other dandruff shampoos for much less, as I like to use them once to twice per week, and use other shampoos the rest of the week.</li>
    <li> Its a bit pricey, but hey It really works for me, my hair is thicker and full of body now and a lot stronger... I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> very good I found this a while ago and it is really good. its just a shame it costs o freakin much</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly to stop hair breakage rather than growth. I just got it a couple weeks ago, so I won&#x27;t say wether it works or not. However, I do like the way this makes my scalp feel whenever I wash my hair. Bad thing about it is that afterwards, my hair feels really stripped and dried, but I just follow up with a really good hydrating mask and everything is all good. Also, it&#x27;s not actually a liter. It&#x27;s a bit less than advertised.</li>
    <li> I had previously bought a small bottle of this product and it was great. It doesn&#x27;t do anything about promoting hair growth, but my hair looked good and my usually dry scalp felt really good, not dry or itchy at all.  I bought this larger bottle because I wanted to keep my scalp healthy but every time I use it my hair is limp and unmanageable, as though it is not cleaning my hair.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s handle is broken!!!</li>
    <li> Have been a fan for a while</li>
    <li> Hair gets thicker by the month.</li>
    <li> Really good shampoo but a little too expensive</li>
    <li> I bought this very expensive shampoo after being told by a respected hair stylist that it would make my hair grow back faster and thicker.  ...Maybe on opposite day.  I lost more hair in a month than I lost in the past five years combined.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be growing back, either.  Back to good old Dove Shampoo.</li>
    <li> The shampoo has a great smell but not noticing any hair growth or thickening.  Can not recommend for the price.</li>
    <li> This does not work.  Maybe it slows down hair loss, but will not do what you are hoping it will.  It also leaves my hair feeling waxy and not clean.  Buy Regepure or organic Avalon shampoo instead.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is perfect for someone who is loosing their hair due to hormones or stress like me.  All of mine grew back!  If you are loosing your hair due to hereditary, it won&#x27;t make your hair grow back but will at least thicken it.  I also like it because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and feels fresh on my head.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo and I actually had some hair growth.  I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner often with this shampoo because it leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I&amp;#34;ve been using this shampoo for over a year now and I LOVE IT. I have noticed a dramatic change, my hair is much thicker and grows 2X faster than it ever has. Even my hair stylist noticed the difference and bought some for herself. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love these hair care products, they really work!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I do lots of research on the things I use on my body. This was one of the best products I could find. It has no many great qualities to it to name, just go to the product website to read. After using this product for the first time my hair looked and felt great. I always purchase the big bottle and  fill up travel bottles for the gym or when I&#x27;m away from home. This is hands down the best hair care product you will find. ** Caution- this product does contain caffeine! If you are sensitive to caffeine it will effect you.</li>
    <li> DS Laboratories products make you feel that you are doing good investment. You see quality on it, and you use quality with it.</li>
    <li> no more greasy hair. I wish this will be cheaper</li>
    <li> My hairline is growing back at age 29 far down as it was ten years ago. Male pattern baldness in my family is brutal and comes at a very early age and my hair is coming back rather than falling out completely like many of my younger male family members. The treatment (spectral dnc-n) is absolutely necessary but the conditioner is clearly speeding the process up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got all the good stuff your hair needs without the unnecessary ingredients in lower end shampoo. it def helps stimulate and grow hair but NOT for balding or thinning which is what I have going on. The back of my hair looks and feels great but the top is still leaving me :( Don&#x27;t get this in the hopes it&#x27;ll stoop balding, it won&#x27;t. But it is a good product</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells very nice and builds a very impressive lather allowing a modest portion to be used. But I purchased it specifically on the premise of it either thickening the hair I have and/or growing new hair and after two months of using it I can find no evidence of it having done so. Ultimately it&#x27;s a nice product but perhaps not worth the expense.</li>
    <li> turned my hair a creepy orange color and it has to sit at least a minutes before it washes out nicely, does it work ? yes but my goodness at the price of hard to find and orange hair and tons of  time and a sticky neck, no mater how much you rinse and btw i&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist so if you&#x27;re a red head and can follow the instruction with the conditioner is the only way its a do or a ver  very strawberry blondie :)</li>
    <li> My brother informed me of this shampoo. He talked about how his original manufacturer bottle was supposed to be the good stuff. After searching around, I finally found the right stuff...so I thought. This may be the same manufacturer, but it is not the same formula. We got our bottles lined up side by side and pumped out some shampoo. This product I purchased was much more fluid than his original bottle. The manufacture date is stamped on the bottoms. Mine says 2012 while his days 2010. So maybe same manufacturer, but not the same batch. I suppose this only irritates me because this has been advertised just like the other bottles of shampoo, but specifies something that would lead people to believe this is still the original stuff. As far as the hair goes, we&#x27;ll I will need some time to decide. I follow the directions and use it twice per shower and wait until 2 and 5 minutes to ensure I feel the tingle in my scalp. After it tingles a little bit I feel that it&#x27;s penetrating as doing something. I&#x27;ll update this later if possible.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works for me.  I use it according to directions.  My hair has always been fine so when people would say it looked thin I would say it has always been that way!  One day I noticed I could see my scalp through my hair when I combed my hair back into a ponytail.  YIKES.  I did my research and chose Revita.  I have been using it for over a year and the results are real.  First little hairs strung up and now my hair is thicker and looks really good.  I am a satisfied user of this product : )</li>
    <li> I had it before, now i returned to it because of the good deal and the nice clean feeling you have after the wash. There is absolutely no hair growth effect after approx 6 months use. Otherwise pretty nice shampoo and clearly reduces dandruff.</li>
