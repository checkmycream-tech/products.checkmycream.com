      <li>The best anti-cellulite solution so far!</li>
      <li>The most amazing moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>but I just decided to solve the problem more effectively by switching deodorants.</li>
      <li>They smell good and most importantly work.</li>
      <li>Those are very nice products and very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I use it 4 times a week and leaves my skin feeling very smooth</li>

      <li>It smells wonderful and I can already see a difference in several weeks.</li>

      <li>I am also pleased that it organic, I try to use organic mostly.</li>
      <li>i have an anti-cellulite office, i have many treatments for cellulite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it was doing something.</li>
      <li>Any night that I can&#x27;t sleep, I use the scrub all over my body, and stay in a warm tub for 15 minutes, my body feels so light afterwards, it&#x27;s more like detox.  </li>
      <li>I love the skin QR Organics Products.</li>
      <li>but I have been trying to walk more hoping that helps..</li>
      <li>The scent is OK.</li>

      <li>Love it love it.  </li>

      <li>My favorite massager</li>
      <li>Buy stock in the lotion - it&#x27;s phenomenal.</li>

      <li>Most definitely the best anti - cellulite product I used.</li>
      <li>hopefully with even better results.</li>
      <li>They work - go ahead and purchase! :)</li>
      <li>Surely, the exercise was a big part of this improvement but not alone.&lt;br /&gt;The massager feels great, helps to soften the muscles and warm up the body.</li>
      <li>I will say, I haven&#x27;t used it exactly as directed but fairly close and haven&#x27;t noticed any change at all.  </li>
      <li>and I really love this product I can really feel my skin with a burning sensation after using it, the scrub its good</li>
      <li>and I look more tone and fit</li>
      <li>I also appreciate that the ingredients are healthy (paraben free, organic, etc.)</li>
      <li>The smell was very strong to me the first time or two, but I grew to love it.</li>
      <li>First let me say that I absolutely LOVE the cellulite scrub AND the cream!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any earth shattering results from this, although I really like the roller! What I don&#x27;t like is that to me the lotion smells like cat pee.&lt;br /&gt;So even though I feel like I&#x27;m doing something by using this, I&#x27;m not entirely convinced it was worth it.</li>
    <li> Very stinky and I broke out in hives.</li>
    <li> I have two of the massagers, appreciate that they are rust free.  My husband can see a difference. I also appreciate that the ingredients are healthy (paraben free, organic, etc.) Will buy again. So highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was looking for just the massager, but the lotion and the scrub were a delightful bonus as well. The massager is somewhat uncomfortable if you&#x27;re not used to massage, let alone deep tissue massage, but you get used to it after awhile. I can see and FEEL a difference after each use! I can&#x27;t say that it has gotten rid of all cellulite just by using it alone because I&#x27;ve also reduced the amount of toxic, processed foods I used to eat AND started exercising again. This is a great product and if they ever get this product back, I&#x27;m ordering at least 2 to give to my girlfriends!!!</li>
    <li> i make my own scrubs, but i cannot make anything as great as this one. Massage can be done over clothes, so i can do it at work without leaving a chair. ) the lotion is just heaven. i have an anti-cellulite office, i have many treatments for cellulite. i actually don&#x27;t really care how effective this lotion is for cellulite. it is a pure heaven to put on. the lotion by itself is not going to do the trick, but it is an application that can be very well used as an addition to other things. and it will make you feel bit a little better about yourself no matter what )</li>
    <li> I previously bought all 3 products separate, but this deal it&#x27;s a steal!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The products are amazing and really have been working for me. Now, everybody is different and even though it works for me it may work different for you, but give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I not only feel but can also see a difference in my skin appearance, my skin feels smoother, softer and moisturizered.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday and I needed to order more and this is a great price for the set.</li>
    <li> Good product. Didn&#x27;t see any physical changes, but it felt and smelt good- I&#x27;m sure it was doing something. I still have the massager long after the product was gone!</li>
    <li> I would give 10 stars to the company! They have great customer service and are extremely polite! The product didn&#x27;t work for me but you can&#x27;t expect all products to work wonders on everyone... I&#x27;m glad I was at least able to return the product and get my money back!</li>
    <li> Cali Julz Says...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have nothing negative to say. yeah, it does get a bit hot and steamy where you apply, they didn&#x27;t lie on that one...but I have noticed smoother skin!!﻿ I have also started using it on my upper arms and love the results there as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spirit of full disclosure, I was given the above mentioned product in exchange for my honest review, all opinions given here are fully my own.</li>
    <li> It does work! My cellulite gradually fades away and my skin is tighter. The massager also makes me feel very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been usin this product for a week now, it&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t changed much YET, but like I said it&#x27;s only been a week. I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about this product though and I&#x27;m excited for the results</li>
    <li> really one of best products e ever use for cellulite, works as litlhe as 2 weeks, my skin its smoother,less dimplus and more firm! as a womem hu bathle 10 years with cellulite, i recomend this product.works for me.</li>
    <li> I only recently started using these products and they are amazing. The results are quick and you actually can feel the difference after only a short period of time. The massager is easy to hold while using it in the shower and the seaweed body blaster scrub works really well. You do not need to use a lot of this but it goes on easily and absorbs into the skin easily. I rub it over my thighs and stomach but you could use it wherever you feel would be useful for you to help with reducing cellulite. The massager together with the scrub is great and they work well together. After I have got out of the shower I use the anti cellulite concentrate and it is light and creamy and easy to apply. I rub it in to the areas I want to such as thighs and stomach. It does become slightly warm and creates a sauna-like effect. The cream absorbs into your skin easily and leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturised so no need for an extra moisturiser to be applied. This is a wonderful set and would make a great gift for someone that enjoys taking care of themselves. It is professional looking and the smell makes you realise that a lot of care has gone into the production of all three of these items. Organic and healthy and neatly presented.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is like going to the spa. It smells wonderful and I can already see a difference in several weeks. I reordered and just received my second package I am so excited to continue using this product, it makes my skin very soft and no need for lotion. I am also pleased that it organic, I try to use organic mostly. I will continue to use and am going to try other products from this line.</li>
    <li> This system really works. Ive had noticeable cellulite for 2 decades and this reduced it unlike anything else. It&#x27;s no miracle cure, as their is no such thing. This simply temporarily reduces the appearance of cellulite, but has become a must have for me during summer. It also helps smooth out my stomach after 3 pregnancies and c sections.</li>
    <li> I love the skin QR Organics Products. The scrub smells GREAT and leaves my skin smooth w/out the need for lotion. The Nu Elle serum isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; has many of the ingredients recommended to help with cellulite. These natural products help reduce the appearance better than the many(chemical ones) I have tried. So until they come out with a true cure ladies this is as good as it gets! Best of luck!</li>
    <li> Love it...Big difference in 2 weeks, I will buy it again! I have purchased NuElle srubs, creams and sets numerous times, and it has made a huge difference.  My skin is much smoother then ever, and find no need to use daily lotions either.  I also realized that some of the cellulite is vanishing. I have used NuElle products for the last six months, and I have recommended this product to my family and some friends, and would strongly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really been overweight, but pretty much everyone has a bit of cellulite somewhere. I hoped this would take care of that problem for me. I waited to finish both the scrub and the lotion completely to review this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Scrub: Showers became a trip to the spa with this scrub. The smell was very strong to me the first time or two, but I grew to love it. It exfoliated a bit and left my skin very soft and moisturized. I used it with every shower. Now, this may sound kind of weird, but I discovered another use for this scrub. For me at least, it actually neutralized odors quite well. Some days, my deodorant just didn&#x27;t do the job on it&#x27;s own. I don&#x27;t know where I first got the idea from, but I rubbed a small pinch of this into my armpits after I washed them, put on deodorant, and was completely dry and odor-free all day. Very interesting, but I just decided to solve the problem more effectively by switching deodorants. I definitely didn&#x27;t hate the scrub, it was lovely - but I don&#x27;t think I would find it worth it to purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lotion: Oh. Em. Gee. This stuff is liquid gold. The most amazing moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I would purchase this again and again if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive! With one application, anywhere I applied it would be slick and shiny for DAYS afterwards. My skin looked amazing while I used it. This stuff will make you feel like a Goddess. An additional plus was the diuretic effect. I have some circulation issues below the knees and this improved that by at least 50%. Highly, highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Massager: Ow. Learn from my mistakes. I was bruised very badly for a few days after I first used this. Start very lightly and work your way up to pressing harder, sweeping up towards the heart. Now that I&#x27;m used to it, it&#x27;s very relaxing; I use it in places I don&#x27;t even have cellulite. I do like the handle - it makes it much more solid in my hand. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the balls rusting or getting stuck. Recommended as you only need to purchase it once - a good investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, TLDR: I say skip the scrub. Buy stock in the lotion - it&#x27;s phenomenal. However, I think it only helps cellulite by keeping you extremely moisturized (meaning, stop using it &#x3D; you don&#x27;t look so hot anymore). The massager feels great once you get used to it - might as well get it.</li>
    <li> This is pretty amazing.  I have much cellulite on my toosh and legs.  After about three weeks, my skin looks smoother and the craters on my toosh are fewer.  The first day that I used it in the shower it tingled, but hasn&#x27;t since then.  It makes you sweat some for be prepared for that, especially if you&#x27;re on the run.</li>
    <li> It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered with cellulite since I was a teen. I am now 34 years old and have spent lots of money in the past treating to get a smooth appearance on my thighs. A few years ago I spent $1200 on VelaSmooth a cellulite treatment. I had 7 treatments of VelaSmooth and didn&#x27;t see nearly the results I did with using the Phat QR Solutions Anti Cellulite Treatment. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and honestly noticed a smoother and firmer look after a few days. I think the massage is the key, the first week I had a few little bruises on my thighs, it was a &#x27;hurt so good&#x27; type of massage.&lt;br /&gt;I think the hardest part is remembering to use it. The lotion you&#x27;re suppose to use it 1 hour before you eat or two hours after you eat, so timing it was a challenge. The scrub leaves you feeling super soft and doesn&#x27;t have a reside. The smell is pleasant, reminds me of green tea.&lt;br /&gt;Hope my review helps you and if you do order this I advise you to take before and after pictures, I wish I would&#x27;ve done that because the results were that noticeable.</li>
    <li> This anti cellulite system WORKS!  I&#x27;ve tried the scrub and cream and decided to buy the massager because of the good reviews.  I&#x27;m sooo glad that I did! This system rocks!</li>
    <li> I have used this product once a day for a couple of weeks, and notice its nice moisturizing properties. I may need to use it more frequently, before noticing, any toning benefit. It is nice, and not sticky. Will use a little longer to see, if I notice any results. Received the items more quickly, than expected. Nice to deal, with such an efficient seller!!</li>
    <li> First let me say that I absolutely LOVE the cellulite scrub AND the cream! Not only does it work, but it smells AMAZING. So good that I can smell the scent in my bathroom after I have showered. I decided to get this, as a set, as I wanted a massager to try with the products and it is a little cheaper to buy it in this \\&quot;combo\\&quot; pack. WOW, using the massager definitely helps with the overall effectiveness of the products because you can target those stubborn \\&quot;fatty areas\\&quot; so much better! I have written reviews on the other 2 products (scrub and lotion: please see those also), and this set with the massager makes the products together, even better and the customer service is fantastic! They work - go ahead and purchase! :)</li>
    <li> Really helps. I have purchased these products a few times. Awesome.</li>
    <li> Purchased these products multiple times so far. They really work.</li>
    <li> Love it love it.  Smells great.  Feels great leaves skin silky smooth.  The scrub is wonderful and the massager is easy to use  Wonderful product!!!</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars because 1)  The scrub helps smooth out your skin aka cellulite. (2)  It also leaves your skin very soft that you dont need to put moisturizer except the Anti Cellulite creme which is the next step, a must.  (3) It smells very refreshing, spa like.  (4) It came in a large jar, it lasts about a month and half.  I use it every other day.  I do use the Anti Cellulite creme every day.  My skin is very very sensitive, anything I put on my skin, if it is bad, my skin gets dry and I itch instantly.  This product does wonder.  Any night that I can&#x27;t sleep, I use the scrub all over my body, and stay in a warm tub for 15 minutes, my body feels so light afterwards, it&#x27;s more like detox.  (5)  If you compare the price with other good products out there, this is affordable and effective. I used to use the scrub from Clarins line because I love the aroma sense, but always had to use body moisturizer right after otherwise my skin feels dry.  Now I replace their scrub for Phat QR.  Since I tried the Phat QR and the NuElle Anti Cellulite, love them, I decided to get the body cream and the face foam cleanser.  I will review those soon.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this set! I ordered after reading all the great reviews and to my surprise it really works. I have a long way to go, but I noticed some firmness and my cellulite looking a little less on the back of my thighs. The smell is also great Its been 2+wks and I have just ordered my second bottle of the cream. Dont want to run out. First week I used the scrub and cream daily. now I use the scrub 3-4 times a week with the cream twice a day everyday. I will continue ...hopefully with even better results. Im so happy to see what happens in 6wks.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit after reading all the good reviews I have used many other products with minimal results and Ive spend a lot of money with endermalogy again with minimal results, I was not expecting a miracle but just an improvement on my cellulite, I also started working out and also bought the love your legs workout dvd and  followed the cellulite diet recommended on the dvd before using this cellulite collection. Im a thin person, I lost 14 pounds and I look more tone and fit, my skin feels smoother and I see some improvement on my cellulite, I have been using this products for about 5 weeks, the messager I use it daily and I really love this product I can really feel my skin with a burning sensation after using it, the scrub its good I use it 4 times a week and leaves my skin feeling very smooth and it smells great my only concern is that half way through the container the oil in it dried up but I still use it with the same results I also get a slight burning sensation when applied, the solution leaves a sticky feeling and I dont really get that burning sensation that I have felt with other products I use it twice a day, Im on my second bottle and I plan to order a third one and see, if  theres no new improvement Ill just keep using the messager and the scrub and get a less pricey solution that I have used before with about the same improvement. Customer service for this products its great, outstanding!</li>
    <li> I think this is a great set of products that help fight cellulite and improve overal skin and body condition. They smell good and most importantly work. My only complain is that they seem to be available only in the USA and shipping cost to get them shipped to UK is high. But I still think it&#x27;s worth it. Please let me know if there is a retailer in UK. Cheers.</li>
    <li> This product is great! The body scrub is wonderful, it leaves your skin so soft and tingly and smells great. The cream is also really nice and absorbs well into the skin with a soft scent. I&#x27;m not quite sure if it works well for cellulite yet as it has only been a couple of weeks, but it definitely has made an impact on the feel of my skin. I use both with the massager and it is very relaxing. I would recommend to anyone. I will order this again</li>
    <li> This is second time I have repurchased these products, together with a massager this time. Combined with adjustments of food choices, all those cellulite creams and lotions do make a difference. It&#x27;s been a while since I used this lotion and scrub the first time and I liked them, but hoped that I would manage to find something cheaper that worked the same well. Sad to say, I haven&#x27;t. At first I thought that this scrub is just a scrub and bought Tree Hut scrub due to a killer cheap price. It was nice but I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvement in my skin texture on any levels. The conclusion I came to is that cellulite targeted products do work. Not a miracle overnight, but they do, little by little. You just have to stick with the program and continue using them, just like brushing your teeth. That&#x27;s why I am buying them again. These products work and worth every cent. After I use this scrub, I don&#x27;t even apply the lotion because my skin feels so silky and moist and I feel it&#x27;s not needed. Which makes it last longer and economical. The scent is OK. I have read other comments saying how bad it is. C&#x27;mon guys. It&#x27;s not that bad. I can&#x27;t imagine seaweed smelling like roses... It&#x27;s something lemony and seaweedish, but not bad at all. Main thing the products work and I will continue buying them.</li>
    <li> Love the roller and cream however balls will rust! Thank God for Bar Keeper&#x27;s Friend cleaner which will remove the rust!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a good compilation of products that help cellulite and skin condition overall. The massager rolls smoothly on the skin providing rather deep massage. It even hurts a little in the beginning. I am not used to massages, that&#x27;s why maybe. But once you get used to it, it feels great. I try to remember to use it twice a day, but forget sometimes and limit it to one. Scrub I use about 2-3 times a week trying to make it last longer. It&#x27;s gooey texture and smells good. Taking a shower becomes a mini spa treatment. Lotion, on the other hand, I use every day, twice a day. It goes on light and absorbs relatively quickly. I like this set as it contains a few products for the same purpose and you don&#x27;t have to hunt around to find separate pieces. Once I finish scrub and lotion, will get refills, though separately they are not as great deal as this set, plus free shipping.</li>
    <li> this product worked for me for the time that I used. its really expensive so that&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t bought it again.&lt;br /&gt;the tube just smells really funky, but you can rite away feel it getting warm on your skin. the body wash which the lemon sea salt I loved! makes you skin vibrant, and you can also feel it get a little warm.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend this, just make sure you keep up with it and you will get the results you want .</li>
    <li> I should have paid attention the reviews about the smell.  I just couldn’t get over it.  The scrub and the lotion just smelled bad.  Very strong – kind of limey and seaweedy and chemically.  I do like the massager though.</li>
    <li> I started to use this product a few weeks now, it is really work for me, but as i used them i also take exercise so even more working, my body was kind of firm and reduce my cellulite, i am a slim person but a lot of cellulite, i am not a big fan of smell but after used scrub, you can feel your body so smooth, i love it! i would recommended to give a try!!</li>
    <li> That is the second time I bought this product. I was surprised how fantastic the results were after I used it the first time. The second time around I wasn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;diligent&amp;#34; in using it as described on the label, so the results were not as spectacular, but still definitely visible. Most definitely the best anti - cellulite product I used. I recommended it to all my friends :-)</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  I was amazed at the results and you will too.</li>
    <li> I am 5 2, 105 lb, want to stay fit, not trying to lose weight. I am on my second bottle and will order the third one soon. I only use it before my pilates routine (50min- hr, 4-5 time/wk) only on my thighs and abs. I think it works (burn more at thighs and abs area) and def works the best with good workout.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SET!!! I USE IT EVERY DAY . ITS GREAT FOR CIRCULATION SORE MUSCLE AND GETTING RID OF THE NASTY FAT POCKETS ON YOUR THIGHS AND BUTT!! I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> I do like the roller, but the jury is still out on the scrub and the lotion (I&#x27;m almost through both items).  Certainly, I haven&#x27;t seen miraculous results, but maybe this kind of thing takes a lot longer to kick in than the Amazon review process allows.  This was my second notice to comment, so I finally did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my concerns is that neither the lotion nor the scrub state just how long to apply in a circular motion.  They just say to do it.  Scrubs/lotions I have used in the past all stated a good five minutes, which I always felt was a pain in the neck.  I&#x27;m probably giving the scrub and roller several minutes per thigh.  The lotion, I&#x27;m just applying in the circular motion until it is absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, maybe if we had an actual idea how long to give results to show, and proper instructions how long to apply, this review would be more accurate.</li>
    <li> I already had this same massager I bought before, but misplaced it somewhere. Had to buy it again with some other cellulite products to prepare for the summer. First I have to tell what an awesome customer service this seller has. I bought all these 3 products separately and paid $92. They emailed me back telling me about this set being much better value and REFUNDED THE DIFFERENCE. Who does that these days? I was amazed. And better yet, the products are very good quality and they work well.  Spending an hour in the bathroom pampering myself is what doctor ordered. I am a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I had very low expectations for any product that was supposed to reduce the appearance of cellulite but tried anyways.  I will say, I haven&#x27;t used it exactly as directed but fairly close and haven&#x27;t noticed any change at all.  I am very active, fit, slender and toned but have stubborn cellulite on my outer thighs and rear that a good diet, regular exercise, and a zillion squats/lounges will not change.  Oh well, what can you do?  I liked the spa-like scent but will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month and I think it&#x27;s working. I love the scrub, the massage thing is cool, and the lotion is light.. I don&#x27;t really excersise but I have been trying to walk more hoping that helps.. I&#x27;ll update in another month.</li>
    <li> Truly the best product I&#x27;ve used for cellulite reduction. I have very sensitive skin but these products have not bothered at all. The seaweed scrub leaves my skin soooo smooth and the anti cellulite concentrate in conjunction works wonders! I&#x27;m trying to use the massager more often I definitely notice a difference when I do. My package also came with a sample of the eye cream and the cell brightening cream and I&#x27;m totally hooked. AMAZING products!</li>
    <li> I have been using the scrub and lotion for about 2 to 3 weeks very consistently. I have been using the product everyday, at least once a day, usually in the evening. I have not been using the lotion twice a day except for a few occasions just due to time constraints and sometimes based on weather and what I am wearing (I live in Texas and its been a very hot fall so far and I don&#x27;t like my pants or clothing &amp;#34;sticking to me&amp;#34; when I put the lotion on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say in the few weeks I have used the products (on my upper legs and thighs mainly) I have noticed a small difference. It is nothing remarkable but I think (hope) with continued use that it will continue to improve. I have used numerous different products for this cellulite issue such as Bliss FatGirlSlim, Nivea, Avon&#x27;s versions, etc and I have never seen any results at all. I think that is why I am getting pretty excited about this one! I just received my second lotion today and will continue my daily regimen. I am hoping one day I can proudly put on a pair of shorts and not have to cringe! I definitely recommend giving this product a shot!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the 2nd bottle of the cream and jar of the scrub. Both seem to be working fantastically! I love this company&#x27;s philosophy and the customer service is wonderful!</li>
    <li> The best anti-cellulite solution so far! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now,couple days a week only after running and sauna,and it works great for my skin.The package is good value,5 stars for massager alone:) Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Those are very nice products and very reasonably priced. I don&#x27;t use them all at the same time as required, but created my own regime as it fits my time availability. And it still works. At least I feel and see the difference. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have only been using these products for two days and my legs already seem smother. I love the smell too! Ialready have recommended to my friends.</li>
    <li> Honestly, there&#x27;s no substitute for working out but this cellulite collection can speed up the process of minimizing the cellulite appearance. I have noticed the difference in about a week. My tummy is flatter in the morning than before using this product. The massager also helps to smooth out the bumps. It&#x27;s very easy to use the rollers with the scrub in the shower and I use the cream in all the problem areas.  The scrub not only minimizes the appearance of the cellulite, but it also exfoliates the skin as well.</li>
    <li> I try to spend at least an hour pampering myself in my bathroom at least 2 times a week. Lack of time wouldn&#x27;t let me indulge more. Glad I got this set. It contains a 3 step program. I don&#x27;t however, consider it for cellulite only. I use scrub and massager pretty much all over. Only the lotion is applied to my thighs and bum. Here is how it usually goes on Friday night. 1. Bubble bath with salts for relaxing (with soothing music). And while I am there I massage myself with this massager, where I can reach by myself.  2. After soaping I scrub myself with the scrub. 3. Lotion only cellulite areas. My usual Victoria&#x27;s Secret lotion goes everywhere else. Done. After that I feel like NEW. And my skin feels fantastic, soft, smooth and firm. A little spritz of Dahlia Noir and I am ready for anything...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have too much cellulite yet to worry about but believe that &#x60; pro-action is the best reaction&#x27; so I try to take good care of my body before it&#x27;s too late. I would recommend these products for everyone, if you have cellulite or not. They are awesome and sure help to care for your skin and well-being.</li>
    <li> I love these products!  I see a big difference in my skin....  softer, tighter, and natural!  I wish I would&#x27;ve found them sooner.</li>
    <li> Purchased the set not long ago. It came in a small box, very well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the seaweed scrub before and loved it. The effect was definitely there. Along with my 5k everyday run routine, it helped me to nearly get rid of my cellulite in about five months. Surely, the exercise was a big part of this improvement but not alone.&lt;br /&gt;The massager feels great, helps to soften the muscles and warm up the body. My favorite massager so far.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say much about the cream yet, cause I am using it only for a week, but it feels and smells great.</li>
    <li> No results, I believe the only way it will work is if I work out more than I already do, but it smells good</li>
