<li> don&#x27;t waste time and money on others</li>
<li> A product made to tame frizz should be...</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t use this and the conditioner you are missing out!</li>

    <li> I love the conditioner, but I&#x27;m disappointed that the shampoo is not sulfate free.... A product made to tame frizz should be... I also got it to enhance my keratin treatments, and you can only use sulfate free shampoos for the treatments to last... I guess I&#x27;ll use it when my keratin treatment wears out...</li>
    <li> see my liquid keratin conditioner review. this is the best. shine, detangle, soft smooth, great smell. perfect. don&#x27;t waste time and money on others</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Keratin treatments done, and using this shampoo with the treatments has been excellent!  Hair stays smoother longer, no tangles, or build up and hair is shiny and soft</li>
    <li> Great stuff fast delivery</li>
    <li> Love it and all of liquid keratin products.  My hair has never been so nice.  I put a keratin treatment in a year ago and every time I do it it gets better.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!  It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and although pricey, it is much less than a salon keratin treatment which costs me $250+!  I have curly,color treated hair, which I style with heat almost daily.  My hair can air dry and there is no frizz in sight thanks to Liquid Keratin.  Humidity is no longer an issue and my hair will stay frizz free and soft and smooth all day/night.  If you don&#x27;t use this and the conditioner you are missing out!</li>
    <li> See my review for the conditioner. The best Keratin products out there. Use with the Liquid Keratin Conditioner and your favorite styling product.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have found to control the frizz, even in humid, damp weather.  I have curly hair that has turned to frizz as I have aged.  This line of products has restored my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product but I use it with the conditioner so together they are great! Soft silky hair</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner of this brand! Makes my hair smooth! The only products I use except when going to hairdresser</li>
    <li> Get it. It&#x27;s amazing.  I have baby fine hair that is also thin AND color-treated.  Since I started using this (with the conditioner), each time I get a trim I have less and less damage on my ends - which means I have to have less and less trimmed every time. I like this even better than Kerastase.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  Works like a charm.  My hair is so much softer with this shampoo, and has less frizz, even on days with high humidity.  I paired it with the LQ de-frizz conditioner. Great new smell. Love it!</li>
    <li> I use the conditioner with it.  After I flat iron my hair it takes rain to frizz my hair.  We have high humidity where I live. In fog and rain I cover my hair and inside it stays smooth.  Before fog and rain outside meant my hair would frizz no matter what.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Liquid Keratin Shampoo is not sulfate-free which is odd to me since sulfate-free products are recommended for keratin treated hair.  Also, the shampoo does not smell that great. I hope they change the formulation so that I can use both the shampoo and conditioner together. For now I will stick with the Liquid Keratin conditioner (which is amazing) and find a new shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used on my hair. It is AWESOME!!!!! i COULD USE THIS FOREVER.</li>
