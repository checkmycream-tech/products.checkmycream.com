<li> Have been using this cream for a few years.</li>
<li> Enter phenoxyethanol, a usual hidden fragrance ingredient and preservative.</li>
<li> On the plus side, it’s (usually) non-irritating and formaldehyde-free.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>
<li> It was way too thick and greesy for me to wear during the day.  </li>
<li> Not a good purchase, and it has been returned.</li>
<li> with all the expensive creams with retinol in them</li>
<li> Others say it’s another bad ingredient that you should run from.</li>
<li> Very disappointing purchase!</li>
<li> br /&gt;or have a nasty smell.  </li>
<li> When it got here, I was VERY disappointed!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I applied this to my face, the product would begin to roll off . Could not use the Physicians Formula Expression Line Freeze with this product, would be come gritty. I gave this product to my sister.</li>
    <li> great skin care cream, easy to apply and my skin feels great afterwards</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! I have used this product for years. It&#x27;s goes on nicely without being greasy and absorbs well. It moisturizer my skin just right. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores so Amazon please keep selling it! I give it 5⭐️!!</li>
    <li> Great cream! I use it every morning!</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer for my aging skin.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Wanted a change and decided to try Physicians Formula.........Love the texture and feel on my skin.  Have to finish the jar before I really decide to stick with it.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap cream but when you put it on it feels better than any expensive one. Very soft and pleasant feeling, will buy again! And you can use it in mornings and nights!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering. It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel soft and smooth, and also imparts a gentle glow that looks really nice.</li>
    <li> Have been using this cream for a few years. I have seen a noticeable improvement in fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t purchase unless you know what is in the \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; and if it is paraben free. Also, be sure it isphenoxyethanol free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Define It&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol is the preservative that seems to have taken the place of your frenemy paraben. Technically, phenoxyethanol is an aromatic ether alcohol. This ingredient starts out as phenol, a toxic white crystalline powder that’s created from benzene (a known carcinogen) and then is treated with ethylene oxide (also a known carcinogen) and an alkalai. Sounds dreamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol Nicknames&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dowanol&lt;br /&gt;Arosol&lt;br /&gt;Emery 6705&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxetol&lt;br /&gt;Rose ether&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethyl alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Glycol monophenyl ether&lt;br /&gt;Beta-hydroxyethyl phenyl ether&lt;br /&gt;Where It’s Used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol is used in many all-natural beauty products touted as being “derived from grapefruits” and has started replacing mercury/thimerosal in almost all vaccines. It’s naturally occurring in green tea, but in cosmetics, it comes from a lab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why We Need It&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as water is used in a product such as foundation or a mascara, a preservative is needed to kill bacteria. Enter phenoxyethanol, a usual hidden fragrance ingredient and preservative. On the plus side, it’s (usually) non-irritating and formaldehyde-free. Experts and chemists alike claim it’s necessary to have these ingredients in our cosmetics to kill bacteria or else nothing could stay on the shelf. Others say it’s another bad ingredient that you should run from. Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Banned in Japan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm, do they know something we don’t? Japan has restricted phenoxyethanol as an ingredient in all cosmetics. Most countries ban its use to only a 1-percent concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bodily Harm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several studies have shown that the toxicity of phenoxyethanol can cause damaging effects to the brain and nervous system, even at moderate concentrations. Again, while it’s thought to be from natural sources, some folks in the beauty biz buy the cheap, synthetic s*** from China. All the danger signs refer to concentrated phenoxyethanol when swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin.xyethanol when swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! Makes my skin soft! Looking younger everyday!!</li>
    <li> I am completing the second jar of this night cream and have, in fact, noticed a slight reduction in the depth of my fine wrinkles and a more noticeable slowing-down of the formation of new ones. It is relatively light-weight and mild, although it is irritating if it gets into my eyes. I wish that there was no coloring in the cream (It is a light lavender.) and that the fragrance was eliminated or lightened.</li>
    <li> The product review claimed this cream is for moisturizing in the a.m. and p.m.  It was way too thick and greesy for me to wear during the day.  Does a great job at night but I do not recommend for daytime use.</li>
    <li> I do not care for the scent of this product. No results seen.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a stained box. Product had leaked and I had to return it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for the past 4 years, and it is getting harder and harder to find!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that I have any less wrinkles from using this cream, or that the ones I have are any less noticeable, BUT&lt;br /&gt;I love this moisturizer.  This is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  My skin isn&#x27;t shiny after applying and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy&lt;br /&gt;or have a nasty smell.  I use it twice a day, and can definitely FEEL a difference in my skin if I forget to put it on.</li>
    <li> ordered two of item, both were not in original packaging.  One of the items  was old and drying out inside. Not a good purchase, and it has been returned.</li>
    <li> Received it in the mail with the contents in a big ball of junk in jar. Threw it out. Looked like curdled purple milk.</li>
    <li> Heavily scented...can&#x27;t use because of sensitive skin...thought Physicians Formula was for sensitive skin. Very disappointing purchase!</li>
    <li> I was a little excited when I found this stuff on here and couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive. When it got here, I was VERY disappointed! This stuff is sooooo greasy, it don&#x27;t even mix together with the \\&quot;cream\\&quot; part! My face was so oily when I tryed to put it on, the \\&quot;cream\\&quot; won&#x27;t even stick to my fingers because of so much grease! I stuck my finger in it and all that was on my finger was grease dripping from it. It won&#x27;t even mix together it&#x27;s just clumpy and greasy. It doesn&#x27;t smell good either. Don&#x27;t waste you money, buy something worth it. I&#x27;m going to check Too Faced and see what they have. I only gave it one star because I had to, if I could, it wouldn&#x27;t get any stars!</li>
    <li> Nice smell, texture and very nice feel on the skin.  Lots of moisture.  Not sure of how much it really &amp;#34;works.&amp;#34;  In all, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> DOES A GREAT JOB, MAKES MY FACE AND NECK FEEL SOFT.</li>
    <li> Nice, slick feel. Use with a makeup with SPF and you are covered.</li>
    <li> Skin is firmer, less lines</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright... smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They tell you that sometimes you need to use the product for awhile to see results...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well I haven&#x27;t seen anything so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have a little left and to be truthful I didn&#x27;t use it everyday. Sooo...</li>
    <li> I recommend buying the skin care kit for this product that way you get the eye cream, and some great moisturizer with some SPF protection at a better value. I have been using this for years and everyone hates to see aging lines. My wife and I have tried all the natural moisturizers out there and some leave your skin with strange reactions such as little red dots or they just smell distasteful. In the final scenario they just don&#x27;t work or make you feel moisturized. Physicians Formula is a very natural company in my opinion and there products do not give any reactions and make our skin feel great. They also smell pleasant. I have tried the No7 boots cream and can say its not comparable to this product. I found the smell to be a bit like SPF lotion and also burned my skin somewhat. Listen, I am in my 30s and people I graduated with look like they are much older than me. Of course lifestyle has a role and especially hydration of water but this product is fantastic. I would pay double if I had to.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer...hence the 3 stars.  The jury is still out on whether it does anything for deep wrinkles.  I use it day and night...went through a third of the jar, and don&#x27;t notice any improvements yet.  Once I finish the jar, I will update on whether this product is worth buying.</li>
    <li> love this product.  needed something with more substance for my face in the winter and this is perfect, I&#x27;m hooked</li>
    <li> I have never tried this product before, so when I recently saw it at Walmart...I decided to give it a try and purchase it. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short amount of time, however, I have noticed my furrowed line between my brows is fading, and the wrinkles under my eyes have improved as well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this product is really nice...The cream has such a soft, silky feel to it, and it blends well into your skin. Even though I haven&#x27;t been using it that long--&gt; I do see positive results! Especially when I wake up in the morning - I notice my complexion looks more evened out and my skin feels firmer and smoother...I definitely recommend this product for people that have sensitive skin like I do...On the product label, it states that it is hypoallergenic, 100% fragrance free and 100% paraben free.</li>
    <li> Very great face cream without the high price. Very prompt seller.</li>
    <li> with all the expensive creams with retinol in them this one I can use as it does not have retinol.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.</li>
    <li> As Described, Well Packaged, Promptly Shipped. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love it, this is my second jar. I have seen good improvement. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> In my 20&#x27;s, even 30&#x27;s I could have never used this product but at my current age 47 it&#x27;s wonders!  My skin went from oily to super dry when I hit 40 and I searched for several years until a year ago I started using Physicians Formula.  My skin now looks like it did in my 20&#x27;s no kidding.  People always comment on my age when I tell them \\&quot;yes I&#x27;m really 47\\&quot;  I have no crows feet at all at this point, no 11&#x27;s!!  I do say you have to have a health diet, drink water and stay out of the sun, and no smoking to keep young.  I feel young and this product restores my skin texture to exactly how it felt in my 20&#x27;s.  Perfect.  If I run out my skin hurts it&#x27;s so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use all of their products now and keep stocked up.  Lasts a long time too, I usually only buy every 4-6 months.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for about a week and a half but so far I really like it. It does soften the skin and my age spots seem less but I also use Physicians Formula Dark Spot Corrector with it. I do like that my skin doesn&#x27;t look so dry and in return isn&#x27;t showing the signs of my aging skin.</li>
