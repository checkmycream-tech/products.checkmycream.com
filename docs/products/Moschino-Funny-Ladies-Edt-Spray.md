    <li> I purchased this wanting to try something new at an affordable price. This scent is a bit like grapefruit (or citrus) to me. It smells crisp &amp; clean. My 9 year old daughter loves it and since its not overpowering, I don&#x27;t mind when he sees it. Two, it doesn&#x27;t break the bank costwise, so thats notable. I give it an 8/10.</li>

    <li> My go to perfume during California&#x27;s extended Spring/Summer season!  Smells wonderful and not overpowering at all.  I can not smell it but everyone around me give me compliments so yeah for fresh scents!</li>
    <li> This is a soft yet tantalizing scent with excellent staying power, and after one spray to the wrist it immediately became my new favorite. And after repeatedly sniffing my arm for 20 mins, I wore it to bed last night for no other reason than to smell it on myself because it was so intoxicating; the scent lingering on my sheets and pillow was an added plus. Never going without this one!</li>
    <li> The perfect gift for a cool, kinda casual lady.</li>

    <li> I was pleased with delivery of my fragrance however I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. I read a few reviews that mentioned if you like Elizabeth Arden Green Tea, you&#x27;d appreciate Moschino&#x27;s Funny! Boy were they wrong. I will definitely be re-gifting this one.</li>
    <li> Excellent . I love this parfum ;)</li>
    <li> Love it! This and I love love, are my 2 favorite fragrances!</li>

    <li> Exelent product thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne as a gift for my niece.  I had already bought one for myself and when she smelt it, she fell in love with it.  The cologne has a slight undertone of grapefruit which I really love.  It reminds me a lot of Babydoll from Yves St Laurent, so if you love Babydoll you will love this cologne.</li>
