      <li>LOVE THIS WEN PRODUCT</li>
      <li>THE BETTER MY HAIR GETS.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many \\&quot;professional\\&quot; products over the years and am telling everyone I know about WEN.   </li>
      <li>Have been using this for 2 years now and still my favorite.  </li>
      <li>and they also love it.  </li>
      <li>and I love that it looks and smells freshly cleansed!!  </li>
      <li>Glad I got it for free with my points, but still would have preferred to get something else</li>
      <li>do think this is important, and my hair looks better in between shampoos because of this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen this stuff in action - - it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
      <li>I bought this for my girls who have fine hair and lots of tangles in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I have medium length fine curly hair that tends to lose it&#x27;s ringlets after one night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
      <li>Use caution if you are using in your bathroom and have uncovered and smooth floors.</li>
      <li>After spending a great deal of time and money, I finally found this extraordinary product and would not ever consider using anything else now.</li>
      <li>But this mist works great, adds needed moisture and does exactly what I want: brings back my curls.</li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B0042H4GIY WEN Deluxe-Size Sweet Almond Mint Replenishing Treatment Mist - 12 Oz]]</li>
      <li>I use the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner and the treatment mist spray.</li>
      <li>My hair is in much better condition thanks to WEN</li>
      <li>Great for giving hair a light shine and keeping frizz down!</li>
      <li>This product enables me to refresh my hair style and leaves hair smelling fresh and looking clean.  </li>
      <li>IT MAKE MY HAIR HAIR SO SOFT AND VERY EASY TO MANAGE.</li>
      <li>I also use it to set my makeup and give my face a fresh glow.</li>
      <li>It did have a great smell, as does the Wen conditioning shampoo in sweet almond mint, but the overspray does tend to make any and all surfaces slick.  </li>
      <li>So worth it.</li>
      <li>I have been using the WEN sweet almond mint shampoo/conditioner for the last 2+ years now and love it.</li>
      <li>I only need to spray it ONCE at the tangle and it combs out easily!  </li>
      <li>This certainly ain&#x27;t it!</li>
      <li>I purchased the products out of curiosity but found I actually don&#x27;t spend any more money than I used to and the girl that does</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve use better and for one fourth the price.</li>
      <li>I THINK A LOT MORE PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY BUY HIS PRODUCTS</li>
      <li>I HAVE VERY COURSE AND FRIZZY HAIR.</li>
      <li>but it really hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I no longer spend hours blowing and straightening my very curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I also bought the pomegranate scent and like it, although not quite as much.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I not only use it on MY hair, but our 4 and 6 year old love it too.</li>
      <li>but this particular product changed my life.  </li>
      <li>I would not be withoutit and highly recommend Wen products for all hair types.</li>
      <li>I had thought that this item would help to keep the frizz at bay and help smooth my hair, but it didn&#x27;t do too much other then moisten it again for restyling.  </li>
      <li>This is the answer, spray mist a little, fluff your hair and you&#x27;re good to go!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I cannot live without this mist.</li>
      <li>It makes it so soft!</li>
      <li>I love the smell it gives &amp; I usually spray some on my hands after spraying on my hair &amp; rub it in.</li>
      <li>I actually didn&#x27;t like this product when I first tried it</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s old glory.</li>
      <li>Will save my money for a professional weekly blow-dry instead.</li>
      <li>All of the WEN products I&#x27;ve use so far have worked wonders on my hair.</li>
      <li>It feels softer to me and I am 60 years old with curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It also leave&#x27;s your hair soft.</li>
      <li>Wow, it really works on African American hair!  </li>
      <li>I am african american with very wavy natrully curly hair.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re tired and/or your face feels dry, just spray a little on and it livens you right up and has a lovely smell.  </li>
      <li>A friend of mine has a daughter with long, frizzy, dry hair and it made it smooth and sleek with just a few sprays.</li>
      <li>I leave it to dry naturally and then use the mist on sections and straighten it with a blow dryer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is great for my hair! My hair tends to be dry, but this spray solves that problem for me. I keep some on hand in a small bottle so I can put it in my purse so anytime my hair feels dry I just mist with this.</li>
    <li> I not only use it on MY hair, but our 4 and 6 year old love it too. It&#x27;s a nice way to refresh hair and eliminate flyaways in the morning. It also feels good on skin and isn&#x27;t sticky at all. A little goes a long way! Wen is a wonderful product line...</li>
    <li> I spray this on my hair every day. I love the mint fragrance it leave&#x27;s on my hair. It also leave&#x27;s your hair soft.</li>
    <li> After coloring my hair for years, it became dry and fine, with poor appearance. This product has made a difference. The salon color also seems to last longer.</li>
    <li> I had extremely damaged hair from over processing (something I&#x27;d never had a problem with before).  After using this product for a couple of months, my hair was back to it&#x27;s old glory.</li>
    <li> Refreshing spray!  Already a WENgirl I&#x27;ve been wanting to try it.  I use it mostly on my skin.  It makes it so soft!</li>
    <li> I had thought that this item would help to keep the frizz at bay and help smooth my hair, but it didn&#x27;t do too much other then moisten it again for restyling.  It did have a great smell, as does the Wen conditioning shampoo in sweet almond mint, but the overspray does tend to make any and all surfaces slick.  Use caution if you are using in your bathroom and have uncovered and smooth floors.</li>
    <li> I have tried sooooo many leave in&#x27;s &amp; have liked Biolage &amp; used it exclusively for years. I ordered this just to try &amp; I am glad I did. It&#x27;s not as heavy as the Biolage, however, it works well as a detangler, conditioner,  I love the smell it gives &amp; I usually spray some on my hands after spraying on my hair &amp; rub it in. It is a GREAT softener &amp; soaks in quickly with no greasy residue. A very BIG thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this stuff in action - - it&#x27;s amazing! Works well on dry, tangled hair. A friend of mine has a daughter with long, frizzy, dry hair and it made it smooth and sleek with just a few sprays. I just bought some for my sister, who also has long, dry, frizzy hair. I am sure she will love it! You only need a small amount for it to work. So worth it.</li>
    <li> Not sure this product lives up to its hype. I have dry, over- processed hair and was probably looking for a miracle. This certainly ain&#x27;t it! Will save my money for a professional weekly blow-dry instead. The same goes for the Wen moisturizing shampoo that makes your hair look lank a few days after washing. Not worth the money, I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girls who have fine hair and lots of tangles in the morning.  I only need to spray it ONCE at the tangle and it combs out easily!  Plus the girls love the way their hair smells!  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is GREAT stuff to use in between cleansings..It is wonderful...I even use it on my dog between cleansings..BUY IT..!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom as a gift. She didnt like the smell at all. So i tried it. It did nothing for my hair. I didnt see a change. I use Redken and LOVE it. This didnt do what my shampoo does at all.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS WEN PRODUCT I HAVE FIZZY HAIR AND THIS TAKES THE FLY AWAY&#x27;S AND FIZZINESS AWAY!!!!!! YES I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO MY FRIENDS!!!! 5*****!</li>
    <li> Great for giving hair a light shine and keeping frizz down! I also use it to set my makeup and give my face a fresh glow.</li>
    <li> Wen products have been wonderful for my naturally curly hair.  I have tried so many \\&quot;professional\\&quot; products over the years and am telling everyone I know about WEN.   IT IS THE BEST ! ! ! !</li>
    <li> I have medium length fine curly hair that tends to lose it&#x27;s ringlets after one night&#x27;s sleep. I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair everyday so I use Wen Replenishing Spray to bring back the curl and style for a second day. It works immediately. I used to use plain water which tended to dry my hair and make it frizz. But this mist works great, adds needed moisture and does exactly what I want: brings back my curls. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the WEN sweet almond mint shampoo/conditioner for the last 2+ years now and love it. I have naturally curly hair and have a hard time finding products that work well with my hair type. I actually didn&#x27;t like this product when I first tried it but once I gave it an honest try and some time, it&#x27;s become my all time favorite. The replenishing mist has a very refreshing smell; it&#x27;s not too strong or perfumy. I use it on my hair in between shampoo days to freshen up and I spray it on my face throughout the day to perk me up. If you&#x27;re tired and/or your face feels dry, just spray a little on and it livens you right up and has a lovely smell.  I also bought the pomegranate scent and like it, although not quite as much. I&#x27;m curious to read comments about the other scents.</li>
    <li> I love this product to freshen my hair.  When it gets frizzy around the edges I spray this on then use the texture balm to make my hair lay flat when I want to pull it back in a pony tail.  I am african american with very wavy natrully curly hair.  The two together work perfect for the look I want.  All of the WEN products I&#x27;ve use so far have worked wonders on my hair.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this mist. Have been using this for 2 years now and still my favorite.  I tried all but Almond Mint is the one I always come back to.</li>
    <li> WEN products saved my long hair.  I was about to cut it all off short as I was tired of the dry lifeless look due to coloring and regular straightening.  I love WEN and have given many colleagues recommendations and they also love it.  I am a total WEN girl but this particular product changed my life.  I no longer spend hours blowing and straightening my very curly hair.  I leave it to dry naturally and then use the mist on sections and straighten it with a blow dryer.  My hair is in much better condition thanks to WEN products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you WEN</li>
    <li> My hair was damaged so badly but in just two days this product brought back my natural hair and smoothed out the rough texture and helped get rid of split ends!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0042H4GIY WEN Deluxe-Size Sweet Almond Mint Replenishing Treatment Mist - 12 Oz]] This product enables me to refresh my hair style and leaves hair smelling fresh and looking clean.  I use it between use of cleansing conditioner and I love that it looks and smells freshly cleansed!!  I use all of the WEN products and making the switch from shampoo and conditioner has been great for my hair.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel great</li>
    <li> The Replenishing Treatment is not all that  it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  I&#x27;ve use better and for one fourth the price.</li>
    <li> When I spray it on my hair it gives it the beach curly hair look.  Nice smell to it also.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I used to have so many split ends and now since I started using it, my hair is getting better.</li>
    <li> In between shampoos?  This is the answer, spray mist a little, fluff your hair and you&#x27;re good to go!&lt;br /&gt;I do think this is important, and my hair looks better in between shampoos because of this.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for me but take up more space under my sink. Glad I got it for free with my points, but still would have preferred to get something else</li>
    <li> I am a big Wen fan. After spending a great deal of time and money, I finally found this extraordinary product and would not ever consider using anything else now. Wen&#x27;s Replenishing Treatment mist is just another fantasic Wen product.  I would not be withoutit and highly recommend Wen products for all hair types.</li>
    <li> I have used the Wen  hair care products before, but had not tried this one.  It doubles as face / neck and hair replenishing mist.  It&#x27;s good for the skin as well as hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it as both and just love it.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  It smells good and it is refreshing but does nothing more to hair.  WASTE OF MONEY!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with dryness and frizziness I experience in the winter especially. I wish I could say it helped but it really hasn&#x27;t.  The product is too expensive and you need to use a ton of it to get the results desired. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like it but not the big rave that everyone was saying it would be, will use it til it is gone but would not re order. Nice clean smell that I liked.</li>
    <li> Wow, it really works on African American hair!  Made my hair silky shiny and manageble after washing, and I have extremely thick kinky coiled hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It has gone above my expectations of what I thought it was going to do! I use the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner and the treatment mist spray. My hair is soft, smooth, and looks great ALL THE TIME! I don&#x27;t have any more \\&quot;bad hair days\\&quot;, I have highlights in my hair for about 3 weeks and they have not faded,and people constantly compliment my hair! No more shampoo for me because I&#x27;m a WEN girl now!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE WEN PRODUCTS. I HAVE VERY COURSE AND FRIZZY HAIR. IT PUT THE MOISTURE BACK INTO MY ETHNIC HAIR. IT SMOOTHES IT OUT. IT MAKE MY HAIR HAIR SO SOFT AND VERY EASY TO MANAGE. THE SMELL IS JUST GREAT. THE MORE I USE IT THE BETTER MY HAIR GETS. AND I USE LESS OF THE PRODUCT. BEING ITS A CONDITIONER AND SHAMPOO MAKES IT GREAT. BUT I THINK ITS A BIT OVER PRICED. CHAZ I THINK COULD LOWER HIS PRICES. I THINK A LOT MORE PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY BUY HIS PRODUCTS WHO WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEM. THEREFORE ALLOWING COMPANIES WHO CARRY HIS PRODUCTS TO HAVE VALUE SELLS FROM TIME TO TIME. AGAIN I ORDERED IT FROM AMAZON THEY HAVE EVERYTHING. AND YOU ALWAYS GET IT ON TIME AS PROMISED.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after using the conditioning cleanser and it works just like advertised.  I will always use these products as long as they are produced.  For all the reviews I have read by people who have had a problem with these products I would have to say I do not understand.  I purchased the products out of curiosity but found I actually don&#x27;t spend any more money than I used to and the girl that does my hair says it is fuller and not brassy looking.  It feels softer to me and I am 60 years old with curly hair.  I have shoulder length hair and only use 5 pumps to wash my hair.  It stays on until the end of my shower and then I comb it through with my fingers before rinsing.  I read a review where someone they were losing hair and I can only say that when I was washing my hair with shampoo I did not notice the hair I lost because I was scrubbing my hair not combing my fingers through it.  I asked my hairdresser what she thought and she told me everybody loses hair daily and because when she washes people&#x27;s hair she can see the hair loss when she combs through your hair.  I also highlight and lowlight my hair and before It got time for me to have it done again my hair was always brassy yellow.  My hair does not lose the color now with Wen so I am very happy about it.</li>
