<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received a sample from a friend and fell in love. Totally turned my hair around. Love it</li>
    <li> I have naturally blonde hair that is slowly darkening as I get older. I get highlights put in by my stylist to bring back some of my lighter blonde shades. She recommended the Unite Blonda line to me and it is amazing. It brings back my highlights so well that my coworker asked me if I had my hair done and it has been over two months. They were all surprised at how well it keeps the highlights fresh and allows me to go 4 months between color which has saved me money in the long run. I use it about twice a week and a regular Aveda shampoo the rest of the time. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I only give this shampoo 4 stars out of 5 because I cannot stand the smell. It&#x27;s a very strong grape scent. Of course it&#x27;s a purple shampoo but I didn&#x27;t think it would smell like this, after people raged it smelled so yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few washes only twice a week, I did notice my orange brassy strands lighting up. It&#x27;s quite amazing how it tones it so nice. The bottle directions ask to only leave it on for 60 seconds &amp; not exceed but my hair stylist told me twice a week for 2 mins tops.</li>
    <li> If you want ashy hair, buy this stuff! It&#x27;s the best and keeps your blonde bright and NOT brassy.</li>
    <li> I have no idea where they dug this product up from.  The packaging smelled like it came from an outhouse.  HORRIBLE smell.  I tried soaking the bottles to get rid of the smell.  And actually had to wrap the bubble wrapped envelope in another plastic bag.  I don&#x27;t think I will order from this company again.  I bought this product because people said it smelled so good.  Not sure what I got.</li>
    <li> My stylist turned me onto this. I paid a lot more at the salon, but now buy it online. Costs so much less. I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in my hair. Platinum blonde hair stays blonde without yellowing. Plus, my hair is the healthiest ever. It feels thicker and softer and never flat. I have thin hair, but a lot of it. I skipped the trim the last time I had it colored. No breakage/split ends. My husband uses it, too.nkeeps his gray looking sexy and soft. A little bit goes a long way. I use it with the 75 seconds conditioner and Boosta spray.</li>
    <li> Love the color it tints my hair, love love love the smell!</li>
    <li> Best purple shampoo and conditioner on the market! Keeps your blonde looking fresh like you just had it done. Highly recommend! Smells like grapes too :)</li>
    <li> I am a repeat customer.  I color my hair platinum blonde.  Using this products help me keep my original hair color (preventing it from turning &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34;) longer.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended to me by my stylist when I decided to have heavy blonde highlights added to my hair. The results are amazing.  My blonde has stayed completely true for two months now, and my hair is in excellent shape.  I have stocked up on this stuff just in case they decide to stop making it!</li>
    <li> This product is great for those that highlight their hair with blonde tones. My hairdresser turned me on to this and I have used it now for over 2 years, it really helps hold my color.</li>
    <li> both shampoo and conditioner are excellent</li>
    <li> I stopped coloring my dark hair and let it go grey...i began to realized i needed a special shampoo to brighten the new color..I tried Unite Blonda and loved it...i especially loved the smell, which is lite and grape like...</li>
    <li> The product itself is generally a good one.  I have used it before after buying it from a salon.  When I opened the package, the conditioner was oozing out around the top and the bottle was obviously old as it was yellowish vs. the shampoo bottle, which was still white plastic.  I won&#x27;t order through this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> Works well and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Wish the bottles were bigger</li>
    <li> Keeps my blonde looking blonde without the brassiness.  Doesn&#x27;t lather too much but the color results are worth it.</li>
    <li> Product works well but smells ATROCIOUS!  It has the most overwhelming artificial grape smell and each time I wash my hair I feel like a walking Blow Pop.  Which is great....for a 10 year old!  PLEASE adjust the scent to make it more &amp;#34;adult friendly&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible. My hair feels like straw whenever I use it which is once a week. The other days I spend trying to recover the moisture that was just sucked out by this stuff. I also can&#x27;t stand the children&#x27;s cough medicine smell.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! Works great and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love this product for my grey hair - it helps keep it from becoming brassy.  However when it arrived the lid was not tight on the shampoo so it had leaked some of the product into the bag and all over the bottles.  That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with my blonde highlights going too gold and I&#x27;ve tried several other products with no visible results.  After one use I could tell a difference.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product and will definitely be using it going forward.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner...leaves my blonde non brassy...this is a must have ..this is truly a winner A+ solid</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for blondes! The product was sealed and ready for my use. Will be reordering in the near future.</li>
    <li> I personally love the smell. It has a very strong grape scent, which may not be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea. Keeps my hair shinny and blonde without the brassiness. Items arrived intact and as promised.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE!!! received w the bottles EXPLODED in the package!!!!</li>
