      <li>Used very gently twice a day, the best thing about the Dermabrush is that it makes all of my regular skincare products work much more effectively: used in combination with my 2x a week</li>

      <li>heels is important to me.  </li>
      <li>I also get spray tanned and this works great for exfoliating/cleaning before tanning and for getting rid of the left over tan once the tan is fading.</li>
      <li>I received it in about 4 days and absolutely think everyone should own one.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much</li>
      <li>I gave Dermabrush Advanced Cleansing System a 5 Star rating because It surpassed all my expectations.</li>
      <li>Overall a great purchase for the price</li>
      <li>I enjoy using it every day and would definetely recommend it to all my acquaintances.</li>
      <li>I feel like this is something best used a few times a week instead of every day.</li>
      <li>Skin is smooth and clean after.</li>
      <li>I am over 50 and for a small price to pay it was just that special gift to myself that is priceless.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, and for the very reasonable cost, I find it to be more than adequate.</li>
      <li>First one I&#x27;ve tried and my skin looks great especially at 49.</li>
      <li>Good facial cleanser.</li>

      <li>need to be careful with face but love this one!</li>
      <li>and I read reviews on this one-- pretty good and so much less than the Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As much as I love the product, I would like if they could add more speeds to future models since it only has one at the moment.</li>
      <li>Also my pores are getting much smaller and my face appears to have more of a dewy glow.</li>
      <li>I love the different attachments.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the nicest facial brush I&#x27;ve owned.  It is powerful, yet gentle.  Other electric brushes I&#x27;ve owned just didn&#x27;t have the stamina of this one.  I liked it so much I ordered a second one, just in case...  It would make a nice gift, though.  This brush does not lose power, even after running for five minutes.  At first I thought the body brush was an unnecessary luxury, but find it is good for circulation, especially in the extremities, and helps with exfoliation.  The only attachment I haven&#x27;t used is the soft sponge. Good price, excellent product.</li>
    <li> awesome product. love it</li>
    <li> girlfriend loves it .</li>
    <li> Pretty decent. It&#x27;s my first one so I can&#x27;t say about the power. It&#x27;s not a big deal about not being waterproof, just don&#x27;t soak it.</li>
    <li> I have not used it consistently to make an informed judgment about how effective the product is in what it was designed to do.</li>
    <li> Love the dermabrush I use it at least 3x week! Also love the other attachments too.</li>
    <li> cheap and good product</li>
    <li> This brush is nice! I haven&#x27;t used any other brushes so I can&#x27;t compare but I really like this one!</li>
    <li> I am a licensed esthetician (20+ years) so I have been able to use all kinds of cleansing products and tools.  I actually saw this cleansing system being demonstrated on HSN, but at almost $40+shipping.  Based on these demos, I wanted to try it!  I was glad to find it for less on Amazon.  It was a good investment because I can truly see a difference.  This exfoliates more effectively and gently than a scrub.  In fact, I use Retin-A, so it helps polish off the little flakes of dead skin.  This in turn enabled my other products (i.e. serum, moisturizer, etc...) to work better.  I could tell a difference after only one use.  I use the small brush on my face and neck.  I used the larger one on my chest, shoulders, and backs of my hands.  Then after applying my usual moisturizer, it looked like I had more dewy, younger looking skin.  The foam pad is best for every day use w/ cleanser.  It might be too drying to use the small brush every day.  But alternating between the two maintains a nice, polished looking glow.  Lastly, I used the pumice&lt;br /&gt;attachment on my feet.  I put on a lot of lotion and slept in socks.  I woke up with really soft feet.  I mostly live in flip flops, so taking care of my feet&lt;br /&gt;and heels is important to me.  Overall, I would recommend purchasing this set because the price is right and it is sort of like the gift that keeps on&lt;br /&gt;giving.  I have noticed my skin looking better every day since I received it.  I would have posted a review sooner, but wanted to use a few times and see actual results first.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a microdermabrasion-type brush.  For years I&#x27;ve been using Alpha Hydrox product, soufflé (12% glycolic acid) which is amazing.  I purchased some Olay scrub and felt like I was pushing my skin around with my fingers to get the skin exfoliated.  I read that once a person tried this, they&#x27;re pretty happy with it and I read reviews on this one-- pretty good and so much less than the Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like this is an awesome accompaniment to my glycolic acid and helps apply my Olay exfoliant. as I was hoping. Contrary to what other reviewers say, I could definitely feel the results instantly using the brush.  I didn&#x27;t care for the sponge/foam setting-- did nothing for me, but the pumice was nice for feet and I am anxious to try to shower/body brush-- not much time to use around here with a preschooler, but I think it&#x27;ll be great since it&#x27;s the same as the smaller one for face.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone.  Mt only complaint is that the brush only rotates one way.  Under my right eye I am careful because I feel like it pulls the kin the wrong way (don&#x27;t want to cause more wrinkles!) Highly recommend (and don&#x27;t forget to use a gentle glycolic acid too-- Holy Grail</li>
    <li> Handy dandy.  Gave as a gift and received positive feedback.  Friend especially likes the lotion pad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dermabrush with my own facial liquid for approx 3 weeks and find an improvement in facial skin, especially in the problem areas around my nose, where previously pores would clog.  I use their exfoliating product once a week on the entire face.  This machine is gentle to the skin and effective.  The body brush does a good job of soothing and smoothing the rest of the body.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> This is a nice appliance with good accessories.  My skin is sensitive and it did not irritate my skin but made it feel very clean.</li>
    <li> Tried this after my hairdresser recommended it.  Love this system! First one I&#x27;ve tried and my skin looks great especially at 49.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It exfoliates well especially on my face which tends to be dry. I also get spray tanned and this works great for exfoliating/cleaning before tanning and for getting rid of the left over tan once the tan is fading. My face sometimes gets red from scrubbing too hard in the same spot on my face, but if you keep it moving it works wonders. I love that it comes with all the different brush heads. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because mine for some reason has trouble spinning. it acts like the battery is dead, but if i jiggle it, it will start spinning again. My mother-in-law has never had this problem with hers, so it may just be the batteries. Overall a great purchase for the price and i would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have one from Neutrogena but it isn&#x27;t flexible and can be hard to get in some areas. Plus it doesn&#x27;t have a brush, it has a flat head so I like this one better.</li>
    <li> This works great and for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.  Someone else said it was a little slow, but how fast would you really want it for your face?!  You are supposed to be gentle on your face, not sandblast it!  Finally I can get ALL of my makeup off.  Prior to using this, I would use makeup remover and then a harsh astringent or alcohol to get more of the makeup off. I still saw it in the pores of my nose. Now, nothing!  I also purchased the Gurin extra attachments which fit the same.</li>
    <li> I would be lost without this! I love the different attachments. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a few months and just now had to replace the battery. Really cleans my skin!</li>
    <li> This cleansing system is awesome! I have the VERY expensive one but I use this one more often because my face feels cleaner. Would recommend to anyone, and the price is spot on.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it daily! Much better value than what you can but from cosmetic retailers. My toddler has also submerged it at least a dozen times and it has not failed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase another one!</li>
    <li> Not bad for a the less expensive line. I use it with my Lazlo black bar. No skin irritation. It works well.</li>
    <li> It does what we think is suppose to do. I offer this item to my wife and she is very satisfied with the results, in particulary with the face massage.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the expensive one for comparison, but I am surprisingly pleased with this.  I mostly love the big body brush.  I use it in the shower on my arms, legs, chest, etc.... with either shower gel or body scrub in place of a bath cloth - easier and quicker.  I use the pumice on my elbow area, which is a place that&#x27;s usually hard to find things that work there (I use a black &amp; decker with a fine tip for my feet, so..... haven&#x27;t tried this pumice on feet).  I can even get the small brush behind my ears.  I always wondered if the brush would clean makeup off or just push it further into your skin, and I can&#x27;t comment on that since I haven&#x27;t used it to remove makeup.  But at this price, I kinda love this thing for what I&#x27;ve described.  It isn&#x27;t very powerful and it does seem as if it&#x27;s a bit puny, but as I said - for the price, good value - I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> I love this facial brush.  Paying 200.00 on a brush to me is crazy.  This brush works great, it has many different heads.  The body brush works fine, but I really bought it for the face.  This brush helps remove everything it needs to.  But what it really does is prepare your skin to accept your skin care treatments.  It will make a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Its good for the Price. A dermatologist friend of mine recommended that I buy the Clairisonic facial cleaner a few weeks before my wedding to clear up my skin. Because it was around $100 and I didnt know how my skin would take to it, I decided to try this as an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;It was good for the price. It got the job done. The main thing I really didnt like about it is that it ran on 4 AA Batteries, and they would die within a week of usage.&lt;br /&gt;Ended up getting the clairisonic Mia a few weeks ago and absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;In hind-sight, if I were to do it over again, I&#x27;d definitely spluge of the Clairisonic and not waste my time with this.</li>
    <li> I never write a review for a product that I bought online,but this item I had high hopes for since I read other reviews saying that it pretty much the same as the $200 facial brush. When I received the brush it was small but easy to handle. The first time I used it, it was great the facial brush was small but very gentle. The next day the brush won&#x27;t work I assumed that maybe the batteries somehow ran out so I replaced them with new batteries and the brush still wouldn&#x27;t work. Sucks I really had high hopes for this</li>
    <li> It worked great until I dropped it in the shower and it completely fell apart and all the wires came undone. The batteries lasted the whole 3 months that I used it. I loved how it made my skin look and feel, so now I have to buy another one. I may upgrade now to the Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Good facial cleanser. Not harsh but deep cleaner.</li>
    <li> Works very well for a week then bristles starts to spread out</li>
    <li> Love this product  . .  saw it advertised on TV . . . love the attachments and am a true believer!!!  Wakes up your complexion and I can see a difference after one week.  Also truly believe that after cleaning and brightening your skin your normal everyday facial creams will certainly work better with the enhancing buffing tool which is included.</li>
    <li> Used very gently twice a day, the best thing about the Dermabrush is that it makes all of my regular skincare products work much more effectively: used in combination with my 2x a week Tazorac .1%, salacylic wash &amp; vitamin C syrum, my skin looks clearer. It also removes the sunscreen and makeup very well at the end of the day with my regular cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not an overnight miracle product, but added to my regular skincare regimen, it improved the results of all of my skin treatments noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star less because it requires batteries, and it isn&#x27;t possible to buy a single small replacement brush, you have to buy a whole 4-piece set.</li>
    <li> Best product I have bought for my skin.  Value is exceptional.  I compare it to Clarisonic.  No need to spend the extra money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and my skin looks cleaner and smoother</li>
    <li> So far I love the product...seems to clean very well!</li>
    <li> Body brush is great and facial is good also....need to be careful with face but love this one!</li>
    <li> Performed well.  Refills cost more than the original item. Went back to traditional methods.</li>
    <li> Had a prior Dermabrush which I dropped in the shower.  This is a replacement and does the same wonderful job as my initial Dermabrush. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. My skin has never looked better. The quality is excellent for the price. No need to buy the expensive fancy versions. Skin is smooth and clean after. Best my skin has ever looked. Sellers please don&#x27;t change the price. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love the Dermabrush! It does the job for a fraction of the cost! I just turn it on and rotate it across my face and neck once a day for a minute and rinse the brush and my face when finished. My skin feels very smooth after doing this process and I do see the dirt and dead skin that&#x27;s left behind in the brush. Also my pores are getting much smaller and my face appears to have more of a dewy glow. I definitely recommend the product. As much as I love the product, I would like if they could add more speeds to future models since it only has one at the moment. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I like this brush and use it every other day with an exfoliating cream and my face is much softer.  So far I have only used the facial brush. I use it with rechargeable batteries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, and for the very reasonable cost, I find it to be more than adequate. It&#x27;s not a Clarisonic, but it does the job well, especially if you&#x27;re not willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a brush to clean your face. I&#x27;ve only used the face brush attachment, but there are several others if you&#x27;re interested in that. It&#x27;s slightly harsher than I expected, but not uncomfortable at all. I feel like this is something best used a few times a week instead of every day.</li>
    <li> I am not quite sure how I ever got along before I bought my derma brush.  Because I have dry skin, I only use the derma brush every other day either in the morning or in the evenings, but let me tell you the benefits.  Since I use Retin A, in the evenings, I sometimes get a little peeling in the mornings.  This brush removes the dead skin completely and without any irritation to my skin.  My face feels so smooth and soft and I feel the serum and moisturizers being absorbed immediately.  My faces absolutely radiates with health all day.  When I use it in the evenings, I first wash off my make-up with my hands and a face cloth.  Then I use the derma brush for the  second washing, and it is during this second washing with the derma brush that I am completely assured that all the make-up residue has been removed.  My face is glowing, not red, just really, really clean and I know that my nightly serum and moisturizer is able to soak into my skin without any make-up residue left on my face.  Then once or twice a month I use it to apply my microdermabrasion treatment.  The brush is soft and gentle and does a better job of applying the gel more evenly onto my face then I can with my hands.  For some reason, I rub too hard when I use my hands and I end up red and irritated whereas, the derma brush is more gentle on my face.  Clean-up is a snap, I just run the brush under water for about 15 seconds and the brush is perfectly clean and soft, ready to dry for my next use.  This derma brush is definitely one of my favorite beauty tools.</li>
    <li> I gave Dermabrush Advanced Cleansing System a 5 Star rating because It surpassed all my expectations. While it is gentle and relaxing  on my skin, it still cleanses and removes all my make-up, also leaving a radiant glow on my face. I enjoy using it every day and would definetely recommend it to all my acquaintances.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin so smooth!  I had no idea it could be that soft... I hope it&#x27;s safe to use everyday, because I&#x27;ve incorporated this into my nightly skincare routine.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it includes the body brush attachment. The speed is not too intense. The only problem is it takes 4 batteries.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. It leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed. You can actually look on the head of the brush and see how much dirt and stuff it takes off. Marvelous, I love it thus far! 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Works well for the price.</li>
    <li> I really life this brush! I had been looking at the clairisonic and they are just too dang pricey for a college students budget! So I googled similar products and decided on this one because of all the different attachments. I have used them all and they are all great! This really helps take the cleanser Im using a lot further and really suds up my face. Be careful around eye area it can really pull that skin! The main downside to this is its battery operated (what is this the 90s?!?!!?) but it comes with batterers so at least I didn&#x27;t have to buy them separate. This has been helping with my acne and the blackheads on my chin. For now this is good enough for me and works well enough at getting my makeup and dead skin off.</li>
    <li> This brush is right for the price. The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get five stars is because there is only one spin direction and I think that having dual direction spin would make this complete. Price is good, water resistant. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> I had wanted this product for a while. Just didn&#x27;t think to check out the price here. It&#x27;s half off the price of HSN. Unbelievable! I received it in about 4 days and absolutely think everyone should own one. It does exactly what it claims. After 2:uses 2 days in a row with my own exfoliating cleanser which is from the pharmacy and inexpensive my skin has a fresh glow and looks better than it&#x27;s ever been. I even skipped makeup and just applied a sheer light tone sunblock. I am over 50 and for a small price to pay it was just that special gift to myself that is priceless. When you look good ...you definitely feel great! I never had such a healthy looking natural fresh looking complexion. Thanks for making this affordable. I am going to never stop using it. Its a keeper and part of my daily routine. Looking healthy makes you look younger too and i am loving that!</li>
