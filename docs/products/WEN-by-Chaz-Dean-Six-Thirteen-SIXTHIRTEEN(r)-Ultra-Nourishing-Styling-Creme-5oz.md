<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Leaves hair SOFT &amp; MOISTURIZE!!!</li>
    <li> Was ordered by mistake and returned</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this is authentic product or not - I noted that a lot of people are having the same doubts about Wen products on here.  I&#x27;m sure some of them are and some may not be.  I used this and after several uses it did not leave my hair as soft as the regular scent Wen I&#x27;d gotton from the supplier.  However after a few uses it was fine and it may be that this formula would not leave my hair as soft no matter where I  purchase it, and since I don&#x27;t care for the smell of the sweet almond mint regular formula, this smells wonderful and works great if I use a small amount as a frizz tamer too.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Hair is hydrated, soft &amp; shiny.</li>
    <li> Sent back because of weird, stale chemical odor. Ewwww</li>
    <li> This is great styling product. All I need is a  little worked into dry hair, scrunch up, comb out and I&#x27;m good to go</li>
    <li> Yes I will buy more this is the best stuff for my natural hair</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this cleanser. That said steer clear of the six thirteen styling cream..it stinks..use the cucumber aloe instead</li>
    <li> great product, works very well</li>
    <li> This works wonder. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I put it on my hair right after washing, rub it into the ends, then blow dry.  My bleached hair has never looked better!  This protects the ends from heat damage, but doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL!  Highly recommend for use in conjunction with WEN shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> This was half empty and smelt like glue</li>
    <li> I really like this.  I use it everyday before drying and it smells good and seems to make a nice difference with the condition of my hair and the styles hold.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> The smell is kinda horrendous.&lt;br /&gt;Works great though</li>
    <li> A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I recently skipped this product for a few days (just to see if I really NEEDED it) and wow, the difference is huge. This is a MUST for my hair, which is dry and curly (3a).</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t always been a fan of WEN products, but Sixthirteen is the BEST product out there.  Beats the Deva Curl product hands down for my head of ginger locks.</li>
    <li> Smell is terrible and leaves my hair very oily and without volume.....not that it&#x27;s a big deal but when this product arrived it was poorly packaged and may have been opened before. It was leaking a small amount of the product which happens sometimes. Like when you travel and the shampoo and conditioners or lotions will be leaking a little bit when you open your bag up. It was opened before it was sent to me.</li>
    <li> This is the first WEN styling cream I have tried. Love the cleansing conditioner. Its great for your hair. No dry split ends. Styling cream leaves hair soft and manageable, but still has body.</li>
    <li> I have coarse curly red hair and it gets dry very easy.  This makes my hair feel really nice after a shower.  Don&#x27;t expect miracles even after a blow dry, still looked like a human cotton ball.  Flat irons really nice.  One note, just recently got a keratin blowout.  This conditioner is too much after a blowout.  Using the regular Wen shampoo instead with good results.  I&#x27;m sure as the blowout comes out I will use this product until my next blow out.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S WEN, ONCE YOU TRY IT YOU WILL NEVER GO BACK TO ANY SALON PRODUCT. IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> Great product to smooth fly away hair and hold curls. Apply after shampoo to wet /damp hair. Let dry or style as usual. Smells wonderful too!</li>
    <li> It was open and smells sour unlike the shampoo which goes with it.  The shampoo smells just fine, but the conditioner smells spoiled.</li>
    <li> This is Kristin and I have bra length hair.It makes my wavey/frizzy hair keep its beachy waves all day,  smells great.  I was using Wen&#x27;s styling creme and love both products.  I mix the smoothing oil and styling creme, then scrunch my hair.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for a shampoo on my own before.  My hair is very fine and since it started graying, I can do nothing with it and the shine has completely disappeared, no matter what I do or use.  I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.  pwb</li>
    <li> Fabulous smell, nice hold, keeps hair from frizzing.  Love all the Wen products!</li>
    <li> This product works very well &amp; smells terrific! My hair is long, thick, curlyish &amp; very dry. Although not miraculous, a definite improvement &amp; I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Of the Wen products, I think this one is my favorite. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair. 2-3 squirts is all that is needed for medium length, thick hair. Quick SH from this company too.</li>
    <li> I have sworn off anything that foams and only use Wen products.  My hair was thin and falling out.  Once I started using Wen, my hair has stopped falling out, is thicker and has a wonderful shine.  I use 6 thirteen  at least three times a week.  It is so nourishing that I can&#x27;t imagine what I would do without it!  If you want to totally change your hair try this product.  Just be sure that you follow the directions and use enough, that is the key.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Will not ever be without it</li>
    <li> Great product, delivered on time and as descripted.</li>
    <li> One of the bottles was leaking and the pump does not work.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself seems to be fine.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was the packaging and the pump that were the problem.</li>
    <li> This is a great styling crème.</li>
    <li> if you like lemon, rosemary &amp; vanilla bean smell all together you will love it ...i can&#x27;t handle the vanilla bean scent..wish they would have put the kinds of scent on web site..i wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this..</li>
    <li> Really good hair stuff. A bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it one time. I have to get used to it.</li>
    <li> Not sure this does much for me. I feel like it&#x27;s kind of conditioning and protecting my hair from the heat styling, but no real evidence of that other than it does make it soft.</li>
    <li> Happy this is a true WEN product! Enough said!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have thick curly hair and it is very light and I use it before I dry my hair with a dryer. When I wash it out it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and it has a pleasant, lemony type smell. I really like it!</li>
    <li> Love all wen products. Amazon great deal!!</li>
    <li> The pump top does not work</li>
    <li> I love the way this styling cream enhances the natural curl in my hair. It seems to also treat my hair at the same time.</li>
    <li> Love Wen, but this scent, Lemon Rosemary, smells like cat pee when put on my wet hair (I use Wen cleansing cream&lt;br /&gt;in multiple scents). Once hair drys the smell dissipates some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work well to soften hair, so I use it when I&#x27;m at home or going to the beach or in a pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine with a weak curl, so it gets frizzy when I don&#x27;t style it. This does help the ends look better and softer when I air dry. Helps the curl look stronger, for that it gets a 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original scent six thirteen is wonderful- next time I will order the original scent nourishing cream instead of lemon rosemary.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only product I put in my hair after I wash my hair with cleanser. Love it!!! I will continue to use Wen products.</li>
    <li> Not the product advertised.  I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but it definitely isn&#x27;t the Six Thirteen.  Lesson learned, only by the product from the WEN website.</li>
    <li> I have used different WEN products for the past 2 years, this is my least favorite WEN.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! Typical WEN product. Very high quality. My hair shines and feels healthy. A tiny, pea sized amount SIXTHIRTEEN somehow allows long lasting control of my stubborn hair, all while being completely flexible, non-sticky and touchable, and adding natural looking volume. Pure witchcraft this! My only complaint (thus the 4/5 stars) is that the only flavor seems to be a mint/lemon scent. I rather dislike the smell. Spoiled milk like, to me. Yes, personal preference, I know, so I&#x27;m not knocking the scent itself, just the lack of olfactory options.</li>
    <li> Bought this product as an &#x27;add on&#x27; from Amazon since we were buying the Fig Wen Shampoo at the time.  There was a hope that it would also work on my son&#x27;s beard to soften, and make it more manageable.  It&#x27;s still a work in progress, more later.</li>
    <li> very nice but need to be careful not to use too much as it leaves hair looking greasy.  good value.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair some soft hold, and makes it soft.</li>
    <li> What more can you say about 613? It is a miracle styling cream. Smells wonderful, not sticky, doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard. Wonderful product</li>
    <li> This Wen product is the BOMB!</li>
    <li> keeps my hair conditioned while blow drying with a bit of styling hold w/o all the bad stuff.  Its GOOD for your hair!</li>
    <li> Not the product I was looking for ......I wanted more of the moose but couldn;t find it</li>
    <li> Perfect for that weightless leave in conditioner. Leaves my hair feeling product free.</li>
    <li> Hyped but failed to deliver would not purchased again. One and done for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  This styling creme works better than anything I have ever used</li>
    <li> Not the formula I got from the actual Wen website but it still works.</li>
    <li> I love all Wen products because it keeps my very curly hair soft, smooth and frizz free but on those very humid or rainy days I do use a touch of SIXTHIRTEEN on my hair as added frizz control.</li>
    <li> I really dont recommend Wen. I used for 3 weeks and started loosing hair.</li>
    <li> Counterfeit item. Live and Learn.</li>
    <li> You can not go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> What they sent to me was not the real thing inside. I love this product by WEN but they had added alcohol, and the bottle was half empty. I did return it. Stick with the real website or QVC.</li>
    <li> Wen is awesome!!!!  I use the whole product line and i absolutely love it! My hair is soft and frizz free and totally manageable.</li>
    <li> awesome product great as a support to the conditioning shampoo</li>
    <li> I love Wen products, this is the first time I have tried this product and am very happy with results. I have dry, frizzy hair and this seemed to make it less frizzy and gave a nice shine to it even in very humid weather. Will be recommending this to others.</li>
    <li> Lovely fresh smell, good product, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help actually at all with any part of the styling of my super curly hair. It does smooth my hair, but doesn&#x27;t work for me like the other WEN styling cremes do.</li>
    <li> it was just okay for my hair.</li>
    <li> Only used a few times but love the feel of my hair.  It also helps with the fuzzy fly-aways I get in humidity.</li>
    <li> I have used many Wen products from conditioning shampoos to leave in conditioners to styling products.  I LOVE  them all - except this one!  The smell is absolutely unbearable.  Lemon Rosemary?  Um, no - to me it smells like a gas station latrine or product with which you have cleaned one.  And once you put it in your hair, it&#x27;s all you can smell for the rest of the day.  It gets one star for styling ability, but if you can&#x27;t stand to put it in your clean hair, what&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> Great follow-up to cleansing conditioner and can use sparingly with wonderful results. Others are noticing and complimenting.</li>
    <li> my hair loves this stuff.  I have to admit I am a WEN fan and use the shampoo/conditioner.  I have always used the styling creme and I still like it but read this will add more body so thought I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;I actually use half styling creme and half sixthirteen.. I have lots more body and my hair is well conditioned and styles easily.&lt;br /&gt;I thought using the sixthirteen needed the styling creme too as it holds better when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;My hair actually still looks good at the end of a work day in which usually the body is gone.</li>
    <li> I put this on after I shower while my hair is still wet, and when it dries its so smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> As good as all the other WEN products. It does a good job of conditioning your hair. I use it on dry or wet hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great light styling product that works wonders for my curly hair!</li>
    <li> Love the entire WEN product line.  Had not tried this one before but it is just as great as the others!</li>
    <li> I have fine, limp hair - the products in this line really help my hair keep a curl all day.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this was going to keep the frizz down on my hair I think it will work if i did not have so many stiff flyways my hair it EXTREMELY FRIZZY WHEN JUST WASH &amp; AIR DRIED THIS PRODUCT WILL HOLD IT DOWN BUT IN A FEW HOUR OR LESS MY HAIR STRAINS (THE SHORT ONES) STARTS TO STICK UP. but i use it when my hair has been press &amp; done it fine works good. I can not do or use anything or work with my hair when it is in an unruly state so i have to press it out and all products work great so I put a little on after I wash it and after I&#x27;ve pressed it i great. hope this helps I received this really fast from seller it a fantastic deal I bought two when buying from qvc or wen site your paying a lot for this small bottle it smells like the cleanser and very strong smell too it&#x27;s like a nice perfume but you use too much smell something like that but  hope this helps i recommend this item i will buy again seller please keep price down</li>
    <li> Without a doubt if you have, dry, colored, curly hair this is for you.  No residue, just soft and luxurious hair. I have not opened this bottle since I am finishing up another, I just like to keep it on hand, esp. w/ the humidity coming.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like spoiled eucalyptus. I have a hard time believing this is actually Wen product. I do not trust putting this on my hair, and am throwing it away since it is nonreturnable. I am very disappointed!!! I have been using Wen products for 4 years now and NEVER have had any problem. Looks like I will be staying with QVC to purchase all my Wen products !!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is authentic Chaz dean.  I have used this product before but this one seems different. Heavier. Weighs my hair down.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered two. But won&#x27;t reorder</li>
    <li> When I used the hair product it smelled horrible.  It was so bad I had to wash several times to get the smell out. I have used Wen Products and loved all. I looked for an expiration date, thought that would explain why it smelled so horrible  it expired in 2013. This product is nearly 2 years past expiration    no excuse</li>
    <li> not crazy about the smell</li>
    <li> The Wen styling cream is the best for my fine flyaway hair. Nothing else has given it control, body and softness in one product. Thank you for having this item available at such a great price. I had to buy multiple bottles.</li>
    <li> Great stuff...smells.good, not oily and.controlled.my..,&amp;#34;maine&amp;#34;...will order again..</li>
    <li> Moisturized my hair and kept the curls styled and defined, very soft to the touch no stiffness.</li>
    <li> having shoulder length fine hair I was hopeing this would keep it intact with a pea portion to apply.  I used much more than a pea portion as the directions said and still the fine hair did not respond.</li>
    <li> Just love the way my hair feels after using Wen products. Every once in awhile I will try shampoo but always go back to Wen.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and find this particular WEN product to be the best. It washes out even easier and my hair has more body.</li>
    <li> This is a knock off of the real Wen  product, and the pump never worked!</li>
    <li> Love this pump better than the tube!  Works wonders on the hair!  Way to go Wen! Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> Purchased this by mistake. Thought I was ordering the SixThirteen Nourishing lotion similar to the one that came in my initial WEN package. It&#x27;s nothing like that, but it IS a very nice, lightweight leave-in styling lotion. You only need a pea-size amount if you have short hair, so this bottle lasts a long time. Just distribute it well into your wet hair. No snarls, and it adds a little bit of body. A nice everyday detangler and light conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product smells awful. I have been using wen conditioning cleanser, which also have very distinct smells. I had to wash it out before I was able to style.</li>
    <li> I presume that by this Year,  Everyone who has Problem Hair has heard of &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; and/or has seen at least One of &amp;#34;Wen&#x27;s&amp;#34;  Infomercials&lt;br /&gt;on T.V.&lt;br /&gt;So, I won&#x27;t  repeat what the Hundreds of other Satisfied Users of  &amp;#34;Wen&#x27;&#x27;  have already written about It,  in the Hundreds of Reviews previously written  at &amp;#34;amazon.com.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, I do have to Start with telling You that I am a Male with Long, Very thick Unmanageable Hair!&lt;br /&gt;I had to start letting It grow Long  while I was in High School, because that is when It started to become VERY Thick! That was 42 years ago, and before I Started to use &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; {when &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; first made Its Debut}, I had LITERALlY used Every Single Natural Shampoo &amp; Natural Hair Conditioner that was sold in Health Food Stores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, I couldn&#x27;t &amp; still  can&#x27;t use Commercial Hair Products,  because they have a lot of  Sulfates &amp; Synthetic chemicals in them that Always Made my&lt;br /&gt;Hair absolutely Impossible  to manage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; was Introduced, needless to say It was &amp; has been the ONLY &amp;#34;Cleansing Conditioner &amp;#34; I have used and the results have Always&lt;br /&gt;been Outstanding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Finally the Subject of This Review:  Wen&#x27;s 5 Oz. Bottle of Its &amp;#34;SIXTHIRTEEN Ultra Nourishing Creme&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wen&#x27;s &amp;#34;Sweet Almond Mint Hair Creme&amp;#34; was the First &amp; Only Hair Creme that was Sold with the First Bottles of  The &amp;#34;Sweet Almond Mint Wen.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;So, to keep my Hair in Its Perfect Condition, I used The &amp;#34;Sweet Almond Mint Hair Creme&amp;#34; in my Hair,  while still Very Damp -- and the&lt;br /&gt;Results were  Absolutely Magnificent: My hair stayed Moist &amp; Manageable all Day &amp; Night!!&lt;br /&gt;That NEVER Happened,  Ever, Until I started using the Wen Creme!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, there was One Problem!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that was the fact that I Did Not Like How the &amp;#34;Mint&amp;#34; Creme felt on my Scalp! Because I have always been Very Sensitive to&lt;br /&gt;anything with Mint in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as I stated above -- the &amp;#34;Wen  Hair Creme&amp;#34;  Performed Magnificently on my Hair!

    <li> Hands down my most favorite and the most effective styling product I have ever purchased! I love this cream so much. It leaves my hair silky, smooth, frizz-free, and so shiny. I use it right after my shower and apply one to two pumps from mid-shaft down and run the leftovers through my roots. Before applying, I rub between my hands to get an even distribution. The smell is amazing. I&#x27;m not sure why some people say its stinky. It has a beautiful lemony, vanilla scent and it is not over powering when applied to hair. In fact, the following day I don&#x27;t smell it at all. I have lower back-length, wavy, thick hair. If you have fine or shorter hair you may only need 1/2 to 1 pump. A little goes a long way. I purchased the 5oz size on November 19, 2014 and I used my last drops today, July 17, 2015. That is over six months of use!!! And I apply it religiously after every shower!!!!!! Such a fantastic product. I hope it comes back in stock soon!</li>
    <li> I have used Wen for about three years now, the cleansers, deep penetrating masks, oils and replenishing sprays.  I can easily say that this is the best product in his line.  I am African American, with natural hair and I love it.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.  Deep conditioning in five minutes. your hair is buttery soft, you can not beat it!!!</li>
    <li> My hair soaks this up...</li>
    <li> Another great Wen product.  Try it, it works and, you will love your hair</li>
    <li> Good product, excellent service.</li>
    <li> Arrived with the cap loose and alot of leakage</li>
    <li> Without a doubt, Wen is one of my favorite indulgences! This product is fantastic, seller was fast and product brand new! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this! Has finally helped tame my flyaway hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 613 many times but the one I received this time sunk! It&#x27;s an out of date product!</li>
