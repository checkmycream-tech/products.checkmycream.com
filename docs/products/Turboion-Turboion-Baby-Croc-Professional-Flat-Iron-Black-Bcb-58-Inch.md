      <li>It didn&#x27;t run silky smooth over my hair like my regular croc.  </li>
      <li>The description on Amazon as well as the description card included state that it is dual-voltage capable.  </li>
      <li>Disappointing, but the return is free and the customer service rep was very nice and helpful.  </li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot, looks very nice, and seems well made, as does the case it comes in. But there are better ones out there.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t keep it but I used it once or twice to give it a chance.  It didn&#x27;t run silky smooth over my hair like my regular croc.  The material was not very great I guess.  It could not have gotten as hot as it claims either.  Maybe my expectations were to high but should have known better with the great price.  It was pretty though!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this flat iron so much I bought two:  one for home and one for the gym.  I have a pixie cut and this is perfect!  It heats up quickly, straightens beautifully, and leaves my hair shiny.  It comes with a travel case and is dual voltage.  I always travel with this flat iron.  It&#x27;s great.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good 1/2&amp;#34; flat iron, give it a shot.  It&#x27;s a bargain!</li>
    <li> I only bought this flat iron for travels outside of the country but it&#x60;s useless to me since it&#x60;s NOT duel voltage as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little iron. Bought it for travel and it&#x27;s perfect for that: small, simple and easy to use. My hair slips through with no tugging at all. Also, it&#x27;s cute and will cause hair iron envy in all other women who see it. ONE THING: This iron only has one temperature setting. And that setting is \\&quot;nuclear\\&quot;. I have very thin, mostly straight hair. I just use an iron to clean it up a bit, and not everyday. I&#x27;ve learned with this iron to start using it right after I turn it on. It heats up pretty quickly and if I wait to let it warm up like I did with my old iron it will be waaaay too hot for me. I did that once and had static-y, fried up hair. I think I heard my hair crying at the time. I think if you have thick, dense and/or curly hair then this level of heat would be a plus for you.</li>
    <li> Nuclear heat setting. Just what I needed from this small compact travel flat iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased for traveling, but use it most of the time because it heats up quickly and so easy to use!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, and I recently got a pixie cut. This works perfectly for straightening my hair and smoothing it down into a modern look. This little iron gets pretty hot! You definitely want to work with smaller sections of hair, though, as the pads are only about 3\\&quot; long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the iron itself, it definitely has a quality feel to it, and it&#x27;s comfortable to use. It&#x27;s very sleek and professional looking.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s right, I am rocking my 2nd Baby CROC.  It takes a lickin&#x27; &amp; keeps on tickin.&#x27;  This is a short hair qualifier.</li>
    <li> Very good product, reliable, stable. I use it more than 1 year and had no problems. I think you will like it too.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! It is so cute and it works well for its size. The carrying case/heat protector is awesome, I haven&#x27;t taken it out of the country yet, but dual voltage is a must - I fried a non-dual straightener on my last trip. Great for touch ups, but since it is so small, it loses heat much faster than a full-size would.</li>
    <li> Not only was there false advertising that I could change the tempeture, which I could not.&lt;br /&gt;When I returned the product I was charged for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive so I can take on my trip.  Does not work, very disappointed.  Sent a request to return have not heard back.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a &#x27;dual-voltage&#x27; flat iron, pass this item up!  The description is completely wrong when it states that it is dual-voltage.  There is only one switch-off and on.  There is not a switch to go from US voltage to European voltage.  You will need to purchase a converter with adapters to use it outside the US.  I have purchased many items from Amazon over the years, and this is the first time I ever had to return an item.  Disappointing, but the return is free and the customer service rep was very nice and helpful.  Am on the hunt for a true dual-voltage flat iron!</li>
    <li> I just tried it a couple of times and it seems to work on my fine hair. It heats up pretty quickly. I order the white color and love it. It comes with a sleek white cover too, though mine comes with a red stain on it (but its not a big deal).</li>
    <li> Purchased this flat iron to take on a trip to Singapore. It worked really well and the size made it nice for traveling. It seemed to heat up very quickly too, but there is no temperature control.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling; easy to work with . Could also be a great gift.My wife is a hairstylist and she has recommended it to her clients.</li>
    <li> Perfect fir traveling and just small touch ups. The case worked perfect to be able to pack it up while still warm</li>
    <li> This item (White Turboion Baby Croc) arrived from Amazon today.  It was purchased through Discounts Jungle.  This was purchased specifically for use while in Spain so we needed something compact and dual-voltage capable.  The description on Amazon as well as the description card included state that it is dual-voltage capable.  However the label on the actual iron states 100-120V only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the manufacturer directly and they stated that any seller on Amazon is not a licensed/authorized re-seller of their products.  They also told me that as long as long as the iron is legit (not a knockoff) then it for sure is dual-voltage capable.  I was told the label is a known issue with being incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We leave in 2 days so no time to return and get a replacement before we leave.  Guess we will take it with us and try it out.  Will update review upon our return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 2013.07 - In Spain now and it works like a champ here.  It does take longer to heat up, but there are no issues at all with 240 volts even though the iron itself has a 120 volt label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 2014.06 - Still used daily in the US.  Works great for shorter hair.  Never had any issues with low heat.  Actually purchasing a 2nd one to leave one at home and one in the travel bags.</li>
    <li> This worked great for travel, small and compact f or a carry on bag...and it does a good job on the hair too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a trip to Germany. It worked ok in the hotel, I did not experience any electrical issues.&lt;br /&gt;I was however disapointed in the performance. It is a SMALL Travel Iron - and it took a great deal of time to straighten my thick coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I not needed the dual voltage for my international trip I would have returned.</li>
    <li> Love this item....comes in a very nice travel case and the size is perfect for travel...also does a good job!</li>
    <li> Took this to Europe and it worked wonderfully.  Light and small.  The heat-proof case was great, you could unplug it and wrap it right away.</li>
