      <li>but my daughter love it.</li>
      <li>On time deliver , looked every where for this item and it is exactly what I wanted, and with a good deal</li>
      <li>Works great on her hair which is straight with fine to medium texture.</li>
      <li>There are no heat settings, but again, for my limited needs, this is perfect.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this to give my thinning fine hair some more body at the root.  </li>
      <li>Did a great job for my 12 year old</li>
      <li>If you are looking to crimp a lot of hair, this may not be the best as it will take a while due to size.  </li>
      <li>:) it turned out to be a great christmas present for my teenager.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and lightweight.</li>
      <li>Crimps beautifully, and is easy for a younger girl to handle.  </li>
      <li>But if you are looking to do fine strips of hair, pattern or just go funky..</li>
      <li>Seems to work fine.  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s super cute and portable.</li>
      <li>Quick heat up!</li>
      <li>It makes an easy fun hair do.</li>
      <li>it takes longer to do a full head of hair.</li>
      <li>Crimps my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s hair pretty good</li>
      <li>but it makes her hair super frizzy and it would take for ever doing it.</li>
      <li>Heats up super quickly.</li>
      <li>It does the job..heats up quickly..</li>
      <li>Quick</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Very easy for our 8 year old to use.</li>
      <li>I burnt my finger a bit but will use a comb now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets very hot.</li>
      <li>and it gets very very hot</li>
      <li>However, I found that it is very lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Does require supervision as this iron gets HOT!  </li>
      <li>The heat goes right through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also heats up very fast.  </li>
      <li>you are looking to crimp a lot of hair, I suggest the Hot Tools Micro 1&amp;#34; Crimper also sold here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Was exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>But works very well!</li>
      <li>I hide the crimp marks by only crimping all around my head, but 1 layer under (I separate the top layer and move it away w/ a clip and crimp the next layer under - a lovely trick from my hair person).  </li>
      <li>So they need to show a better picture so you can see te actually size.</li>
      <li>and I recommend to buy something bigger with better reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
      <li>&quot; long, takes forever to crimp a whole head of hair, but it would work nicely for chunky crimping or traveling.</li>
      <li>My actual rating for this id 4.5 stars :)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Maybe for someone with coarser hair it would hold better, but be aware that the crimping plates are not deep enough to make much of a visible crimp even if your hair will easily hold an imprint.</li>
      <li>Works good in my hair, heats up in like 1 minute and just small but something i recommend someone to get.</li>
      <li>It works okay, but would work better if it made crimps a little larger.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use this crimper much because I feel like it is very damaging to my hair</li>
      <li>Works really well.  </li>
      <li>Crimps real</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t for someone who is looking to do their whole head.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34; are very frizzy and unbalanced.</li>
      <li>This crimps the hair really well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a MINI crimper, but it works great for younger girls who are just starting to style their hair.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a tool to do your whole head, this is not the product for you.</li>
      <li>It takes too much time and the crimp does not show up well.</li>
      <li>works ok for my 8 year old, but was A LOT smaller than I realized.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was exactly what I needed. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for any dancer who needs to do touchups or for any trip.</li>
    <li> It does the job..heats up quickly..</li>
    <li> This crimps the hair really well. The only thing is that I expected it to be a little bit bigger. Since it is mini it takes longer to do a full head of hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!  Great price, too</li>
    <li> The size is very small and light weight for traveling.  The heat is perfect for quick crimping and it heats up very quickly.  The only thing I have to complain about this crimper is that the upraised part of the crimper is not big/high enough, so after your hair is done, you don&#x27;t really see that much of a distinct wave.  Your hair will look a little frized out with little tiny indentations.  Other than that, I liked the product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The crimped was very tiny. So they need to show a better picture so you can see te actually size.😒</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. I have short hair and use it for volume. It does the job well and it&#x27;s super cute and portable. The only this in that the tab tip, you can hold on to it to clamp the hair without burning the crap out of your fingers. And there&#x27;s only one heat setting.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it and I don&#x27;t recommend it. It would not crimp my hair at all. I was going for a 80&#x27;s look for Halloween and it&lt;br /&gt;was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s larger than I expected as far as crimping.  It works and everything, but I was looking for a micro crimper.  This is not micro.</li>
    <li> I bought this to take to Italy because I didn&#x27;t want to risk frying my good mini crimper. I use my good one to crimp at the roots for volume under a layer of hair so that the crimped part (which remains unseen) lifts my hair away from my head. It&#x27;s a great trick for those of us who need volume for our fine hair. I didn&#x27;t take into account that while my volume crimper has deep tight ridges which distinctly crimp the roots into a stiff section capable of holding the top layers away from my head, this little crimper has wider set and much more shallow ridges. They aren&#x27;t even deep enough to make a distinct crimp - they just make a vague little wave. If I was actually trying to visibly crimp my hair I would still be disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t really even do that, at least not to my smooth, fine hair. This was basically useless to me. Maybe for someone with coarser hair it would hold better, but be aware that the crimping plates are not deep enough to make much of a visible crimp even if your hair will easily hold an imprint.</li>
    <li> I had excellent service and received the product very quickly. I did not expect it to be as small as it was but that was my fault the dimensions were there. None the less I still love it and it does what it is intended to do.</li>
    <li> Too small for my thick hair</li>
    <li> Works as it&#x27;s suppose to. It was a gift for my daughter, who begged for one, and she seems to like it.</li>
    <li> Was a great purchase! Good for fine haired people.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> They gave me a difficult time with this crap. The owner forgot to put my apartment number....</li>
    <li> Works really well.  But very small iron takes an hour to crimp my whole head. But works very well!</li>
    <li> My actual rating for this id 4.5 stars :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my limited needs (I just want to add volume to the crown of my head), this works GREAT!  I hide the crimp marks by only crimping all around my head, but 1 layer under (I separate the top layer and move it away w/ a clip and crimp the next layer under - a lovely trick from my hair person).  This tool is small enough to get right up to my scalp which is where I want to crimp for volume.  I have never burned my fingers turning on/off, but I am careful.  This thing is small, so keep that in mind.  If you are looking to crimp a lot of hair, this may not be the best as it will take a while due to size.  I, however, love it!  It also heats up very fast.  There are no heat settings, but again, for my limited needs, this is perfect.  My ONLY complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a swivel cord, so making it stay standing w/ bottom down as shown in pic is tricky - this thing always wants to flop over on its side and I&#x27;m afraid it will leave burn marks since the plates go right up to the edge.  But for the price - I can deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to crimp a lot of hair, I suggest the Hot Tools Micro 1&amp;#34; Crimper also sold here on Amazon.  That does have heat settings and a swivel cord and is much larger than this one.  I tried that one first and while it is very nice (see my review), it wasn&#x27;t small enough for my needs - I couldn&#x27;t get it as close to my scalp as this on</li>
    <li> Too small did not crimp hair at all. Purchased and would have returned but my daughter threw away the box.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t for someone who is looking to do their whole head. The &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34; are very frizzy and unbalanced. The crimper itself is very tiny and I had to return it. I expected it to be a little bit bigger in size and to crimp neater then it actually was. Overall was not a great crimper and I recommend to buy something bigger with better reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Works well for small children but not for young adults and older.</li>
    <li> Love this little hair crimper! I usually crimp little protions of hair and it looks really cool! It makes an easy fun hair do.</li>
    <li> Little small but my daughter love it.</li>
    <li> Works good in my hair, heats up in like 1 minute and just small but something i recommend someone to get.</li>
    <li> Very easy for our 8 year old to use.</li>
    <li> It is definitely not meant for thick or long hair! It takes too much time and the crimp does not show up well.</li>
    <li> Received this item in a package that actually looked like it was opened and taped back together . NOW I know why. My daughter opened it for Christmas and plugged it in and we got nothing! Totally broken. I can only assume now that by the way the package looked that someone else bought this repacked and taped it and sent it back. Lucky me they sold me a broken item. So I retaped it and now the day after Christmas it is waiting outside to be picked up and sent back to wherever it came from. I should have known immediately but I guess I was too trusting.</li>
    <li> Did not work coming out of the box. I am getting a replacement. I hope to update this review with a better one. UPDATE: Have gone through 3 of these things. All failed within 3 months.</li>
    <li> Works great for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Used this for an 80&#x27;s prom party! Worked perfect!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect styling tool to crimp your hair with, It works really fast and its so cute. The only problem is that I feel it&#x27;s a little too small. I understand its travel size but its smaller than a 12 inch ruler. I would probably only take it with me on vacation but I would get the standard size just to have something that is actually easier to use in terms of time management. Other than that, I have no problem with it.</li>
    <li> Works just as it should! Quick heat up!</li>
    <li> This is unreal how small this guy is. I gave it two stars cause it was ok for my daughters head but the crimps were so small you couldn&#x27;t tell what they were.</li>
    <li> But because of the size, it takes longer to do my daughter&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;I think I would buy a bigger one If I ever get another one of these</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought but works great!</li>
    <li> Very small. But it did the trick for an 80&#x27;s party.</li>
    <li> Grand kids love this...they do their hair before they go to school. Quick</li>
    <li> Perfect for creating texture to hair! Small &amp;#34;Crimp&amp;#34; plate that is easy to match and not get those old gaps (1980&#x27;s!). If you are looking for a tool to do your whole head, this is not the product for you. But if you are looking to do fine strips of hair, pattern or just go funky.. You need this!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to give my thinning fine hair some more body at the root.  I saw another kind of &amp;#34;crimper&amp;#34; advertised on a home shopping channet and they wanted like $100 for a &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; crimper.  So, I thought - let me check out Amazon, see what they have.  This mini crimper is perfect to crimp the under layer root at the top of the head to give the hair some life/body.  Who would have thought?! :)</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine.  Crimps my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s hair pretty good and she has thin pin straight hair.</li>
    <li> Did a great job for my 12 year old</li>
    <li> Though it&#x27;s a mini I was honestly surprised by just how small it was but it works great and I love it&#x27;s portability!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas.  When I saw it&#x27;s size I was very skeptical. However, I found that it is very lightweight and easy to use.  It gets super hot super fast and takes only a few minutes to crimp a handful of sections of hair.  I don&#x27;t think this was designed to crimp all of your hair, just for adding some texture.  Works great on her hair which is straight with fine to medium texture.</li>
    <li> Was not expecting it to be this small. I know that it said 1 inch, but I thought that was the plate, this would only work on someone with really short hair or a kid with short hair</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 11 year old niece. Works perfect. Crimps real nice.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and lightweight. She loves it! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 1st grade daughter who tried a friends crimper and wanted one.  Couldn&#x27;t find one locally so, of course, tried Amazon.  Awesome iron.  Crimps beautifully, and is easy for a younger girl to handle.  Does require supervision as this iron gets HOT!  All in all, great crimper.</li>
    <li> When they say \\&quot;mini\\&quot;, they really mean MINI! It is only about 1\\&quot; wide by 2\\&quot; long, takes forever to crimp a whole head of hair, but it would work nicely for chunky crimping or traveling.</li>
    <li> This works great for adding volume to your hair. Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, hold the heat fast and makes you look like you stepped out of an 80&#x27;s music video in just a few minutes. What&#x27;s not to love?!?</li>
    <li> I use the crimper to just crimp my roots to add volume and it works great for that.  It&#x27;s smaller than I imagined it would be and wish I would have gotten the 2 inch, but maybe next time.  Seems like a well made product.</li>
    <li> On time deliver , looked every where for this item and it is exactly what I wanted, and with a good deal</li>
    <li> I have bought three of these so far for my salon. One of them stopped working the same day we had gotten it.</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself and another one for a friend.  Love using it to give my hair more volume around the crown.  Heats up super quickly.</li>
    <li> The on off switch is in a awkward place. When I ordered it I didn&#x27;t think to get one that makes bigger crimps. This makes small but noticeable crimps. Also its a great size for travel. I will be ordering one that makes bigger crimps.</li>
    <li> I use this to give my hair fullness since I&#x27;ve been losing hair from steroid injections. It works okay, but would work better if it made crimps a little larger.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. the crimper works amazing....now we can 80&#x27;s hair again. :) it turned out to be a great christmas present for my teenager.</li>
    <li> Got it for my 12 yr old. Its perfect. Smaller then it looks but works great. Especially for a beginner.</li>
    <li> I bought this crimper to use at the roots of my hair for volume and it works great!  I am a hairdresser and am going to get a second one for work because it does such a fantastic job.</li>
    <li> So I know it says mini but I didn&#x27;t realize it was pocket size!!!!!!! I thought the crimper iron part size was just smaller. I really wish I would have spent the $10 more to get the larger one. It does an ok job crimping but it makes her hair super frizzy and it would take for ever doing it.</li>
    <li> This is for doing just your roots to add body to your hair. It does a good job of it. The crimp is not shallow enough it is easy to hide on the underneath.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the on off switch wasn&#x27;t on the inside. I burnt my finger a bit but will use a comb now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets very hot. There are places at the end to close it together tighter cause you can&#x27;t touch the other sides of the plates. The heat goes right through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do your ends it does look like a feather. It&#x27;s kind of nice if you want to punk out your hair in a 90s hairdo.</li>
    <li> I was expecting them to be a little bigger then what they are.</li>
    <li> works ok for my 8 year old, but was A LOT smaller than I realized.  If I had bought it for me I don&#x27;t think I would have been to happy...it would take forever to do my head of hair.</li>
    <li> Great service and product, thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this crimper much because I feel like it is very damaging to my hair and it gets very very hot and you can feel it through the plastic handle when you crimp a piece of hair. It does work well for small sections though.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my cousin&#x27;s daughter, and she LOVED IT.  It&#x27;s definitely a MINI crimper, but it works great for younger girls who are just starting to style their hair. She tried it out right after opening it, and it crimped very nicely! Works great!</li>
