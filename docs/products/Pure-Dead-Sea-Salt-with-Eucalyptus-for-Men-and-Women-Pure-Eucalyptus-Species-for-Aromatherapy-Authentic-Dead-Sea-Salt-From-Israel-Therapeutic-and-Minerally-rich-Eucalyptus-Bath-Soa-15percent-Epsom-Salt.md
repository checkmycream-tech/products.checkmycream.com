    <li> I love the pure essential oils used in these bath salts. This is the only bath salt I found on Amazon without artificial smells, chemicals or dyes added. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Not surprisingly, there is no mention of the size I could find anywhere in the description of the item.  Only if you enlarge the pic and look at the tiniest numbers at the left corner would you get this essential piece of info. 15% Epsom salt. What is &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34; in that Dead sea salt? It is a purely overpriced item with important info omitted. Otherwise, there is nothing wrong with this item. It smells nice and dissolves without trace.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it! Am ordering more.</li>
    <li> I misread quantity - I got 2 cups instead of 2 liters. Much too small an amount for the price. Nice product though if you&#x27;re not on a budget.</li>
    <li> I am an avid, competitive runner plagued with aches and pains in my feet and joints from running. I recently discovered these sea salts and love them!

    <li> It&#x27;s hard to keep up with my 12 year-old daughter.  I&#x27;m in my late forties and we ride ponies together!  I can&#x27;t say how wonderfully refreshing it is to take a long soak in these bath salts after riding.  I feel new.  I feel like I have been honeyed-up and am minty-fresh.  My feet love it especially.  I open the bathroom door so the smells wafts into the rest of the house....just for a minute we are in a pine forest!!</li>
    <li> Really smells great Definitely eucalyptus not the fake smell some products have Refreshing</li>
    <li> Nice smell, does not last long though.</li>

    <li> Epsom salts are known for their cleansing and detoxifying effects. When I used this salt it filled all the bathroom with the smell of the forest (be careful if you don&#x27;t like pine smells), plus it has dead sea salts that literally bring me somewhere on the Mediterranean beaches. Skin feels amazing afterwards, but don&#x27;t stay too long in the bath as your body might absorb an excessive dose of magnesium</li>
    <li> Eucalyptus smells wonderful and has many benefits. Once I put this in my bath, it helped me relax instantly. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So, I received this in the mail today. And, before I even opened the package, I could smell the fresh ingredients emanating from the package. I already fell in love with the Eucalyptus soak. Not only will I use this as a bath soak for soar aches and tired muscles, but this will be my go to for any time I feel a cold coming on. This will definitely open and revive your senses, especially is you have a stuffy nose. The ingredients are pure, as well. Thanks Maple Holistics!</li>

    <li> Wrong product came. Never did receive the salts.</li>
    <li> I read some review and many people&#x27;s lives it.. I request some products and I can&#x27;t wait try this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a believer in essential oils therapeutic properties and have often used them successfully to provide comfort or lessen my pain.
