      <li>It has a nice lightweight gel consistency which I thought would be suitable for daytime use</li>
      <li>This is by far the best product I have found to treat acne breakouts.  </li>
      <li>This is working wonderfully to help clear up my DD&#x27;s skin.  </li>
      <li>Ok lotion for acne, doesn&#x27;t clog pore or make face oily/greasy.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin, which is mostly oily.</li>
      <li>It gave me more acne than it took away.</li>
      <li>Okay I&#x27;ve bumped this up to 5 stars</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>my skin is doing so much better since I&#x27;ve used this and</li>
      <li>Also getting more pimples.</li>
      <li>I see a difference more and more each day.</li>
      <li>my skin tone is blended and looks much better now</li>
      <li>and I use this as well as the YTT moisturizer which I actually really really love</li>
      <li>I love to wear this after washing my face.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer itself is ok</li>
      <li>The solution is moist enough to act as a moisturizer, but not oily, which is perfect for oil prone skin types.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>if you want a quick acne fix, this will be good but do not apply to whole face.</li>
      <li>I tried to place on a light moisturizer over it like it says on the directions</li>
      <li>When I bought it at first, I didn&#x27;t know for sure if it would be moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Mose def worth the try!</li>
      <li>It soothes my skin and for someone that&#x27;s oily, it feels clean.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get oily during the day anymore, and is super smooth.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering at all-I actually find it pleasant.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not totally clear, but it&#x27;s under control and better than ever! :)</li>
      <li>This product really isn&#x27;t a lotion but more a serum.</li>
      <li>I find that with my oily skin, more than once a day would be too much moisture.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s good for that purpose only.</li>
      <li>It is very runny and does not sink into your skin, rather it just sits on top, making your face feel sticky and leathery.</li>
      <li>Super drying and</li>
      <li>, it doesn&#x27;t look pretty during the day)!</li>
      <li>I bought the Yes to Tomatoes products as a healthier answer to the standard off-the-shelf acne products, most being full of harmful chemicals.  </li>
      <li>is a great product for upper chest / back area if you have issues in the summer with pimples there.  </li>
      <li>First ingredient is aloe juice then pomegranate juice extract..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since stopped using this stuff when I first notice the break outs months and months ago</li>
      <li>I love this product and am on my 3rd bottle.  </li>
      <li>:) I totally recommend this acne lotion to anyone with acne...</li>
      <li>so I actually had to go to my doctor and get over the counter prescription for it, and it worked like magic</li>
      <li>But if you want a good gentle cleanser from YTT I recommend the daily cleanser, it&#x27;s in a white tube, cleans really well and is super gentle, that and the YTT balancing moisturizer are keepers!</li>
      <li>I will update this review as I continue to use this and if I see positive results I will change my review.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s gentle enough and feels good overall.</li>
      <li>I feel as though the cleanser and moisturiser are effective enough on their own, but this definitely helps calm my skin down.</li>
      <li>My face seems to like the product used sparingly, I still do get the occasional pimple, but it goes away very quick.</li>
      <li>The Yes to Tomatoes Scrub is good, but too costly for how long (or how short) it lasts.</li>
      <li>but I put way too much of the undiluted pure tea tree oil on my face (sort of abused it)</li>
      <li>I used to put a pump of this on my whole face and then 2 pumps of the YTT moisturizer to combat the drying qualities of this.</li>
      <li>and my teenagers seem to really like these.  </li>
      <li>and I will not stop using this.. really just overwhelmed by the results.</li>
      <li>As a whole, I like this product line.</li>
      <li>so much that I put this on every chance</li>
      <li>my whole life and proactiv and two treatments of accutane couldn&#x27;t cure it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really torn with this product.</li>
      <li>I have never had an acne issue in 25 years like I do now, thanks to a medicine I&#x27;m on.</li>
      <li>To Cucumbers gentle milk cleanser have worked MIRACLES for my acne.  </li>
      <li>My skin is so much brighter, healthier</li>
      <li>it has been a very well-spent investment.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dries fast once rubbed in then</li>
      <li>that I know- is put it on for about an hour (over my whole face).  </li>
      <li>The only downside is that none of their stuff is completely natural, but is still better than the big brand out there full of cancer causing chemicals.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure if I were to get the yesto face wash and replace my lengthy morning regimen, it would be further minimized... definitely recommend trying this brand</li>
      <li>but I just get even more of a sticky mess on my face.</li>
      <li>First off, let me just say, I don&#x27;t have really dry skin unless its middle of winter, and even then, my forehead tends to get a little oily, so maybe that is why this lotion works so great for me.  </li>
      <li>My face is so clear now!!</li>
      <li>She has actually pretty much always had a constant presence of acne in those areas until now.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m new to this line as I said</li>
      <li>The Yes to products have ingredients I can live with</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to this line</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s like this tacky serum that is dry but super shiny</li>
      <li>Completely cleared up my acne!</li>
      <li>however, if you have health insurance and you can have your doctor check it out, always go to him first and then buy commercial stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap stuff to pro active!</li>
      <li>At least I&#x27;m constantly being told one of them needs more of something!</li>
      <li>let me make this abundantly clear.</li>
      <li>and it looks like you have a clear polish on your face that you could peel off.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really provide enough moisture for my skin.</li>
      <li>so if you have sensitive skin please don&#x27;t buy this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have combination skin, which is mostly oily. I also do get pimples here and there, but nothing real serious. As a whole, I like this product line. With this product, I actually use it after one of the Yes to Tomatoes cleansers every other night, opposite the daily moisturizer. I find that with my oily skin, more than once a day would be too much moisture. I use it sparingly when I do, since too much, especially on the forehead, makes it feel oily. My face seems to like the product used sparingly, I still do get the occasional pimple, but it goes away very quick. I don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering at all-I actually find it pleasant. As of today, I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This line didn&#x27;t work for me (combo skin, acne prone) and didnt relieve any redness. The moisturizer itself is ok but I&#x27;m dying to use it up, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad they changed the title of this as it was very confusing when it was being called a lotion, since it&#x27;s not a lotion. I believe this stuff works well and unlike the gel acne treatment from this line, it is not sticky and is a lot lighter. I use this with my yes to tomatoes moisturizer and I feel wonderful. The only downside is that none of their stuff is completely natural, but is still better than the big brand out there full of cancer causing chemicals.</li>
    <li> It did not help with my acne at all! It stings my acne too! When it drys it flakes and makes my skin feel tight!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really torn with this product. I like the fact that it does have salicylic acid and tomato. Both are great ingredients for acne prone skin, however, this isn&#x27;t a lotion at all. It is very runny and does not sink into your skin, rather it just sits on top, making your face feel sticky and leathery. And after awhile my face looks shiny and oily. This product really isn&#x27;t a lotion but more a serum. I tried to place on a light moisturizer over it like it says on the directions but I just get even more of a sticky mess on my face.</li>
    <li> This turned my face into a commercial-grade oil field. My skin feels heavy and greasy, like it&#x27;s perpetually melting off. Also getting more pimples. Don&#x27;t even try wearing over makeup - it just oozes right off.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I was using other products that weren&#x27;t natural and really harsh on my skin. Even though I didn&#x27;t have a bad acne problem, I did get pimples every now and then, mostly a hormonal thing. But once I began using this product, that changed. I no longer got the occasional pimple and my face felt a lot smoother. But the best thing about this product is I no longer got the skin rashes and burns I would get from other products. I also use Yes To Tomatoes Daily Balancing Moisturizer along with this product to keep my face from feeling dry, since it tends to dry out the face...or at least it does to mine.</li>
    <li> Tends to dry the area a little bit. But it&#x27;s gentle enough and feels good overall. You would need a sunblock at daytime.</li>
    <li> This is working wonderfully to help clear up my DD&#x27;s skin.  She is also using the YTT Clear Skin Deep Pore Scrub &amp; moisturizer.  She loves them all &amp; we are VERY impressed the difference it has made.  I put off buying yet another product line because I felt it was just false hope for her &amp; wouldn&#x27;t be any better than the YTCucumbers cleanser &amp; milk of magnesia, but I was wrong!  Now I am so happy I bought it &amp; wish I&#x27;d have bought it sooner.  She doesn&#x27;t get the big cystic pimples/ acne, but gets a lot of smaller ones (clusters) along her hair line, the sides of her face, &amp; forehead pretty regularly.  She has actually pretty much always had a constant presence of acne in those areas until now.  She still uses MOM sometimes, but not the every other night like she used to.  I am VERY impressed &amp; so grateful!!</li>
    <li> This is my must have product.  I think if they ever stop making it I&#x27;ll cry!  I use it underneath my tinted moisturizer in the morning every day.  It soothes my skin and for someone that&#x27;s oily, it feels clean.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product I have found to treat acne breakouts.  The solution is moist enough to act as a moisturizer, but not oily, which is perfect for oil prone skin types.  I cannot recommend this product enough.  If you want clearer skin, then buy this product now!!</li>
    <li> I have fair acne prone skin, everything makes me break out! However I did my research &amp; now use this as my daily moisturizer for both night &amp; day! My face would shine up within an hour of applying my makeup. This product keeps my face from getting shiny &amp; yet still maintains it moisturized! I depend on this product &amp; absolutely LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have purchased many products and taken him to the doctor too!  I use some of this company&#x27;s stuff myself and saw the Yes to Tomatoes product on Subscribe and Save. I believe this is the most effective acne product he has used! It is a permanent item on my list now!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this online, but at Target because I had a coupon. I am so glad I did. I was using simple face wash alternating with the apricot scrub each morning. After that I was using a  blackhead clearing scrub every day. I have never had an acne issue in 25 years like I do now, thanks to a medicine I&#x27;m on. What I was doing wasn&#x27;t working. I added this to my post shower regimen. At night I use the yesto tomatoes towelettes (also with coupon lol) then follow that up with this. It hasn&#x27;t even been a week and my acne is disappearing! I still get the little red bumps but they stay little instead of blowing up into massive whiteheads overnight. I&#x27;m pretty sure if I were to get the yesto face wash and replace my lengthy morning regimen, it would be further minimized... definitely recommend trying this brand</li>
    <li> It was awful. I never should&#x27;ve purchased this stuff. It gave me more acne than it took away. I&#x27;ve since stopped using this stuff when I first notice the break outs months and months ago but but I&#x27;m just now letting the tomatoes out of the bag. Don&#x27;t waste your money at all. What help me with my acne was good ole Prime Rose Oil and Salmon Oil pills.</li>
    <li> This is both a daily acne treatment and a moisturizing lotion. When I bought it at first, I didn&#x27;t know for sure if it would be moisturizing. But now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few months, I can say YES, not only does it help keep my skin clear from breakouts and dirty pores, but it also keeps my skin from drying out. Now if only I can find an affordable daily scrub! The Yes to Tomatoes Scrub is good, but too costly for how long (or how short) it lasts. This lotion, on the other hand, needs only a drop to cover my whole face and it is lasting forever. A great value for a great product. Thank you Yes To Tomatoes for making an affordable, chemical-free, anti-acne moisturizing lotion!!</li>
    <li> The smell is awful, I use just a little or it doesn&#x27;t absorb you just end up with gunk allll over your face</li>
    <li> I have been using it for sometime, its too flaky and no improvements on my skin. You cant put it on during the day.Please consider buying a cheaper product.</li>
    <li> it dries up the acne spots, however, the places you put this on will flake. if you want a quick acne fix, this will be good but do not apply to whole face. i use it to spot treat and it&#x27;s good for that purpose only.</li>
    <li> I see a difference more and more each day. I only use this at night after using the Yes To Tomatoes Clear Skin Deep Pore Scrub and then I use the daily moisturizer, I do this so my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out. My skin is so much brighter, healthier and I see a change in my acne scars. It&#x27;s not an overnight fix, but everyday my skin gets clearer.</li>
    <li> this worked well for about 3 weeks and then I started breaking out again. Acne.org cured my problem cystic acne that i have had all my life.age 59 ! can you believe i still suffered from acne. Cured at last w Acne.org</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily acne prone skin and this stuff has given me results. My skin is not completely clear but it is much clearer. I use with yes to tomatoes mask once a week and an acne cleanser and moisturizer. Finally found a skincare routine that&#x27;s working for me and I would say this is the key part of it!</li>
    <li> I use this sporadically when my skin needs it (which unfortunately has been every day since I bought it!) I feel as though the cleanser and moisturiser are effective enough on their own, but this definitely helps calm my skin down. I just use it at night to help repair my skin whilst I sleep. Worth a try, but prefer other items in the range.</li>
    <li> I love to wear this after washing my face. Especially after getting my eyebrows threaded. I usually breakout after threading but this baby works paired up with yes to cucumbers face wipes. I haven&#x27;t seen a single pimple! Totally recommend it! The smell is a bit bitter but I put on the Yes to carrots lotion to moisturize my face which smells delicious and is not oily!</li>
    <li> This stuff is magical and wonderful! I used to have really, really, really bad acne problems, I tried just about everything in the market but nothing seemed to do the job, so I actually had to go to my doctor and get over the counter prescription for it, and it worked like magic, however, it was a little pricey and when I no longer had health insurance, I was in trouble. So, long story short, i read a lot of reviews on Yes to Tomatoes! and decided to give it a try, and I just have to say, it has been a very well-spent investment. This stuff works just like my prescription did, it takes a little longer than my prescription for it to take effect but it works! The wait is worthwhile! :) I totally recommend this acne lotion to anyone with acne...however, if you have health insurance and you can have your doctor check it out, always go to him first and then buy commercial stuff.</li>
    <li> First off, let me just say, I don&#x27;t have really dry skin unless its middle of winter, and even then, my forehead tends to get a little oily, so maybe that is why this lotion works so great for me.  It doesn&#x27;t get oily during the day anymore, and is super smooth.  I got it to reduce breakouts, and started using apricot scrub a couple weeks before getting this lotion, and together, not only have my outbreaks almost stopped, but blemishes I had gotten used to (I thought were permanant) are fading, and almost gone now after two weeks of use.  If I do get a small white/black head, it comes right out, and red spot is basically gone the next day, so no more weeks with the same zit!  Awesome.  I also use it on my skin after waxing, and on my arms to reduce spots, and it is Amazing.  Writing the review as I buy more, so I will have a spare... and will never run out!  I need more!</li>
    <li> Completely cleared up my acne! In all fairness, I didn&#x27;t have very bad acne to begin with, but I haven&#x27;t had a pimple since I started using this.</li>
    <li> Ok lotion for acne, doesn&#x27;t clog pore or make face oily/greasy. Doesn&#x27;t really provide enough moisture for my skin. After several days of using it, my face began to dry out and I would have to apply a different lotion. Discontinued using it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Yes to Tomatoes products as a healthier answer to the standard off-the-shelf acne products, most being full of harmful chemicals.  The Yes to products have ingredients I can live with and my teenagers seem to really like these.  At least I&#x27;m constantly being told one of them needs more of something! Tried other less harmful alternatives but they didn&#x27;t like them.</li>
    <li> Well, it definitely dries up my blemishes. It has a nice lightweight gel consistency which I thought would be suitable for daytime use BUT it leaves your skin PEELING so I would only use it at night as a spot treatment. The scent of this product is strange but not strong, it smells like their tomato body gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it for spot treating when I have severe acne but I would not use it everyday since it causes my skin to peel (and girl, it doesn&#x27;t look pretty during the day)!</li>
    <li> This along with the moisturizer are the only things that work for my face. They dry up my blemishes without drying me out.</li>
    <li> Helps keep my sons acne under control</li>
    <li> UDATED REVIEW 3/4/2015 Okay I&#x27;ve bumped this up to 5 stars seriously just give it a try.. my skin is doing so much better since I&#x27;ve used this and all irritation that I once had when I started using this product is gone.. this seriously repairs your skin especially acne scars(!!!!!!!!).. my skin tone is blended and looks much better now and I will not stop using this.. really just overwhelmed by the results. so much that I put this on every chance I get like 3 times a day. wish i had a before and after!   Really weird stuff.. First ingredient is aloe juice then pomegranate juice extract.. I&#x27;m new to this line and I use this as well as the YTT moisturizer which I actually really really love but I digress..  I have uncontrollable combination skin with a mind of its own and I only know that sugar makes it worse as bacteria thrives off the sugar in our blood, which yields true for me every time I eat something sweet because I&#x27;m reminded the very next morning. Anyway, I&#x27;m new to this line as I said but this product is no moisturizer AT ALL let me make this abundantly clear. My skin is not sensitive at all, like in no way shape or form and I&#x27;m not allergic to anything. That said, this daily repair lotion #1 dries your skin out BAD and I&#x27;m talking like Sahara desert dry. It&#x27;s dries fast once rubbed in then it&#x27;s like this tacky serum that is dry but super shiny and it looks like you have a clear polish on your face that you could peel off. Super drying and I have oily skin.. I used to put a pump of this on my whole face and then 2 pumps of the YTT moisturizer to combat the drying qualities of this. This has not repaired my skin at all and actually burns sometimes when I put it on so if you have sensitive skin please don&#x27;t buy this. But if you want a good gentle cleanser from YTT I recommend the daily cleanser, it&#x27;s in a white tube, cleans really well and is super gentle, that and the YTT balancing moisturizer are keepers! This is a disaster and I recently damaged my skin with tea tree oil because it&#x27;s the only thing that stops my acne (seriously if you&#x27;ve never used pure tea tree oil and you have acne your prayers will be answered it&#x27;s a gift from god tbh) but I put way too much of the undiluted pure tea tree oil on my face (sort of abused it) and it dried my skin so severely to where I think I permanently damaged my skin and that&#x27;s what drew me to this product and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m vehemently saying not to use it if your sensitive to dryness and harsh tendencies of products. 3 stars  because it&#x27;s not the products fault it didn&#x27;t work on me I just have the skin from hell. I will update this review as I continue to use this and if I see positive results I will change my review.</li>
    <li> This lotion clears my skin in a matter of days.  It tightens my pores and evens out my skin tone.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product and am on my 3rd bottle.  I have had terrible acne my whole life and proactiv and two treatments of accutane couldn&#x27;t cure it.  This product used at night with the Yes To Cucumbers gentle milk cleanser have worked MIRACLES for my acne.  I&#x27;m not totally clear, but it&#x27;s under control and better than ever! :)</li>
    <li> I never had breakouts then around 21 years old I got major acne! I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap stuff to pro active! Nothing worked until I started the yes to tomatoes line!! AMAZING STUFF!! My face is so clear now!! Mose def worth the try! I use the Mask, Repairing Lotion, and Spot Stick!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a couple months now and seems to be working well on my skin. It&#x27;s not watery at all so I&#x27;m not sure what the other reviewer is talking about. I also wear it under makeup and have no problem with making my skin feeling oily. I still get breakouts so that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
    <li> This product will dry your face to a flake, so use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;What I do -now that I know- is put it on for about an hour (over my whole face).  Then I wash it off and put a good moisturizer on.  If I leave it on any longer than that, it make my face flake for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for upper chest / back area if you have issues in the summer with pimples there.  Hope that helps.  Thank you.</li>
