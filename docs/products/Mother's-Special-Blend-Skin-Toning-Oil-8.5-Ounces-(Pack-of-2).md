<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have used throughout my entire 2nd trimester and now into my 3rd. No stretch marks yet (but I know this is a lot of genetic doings). It has a really mild scent, not an overpowering cocoa smell like some lotions. It&#x27;s also nice that you can put clothes on right away, and no grease on clothing. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Used this religiously while pregnant (and after) with 2 kids within 3 years...and no stretch marks here!</li>
    <li> Great used while I was pregnant and after helped keep me stretch mark free :)</li>
    <li> Feels great.  Long lasting moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended I get this, and so far I have not been disappointed. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $30 plus on the other creams with a ton of ingredients, when this seemed to be what the others had as their main ingredients anyways. I know they say nothing can prevent stretch marks, but so far I haven&#x27;t gotten any and I&#x27;m 34 weeks pregnant with twins. Regardless, it feels nice and moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even count how many bottles I&#x27;ve gone through.  I used this day and night from chest to toes.  You stay moisturized the entire day.  I can&#x27;t blame it on the product even though I got stretch marks on the last month of my pregnancy.  My baby decided to stretch me out too fast towards the last month and stretch marks are inevitable.  But this is a great product.</li>
    <li> My wife is pregnant and she love this stuff</li>
    <li> I used this thoughout my entire pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. While I don&#x27;t think it prevented them, I certainly thinked it helped to keep my skin hydrated. I added it to my bath water and applied it every morning and evening.</li>
    <li> Works great on my belly but tends to break out other areas of my body.  Otherwise very pleased and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I used this product all throughout my pregnancy. I loved it! It kept my belly moisturized, and I got absolutely no stretch marks! I will not go through another pregnancy without this!</li>
    <li> No stretch marks so far- and only five weeks to go! It keeps my skin moist and pliable, so hopefully no stretch marks when all is said and done.</li>
    <li> I was given my first bottle as a gift when I announced my pregnancy. I have been through 2 other bottles and am about to purchase a 3rd. It is wonderful. It&#x27;s not sticky and at 35 weeks pregnant I haven&#x27;t had any stretch marks yet!</li>
    <li> I used this religiously on my baby bump and chest area. I don&#x27;t really know if it prevented stretch marks but I certainly didn&#x27;t get any and it was very moisturizing. I also appreciated that it didn&#x27;t have a super strong cocoa smell.</li>
    <li> Definitely helps the itching that comes along with mid-later pregnancy.  Not sure it really does anything for stretch marks though...</li>
    <li> Have a two week old and no stretch marks!  My skin on my stomach looked great this entire pregnancy and my tattoo still looks good.  Definitely use again.  I am prone to stretch marks as I got them in college when I gained and lost the freshman 15+</li>
    <li> Great product! So far 20 pounds gained and no stretch marks, and helps with the itching of belly growth!</li>
    <li> I been using this oil since 4 weeks of pregnancy now I&#x27;m 24 weeks and so far I haven&#x27;t get any new strech mark hopelly I don&#x27;t get new ones with this pregnacy 🙏🙏🙏🙏</li>
    <li> This has been great. I am 32 weeks pregnant with my first baby and currently have no stretch marks. I put this on twice a day, morning and evening and rub in thoroughly. I have gone through two bottles already and might need a third before my baby comes. I do not mind this though because the product seems to be working! I did not give it 5 stars simply because I am not done with my pregnancy yet.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this actually prevents stretch marks, but it smells wonderful and is super moisturizing. It is pretty oily so you probably need to let it dry after putting it on.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle and couldn&#x27;t be happier I chose this product to use while I&#x27;m pregnant. Goes on smooth, no unpleasant odor. Will continue to use after my child arrives to prevent stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Started using it when I was pregnant with my first child. I continued to use it after and still do. It has a mild smell and absorbs very easy. Very simple ingredients, like that it is safe for baby and mama.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m at week 39, used this daily after every shower and used cocoa butter lotion at night, no stretch marks! I like the product because it is pretty much uncented and rubs in well so not too oily.</li>
    <li> Does a okay job with stretch marks just as anything else would.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I found out I was pregnant, and it&#x27;s the best thing ever!!! I&#x27;ll always use it!! :)    And now here we are on my second and so far so good! Love this stuff</li>
    <li> Great product, all natural, so they say. Before I got it was using coconut oil, does the same job.</li>
    <li> Years and years of buying this product. It is great for all uses...sunburn, dry skin, Pregnancy and post partum belly, baby skin,  makeup remover, massage, carrier oil for massage therapy, lubrication where needed :-D...etc. etc. etc.</li>
    <li> I do not love the smell, but that isn&#x27;t why I bought it. I do love the feel. Not a real believer in these kind of products actually helping to prevent stretch marks, but figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> I am loving this oil!  It feels wonderful putting it on my pregnant belly, it stops it from feeling itchy or dry and lasts way longer than lotion.  I plan on using this throughout my pregnancy and postpartum.  Would recommend to anyone who is expecting.  I even rub the excess on my hands and it keeps them feeling smooth all day.</li>
    <li> Smells good, moisturizes skin. Great for your gentleman&#x27;s sausage.</li>
    <li> Goes on very nicely and no smell! Have ordered several bottles already.</li>
    <li> My pregnant wife uses this and she&#x27;s been using it ever since she was 2 months pregnant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Touch wood until now she does not have 1 stretch mark&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts for a long time&lt;br /&gt;Use it immediately after showering and before bed</li>
    <li> I have used this belly oil for years, It&#x27;s wondering.  I am having baby number four and have no stretch marks but neither does my mother.  I love that the oil isn&#x27;t strong smelling so when you are nauseas in the beginning of pregnancy the smell doesn&#x27;t make me sick.Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I used Bio Oil in the beginning of my pregnancy and after a while i noticed some rush on my stomach so i bought this one instead. I am glad that i purchased this one because its not as greasy as usual oil, it penetrates skin very well, it has no harsh smell another thing that i love about it, and it leaves your skin very soft during all day. I put it twice daily, i had my baby and no stretch marks, nothing at all. my skin looks beautiful as it was before. I am do happy with this mother oil. Definitely recommend to everyone who is pregnant!</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels and doesn&#x27;t have a smell! In my third trimester and no stretch marks yet! I can see how this is great for when skin stretches and gets itchy! This will help!</li>
    <li> So far so good! I am only 24 weeks though. Super nourishing.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I use it every day. It has a nice smell and moisturizers well. Does not leave skin greasy.</li>
    <li> Smells weird, must be the cocoa butter? Almost like chocolate, but not in a good way. I&#x27;m using it anyway because I can&#x27;t stand to waste it, but won&#x27;t order again just based on the smell.  Otherwise, seems to hydrate skin nicely, but obviously it is oily since it is made of oils. For that reason, I only wear it at night under my PJs, or under clothes that I don&#x27;t mind getting a little stained (the oil scent is hard to wash out if you constantly wear this under your clothes.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be honest. Mother nature has a part to play when it comes to pregnancy stretch marks. However, I&#x27;ve been using this toning oil since the beginning of my pregnancy (even before I started to show) and it has been wonderful! I am entering my third trimester with twins, so I&#x27;ve grown quite a bit already. I haven&#x27;t seen a single stretch mark so far. I&#x27;m convinced that if I develop any stretch marks in my third trimester, then it&#x27;s going to happen no matter which product I use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest, the whole &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; consistency put me off at first, but I quickly realized that it had no effect on my clothing and actually does absorb quite well into my skin. I don&#x27;t even bother washing it off of my hands after, I just rub it in like a hand moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you&#x27;re wondering how often to use, I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day: after my shower in the morning and before I go to bed. Seems to be working so far!</li>
    <li> My wife ordered 2 or 3 for whole pregnancy, recommended to everyone. very useful and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will order more if required.</li>
    <li> I use it after showers .. IT STINKS SO BAD!! .. but I think it could work .. I still dont know.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I apply to my growing belly after I get out of the shower. It smells yummy too!</li>
    <li> Nice feeling oil! No streach marks!</li>
    <li> this was way too oily for me.It never seem to absorb into my skin and left stains on my clothes and bed sheet....I used it for about three days and then it went into garbage.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know this oil before but decided to give a try after reading a good review online. I use Mother&#x27;s Special Blend All Natural Skin Toning Oil daily before going to bed since I was 5 and a half months pregnant. The oil is organic and a bottle lasts around 4 months (what a bargain, I use it all over from my bust to my hips and back). I don&#x27;t love the smell (smells as vitamin E) and takes a few minutes to get absorbed (but a lot less than other oils I tried before). Right now I&#x27;m in my 35th week and haven&#x27;t got any new stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I must clarify that I&#x27;ve gotten excellent results (as for now, 0 new stretch marks, skin feels really smooth and stretchy).  But as I said before, I only use this oil during the night and in the mornings I use Nicci Marie Stretch Mark Cream (as it gets absorbed really quickly). I started both on the same day so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve could get the same results if I were using only one of them.&lt;br /&gt;For me, the Mother&#x27;s Special Blend All Natural Skin Toning Oil combined with the Nicci Marie Skincare it’s the perfect match. The cream can be a little bit pricey because (in my experience) it doesn&#x27;t last a whole month, but I really think it’s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this product for relieving my itchy skin. I&#x27;m not sure about the stretch marks--I had plenty before my first pregnancy anyway--and now that I&#x27;m into my second pregnancy, well, those marks are not going away. But the fact that I don&#x27;t spend my life scratching my sides is awesome enough to recommend this oil blend to any pregnant woman. I pour a little in a jar and mix a few drops of my favorite essential oil with it before rubbing it on. Even though the smell is mild, it still bugs me for some reason (thanks hormones).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy and goes on smooth. I started using this product as my skin was getting really dry and itchy. This product has made my skin soft and silky smooth.  I am now 7 and a half months pregnant and don&#x27;t have a stretch mark yet.</li>
    <li> I used this for my 3rd pregnancy and did not get a single stretch  mark and delivered a 10lb baby.  I had used different cocoa butter creams for my first two pregnancies and got tons of stretch marks.  This oil has a peanutty smell that took a little bit to get used to but was overall, great.  Used it every night.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 6 years with both pregnancy&#x27;s and after . I have no stretch marks  luv this product !</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at about 6 weeks pregnant after reading positive amazon reviews for it. My mom and my sister both had stretch marks with their pregnancies, and since I have read genetics are the major player in determining whether or not you&#x27;ll get stretch marks, I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes. But I thought &amp;#34;hey, every little bit helps!&amp;#34; So I began using this product religiously on my belly, hips, and thighs after nearly every shower. I am now 34 weeks pregnant, and so far I am stretch-mark free! Granted I still have 6 weeks left, but my skin is soft, supple, and glowing, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any itchy skin on my belly, either. I am on my third bottle, and I apply this product generously. Whether or not I avoid stretchmarks altogether, I still highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great Product! Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;The best product to prevent scratches on your belly .&lt;br /&gt;Saving pack of 4 packages , what do you need more :)</li>
    <li> I used this with my first pregnancy and did not get any stretch marks.  Who knows if this is what worked, but now during my second pregnancy (almost 7 months along) I use it twice a day!  No stretch marks so far, but that is not even the reason to use it.  It helps so much with itchiness of stretching skin!  The moisture lasts a long time if you apply it in the morning and before bed.  For anyone suffering from itchiness, it is the best!</li>
    <li> I love this oil!! I used it for both my previous pregnancies and am using it for my current one now. I apply this oil 2-3 times a day, especially after a shower. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use this after every shower. Easy to rub in. Smells nice. Absorbs well so it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin but I honestly don&#x27;t know if it prevented stretch marks or not. (For the record, I didn&#x27;t have any after birth).</li>
    <li> This is an amazing blend of oils! It&#x27;s absorbed into the skin right away, leaving no greasy residue. As an added bonus, it completely erased a scar I have on my belly!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend and she says this product is excellent!  She uses it daily and she says it leaves her feeling slick but she loves this product.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the ingredients more carefully before I ordered this. The product contains almond oil and coconut oil... I hate the smell of both so putting this on my skin everyday is a special kind of torture. My husband does not have the same aversion to almond and coconut flavored things and he agrees this product smells awful. I am 25 weeks along and I have not noticed it helping my skin a whole lot, I am very itchy these days, but I have also not seen any stretch marks develop either, so there&#x27;s that at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update -- I am now post-partum and I have sooo many stretch marks its not even funny. I used this crap religiously twice a day, not only does it ruin any cloth it touches but it didn&#x27;t work worth a damn. Buy anything else, I may as well used water for all the good this did me.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and ítem as described!  Recommended 100%</li>
    <li> Pregnant daughter she loves it</li>
    <li> Purchased this to help prevent stretch marks and itching during my pregnancy. So far so good on both accounts. It dries pretty quickly and I can tell when it starts to wear off, but that is usually 10+ hours from when I put it on in the morning.</li>
    <li> I used this with my first pregnancy and had no stretch marks. Hoping it works again. I also use it as a moisturizer for my 3 year old. This is great stuff!</li>
    <li> I am 25 Weeks pregnant and no stretchmarks yet!  Love this stuff, it dries fast and absorbs quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t feels extremely oily on the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell either!  Loving it so far.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I used it religiously throughout my pregnancy as soon as I found out I wad pregnant. I rubbed it all over right after my showers when my skin was still slightly damp as that really helps lock in the moisture.  I love the way it feels and also grew to like it&#x27;s slightly nutty smell. I was concerned the oil would stain clothes or sheets, but it never did. Most importantly, I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark on my skin. I&#x27;m unsure whether it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t gain much, genetics, this oil, or a mix of all these factors, but either way, I recommend this product to other pregnant friends.</li>
    <li> AMAZING product!!! 38 weeks and NO stretch marks. I always stock up on this product, and plan to use it after labor.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend told me to use oil for my pregnancy saying that it helps so much! She was right. This stuff works amazing. My skin has been able to stretch as my baby has grown so much easier and so far i don&#x27;t appear to have any stretch marks!</li>
    <li> Hands down best one I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve had three baby sand have tried many of these!  My youngest baby is almost two and I still keep some on hand to put on after showering.  I feel like keeping those areas moisturized makes a huge difference in the appearance of the stretch marks I do have.  :)</li>
    <li> I use this every time I get out of the shower. I am pretty little and was worried about stretch marks. Though it is mainly a genetic factor, I haven&#x27;t gotten any yet at 8.5 months! Not too smelly or greasy... I would wait a bit before putting on clothes, let it dry for a while or put on a shirt you don&#x27;t care about first. Stays on most of the day. I have already recommended it to others!</li>
    <li> I used this both times I was pregnant and I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark. And I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not just luck because my mom got stretch marks really bad. This stuff is amazing I would never go without it.</li>
    <li> I come from a long line of ladies who got terrible stretch marks during pregnancy.  So, though I thought that would just genetically be my inevitable end result, I gave this a whirl.  I can&#x27;t say whether this is for sure the reason, but I got no new stretch marks while pregnant.  I love this stuff.  Greasy...so I used it at night only because I didn&#x27;t care if it stained my pajamas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as soon as I found out I was pregnant (week 10). I am now at 33 weeks and have not seen any stretch marks or signs of  dry skin. It&#x27;s super absorbent and have enjoyed using it so much I use it on my arms and legs as well for a nice glow :) I used this product every morning from week 10 - week 20. Since week 20 I have been applying the oil 2x a day; every morning after I shower and evening before bed (sometimes in the middle of the day if I felt my belly itching). I have stretch marks on my hips and thighs from growth spurts in my early teen years, so I felt like naturally my skin would be the type of skin to get stretch marks during pregnancy right away. I am still hopeful and will continue to use this product until delivery and post. So far so good.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I&#x27;ve used it for all of my pregnancies and give it as a gift as well! Love it!</li>
    <li> My friend gave me a bottle when i first became pregnant.  I bought my second bottle with 8 weeks to go.  I still do not have nay stretch marks and my skin is soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> My wife liked it and did not have stretch marks during/after pregnancy...take that as you will :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 5 months pregnant but I have no stretchmarks (so far), no itchy belly, and it&#x27;s kept dryness to a minimum in this cold weather. I use it once a day after the shower, all over. I&#x27;ve been using it since I was 3 months pregnant. I took off one star because it&#x27;s a big oilier than I&#x27;d like, but I did try another (more expensive, lighter oil, mamma mio) product and I started seeing dryness, so I switched back to this Mother&#x27;s Special Blend. The initial smell is nice (chocolately!) but it goes away in a few minutes.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this stuff.  She&#x27;s petite, 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; and 117lbs.  Grew nearly a 9lb baby and no stretch marks!</li>
    <li> I am currently pregnant with super itchy skin, i tried high end , low end lotions, creams and everything with no results or relief. I am so glad that i discovered this special oil blend. It is amazing and definitely helps with itchy dry pregnant skin plus it doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell which is a plus for any sensitive preggo! I am done with one bottle and this is my second one, i highly recommend these to my fellow preggos. I am 5 n half months and so far no stretch marks!</li>
    <li> I used this oil from around 20 weeks and, 1 week postpartem, only have a few small stretch marks (although that may have had more to do with poor diet and lack of exercise in my second trimester).  I would encourage women to use it on their thighs as the bottle suggests, because while I never had stretch marks on mine the entire pregnancy, some showed up after I delivered, I believe due to the IV fluid that left me rather bloated all over.  I&#x27;m sure they wouldn&#x27;t have been as noticeable had I been using the oil there.    As for the oiliness/smell, it never left any residue or stains on my clothes and the only clothes I notices a detectable smell on were the few shirts/dresses I routinely put on after I showered and oiled up while I finished getting ready for work, although after a few washes since I stopped using the oil I no longer smell it on them either.</li>
    <li> so far so good! non irritating scent and I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> My pregnant daughter loves this after trying several and plans on continuing to use it after the baby is born.  Great product for the expectant mom!</li>
    <li> I wish it was scented.  I am going to add lavender oil to it.  Other than that it works well and I will continue to enjoy it.</li>
    <li> thank you for your prompt delivery.  my daughter has just become a mommy and this was a gift for her. It was greatly appreciated by myself when i was in the motherly way and I&#x27;m grateful to be able to share this amazing product with my daughter.</li>
    <li> Great light scent, I used this during my pregnancy and long after.</li>
    <li> Using on sensitive skin and it has helped. I like the cream the best but would really work on stretched skin of pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I figured that since this was oil based it would work like a charm.  No such luck.  I used this once I saw that I was getting small stretch marks.  I actually felt and looked DRIER when I used this item.  I got a recommendation from a friend about a different cream based brand and it took care of the little marks plus I didn&#x27;t get one single mark after I stopped using this product.  And I got pretty big! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> This is my second pregnancy using Mother&#x27;s. I love it! I purchase this product for all of my expecting Mommy friends and family! This skin oil moisturizes without leaving me greasy and doesn&#x27;t need to be reapplied more than once per day. One bottle got me through my pregnancy and the weight loss phase following. I&#x27;m a petite 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and gained 40 lbs during pregnancy, then lost it all over the course of a year. Although skin type and genetics play a huge role in stretch mark vulnerability, I have to give my lack of marks to this product. The blend of natural oils and lack of chemicals and fragrance is very compatible with my eczema and sensitive skin. Also, I rub this stuff in my hair as a frizz fighter and pretty much anywhere else that is dry on my body.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product! A little amount last for a pretty big area , light fragrance ,skin left moisturizer for a long time.i put it right after the shower and I put my sauna pants on to get rid of my after pregnancy pouch,so when I take the pants off skin was still moisturized.its a bit early to say if my streatch marks will disappear, but by my research it has a perfect blend of oils for that.he only minus to my opinion is that it could be a little less liquidy.</li>
    <li> No stretch marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will come back when baby is born, but I have no stretch marks at all, belly is big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also eat healthy and trying to incorporate vitamin E on my diet, eat almonds every day and peanut butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is working for me!</li>
    <li> My esthetician recommended this to me when I was about 5 months pregnant with my first child.  I used it every day after the shower and not one stretch mark.  I know they say stretch marks are genetic, so I thought I would get tons (all of the women in my family have gotten them pretty severely).  I give all the credit to this oil!  I am currently 8 months pregnant with my second and so far so good!</li>
    <li> I got this because it is so natural and I use it on my toddler&#x27;s skin after baths about once a week.  It is great and makes her skin so soft.  Also I don&#x27;t have to worry about strange fragrances or chemicals.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Used it last pregnancy and current one and have no stretch marks on my belly so far. Great natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  Used it throughout my entire pregnancy (more frequently towards the end).  Now I&#x27;m using it after baby was born.  Can&#x27;t really avoid stretch marks when you&#x27;re only 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and have a 9lb 2oz baby but my skin did not get any huge stretch marks other than some small ones on my belly button area.  Will continue to use it until I run out.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended this oil when I got pregnant with my first. I&#x27;ve used it faithfully on my belly since about 3 months, but some days would skip hips and butt areas. I got no stretch marks on my belly, my hips and butt, on the other hand looked like I had a fight with a tiger and lost. This time around I&#x27;m sticking to using it faithfully everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pure blend of oils, no chemicals added. It ranks 0 on EWG too!!! It&#x27;s pretty oily and takes a minute to absorb, but you can&#x27;t go wrong with all natural oils vs. chemical loaded creams and ointments. I would highly recommend this to any mama, especially if you&#x27;re trying to stick to all natural products!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this daily after showering.  She is now 8 months pregnant and not a single stretch mark or irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t have much of the sticky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;We will no doubt be using this product even after the delivery.</li>
    <li> The best for a pregnant belly! Use it daily after the tub. Natural, moisturizing, and smells great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this oil! I have used it when I got my breast augmentation and did not get ONE stretch mark! Now that I am pregnant, I use this twice daily and feel confident in the product to tone my skill as much as possible to prepare for pregnancy! Also got my cousin who is pregnant on it and she has had great results and loves it as well! This is a great all natural brand.</li>
    <li> I used this toning oil throughout my pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. It really works!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much more oily than I expected... but I should have known based on ingredients. It works great. As long as I&#x27;m using it regularly, I don&#x27;t itch. If I miss it for a few days, I start itching really bad. It feels so good to put it back on.</li>
    <li> Worked well but like they say no magic cream I still got stretch marks....none while pregnant but when I shrunk and yes I still use oil twice a day 6 weeks post partum</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d buy this stuff again in a heartbeat. I&#x27;m currently 25 weeks pregnant and have been using it since approximately 16 weeks. It&#x27;s oily and doesn&#x27;t absorb super quickly, but I think that&#x27;s part of what makes it work so well. I suffered from an itchy stomach and this has since cured my problem! I use it right after I shower, every time I shower. I had to go a few days without it while we were traveling and I definitely missed it and felt a noticeable difference. I also have no stretch marks yet, which I&#x27;m hoping this will help prevent as well!</li>
    <li> It really prevented me from getting any stretch mark during my three pregnncies.</li>
    <li> I used this oil since day one and I didn&#x27;t get 1 stretch mark.</li>
    <li> I used this for my first pregnancy (I was huge) and now my second pregnancy. I don&#x27;t know if I am just blessed or if it&#x27;s this oil, but I have had zero stretch marks. I use this every morning when I get out of the shower all over my belly, hips and thighs. It is easy to put on and absorbs fast. I have never had any problem getting it all over my clothes. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not pregnant, but recently lost 100lbs. I&#x27;m using this on my small stretch marks on my stomach and this oil is making them fade! Miracle worker!!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this oil. It felt great on my skin and I saw a difference in my marks in less than two weeks. However, the bottle continuously leaks everywhere. I have lost about half the product to the leakage and it has unintentionally oiled up too many of my belongings. I will try to salvage what is left and put it into a different container, because I really do like the way it makes my skin feel. It does have a distinctive scent, but I do not find it overpowering or offensive (although, I am not pregnant).</li>
    <li> Just started using this product. Smells great. Absorbs nicely. Hoping it works well to prevent stretch marks!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this product on amazon.  I usually purchase it at whole foods, but its 17$+ there and they discontinued it near me &#x3D;(.  This product is amazing, I cant say enough good things about it.  Everyone in my family has stretch marks from pregnancy, but when I found this at whole foods I used it nearly everywhere on my body during pregnancy (and AFTER-very important, since your skin is still changing) and I have NO stretch marks.  This product really impressed me considering I gained about 50lbs during pregnancy, and lost 70 after (putting me 20lbs lighter than my pre-pregnancy weight) which means my body went through A LOT of changes.  and still-no stretch marks.  I&#x27;d also like to add it makes your skin so soft, and will soften even the dryest/roughest skin nicely overnight.</li>
    <li> Not sticky like many other oils and dries very fast. I haven&#x27;t had baby yet, so i&#x27;LL EDIT LATER IF IT ACTUALLY HELPS FOR STRETCHS MARKS, BUT I HAVE DEFNITELY NOTICED IT limits the itch in my stretching skin and I have a friend who I turned onto it who says it relieves her itch as well also.</li>
    <li> I really love this oil. It&#x27;s heavy enough to be moisturizing but somehow it&#x27;s not greasy. It really feels like it soaks into my skin and doesn&#x27;t just sit on top. Prior to this I had such an itchy belly but ever since I started using this it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I ended up getting a small second degree burn on my stomach from cooking and once it healed I started focusing on massaging the burned area with this and it has faded the scarred area substantially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use the burts bees mama bee belly butter as well after I apply the oil but I could probably not use it and still be very moisturized.</li>
    <li> Used for both my pregnancies. No smell. Hydrating to relieve itching and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily or getting on your clothes.</li>
    <li> The wife used this along with the soap, no stretch marks at all, she is very pleased.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helped with stretch marks at all (I still got new ones while pregnant and using the oil), but it stopped the itchy belly.</li>
    <li> I am almost 7 months pregnant and was nervous about stretch marks since I have gotten them before elsewhere. I&#x27;ve been using twice a day since i was about 3 months. Just started my second bottle, definitely a must have.</li>
    <li> Due in 4 days and no stretch marks!! Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s hereditary or if this oil is magic but I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I used Mother&#x27;s Special Blend in 1990 when I was pregnant, and it worked like a miracle! I got NO stretch marks on my belly... and here&#x27;s proof it was not genetic or any other factor: I DID get stretch marks on other parts of my body, such as my lower back, hips, and sides of my breasts. I didn&#x27;t think of those areas and only rubbed this stuff on my belly. So learn from me; rub it everywhere! I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about it for all these years and never thought to see if it was still around. I&#x27;m going to get some to use as a general moisturizer. The ingredients are pure &amp; simple, and if they prevent stretch marks maybe they&#x27;ll be good for entering my next phase of life... incoming wrinkles, LOL! ...definitely worth a try, I&#x27;ll be back in another 25 years to report again. :-)</li>
    <li> I have used this for both my first and second baby,  and didn&#x27;t get a single streach mark.  I woudl recomend starting before you start showing and continuing to use after you have the baby.  Kind of smells like coco but not strong enough to be annoying.  I would recomend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost 7 months pregnant and have been using this product every single day ever since my first trimester...no stretch marks! Just bought a second bottle to get me through my last trimester and hoping for minimal/no stretch marks! I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> It used this throughout my entire pregnancy and it worked wonders.</li>
    <li> Totally prevents stretch marks! Use during pregnancy and after.</li>
    <li> Not that fast with drying since it is oil so make sure you let it dry before getting dressed.  Its fantastic though!</li>
    <li> Have used this oil when I was pregnant and it works wonders and now I use it after a hard day at work.</li>
    <li> I do enjoy slathering this stuff on my pregnant belly, it&#x27;s moisturizing and absorbs fairly quickly. However, the smell is really bad. It has that cocoa butter smell, but as if the cocoa butter has gone bad. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the bottle that I received, but I find myself holding my breath while applying it.</li>
    <li> ZERO stretchmarks for me!!!!  Yes, genetics have something to do with it...but my mom had LOTS of stretchmarks...and both of my sisters have had stretchmarks on the underside of their belly.  So, I would say it&#x27;s a GREAT product!</li>
    <li> Used all through pregnancy! No stretch marks:) I&#x27;m not sure if it was the oil or the fact that I only gained 18lbs through entire pregnancy. Either way... I love the smell and feel of this oil. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I used this oil with both my pregnancies because a friend recommended it to prevent stretch marks. It works! I have continued to use it, especially in the winter, as an extra moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love the way this feels on my skin. Does not irritate my skin like Palmers products did.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s mostly genetics that determines stretch marks, especially during pregnancy, I definitely used this oil a lot and feel it kept my skin healthy and looking its best. I applied twice a day, mixing it with lotion. Another perk is that it has a non-offending smell, an issue for many during pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Nice but a little tedious to rub in</li>
    <li> As soon as I found out we were expecting I purchased this product. I read all the great reviews and I sold! this is a great natural oil that will keep you from getting any stretch marks. I&#x27;m 30 weeks today! I&#x27;m stretch marks free. the only complaint I would have to say about applying this oil is that it will stain your sheets if Applying right before going to bed. so if you do so make sure to wear something long to cover the areas that you have applied on your body. Overall this product is awesome I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This oil was a recommendation listed on Mint Arrow&#x27;s ultimate baby registry blog and I decided to give it a try.  I am not one to use lotion or oils since they make me feel greasy but I knew I needed to keep my skin hydrated with a growing belly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying Mother&#x27;s daily after showers and I seriously could not be happier with this product.  I feel wonderful, my skin is smooth and as I enter my 8th month, I have yet to see stretch marks... (disclaimer: preggo stretch marks tend to be hereditary).  I am convinced that this oil has helped my skin and I will be ordering more.  I recommend buying a couple bottles if you plan to use anywhere else besides your tummy as I tend to use on my legs, chest, etc.  Also check out their website to find brick and mortar locations that sell it near you.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Feels nice going on the skin. No more itching from growing baby!</li>
    <li> As a new mom to be. I was recommended by my friend on this product. It works great on my growing belly. I use it right after showers and before bed. It keep my growing nice and soft. It prevents my growing belly from drying out. I would recommend this product to any new mommy&#x27;s to be.</li>
    <li> Terrific product!!!! So moisturizing. Fades Scars! On my second bottle and love it. Slightly greasy recommend using at night and putting on pj&#x27;s afterwards. Started to notice slight stains on some clothing that the oil transferred to, but not enough for me to stop using the product. Great for allover moisturizing for itchy dry skin. Give it a try!!!!</li>
    <li> The oil is nice and feels good on your belly, however I couldn&#x27;t get over the fact that it smelled like chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;I should&#x27;ve read the ingredients more carefully. I would prefer to keep using my Palmers Coco Butter.</li>
    <li> I like this product. The only thing is it&#x27;s just regular oils mixed together that you can do yourself if you want. Nothing too special.</li>
    <li> to be fair I have very fair skin and my baby came four days after my first stretch mark appeared...dang, so close! Now that the little one is here I use it on her after bath time. It works so much better than lotion and really eliminates the &amp;#34;crust and flakes&amp;#34; on her head. Additionally, it&#x27;s great for baby massage. I still use this on myself after every shower and we&#x27;re both baby soft ;)</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my stretch marks, but did moisturize my skin.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a gift when pregnant with my second child, and I loved the smell and the richness of the oil. So when I ran out with my third baby, I knew I wanted to order it again. I had planned to use it through my postpartum recovery months as well.&lt;br /&gt;What I received is not the same as what I originally had. The packaging/image on the front of the bottle is new-- not a problem by any means, however, the ingredients are also not the same! The newer version does not contain pecan oil as it states in the description here. It only has almond oil, coconut oil, cocoa butter, and vitamin E. I assume the smell (which was my greatest draw to this item) is probably going to be affected so I haven&#x27;t opened it yet since I am unsure if I want to keep it without the pecan oil. I am disappointed and thought I should warn others the product is not exactly as it used to be, and it does not actually contain the ingredients listed in the description here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I kept the oil, and can say that it did not smell all that different than it did previously. It still has a very rich feel to it. I used it through six months postpartum. My third baby is now 8mo and I still use it after shaving on my legs as it has been a rough, dry winter.  It is still a great product even with the changes. Though I am still disappointed they switched from 8.5oz to just 8oz and took out the pecan oil, I would buy it again. I uploaded a photo for those who are interested in a visual.</li>
    <li> This made me itch a lot. Didn&#x27;t really see much toning effect. I&#x27;ll stick with bio-oil.</li>
    <li> Pregnant or not, young or old, this is a wonderful moisturizing oil with a low oily factor.</li>
    <li> Honestly if you&#x27;re disciplined in applying this 2-3 times a day you will prevent getting stretch marks. I am living proof of it and I suggest it to any new mommies to be, but you have to apply it everyday multiple times and you will get the results of no stretch marks. I was shocked because doc / anyone will say nothing works, but this stuff actually and truly worked. I&#x27;m 9 &amp; half months pregnant and no stretch marks where I applied the oil.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Used effectively along with cocoa butter lotion and Vitamin E oil to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy. Highly recommend use beginning in 2nd month through 6 weeks postpartum. No stretch marks for this new mom!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, so I had to throw it out. Because I discontinued use, I cannot speak to the effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I really love this product because it works perfectly good on my body. Overcome my expectations, I recommend the oil widely</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s all natural and safe for mom and baby. My skin is soft and itch free! A bottle lasts a while.</li>
    <li> Love it, have used it for 2 babies and continue to.</li>
    <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it&lt;br /&gt;Loving the feeling of taking care of myself and being mindful of protecting my baby at the same time</li>
    <li> This oil seems to do the job.  And it has a long shelf life which is nice.  I just wish it smelled a little better.  It kind of just smells like vegetable oil - doesn&#x27;t stink, but doesn&#x27;t smell good either.  I still buy it with every pregnancy though.</li>
    <li> nothing gets rid of stretch marks, but this really did help minimize mine, and helped my belly from being so itchy during pregnancy!</li>
    <li> Amazing. I live this product.  It really moisturizes and my skin stays moist and supple.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m religiously using this oil for almost 2 months now, at morning and night. I&#x27;m in 29 wks now but so far so good. I don&#x27;t see any stretched mark yet and helps for my belly itch! Whenever my belly gets itchy, I apply it and completely takes care of it right away! And it smells sweet like a cookie. lol I don&#x27;t mind this smell at all but I mix with Grapefruit oil in the morning and Lavender oil at night to give me some fresh relaxing smell. It works pretty well!</li>
    <li> Started using around 7 months pregnant and did not have one stretch mark. Applied twice a day to chest, belly, back, bum and thighs and it&#x27;s magic! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write a public review, but when it comes to pregnancy, I find it very helpful for other first mom to be (like me) to read an honest feedback on stuff that will contact with our sensitive skin or may effect our unborn baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I found out that I was pregnant, I&#x27;ve started to try different safe oil, butter, cream, lotion that might helps prevent any irritating issue during pregnancy. This oil is one of favorite. I apply it all over before putting anything else on, I love how it leaves my skin soft and glow, and easy to absorb other lotion I put on next. I also mix it with my other body butter. The only thing that bothers me is its smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell fresh or pleasant at all, it stinks. The only way that keep me using it is to mix it with my favorite essential oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to write this review for a while (my twins are now two!) as I really wanted to share my experience with this oil - it was a true miracle worker.  Pregnant with twins, let&#x27;s just say that my belly got quite large but I can happily report that I do not have one single stretch mark.  I applied Mother&#x27;s Special Blend throughout the day so that the skin was always moisturized.  The oil is definitely on the thicker side but I think that&#x27;s part of why it works so well.  My sister was pregnant at the same time but was not using this oil it in the beginning of her pregnancy.  However, at one point in her pregnancy she noticed two little stretch marks so she immediately started using it and did not have one more stretch mark after that.  It&#x27;s great - it works....a definite godsend!! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant and this has been my saving grace through my first and second trimesters. I got a few truly horrible stretch marks when I went through my growth spurt as a teenager, and have been terrified of getting more now that I&#x27;m pregnant. I know I&#x27;m only going to get bigger, so there&#x27;s still a chance I&#x27;ll get some, but so far I am stretch mark free (even though I&#x27;ve gained 15 lbs and my belly is popping out!). I use this on my belly, my boobs, my hips, and my butt straight out of the shower in the morning and love the results. My skin is so smooth, smells heavenly (faintly of chocolate, yum) and it even helps relieve the itchiness of pregnancy skin. Feels so good, and I love that it&#x27;s all natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband suffers from extremely dry skin and has even tried it on himself with great results. I also found that it does wonders for soothing sunburned skin...give it a try! Awesome gift idea for expectant mamas.</li>
    <li> Best Product! Used with both of my pregnancies and no stretch marks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 9 months pregnant and have used this since 3-4 months.  I oil-up after every shower and truly believe this is why I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. The smell is great, not to greasy, soaks in fast. I did accidentally get it on my clothes once and the oil stain came clean in the wash. I put it on once in the morning and one at night. I have gained 20 pounds so far with my pregnancy and no signs of stretch marks!</li>
    <li> Was a very nice oil that was easy to apply and had a neutral smell. It did not prevent stretch marks after using 2x per day for many months.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is stickier and more oily than bio-oil but that is what I like about it. It is easy to apply leaves me feeling soft. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all it has less of a smell than bio-oil for me. I have already purchased about 4 bottles. I originally got it from mothers market after they recommended it and then the last 3 here because it is cheaper and saves me a trip to the store. I do not use it lightly, instead I lather myself up in it from my hips to my neck. I apply in the morning and before bed and also bought bio oil to try it which I use during lunch time. Im just using bio oil since I already purchased it but I prefer mothers special blend. If I feel itchy I just place this on and feel much better right after. Would definetly recommend using, I started when I first found out and still using it 32 weeks later. I will update about the results once I am done.&lt;br /&gt;Update: 11 weeks postpartum and not a single stretch mark!! Would definitely recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Used it during my pregnancy and got no stretch marks, its a little greasy but it absorbs easily, doesn&#x27;t smell much so I could still use my perfume.  HIglhy recommended, during my last 3 months I used it 3 o4 times a day!</li>
    <li> First time mom. I started using the product when I was ~ 5 weeks pregnant. I&#x27;m now 33 weeks and no stretch marks. It also helped my previous stretch marks on my breasts.</li>
    <li> The Mother&#x27;s Special Blend was recommended by a friend and since it was more all natural, I decided to give it a try. In my opinion, it&#x27;s way to greasy and takes forever to be absorbed by the skin. I always put lotion on first thing after a shower so that it will have time to dry before getting dressed for work or for the day; I wasn&#x27;t able to allow my skin to absorb this stuff before having to get dressed for work. I don&#x27;t think I used too much....I barely used any!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll just stick to the Palmer&#x27;s Lotion for now.  Stretch marks may come...I don&#x27;t think anything really prevents them if you&#x27;re prone to them.</li>
    <li> I know, you either get stretch marks or you don&#x27;t. But I used this with my last pregnancy religiously and didn&#x27;t get a single one, so I am using it again with this one. Hopefully I won&#x27;t get any this time around, either!</li>
    <li> Great smell, very light.</li>
    <li> I usually never write reviews, but this one deserves it. The product came fast, I got it  for my wife she is almost 30 weeks pregnant; and she was 14 weeks when she started wearing it. She loves it even though the smell is not the best. Not stretch marks at all, she wear it twice a day morning at night after shower.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Fast deliver&lt;br /&gt;No allergies&lt;br /&gt;Works pretty well no stretch marks&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Smells funny&lt;br /&gt;Takes a little be to absorb but is not big deal</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this for 4 months now and is extremely happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best product for stretchmarks EVER. I got very light, very few marks (I went full term+ a day with a 7.2 baby). It helped so much with itching and dry skin AND I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks until after 35 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Use every day, after you shower, or whenever your belly is itchy and your skin will thank you! It also works great as part of a sugar scrub, or a leave-in conditioner for soft-shiny hair (wash and rise after).&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell. It&#x27;s light and chocolaty and I recommend this product to absolutely everyone I know.</li>
    <li> this works wonders! helped me during my pregnancy and will buy again for the next one.</li>
    <li> I really like using this oil because it spreads easily but is slightly thicker than just coconut oil. I&#x27;m only at my 20th week of pregnancy but so far no stretch marks. Hopefully it stays that way.</li>
    <li> Working great so far!</li>
    <li> smells gross, but works pretty good :) I&#x27;ve bought 6 already...nice and natural...has all the ingredients to better your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not pregnant but I use this instead of lotion, especially on areas prone to stretch marks and cellulite. It&#x27;s the only thing that combats my dry skin. Best right out of the shower, as it locks in moisture. Love it!</li>
    <li> all I can say this is magic I start using it since I was 2 months n I don&#x27;t have a single mark in my belly till now 9months ladies this thing works for sure....</li>
    <li> I love this oil so much, I use it for after showers, as a suntan lotion, as a night time moisturizer, I actually threw out all of my other lotions and this is the only one I use now. Love it!!</li>
    <li> leaves the skin very soft...absolutely natural!</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Love the way it feels and works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since the 2nd month into my pregnancy.  It keeps my skin really pliable.  It does have a faint smell but they&#x27;re natural ingredients and I&#x27;d rather it have it&#x27;s natural smell than be perfume-y (especially since usually to have perfume, it has to have alcohol and alcohol dries out the skin, so that goes against what you&#x27;re trying to do).  I wear a tank top to protect my clothes from the oil marks.  No stretch marks so far, thank The Lord, but I&#x27;ve read that stretch marks are hereditary and also have to do with the amount of weight you gain and how fast you gain it.</li>
    <li> Smell is not that great, kind of smells like hemp actually. I can&#x27;t vouch for how well it works for stretch marks yet but definitely sooths itchy belly and breasts. Oil is very thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I used it while pregnant with My first child and did not get any stretch marks. I am pregnant with my second child and I use this daily!</li>
    <li> I also purchased the soap-  Bot products  2 thumbs up</li>
    <li> Love this oil... No stretch marks and keep my body smooth.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I won&#x27;t know for another seven months or so if it keeps the stretch marks away. It absorbs relatively quickly (about 5 minutes) and goes on easily. My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t love the scent. It is all natural, and smells of cocoa beans, but it&#x27;s a bit... odd... it&#x27;s not the lovely chocolate smell that one may hope for when imagining cocoa... I suppose I&#x27;m partial to the smell of essential oils when it comes to products like this.</li>
    <li> The best stuff on the market!! I use this with 2 pregnancies and all the time in general</li>
    <li> Used this practically daily and still got stretch marks, it is true...using oils/cocoa butter makes no difference mostly genetic</li>
    <li> This product was a gift for my daughter-in-law who is a new mom.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin smooth and my stretch marks are fading!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before during and after all 3 pregnancies.  It&#x27;s a good eat product to use right after the shower. I really notice how well it keeps my skin moisturized and helps stretch marks fade. I also love to give it as baby shower gifts to help my friends take care of themselves.</li>
