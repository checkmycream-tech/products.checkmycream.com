<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product made me breakout. There&#x27;s also a strong smell that I cannot take. My skin didn&#x27;t lighten at all.</li>
    <li> So far so good it&#x27;s been 6 days I&#x27;ve already seen results I brought this because I have a dark spot on my chin from plucking the hair and hormonal changes due to pregnancy it left me with dark underarms from shaving and my inner thighs are dark from gaining weight and chaffing. I am brown skinned with red undertones I look kind of West Indian in color as I am from an island. I hope to get rid of these marks as they have plagued me for awhile throughout my 20s and I&#x27;ve lost 20 pounds hoping to loose more and make a complete make over. These changes will boost my confidence after loosing the rest of my weight I can show off my beautiful body without having to be self Conscious I will update in another week but I can see my underarms lightening and the spot on my chin my inner thighs haven&#x27;t lightened much but the skin their would be more resistant as its thicker and it&#x27;s been their for years wish me luck!!</li>
    <li> So I was reading reviews about this cream because I usually don&#x27;t buy nothing unless I see 10 good reviews with 5 stars. I have a caramel skin tone but my skin got darker over the years and I lost my real complexion. I bought this cream to lighten me up.. And wow it hasn&#x27;t even been a week I already see changes! Face is lighter, skin glowing and smooth. I&#x27;ve ordered the whole kit. Soap, lotion, night cream and serum! I&#x27;ll continue using this product for a veryyyyy long time. I love it! Worth the price and much more. Try it, I GUARANTEE you won&#x27;t regret it. Pinky promise lol</li>
    <li> I love this product.It is like butter so silky and actually works!.The sellers are wonderful ..BLUE WIRE.they are fast, efficient courteous and I will be ordering more.. go and buy it it is fantastic. Your skin will thank you :)</li>
    <li> ITS GOOD BUT ITS TOO SMALL FOR THE PRICE WE PAY. VERY STRONG AND CAUSE THINING OF THE SKIN BE CAREFUL OR MIX IT WITH NATURE CREAM</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Just got so I&#x27;m in between yes &amp; no but so far so good</li>
    <li> It has been working ok.... Not as fast as others have claimed. But I have seen improvement in my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is not the greatest or worse but it is something that you will have to get used to. Would recommend to others to use.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! It takes care of acne blemishes, discolorations, I feel it is a bit over priced because the jars are not full, that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars! The product is a very good product.</li>
    <li> Works accurately,i use it everyday ,in the morning and at night , each after a good shower.</li>
    <li> removed my pregnancy mask  my complexion is clear again and AlMOST as pale as i want not quite  using for over a month now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream mixed with the lotion for over a week now and my skin is already lightening, i wash with Olay daily exfoliate body wash. So I&#x27;m very much please. Everyone skin is different too, so some will see result quicker than others.</li>
    <li> I use this on my knees and my elbows and it definitely did work even though I didn&#x27;t use it every single day or twice a day the way I should have so I am pretty sure that if I would have been more diligent that I would have had it even better experience what I will say is that this Lightener is only good for elbows and knees I had a bad burn on the back of my thigh as well as a scar on my leg and it did nothing to help the extreme darkness...</li>
    <li> so I used it for a bout a month and a half and within that time there were a gradient of things that occurred. My skin became very thin and appeared to have developed a rash texture around my nose. If I got a pimple in the course of using the product my pimple would heal extremely dark almost black which is very unusual for me. After I stopped using it, my hands and face got darker than my original skin tone, and became very sensitive to the sun, again odd for me. I do not recommend this product due to the aftermath of discontinued use.</li>
    <li> Worked on my face lighter in 2 weeks but does not work on larger parts of the body</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off and on for about 8 months. I use it to fade dark marks caused by acne and sun damage and it does work. I have two old dark scars that I targeted since my first application. One has almost disappeared and the oldest one (14 years) has improved. This cream works best on new scars, but with persistent use, I believe even the darkest discolorations will improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bleach is powerful and does thin the skin which is why I use it in 4-5 day intervals and then I take a break for about the same amount of time. I would recommend taking a slow a gentle approach and using a great moisturizer at night. If you notice redness and peeling, your skin has been overwhelmed by the chemicals. I had redness on dark marks on my cheek, took a break, used this product for 3 days instead of 5, and my skin was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the product but if you do not protect your skin with sunscreen after using it, your results will not last. Also, regarding acne, I do feel you need to take special care cleaning your skin after applying this product or it will clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had darkness in my underarms for years. In a matter of two weeks my underarms are so bright and clean looking. I went to a dermatologist before I started using this cream and there was nothing they can d. This product is amazing so thankful I found it.</li>
    <li> It made me break out into a rash on my face and there were no improvements on the other areas I used it on like my knees and elbows.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works very well. especially after I get darker after using a harsh product. My BF also uses it on his bear area, and his skin looks sooo good! I call this my skin fixer. It clears every blemish on your face. I have dry skin, so I find this product to be suitable for me.  Read my fill review on my blog : ilightenmyskin.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me.  It said to stop using it if you didn&#x27;t see any results after a few weeks.  I tried 5 weeks with no results.  I threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> GOT SICK, STRONG CHEMICAL ORDOR, MADE SKIN DARK DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> After reading mixed reviews I still decided to give this product a shot.. I exfoliated 4 weeks with jonica acid and lactic acid peels. Once I got pionA I started using it and in one week my skin has lightened dramatically... The only complaint I have it that it is such a small amount for a lot of money.,, for those reviews of The product not workin I don&#x27;t understand how.. But everything doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. I recommend u exfoliate well before trying this, just to make sure u get the best results possible.. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived and just as pictured.  Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> This product is, hands down, the BEST for removing dark spots. I tried several painfully expensive creams, both from stores like Ulta as well as here on Amazon. I did lots of research and took a chance on this one due to the reviews. All I can say is Wow! I saw results within a week, noticable results. At first I only applied it at night since my skin is sensitive and I was concerned it would burn. It didn&#x27;t leave me burned or red or anything. Be sure to use a good moisturizer and a good sunscreen. The results are amazing. I recommend this to to everyone I know. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. On the tub it says improvement is seen after 3 weeks but I&#x27;ve applied it 3 times in the space of two days and I&#x27;m already seeing a significant change. I&#x27;m light skinned but seem to have dark red/purple skin pigmentation on my knees and having used this cream it&#x27;s making me feel so much better about myself. Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin or cause soreness &amp; itching. Doesn&#x27;t smell strong or bad and absorbs well into the skin. Not a lot of the product is needed so I presume the 4oz tub will last a while. Definetley beats all other skin bleaching gels/creams!</li>
    <li> Too watery and didn&#x27;t see a difference. The serum is way better</li>
    <li> Strangely enough it does turn your skin darker so beware.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve read the glowing reviews and the horror stories, and you&#x27;re not sure which to trust. And if you&#x27;re going to spend $40 on face cream, you want to be sure what you&#x27;re getting. Hopefully this review will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Disclaimer: every skin type is different and I can  only speak for mine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this cream works. And it works fast. I bought it to even out and brighten my skin tone and within a week, I&#x27;ve gotten great results. Acne scars I&#x27;ve had since forever are already starting to significantly fade and my skin is absolutely glowing. I&#x27;ve never felt so confident leaving the house without any makeup on and I seriously can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in a month or two. I don&#x27;t mean to sound like an infomercial but it&#x27;s that impressive! Lol&lt;br /&gt;The best tips I can give are to use it with the Piona soap or kojic acid soap to exfoliate, which is essential to skin brightening. I can&#x27;t stress the importance of exfoliating enough. The less dirt and dead skin the cream has to penetrate, the more effective it&#x27;ll be. I highly recommend using the entire Piona line (soap, cream, and serum) together. Amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;Also, be consistent and be patient. And wear sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanna touch on some things I read in the bad reviews, that I found to be untrue in my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The cream burns&amp;#34; - I haven&#x27;t even remotely experienced any burning from this cream. And I&#x27;m perplexed that some reviewers claimed to. Perhaps they were combining it with other products, or putting the cream on raw skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;causes breakouts&amp;#34; - now this will vary from person to person, but I personally haven&#x27;t experienced any rashes or breakouts. As a matter of fact, I&#x27;ve used this cream to clear up breakouts caused by other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It smells bad&amp;#34; - does it smell like your favorite bath &amp; body product? No. But far from bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;makes you darker&amp;#34; - I have yet to experience this. But if I had to guess, the people who did likely didn&#x27;t wear enough sunscreen when outdoors. When using skin lightening products, sunscreen is a must because bleaching thins your skin, making it more susceptible to burning. Take the proper care and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence! I&#x27;m not one to gush but it&#x27;s about the best $40 I&#x27;ve ever spent. This is the best my face has looked my whole life, not even exaggerating. And I wish you the same luck that I&#x27;ve had with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 2 months:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is about 90% clear, outside of a few stubborn scars. I&#x27;ve gone from having to cake on concealer everyday to barely wearing makeup at all anymore. I&#x27;ve also lightened about 2 shades. For reference, I used to wear MAC NC45 in Studio Fix powder, and I am now a NC42. I will say, it&#x27;s not as strong on other parts of the body because the skin on your body isn&#x27;t as thin as the skin on your face. So if you plan to use it on other areas, be prepared to be patient for results. Other than that, I&#x27;ll vouch for this cream any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 4 months:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has maintained its new color and is still clear, but I think I&#x27;ve reached a plateau. In other words, your skin will build a tolerance to the cream over time and its lightening effects will be less effective. I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s best to switch to products with a different active ingredient every 3 months when lightening so your skin doesn&#x27;t become immune. (The active ingredient in the cream is arbutin) I just bought the Piona serum which contains hydroquinone and I&#x27;ve found it to be effective so far, especially on areas that the cream couldn&#x27;t lighten. Pretty much, the entire Piona line is just amazing. Cannot say enough good things about it. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever madescreen when outdoors.

I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s best to switch to products with a different active ingredient every 3 months when lightening so your skin doesn&#x27;t become immune. (The active ingredient in the cream is arbutin) I just bought the Piona serum which contains hydroquinone and I&#x27;ve found it to be effective so far, especially on areas that the cream couldn&#x27;t lighten. Pretty much, the entire Piona line is just amazing. Cannot say enough good things about it. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made</li>
    <li> Effective. I use this multiple times a day on my face and haven&#x27;t had any problems. I do notice it making a difference. It&#x27;s not life changing but it is effective. Two downsides: 1) the smell is very strong, like other people can smell it on your face too and 2) can be kind of heavy feeling and hard to blend. But worth it in my opinion</li>
    <li> Love it, it&#x27;s expensive but it works! After a week or two I started to see result. I applied to spots 2 times a day.</li>
    <li> Stinks but works well</li>
    <li> did not work for me would not get again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but if you are struggling with dark spots maybe from pregnancy this is your cream. I had a dark spot over my lip for two years leaving me super insecure about my face. This cream has me back to normal. Love it</li>
    <li> i bought a 4oz of this thats worth $40 but i only got a 2.oz, which is only for 20$, sometimes we get so excited to see and use it rightaway and never pay attention on the size we get. careful and always be aware so we dont waste the money that we are been working for. this is for tips only not for product review yet i will follow up for product review soon</li>
    <li> I had begnign genetic acanthosis nigricans that ive struggled with and have tried every method in the book to get rid of and this helped me dramatically whiten the darkened areas. Great product would definately recomend this to anyone interested</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the piona cream and the piona exfoliating soap for about two whole months and personally I love it because it works. At first I was scared to try it because of the negative reviews but I decided to get a 2 oz jar of piona cream to try it for myself. Which I highly recommend to anyone trying to get a shade lighter to try it because what doesn&#x27;t work for someone else doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you. Try it for your self!!! I use it on my face to try it out. In a week and a couple of days I saw a change in my face. So I started to use it on my neck, arms, and legs. I noticed that my face, neck, and knees took about three full weeks to match the rest of my body. Really dark areas take about three to four weeks to lighten. Also you must use the cream day and night with the soap to see great results. *Do not scrub your face with the soap, it will burn like a mf. Trust me I did and I won&#x27;t do it again. Just wash it using you hands. I&#x27;m going to finish up my body and plan to do another review to update everyone and hopefully I&#x27;ll have a channel on YouTube or something to help and tell people about this amazing product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! There are many skin whitening products out there but this one does the job for real....if you know what I&#x27;m saying. I only use it twice a week and it works evenly on my skin. The result was visible with just a day of use so I decided to go slow. I also love the fact that there&#x27;s no hydroquinone in this product. I will definitely stick with this product.</li>
    <li> Works really good, clears black marks and spots</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. I have a medium brown skin color, African American. In as little as five days I saw results. I would recommend this to anyone with burns or major scars. It works fantastically!!!👍🏾</li>
    <li> Used this once and had to stop. Smelled too bad.</li>
    <li> I can see difference in my skin color after using product for 2 weeks. It really works! Only one disadvantage is smell. Cream smells really strong and  that I can tolerate it well, but my husband doesn&#x27;t like it...so I have to apply cream at night after he falls a sleep...</li>
    <li> Works to well and too fast just monitor the use. When you stop using it though, the burn or scar will come back to the originally coloring so may need to use a toner.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. It caused my skin to burn and peel.</li>
    <li> Great product works fast I saw a difference in one day a major difference in a week I will continue to use this as my beauty cream</li>
    <li> It was such a small jar and I would barely use it and it only lasted for about 3 days and no improvement was seen so far</li>
    <li> Results slow depending on length of time you had the problem but positively effective. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This product does work, but it takes some time.  It&#x27;s also pretty hard on the skin.  I use it on my hands and arms, but would never use on my face.  I use very rich creams on the hands and arms since this is pretty drying. I also found that I needed to exfoliate, but the brown spots I hated so much are beginning to fade.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to to lighten marks received from hormone medicine and acne marks. It works excellent and I noticed a difference within two weeks. I would recommend this product to anyone who have tried ridding themselves of dark marks. in the past I&#x27;ve tried Ambi, Black Opel (it worked pretty good) and Palmers, but none can compare to Piona!</li>
    <li> I had to write this review.  I am writing this review because of how well the product works.  Worth your money!</li>
    <li> I just bought it after seen so many good review. I&#x27;m very happy with the results and l just used it  a few time. I really recommended.</li>
    <li> This is amazing it bleaches u in 4-5 days... like a big difference and it does it inna very even way! piona is simply the best on the market!</li>
    <li> I used the one with old packaging a while ago and it worked fine. It lightened spots in a week or less. I recently ordered the new one and even though it says that the formula did not change I suspect that it has. It does not lighten and it acutally causes bad breakouts. I&#x27;ve never broken out like this in my life and I attribute it to Piona. Now I&#x27;m on the search for a new bleaching cream for the dark spots that Piona has caused.</li>
    <li> love it.. have to re-order this one.. it really works</li>
    <li> It only take 3 application for the dark spot to disappear. With my regular bleaching cream it will usually take more then 2 weeks to see result.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream twice a day for about a month and it hasn&#x27;t made any dramatic changes to my skin. i cake the cream on and it hasn&#x27;t done as much as other claim. I will say it has slight improvedy complexion by giving it a slight clear look but it took about 4 weeks for me to see results. I would recommend but don&#x27;t get your hopes up to high!</li>
    <li> I am a dark skin African American female. My complexion is similar to the singer Kelly Rowland. I want to have lighter skin. I have used countless creams over and over again. I already know that its going to take me longer to get lighter because im really dark vs someone who is already light  I cant say if this works or not because i just started yesterday but i love updating my progress. It smells good to me and the cream is really light. Not like a thick cream. But i have been using the Kojic soap which i purchased from this site a few days ago it just arrived yesterday. I know the results dont happen overnight. But i am also thinking about getting hydroquine 20% on the Isiscosmetics site to speed up the process. So if this doesnt work in about a month. Im going to that but from the reviews it seem like it well. Will keep u all posted..good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...........Update...............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so its been a week since i been using this  cream and it works. But u most most exfoliate your skin with an exfolitator sponge or glove. I am lightening my whole body. And i see results. I exfoliate twice a day with the Kojic soap. Leave the soap on for 3 minutes and then exfoliate yur skin meaning scrub your skin. And then I use this cream. Parts of my face are turning lighter. So i know this product is working!! I also use the cream three times throughout the day. I am really dark like Kelly Rowland. People with darker skin tones it takes longer to see results but not if u exfoliate your skin. You should see results in a week....but remember i am CONSTANTLY scrubbing my skin and using cream afterwards. I may need to buy three at time for full body lightening along with the Kojic soap.</li>
    <li> This cream works and works fast, especially on dark skin. It is a but pricey but it works. People that are saying it darkens may not be using sunscreen. If sunscreen not used you will darken.</li>
    <li> Product is as described.Very impressed with the seller, got my order on time.. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for a relative who absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> I read so many good reviews that I decided give it a try. Was expansive but I tried anyway. And I am using for a while every night and morning but there no different at all. I tried in different parts of my body and is still the same. On my face, my underarms,  my knees, and is all the same.Was my last hope to make it lighter, so now Idk what to do... was waist of money and I am very unhappy with this product!  Can I send it back?</li>
    <li> It is an excellent cream bleach, my face and neck became brighter and glowing in only 2 days application!!&lt;br /&gt;it is very well much recommended who need to make the face, neck glow...&lt;br /&gt;Satisfaction Guarantee</li>
    <li> It did not work for me ,it broke my face out worst. And I bought the soap also  I hate I bought it and the lighten I didn&#x27;t see</li>
    <li> The product came real quick. I am dark brown and had two tone skin, lighter brown in my inside arm. I wanted to be all one color brown. After a  week in a half I did notice my skin was becoming one tone. out. I started using Ambi with the cream to speed up my results. I am real satisfied with my results now and one shade away from desired color. I have not made up my mind on getting one more bottle  yet but most likley will since I am about out. It did take time and I didnt go from dark brown to carmel. I did go from dark brown to a  lighter brown. I did use kojic soap and exfoliation everyday.  I will update later once I reorder(I also use suncreen faithfully which I never use to do).</li>
    <li> Make sure to have a good moisturizer. This was my first time using the piona line, but I quite like it! I can&#x27;t wait to see my long term results. I have only been using for a month, and not religiously but I can definitely see a difference.</li>
    <li> I just used on my elbows/lips n I really see difference...I order another 1</li>
    <li> Product is not effective</li>
    <li> I have Fitzpatrick type IV olive skin with sun damage that hyper-pigments from acne or other trauma. I was devastated that my dermatologist said I am too dark for laser treatment of my sun damage. I tried Lytera, which was expensive, and did nothing. I use Retin-A, which has helped a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piona has significantly faded the sun spots in just 4 weeks. I would give 5 stars, except the smell is not great and the texture is a little heavy, so you cannot wear under makeup. Not a permanent solution like a laser, but mejor que nada.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 1 star because its  40.00$ and DOES NOT WORK! I read great reviews on this product and, I don&#x27;t know why they lied this a horrible waste of money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I purchased this so I must say it works moderate. If it worked great I would have ordered again and again like I have done with other products and I have never purchased this product again. So...</li>
    <li> Its been  two weeks and no noticeable changes. A little disappoint.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks .... Wow awesome results.... I would highly highly highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s a little pricy but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I just received my order i am excited will be giving an update after i use it for a couple days</li>
    <li> piona cream is now one piece of s***, quality n quantity drops .poor results give dark cycle and acne. Not good at all for the face</li>
    <li> I bought this product 3 weeks ago and it didn&#x27;t do nothing to my skin .Its not worth it and please don&#x27;t buy it .It smells like laundry soup and doesn&#x27;t peel or bleach anything .I&#x27;m so disappointed ...</li>
    <li> Im a black woman with dark marks from mosquito bites that I&#x27;ve had on my legs for the last TWO YEARS. it keeps me from wearing skirts and dresses so I really needed something to clear up the scars. This item has helped some. the scars are old and went from dark brown to a reddish brown so it definitely is lightening them.  You must be careful where you put it because it can lighten the area around the scar too. Use a q-tip as an applicator and dab on the exact spot. It isn&#x27;t a miracle cream but has lightened them from dark brown to reddish brown. I received similar results with  a cheap hydroquinone cream but that cream did not work as quickly as this one so this one is better for me. It also extremely lightened newer scars I had so this is a keeper. Just have to be consistent with use and careful how and where you apply it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I saw results in approximately 4-5 days. I am definitely going to purchase more.</li>
    <li> Very small for the amount paid.</li>
    <li> It works miracles for my family</li>
    <li> It is an easy product to use, and it helps to fade the scars I&#x27;ve had for quite a few years. *I&#x27;m pleased with it, and would recommend it to friends</li>
    <li> I would never usually leave a review however this product has left awful results on my face. In only three days the product has caused my face to become extremely red and my blemishes which were previously not very noticeable are now bright red. I will discontinue use of this product as of now. This has been my first whitening cream and after these results, I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking to natural methods. If anything, my skin has turned darker. I am Asian if that helps you to decide whether or not the product is for you.</li>
    <li> really &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It has been over a month and I chose to still use it after 3 weeks.  I thought maybe because my skin was dark that it would probably take longer to see a change.  I have not seen any change at all.  I will use until the end of the month then I will stop if no change.  Its sad that I had no results from such expensive $40.00 jar of nothing.  ......ugh.  I really thought I would see results after all of the reviews that I read but not so.  Hopefully it will work for someone else. Good luck.</li>
    <li> My skin has gotten darker from working in the sun for years and I used it for less than a week and it works very well</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how fast this stuff worked. My old acne blemishes were lighter after just a few days use. I recommended it to my nephew and he got it as well. You just have to be careful because it will bleach your unmarked skin too. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Was not effective. Will not buy anymore!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a while,it work really well. The only problem I have is that when I first starting using it cost was 34.99 and from that 38.99 now 39.99. The price is increasing to much.....complaint from other people on the price....</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product to remove sun spots from my face and have been applying it as directed and have not seen any improvements.</li>
    <li> Is working, slowly but I can see some improvement. I see my melasma getting lighter. Is NOT gone but definitively improving.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for only 3 days and I already see a difference! I purchased the cream only, therefore, I will not proceed to the soap and body lotion. I&#x27;m excited! My skin is finally glowing! YOU MUST TRY IT!</li>
    <li> Product really works..it does take time but it&#x27;s worth it! Have patients..the dark spots didnt arrive over night..dont expect them to fade overnight. It works over time with consistent use!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again five stars all the way!!</li>
    <li> I am still observing the results.. So far i still didn&#x27;t see or notice any difference. Hopefully it&#x27;ll do justice on the price.</li>
    <li> Effective, get the job done.</li>
    <li> It works initially. I used it as part of my regiment since about April 14th until September 9, this made me bright and a few shades lighter I was already light brown Camel complexion, so initially it burn my face, I used aloe Vera from gnc, and a olay sunscreen, and anti aging cream and also Nadinola with it, I was not trying to bleach but to just lighten my under eyes. Skin was flawless, I was super afraid to stop using it because of all the comments about post darkening, so I been using it twice a day for months.... Fwd to September the results slow, it stopped, i started getting marks on the side of my eye on my cheeks hyperpigmentation... So I&#x27;m done with It altogether just nadinola never had problems with that</li>
    <li> I usually purchase piona strong bleaching cream from this company however, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same affects as it did the last time I purchased it.</li>
    <li> The reason i bought this cream was to help even out my skin tone which is slightly not a huge difference, so i thought it was going to work fast. I tested it out by putting some on my forehead where i have a small blemish mark, the cream only made my skin feel a burning sensation in which the next day my skin was a bit red and dry. i had also tested it out on my feet where i got a sunburn years ago and have a darker shade than my skin. I&#x27;ve been using the cream for about 3 weeks and have not seen NO RESULTS at all!! This cream does not have HYDROQUINONE which is the active ingredient in BEACHING CREAMS!!! Honestly very disappointing cream that is expensive and does not work what so ever!! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> This works great but be careful. I started seeing results after one week.  Some areas lightened faster than others.  I have suffered from cystic acne which left dark areas on my cheeks and jaw line.  Those areas are taking longer to lighten. I also have dark areas on my neck at my collar line which look like someone used a black magic marker on my neck.  This product lightened those areas as well in just one week!!!!  Make sure you use a sunscreen after you stop using this product. May I recommend Aveeno daily moisturizer which has a sunscreen built in.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best I have ever used.  It works effectively without the strong, harsh chemicals containing hydroquinone or mercury.  It lightens your skin gradually and naturally so that you don&#x27;t look bleached or washed out.  I went from a cocoa brown complexion to a light cafe au lait in about 3 weeks.  Maintaining this complexion is super easy and it doesn&#x27;t require daily use.  Also, my skin doesn&#x27;t turn darker after discontinuing use like some of the other products containing hydroquinone.  It&#x27;s kinda &amp;#34;pricey&amp;#34; but because it works so well without harsh side effects, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Works great. Got rid of my dark circles under my eyes and other little spots. I actually use this as a spot treatment. And my face is clear as if I wear makeup.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This does not work and it smells off if you want lighter,brighter skin go to isis website and order the 20% hdyroquoine cream.I&#x27;m so amazed at the results My skin is absolutely beautiful and there is a customer on there that actually shows before and after pics of her results.You get more for money too.I use the 20% hydro cream on my arms because they are darker than my body and it started peeling and show lighter skin underneath it&#x27;s truly amazing.I&#x27;m ordering another bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks and I cannot say it is working as I had hoped. Nothing drastic anyway.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed by this product. After doing much research on Piona, I finally purchased it hoping to see a significant difference in color on more darker areas of my body. Unfortunately, I had tried it on a small area on my face where I had very small dark spots. I specifically only applied on the spots, however after a few hours - I noticed that the area had become extremely red. And eventually became darker than the original color of the spot. I had no exposure to the sun that day, and the days following I applied SPF 50 before stepping out, and it became worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had decided to try on other areas of my body, including my underarms as well as a part of my legs. I had been applying it twice a day for the past 30 days and have not noticed any improvement on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I feel like I spent a lot of money for a product that does not even slightly make a difference on my skin. Perhaps it may just be me ( I am South Asian, naturally tanned skin) but my Garnier Dark Spot Overnight Peel which is 1/4 of the price, had shown me better results in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing from this seller either, as I had expressed to them my review and was sent a very rude &amp; unprofessional response.</li>
    <li> I am going to be brief and short.  I have tried every product out there to even out my skin tone and dark circles around my eyes and dark patches on my cheeks to no avail.  I have been using Piona products since March of 2014.  This product works extremely fast.&lt;br /&gt;My dark circles around my eyes and dark patches on my cheeks are disappearing and my complete face has lighten up considerably.  I will purchase this product again and I do recommend this product to anyone who are experiencing hyper-pigmentation.</li>
    <li> This product started working within one week.  I have no complain about it.  I am sooty that I did not find it earlier.  Very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I just received my cream so I haven&#x27;t used it yet. The reason why I gave it 1 star rating is because when I open my package half of the cream has spilled in the envelope it came in. I paid to much money for this cream &amp; it needs to be packaged better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male with the dark spots on my face, I used this product at first locally on the spots it took about 4days i already see big improvement I can tell you the spots are 85% gone, really impressive.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of great review so decided to buy it.  I was disappointed when I first used it, it redden my face so I stopped use it.</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my elbows and it didn&#x27;t work. I used it for about two months. Will not recommend it</li>
    <li> After reading all those great reviews, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this cream for the spots on my hands.  I guess I&#x27;m one of those people with very resistant skin.  After about a week or two, my spots seemed to actually get darker.  I figured maybe those areas would get dry and eventually flake off.  But no.  On the container, it says if it doesn&#x27;t work within 3 weeks to discontinue use.  I have kept using it anyway.  I&#x27;m in my fourth week, and I see no difference.  I&#x27;m SO bummed.  This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap, and I&#x27;ve had no results.  I&#x27;m very, very disappointed.  I really wish I could return it and try something else.</li>
    <li> Not working like they describe it. sorry, this is the true. If you don&#x27;t believe me than don&#x27;t. I just wanna share this with you..</li>
    <li> this is the only thing that has worked for me!!! good on sensitive skin. It makes you lighter but with a pale undertone. overall great product!!</li>
    <li> Ok, not really impressed.</li>
    <li> Horrible!!!!! Burned my face really bad with redness!  Smells like shoe polish ugh!  Makes you look as if you have been sunburned! Total waste of money and for the price please waste your money you will regret it!</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS FOR MOM AND HER SUN SPOTS WENT AWAY IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS. SHE EVEN ONLY APPLIED VERY LITTLE TO HER FACE. SO LITTLE, THAT WHEN HER FACE WAS CLEARED, SHE HAD MORE THAN HALF LEFT TO GIVE TO HER FRIENDS. HER FRIENDS EVEN HAD THE SAME RESULTS. MY MOM EVEN ORDERED TOP NAME-BRAND PRODUCTS LIKE CLEARCIL AND LOREAL BUT THIS HAD A MORE OF AN AFFECT ON HER. SHES SO HAPPY</li>
    <li> I have been using piona bleaching cream on my face and arms for 2 weeks now. I can notice a visible difference on my face. My face is lightening up gradually. I like that its a gradual process. I am sure that in a month, I will have achieved desired result. But this doesn&#x27;t seem 2 be doing much for my arms,or maybe the process is more gradual. I will be purchasing another soon,to continue working on my dark arms</li>
    <li> Nothing great and I hoped it would have faded spots but nothing impressive. It only moisturized and nothing else unfortunately</li>
    <li> I just start using it on the spots on my face and arms.  I have question. Can I use wrinkle face cream and body lotion over Piona creana?</li>
    <li> Two stars only because this cream lightened under my eyes well.  But after 3 months, it did not lighten my complexion evenly.  If you try to use it directly on spots it will lighten the area around the spot before it lightens the spot. Now I have to do more work to correct this--Ugggg--the ugly cream!</li>
    <li> This product is HORRIBLE for sensitive skin. Once I put on the cream it immediately turned red and blotchy. This lasted for about a week. I saw no lightning of my skin. will never buy this product again especially at a ridiculous price like this.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what it said  did not fade marks and its beens more than a month</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an AfricanAmercan female who is just trying to rid blemishes, but literally within one week and a half (two weeks at best) of using this morn and night I&#x27;ve turned 3 shades lighter lol so i panicked cuz I didnt expect it to actually work so fast and its not gradual. So my blemishes are def lightened but since my entire face is so much lighter i&#x27;ll only used on specific spots from now on. If you are like me and are just using for acne blemish, its tedious but JUST PUT ON SPOTS THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS FAST.</li>
    <li> Ok so I am a dark skinned black female and I can definitely say this cream works. My complexion is similar to Angela Bassett. I had a really big blemish on my chin and I applied this every day. I have high melanin, so I usually get dark scars. This definitely lightened the scarring up and seemed to even out my skin and made it soft. I do have to warn you as others have, only apply a small amount to the area needed and be careful of the surrounding area. I do have light spots on my skin now where I applied the cream where it wasn&#x27;t needed and it&#x27;s about 2 shades lighter. I started using this cream about June 9th every day non stop.</li>
    <li> Very bad smell, don&#x27;t waste your money.don&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I love this cream!!!!!! Amazing results and it works verrrrrrrrrry fast. When i read the other reviews i decided to try it and i am so grateful i did. The product shipped very fast and.</li>
    <li> So the reason I got this was because I have a bunch of acne scars on my face. I&#x27;m African American so the scars were black. I&#x27;m brown skin so the scars show up horribly. Any hoo, I don&#x27;t want to eggagerate so I won&#x27;t say I noticed a difference in the first few days. For sure I noticed the difference in the first week. Not only did it lighten up the scars, it lightened up my complexion in general. I had to start putting it on my neck too just so my neck would match my face. My chest and top of my arms are pale from wearing long sleeve shirts so I don&#x27;t have to worry about that, but I might start using it on my hands and legs. Oh, I used it on my knees and elbows and it made a big difference there too. People are staring to asked me am I mixed or am ISpanish because of how light my face got, I keep telling them it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s cold out ;). The only possible bad thing is that I noticed I broke out when I first started using this, the more I used it, the worse my skin got. Like I&#x27;m talking my whole face was covered in red pimples. I didn&#x27;t want new scars to worry about so I started using that new Proactiv. Perfect combination. The proactiv stops me from breaking out and this stuff is fading the old and new acne scars I have. That is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars; I think my skin was too sensitive and it was the reason I had that awful breakout. I will continue to buy this though because it does work.</li>
    <li> After one month of use i notices the change in my face and my friends are starting to notice that i look 3 shades lighter.</li>
    <li> I am a 50 something, dark skin African American male, and got a zit on my forehead on a stressful Christmas day in 2008. The zit eventually went away but it left a black scar that would not go away no matter what I tried, including 4% hydroquinone, herbal creams, vitamin E, you name it. It&#x27;s 2015 and I thought I would live with it for the rest of my life with it always being there in every photo I took. Then I tried Piona Strong Bleaching Cream. I have been using it for less than 2 weeks now and the scar from Hell is Gone! I can&#x27;t believe it! I also tried it on a black circle that had been under my right eye for over 15 years. It&#x27;s Gone! Thank you Piona, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a MIRACLE whitening cream. Works perfect. I have indian-olive skin and I have ugly darkening in my inner thighs and vulva that is way too darker than it should be. I have been so stressful about this over decades.  For years I&#x27;ve tried various products to lighten this area, but had no luck. It&#x27;s so embarrassing to wear a short or a swimsuit because of the apparent and disgustingly ugly darkening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and bought this product. (4oz), only in two weeks, I saw my inner thighs became 3 shades lighter. Then I applied it on my anus (dark spot at the opening, and vulva as well. Now it&#x27;s 3 weeks 3 days, after 8 0z of Piona cream, my vulva looks absolutely beautiful, inner thighs are almost the color of the rest of the body, and I am using it on my under arms now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream really works, I do not recommend this on the face though. Face gets exposed to sun and I am not sure how the sun can affect in the bleached skin on face. But for the aggressive and stubborn darkness on your skin, PIONA IS THE ONLY ANSWER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I like it because it&#x27;s quick working. Results are swift</li>
    <li> Very good product, does what it said it would do .</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the cream long; less than a month.  However, since I have been using the product, there is a very slight difference in the area I am trying to lighten, which is the back of my thigh right underneath my buttocks; for whatever reason that area of my body is as of a dark skin person and I am medium light skin complexion.  I will give the product more time for results I am look for, if not, then I will seek another product or get the real deal from a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> First time I buy this product. I have spots on my face called melasma. I&#x27;ve tried other bleaching creams before, nothing worked for me. I read other buyers&#x27; reviews and decided to try it. I started using this product on the same day it was delivered. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. I see a big difference already. I LOVE the results so far. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works big time for me. I am a woman of color. I have been using it on my face for the past month, and I am now around 3 shades lighter.  My was face is 2 shades darker than my body due to age and being the sun constantly.  I initially purchased the 1oz lotion and the soap. I was using both twice a day, but I am slowing down to once a day for the lotion and twice day for the soap. I don’t want to get too light (LOL). Its becoming noticeable and people have starting asking about my skin tone. I am very happy with the results. I am re-ordering the lotion again and also want to try the serum.</li>
    <li> Scum bags... Ordered 4 oz and they gave me only a 2 oz product. Buyers beware! Make sure you check if you get the right amount you ordered and paid for!</li>
    <li> Do not purchase! It left my skin very itchy,dry,and it began to turn red.</li>
    <li> Great product, makes skin shine but as far as bleaching, not at all or little. When I first got the product I thought it&#x27;s gonna change my skin to Micheal jackson, based on reviews. I tested first on my hand a little bit to see what it does cuz, am light brown, find out no biggy. I start using it on my dark spots on my neck and cheeks, it works I noticed some improvement. However, I noticed my face was kinda getting sensitive to the sun so wear sunscreen. otherwise,  It made my face so shiny and gave healthy feeling. Therefore if you looking for a bleaching cream to lighten your skin extremely, it is not for you. But it will give you shiny skin like I said, but not change much your color. it&#x27;s a great product, I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not good at all. It burned my skin. I used it twice a day for 4 days and instead of lighter dark spots I have burn marks red and painful. It was a waste of money. Now I have to see a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I saw absolutely no results from this product.</li>
    <li> I used it day and night and didnt work at all. I think i got darker from it. Too much money wasted. Not worth it!!</li>
    <li> This cream was a little harsh on my skin at first, but I used too much too often, but it&#x27;s part of my regime now and I love it. My skin just feels better.</li>
    <li> It is a good cream,  Did expect it to work a little faster.</li>
    <li> Wish I had more, this stuff was on it&#x27;s way to actually working.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product for better results use with the soap.  I highly recommend the body lotion for dark spots</li>
    <li> Does anyone know how long the skin stays bleached? Does it go back to the original color if you stop applying the product or does it last a while</li>
    <li> I have ordered this in the pass via a friend.  Couldn&#x27;t understand why I would get knots in my face when I start using. My skin tone was beautiful but I would have a kernel on my face.  I told my mom and she recommend putting it on for about 30mins to and 1 hour and then wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and so my skin was being smothered by the cream, which was creating extra oil. I do a great cleanse at least once a day and a toner, light vitamin E oil and then Piona.  It works for my skin.  You can see some difference in as little as two weeks.  I always get so many compliments on my skin.  I DO NOT GO IN THE SUN with this on my face.  I normal use it in the winter (morning and night) and in the summer at night only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smooches</li>
    <li> OK I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks. It seems like it&#x27;s doing something.  As for some of you saying it smells. It really smell like a strong lemon smell but the smell does not last. I did use Palmers and it does work put it smelled bad to me to i didn&#x27;t buy it anymore. I was just this really bad smell.  And the other one</li>
    <li> Works really well, needed for dark pot.</li>
    <li> I am a brown skinned African American female who suffers from extreme hyperpigmentation due to acne scarring. I purchased Piona May 15 2014 and immediately started using it. I noticed results within the first two weeks! It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or cause redness or anything. Now two months in 80% of my acne scares are almost completely gone. The only downside is that the skin around my scars are lighter as well so now when I apply I have to make sure to dab a very light amount being careful not to touch the skin that has not be scarred. I think that by October my skin will be completely clear.</li>
    <li> I do Alot off Amazon purchases according to reviews..not 1..2 or even 3 , but I read at least 20 before I make a purchase..Now piona. I have an EXTREME amount of old dark spurs around the bottom parts of my legs, ankles and top of feet..I have tried all sorts of bleaching creams too at least lighten them. I am a lighter skinned black woman and these marks are horrible looking..this is only day 4 that I&#x27;ve been using piona..what I&#x27;m doing is taking pictures of one spot in particular too see if there&#x27;s any change..Yes ..there is..subtle but visible..I will report back on a week or 2 with the truth..no exaggerations...no bs..just the truth..</li>
    <li> Hi I love this cream I&#x27;m so happy with my results, I have been using ambi for years on my face and neck not so much my forehead. Because I always wear bangs but when I want to stop I noticed how dark my forehead was I was not happy. So I kept trying and trying different creams nothing work until I found piona. But it took about 3 to 4 weeks before change happen I want to stop at first because it didn&#x27;t seem to be working. But I said let me use it I bought it . I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t it finally worked I&#x27;m so happy now. But I also exfoliate with ambi face soap also.</li>
    <li> As with most &amp;#34;bleaching cream&amp;#34; it takes time, however it does work. I ordered it twice. I use it for my elbows and my daughter uses it for her legs.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT. WORKS FAST. I DID EXPERIENCE A SMALL BREAKOUT ON MY CHEEK BUT I DON&#x27;T CARE BECAUSE I LOOK SO GOOD! WORKS GREAT ON DARK  AFRICAN AMERICAN SKIN.</li>
    <li> This really works!! I used it for my face and forearms due to sun damage and tanning  and people say that I look lighter. It&#x27;s really strong (:</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product for dark elbows, came across this and Wow...I&#x27;m so happy I took a chance and ordered. It has turned my elbows from very dark &amp; rough to light &amp; soft. If you&#x27;re having issues with any part of your body that is dark please try this, you&#x27;ll be happy you did!! Use with the Piona soap and it will work faster. Will be ordering again!! I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Really works</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. They won&#x27;t give you your money back.</li>
    <li> I want to give this five stars but...for 2 reason I give this product 4 stars...first they went up on the price second the affect is slowing down....I want buy as much now because of the price...plus my face is can of getting use to it...not having the same affect I&#x27;m guessing because of too many times of using it. I think this is my 3rd time ordering this. I did tell another person about this and they only got a small improvement. I guess it different for some people. Well I this my reason for 4 stars. Shipping was fast and product it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really has lightened by dark spots. The only problem is that my skin has turned a bit red in the process but hopefully that will fade soon</li>
    <li> I bought this product for dark underarm spots... within a month of daily use, morning and night... they are 80% lighter, and I still have another two weeks worth of product. I will recommend to use a collagen and retinol along with this product, because dark armpits are a result of lack of hydration, and lack of removal of toxic deodorant use, so use a loofah to remove dead skin. This past month i haven&#x27;t used deodorant (no need), I only used this cream, and the collagen to promote new cells. After this treatment I recommend the use of a DIY deodorant option such as coconut oil, cornstarch , peppermint oil and baking soda, and twice a week scrubbing of armpits, many recipes online, Good luck &#x3D;) happy customer....</li>
    <li> I am an african american woman (Gabrielle Union&#x27;s complexion) about to turn 30 years old in a few months. After giving birth to my daughter 9 years ago, I noticed a hyperpigmentation mark across the bridge of my nose aka mask of pregnancy. And about 3 years ago, I started getting bad acne on my cheeks and chin resulting in dark spots. So for the last 9 years off and on, I have been trying different bleaching creams to get rid of this mark and to get rid of the acne scars. I was so embarrassed and had to pile lots of makeup to cover up. On Feb 12, 2014 I ordered Piona and recieved it on Feb 17, 2014. I put the cream only on the acne scars and the hyperpigmentation on my nose at night before bed. I am happy to report after all these years, the mark on my nose is 95% GONE!!! So I&#x27;m thinking a couple of more weeks it will be gone completely :) The acne scars have faded about 85%!!! I wear less makeup and my skin is returning to its original pre-acne and pre-hyperpigmentation state! I HIGHLY recommend this product!! I will forever keep this in stock! :)</li>
    <li> I am using this product to mainly lightly old acne scars and I definitely saw improvement by the first week. I started using the cream on 2/14/14 and it&#x27;s already lightened my scars enough to where I feel comfortable going out with foundation, which is something I would have never done just a couple weeks ago. Also, I have very oily,acne prone skin and this doesn&#x27;t break me out at all which is always a concern for me when trying a new product. I have also used this product on my elbows, arm pits and knees and it&#x27;s working well on thoes areas as well eventhough I don&#x27;t use it everyday on those places. The cream is thick and one jar should last a good month or so. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This cream really work good,I add little bit of the serum to it it clear all the dark cycle I&#x27;ve around my eyes,my hands and my feet.it actually start working within four days.it work like magic,I will recommend it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do nothing for my skin</li>
    <li> This is the best skin lighting cream ever!!!! Less then a week I already see my self getting lighter.</li>
    <li> came with sealed broken, don&#x27;t look like it was used, but look like the seal melted off , anyways its ok.</li>
    <li> It did not work at all.  A waste of money!</li>
    <li> Not working as its supposed to be.</li>
    <li> It caused me to have an allergice reaction and inflammation that remained on my face for a week. It did not help me at all like it did my sisters</li>
    <li> This cream is the total waste of money.  It smells terrible!  I mean I will tolerate the smell if the product works.  I have been using past 4 months religiously,  I do not see any difference.  Addition to that, it makes me break out.  If I could, I would give zero star. I am a beauty product junkie. I have not seen any produce as ineffective as this.</li>
    <li> I started using this product and saw results in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I HAD darkening on my temple areas due to adult acne and razor-burn. It was making me look older.  It&#x27;s been 3 weeks now.  The darker skin is gone!  I saw a doctor about a dime-size black mole on my cheek.  He wanted to simply lance it off.  I wanted to wait.  I started applying the cream to the mole.  It took about 5 days before I saw any results, but once it started the cream literally dissolved the mole off!  It&#x27;s now about 97% faded.  I feel much better.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I have been using it for years. I will be ordering this product again. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream after all the reviews. I am a dark skin African American  and i actually have to slow down using this cream,, since my face have gotten so light. I have used expensive dermatologist recommended creams costing over $100.00 an oz  and it did not work like this. My only problem is that I did not put it on my neck, did not expect it to wok or work so fast. I am lightening up my neck and shoulders now and slowing down application to my face. It is working for me .  I have never written a review before but felt I needed to share this especially for dark skin</li>
    <li> I have a farmers tan, it&#x27;s slow but it&#x27;s working</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago. I wanted to give it a bit before a wrote a review.  I am a medium dark brown skinned AA Woman. I purchased this product because I&#x27;m a trucker and was hit in the face with a trailer door. Ikr {{OUCH}} anyway. After my giant hickey went down I was left with the black eye from hell that wouldn&#x27;t go away.  I followed the instructions and took heed to the reviews.  I applied a very thin layer and I used a Qtip so that I was sure to make contact with only the affected area. I saw results in just 3 days. This stuff is powerful!  If u aren&#x27;t trying to change u skin tone entirely I recommend that u use something other that ur fingers to apply it. I wasn&#x27;t trying to lighten my beautiful mahogany skin tone. Just put it back the way it was originally lol...it worked so well and I had so much left over I started using it to lighten dark spots on scars. Great product! Very satisfied! Ok so I am here to add to my review.  Unfortunately I hv very bad news. I initially had such great results that I purchased a second container for other areas of my body where I had dark spots. I started noticing that the area around my eye had these small light spots and my skin texture started changing. before I knew it my entire face had erupted it with all these bumps, dry patches and blemishes. I have always had beautiful smooth mahogany dark skin.this product has completely destroyed it. It&#x27;s been months since I stopped using the product and my skin is still in complete turmoil.  I regret ever touching this product. I fear my face will never be the same.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> This totally works!! I would recommend to any one who wants a clearer complexion.</li>
    <li> I only used for 2 weeks, I turned from darker skin toned to a brown skin toned, blemishes are about gone, I had to order more to get my body the same color as my face. Great product..I have pictures coming for results...</li>
    <li> This burned my skin so bad awful product</li>
    <li> You know what&#x27;s funny? The ingredients for this product aren&#x27;t listed, nor can they be found through any online resource. Additionally, inquiring minds have asked, yet the question goes unanswered. How odd. The only thing people have said is whether or not it&#x27;s working for them, and how bad it smells. I&#x27;m sure the ingredients are listed somewhere on the container. It would be nice if the company could tell us what they are selling. Before you splurge and spend 40 bucks on a product that may or may not work for you, find out what&#x27;s in it to make an informed decision. And if anyone out there could help us out, we&#x27;d appreciate it.</li>
    <li> This is good product, bought one bottle first just to see then two more after! is a little expensive&#x27; but is worth it, smooth my face and clear it.</li>
    <li> This product came to me packaged well for shipment. The product itself its works ok so far.  The areas i use this cream on have definitely faded, not gone, just faded.  I believe if i use the product long enough it will fade the areas more with time.</li>
    <li> Saw a difference in 3-8 days and my dark patches were gone in 2 weeks! For more info and tips email me!! If you want to se my before &amp; after pics email me aswell! karyna.fierros23@gmail.com</li>
    <li> ! This product really works and worth your money.  I buy this product reguarly because I love them so much and now I can&#x27;t leave without it.  My skin is 3x lighter and with no blemishes or dark spots.  My skin looks flawless, lighter and younger with this product. Thanks PIONA and the makers of the this amazing cream.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing but STRONG. Perfect for spot treating or all over but beware, I was spot treating for a week because there was a particularly dark spot I was trying to get rid of and now that spot is WAY lighter than the rest of my face. You live and you learn. The product has lasted me about a year with regular use and I will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> ONE OF THE BEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this creme. A little expensive but it really works. Does not stain your white clothes. Might have to get use to the smell but you totally see the difference on skin tone within a week or less.</li>
    <li> horrible product. I was thinking that because of the high pricing and positive feedback, that this item would work to it&#x27;s full advantage but turns out to be just one of those products that is cheap and can be found in drug stores.</li>
    <li> I used this cream both morning and night after thoroughly washing my face.  I don&#x27;t think it works.  Perhaps I needed to use it for 3 weeks straight and see.  I&#x27;ll try it again because of how much money I spent on it.  At first I thought it was working, but it was just an illusion. Sort of like the placebo effect!</li>
    <li> I used this cream twice. The first time only applying it to the dark spots and leaving it on for 5 minutes. The next night I put on all over both my cheeks, and left it on over night (which was probably stupid) but it burned my skin, leaving me red for a full week, and then just darkened the entire area that the cream had been applied to. So now not only are my dark spots still there, but I have larger dark spots from this cream.</li>
    <li> I wish I was one of the people it worked for but alas.  I bought this to clear up the razor bumps left from years of shaving.  I applied it twice a day, as directed, and used it with the brightening soap, as recommended.  Nothing, barely a shade increase. Sadly, another brand bites the dust after you try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> Used it for a month or more did nothing for me. Saw not even the slightest results. I&#x27;m a brownskin black female with a few unwanted dark spots. Applied morning n nite on troubled spots, only my face at nite since it has too much moisturizer to wear during the day for me.The smell is strong but not unbearable. This was a waste of my money. That is all.</li>
    <li> Worked for a min but turned my dark spots even darker and noticeable!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not sure what the difference is between this 4oz jar and the last jar I purchased which was 2oz. The 2oz jar worked really well and rather quickly. I cant say I&#x27;ve seen any improvement with this jar which seems weird to me. I don&#x27;t know if its the company or what but I haven&#x27;t seen anything from this particular purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with kojic soap. I&#x27;ve been using both for about 3 years and thru TRIAL and ERROR the below is the routine which works best for ME. When I first started using  Piona it made my skin sensitive. I started buying an aloe leaf ($1.99 at any supermarket) and applying it 10 minutes after I applied the cream and the irritation stopped. Be careful and only use on area which you want to lighten at first if you want an even skin tone. Also use sunscreen daily (sometimes 2x a day (I&#x27;m in Florida) and nighttime anti-aging cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply to dark spots 2x a day (morning and evening) for two-three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Next month apply to spots in the morning and entire face in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;Next month apply daily in the evening&lt;br /&gt;Next month use every other day in the evening&lt;br /&gt;Stop using and apply for a few weeks if I notice any spots. Treat spot immediately when darkening is noticed or you&#x27;ll have to begin routine again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People compliment me all the time on my skin and say I look 15 years younger than I am. GOOD LUCK!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m mistaken for being 15 years younger than I am all the time</li>
    <li> One star stands for &amp;#34;HATE IT&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s my exact expression. I&#x27;m so mad I wasted money on this pathetic product. I started on March 31 and used it twice every single day. It&#x27;s July 17, 2015, that&#x27;s over a month and I haven&#x27;t seen a single change/improvement. It really sucks because the scar I&#x27;m using this cream for is very small and it&#x27;s not even that dark.  DO NOT BUY IT, dead serious, this product is pathetic. Buy this only if you want to throw away $45. Some people are complaining from the smell, the odor isn&#x27;t strong at all, and the cream texture is fine, the only problem is that it DOESN&#x27;T work. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ UPDATE: 9/19/2015  I stopped using the product. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of questions and decided to write a full review.  1) It&#x27;s way over priced 2) The smell isn&#x27;t bad, in fact it has a very light scent that fades away. If you&#x27;re referring to the smell as &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; then you&#x27;re probably packing too much product  3) It doesn&#x27;t work. It really sucks, but it doesn&#x27;t do the job it&#x27;s titled for. I used it for more than 4 months, the max is 4 months and throughout the process I didn&#x27;t see any difference/improvement.  4) The color of the cream does get darker over time, once this happens you should discontinue it because it basically means the chemicals&#x27; job stopped is no longer active.  5) YES, it does make you break out. I didn&#x27;t experience any breakouts at first but after awhile I brokeout on my forehead and it sucks! I don&#x27;t break out, and that really stressed me out.  6) This was my routine:  - used it twice a day, in the a.m and p.m for more than 4 months  - used sunscreen when I got out in the sun to help boost it&#x27;s activation  - kept my face clean Yet, it still didn&#x27;t work.  You all need to note that each person&#x27;s skin is different, but products that promise something should at least show some improvement-- this did nothing.. So don&#x27;t waste your money. Don&#x27;t buy it. Go buy something else thats a lot cheaper and SMALLER, start with a smaller oz just in case it doesn&#x27;t work out.</li>
    <li> I hardly ever write reviews but this deserves a review. Its excellent product, very strong use wisely, I look like a white woman in just a month, I stopped using it for a while to get my colour back because I am way to pale but truth be told this cream is good!</li>
    <li> Please do not use this product. it burns your skin. My face all got red and started giving me burning sensation.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m always skeptical when buying products like this but definitely worked. I have fair/dark skin, and I&#x27;ve been playing soccer since 6 years old usually in summer at 90F at noon, so my arms and face are really dark and sunburned because of those years, and I also had acne spots in my face that don&#x27;t look good. So I decided to give this product a try and started by putting in my face. Everyday twice a day, morning and night religiously, in the morning before work I would put a thin layer along with sunscreen. After 3 weeks my face went brighter. I couldn&#x27;t believe it, I felt like a miracle lol, it looks even now with the color of my chest. So decided to try it in my neck too that is really dark and it is getting clearer. This is the product to go, I would recommend it to anyone, I&#x27;m planning to buy it next to lighten my arms that are really dark an uneven.</li>
    <li> Last year I had an ingrown hair that became infected and turned into what looked like a cystic acne spot. It stayed infected for about six months and after was left with an ugly scar.  I had the scar for about three months before trying piona. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day almost three weeks without much luck but then yesterday I go to apply it and can hardly find the scar at all!! I&#x27;m so happy. I never thought the scar would fade!  It&#x27;s a big jar and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m sure, like most bleaching creams, the results probably aren&#x27;t permanent, and you will probably have to maintain the results by applying cream periodically even after the scar has faded. Anyway, I am really happy with my results and would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Was a bit surprised by the costly price however I decided to try the item anyway. This item comes highly recommend in the black community which was the deciding factor for me. I have dark skin with even darker marks. Was really starting to look my age.although it does have a slight smell I wouldn&#x27;t care what it smells like if it does what it meant to do. I love this product just because it works. That simple. Who gives a damn about the slight smell if it works! For the first time in over ten years I&#x27;m able to use less foundation and or go without make up and be alright with it. Buy it. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> I bought this product last year March 2013 and I used it to lighten my skin after a long vacation in the sun, started using around March 2013 and by April 2013 people who hadn’t seen me then noticed the difference. This is perhaps one of the only things that work for me.  Now if I could only find a body product this effective. Love it…its now Oct 19 2014, I am still using it in small amounts in troubled areas and I think I am stuck on this item until I find something else.</li>
    <li> I got this because my skin had darkened at least two shades from being out in the sun.  It did lighten my skin, in about five days I saw my skin at least three shades lighter.  However it lightened the skin but left a lot of dark blotches.  As soon as I stopped using the product my skin darkened within two days.  For the price.....disappointed.</li>
    <li> After receiving Piona skin bleaching cream . I quickly  applied it on my sun spots and continued to use it each day as directed . Within four days of using this product, I noticed the sun spots  are beginning to fade . I have been applying a light coat on my upper eye lid brow for dark circles and after the 7th day the creepiness around my eye is almost gone . Be extra careful not to get it into the eyes . I use a q tip and applied a thin coating only .I have actually noticed an expression wrinkle has been smoothed out after using this cream.  I was like \\&quot;wow\\&quot; . I highly recommend this product . Thank you so much .</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, used it for about a month now and notice nothing on my body, only a little difference on my face but its not strong enough for the body, not going to purchase any more, save your money, purchase cheaper product that work charms.</li>
    <li> will never order again. does not work! i bought to use on scars and darkareas if my body 3 weeks later nothing has changed!</li>
    <li> this product bleach my skin then darken it beyond recognition. do not purchase this product.</li>
    <li> This product indeed slightly lightened some of the previous acne scars/hyperpigmentation on my cheeks and jaw line, but it also caused severe dryness. I now have several patches of very dry skin on my face on each area where I put the cream. I&#x27;m going to have to exfoliate and moisturize alot to get my skin back to the same smoothness/texture.  As far as duration, I used this product both morning and night on scar areas only for three weeks since three weeks is the max time suggested on the package.  I didn&#x27;t give one star because it did slightly lighten.  Just not worth it because now I have to deal w/ another problem (severy dry patches).  I read about Rose Seed Hip oil being a natural way to lighten scars. May give it a try!</li>
    <li> This cream help me tremendeous, I had lots of dark spot on my feet and they are almost off</li>
    <li> Had to stop using it because it made me break out every time I used it. I really wanted to like this product and see the results after viewing the other reviews.</li>
    <li> It has an unpleasant smell and discolored fast.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend this product. NO, NO, NO!</li>
    <li> After day 4-5 of using this cream nightly, my facial skin got so light I had to STOP using this  cream for a week. However, on the 8th day after I stopped using this cream, I woke up to find EXTREMELY dark/black shadows all around my eyes - above eye lids and under eye areas! Looked like my eyes were blackened from a fight! :(  The darkening is the worst it has ever been and suggests skin damage! Waaay darker than before using this cream! I got scared and had to use a concealer to cover the under eye darkness as well as the areas above my eye lids. It was dreadful &amp; scary looking! Hands &amp; feet also got darker after I stopped applying this cream for 2 weeks! DO NOT use this cream on the eye areas, hands or feet because when you take a break from it, the results will be disappointing and your natural complexion will be waaay darker; 3 shades darker than the original skin tone you started out with. I have now resorted to using a regular fade cream to repair the damage skin to the eye areas, hands &amp; feet. Since I had ordered both the cream &amp; the Serum together, I had switched to using the Serum strictly on blemishes only; with the hopes that I would not experience the same aftermath as with the use of the cream but decided to not use the serum either! Will throw out! Not worth the risk of further skin damage that will probably take months to repair! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CREAM due to the dreadful aftermath once you stop using this cream.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that it worked well for me.</li>
    <li> i have adult acne and use this ONLY on the actual blemish....it lightens the spot really fast. If your trying to lighten spots, just dot a small amount on the actual spot, be careful because it will lighten the area around the spot too, so you have to be precise.  could be a a little time consuming but i do this a night and days where im home all day. It works better than ambi.</li>
    <li> Piona helped me it remove the spots and i am very satisfied. I would like to get more of this cream.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this product would work but in a few days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw changes instantly... IT doesn&#x27;t irritate skin in sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Very effective and works within weeks. Use your sunblock and only put it on your spots you want to fade first.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on the reviews.  I have dark spots on my face,  after using this product for almost 3 weeks. I noticed that the area has started to lighten and the text of my skin feels smoother.</li>
    <li> My friend purchased this and I saw the amazing results when I returned from my five week vacation this summer so I purchased for myself. I do see changes but you have to use at least 2x a day to see results.</li>
    <li> This product won&#x27;t lighten your skin dramatically, but it has slightly faded my acne scars. I noticed I&#x27;ve gotten many blackheads on my face since using this cream. It clogs your pores. Be sure to use acne/blackhead treatment on your skin as well. Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it, but it will not provide dramatic results if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re expecting.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have adult acne and since i have dark skin i scare very dark. On both side of my cheek bone, i had really dark spots. I&#x27;ve tried many things but the Piona cream really worked to lighten the scars. On certain spot it worked a little too much... LOL. So be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT HONESTLY THIS IS THE ONLY CREAM THAT WORKED.</li>
    <li> Love it works for me!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 10 days on my underarms and I can already see the top layer of my skin peeling! Good purchase. I&#x27;m black and I&#x27;ve had some experience with prescribed lightening creams for scars and you must moisturize after every time you use it(at night)! Wear sun screen(in the day) no matter what your complexion is or what season, inside or out! Or else your skin will dry out and become darker. Even after you&#x27;re done with the treatment continue moisturizing and sun screen for at least a week. Also Do Not use it around you Eyes! There&#x27;s very thin skin there already. It can make the bags around your eyes look dark because of the lack of skin</li>
    <li> So far its working i just got the product about a week go and i miss a couple days putting it on... but the days i put it on i see alil change and from now on ima put it on day and night ...so iil give it about 3 more weeks and iil write another review about this piona .....oh and it does have a smell to it but i can still handle it</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of the SLS (sodium Laurel Sulfate) in this jar but if nature could make something as strong as this then I&#x27;m on board! This jar comes with a nice amount. I noticed a difference the second use. My two toned forehead is now even colored. I am happy with this product. I will say that you definitely MUST wash your face after each use in the morning and at night to avoid pimples. Especially if you are reapplying in the same spot. A little goes a long way. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I *HIGHLY* recommend this cream. Don&#x27;t expect overnight results but with persistent use dramatic results from years of sun damage. I will never be without this in my house.</li>
    <li> This stuff really, really, really works. I have been using it for the last 3 months and it&#x27;s worked wonders not only on my face, but my legs and arms as well. I usually mix it with moisturizing lotion (Nivea) and it&#x27;s been good. Non greasy, no strong smells, and it makes the skin soft while clearing any discolorations. My God, this stuff is the best. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product and I will. Keep using my knees and toes are lightening up so fast and it&#x27;s staying, I will order some more shortly. The smell is awful but hey it works. I&#x27;m going to mix it with bio-oil starting tonight and see if there is any difference. Be careful your nails will turn brown if you don&#x27;t want your hands afterwords...</li>
    <li> Second jar I&#x27;ve gotten.  The first one was 2 oz. This one is 4 oz i think? The 2 oz lasted maybe a month or two?  I&#x27;m med to dark skinned with some spots I cover with make-up. I&#x27;ve gotten lighter but so have the spots.  Its not a quick fix, but it does work. Not as fast as others state but in a month you will notice a difference. If you want to fade spots. That maybe difficult unless you have a couple bigger areas or alot of time to dab each small spot. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the positive reviews from brown skin women like my self who swore that it works and I was very disappointed after using this for weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any difference on the scar on my leg.</li>
    <li> I thought the results would be much more noticeable than they are. I&#x27;m still using the product because I still have hope that it will produce better results. I have been using it now for about 1 1/2 months. The only great thing so far is the size of the bottle. It is long lasting because I don&#x27;t have to use much of it. I just wish the results were more satisfying.</li>
    <li> I must say this really does lighten the skin, even the skin tone very well.. I use it twice a day.. in the morning and before bed.. I got the 4oz bottle it was  shipped out pretty fast. I think the cost was well worth it for how well it performs</li>
    <li> The best of them all.</li>
    <li> This is the worst cream ever! Originally, I was satisfied with the results after the first two weeks, but then I noticed my skin started to feel rashy and tough in the areas where I used the cream. I stopped using this cream immediately, but noticed within a week that the areas where I used it at were darker than before the original use of the cream!</li>
    <li> This cream doesnt even deserve one star! I bought this cream because of the good reviews but now I&#x27;m starting to feel like a lot of people LIED. I&#x27;ve been using this product for only about a week. The first couple of days it made my skin feel supple, dewy and youthful. I used it both day and night.  I woke up on the 7th day and out of nowhere i had a rashy breakout on the entire right side of my face from the upper neck all the way up towards my temple.  IM NOT USING THIS PRODUCT EVER AGAIN. No lightening effects just damaged rashy skin.  Dont do it to yourself!!! This review is 100% authentic and i hope it saves someone from making a terrible mistake!!</li>
    <li> I use 3 items together. The bleaching soap cream and the lotion. I see no difference. . Just a waste of money. Smells bad to.</li>
    <li> I love this cream it fades the ache darks spots super fast. No side affect s. It&#x27;s PERFECT!!!! Its a must have fade all blemishes... Whooo wooo</li>
    <li> I used a QTip and applied it directly on my dark spots on my chest for two wks and cleared right up! Great for blemishes but use directly on dar spot otherwise will lighten surrounding area</li>
    <li> This cream is totally worth the money, so don&#x27;t let the price scare you off just yet! I&#x27;m African American, and for years, YEARSSSSSSS I&#x27;ve wasted money on products and thousands of other things under the sun (even at home chemical peels) that haven&#x27;t worked for my (previous, no longer) dark underarms! ....I was seriously at wits end, and I almost gave up, almost going to a dermatologist (but I didn&#x27;t want to because I was too emberassed)- but I stumbled upon this cream just in time.  I&#x27;m a medium brown skin color, kinda like Carmel, but my armpits were coal BLACK. Very emberassing, and I was forced to always wearing long sleeves and couldn&#x27;t wear tanktops or bathing suits unless I kept my arms to my side without lifting them. Within a month of using this cream my underarms turned EXTREMLY light, almost white. This cream works so well, and it IS very strong. It actually worked too well, and I had to cut back on it because my underarms were getting too white. Try it! This stuff is no joke! It really works. In this case you really DO get what you pay for! :)</li>
    <li> I used it for my acne dark spots. Three days into putting on spots over night and morning, I got completely burned from it. The red marks are so much worse than my original brown spots. Cant even cover them with concealers. Im returning this strong chmical that delayed the healing of my scars instead of bleaching them...</li>
    <li> This actually works. But be careful that it may leave a lighter tone than desired. I used it on my face and it worked within a day or two.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying beauty products but I&#x27;ve not been really good at using them long-term. Part of the reason is that my skin is sensitive and I break out easily. I skeptical about this product at first because it&#x27;s not popular but I gave it a go based on reviews and boy was I really happy I did. I noticed a big difference in my face and scars. It lightened up but not like pasty white. I use it regularly since I received it. My routine isn&#x27;t complete without applying it on my face. I don&#x27;t break out while on this product.</li>
    <li> GREAT ON KNEES AND ELBOWS !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Recently purchased this and it smelled terrible and didn&#x27;t do a thing. I applied it on religiously to the areas I was hoping to lighten, and they didn&#x27;t change at all which was surprising considering all these good reviews. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Updating after using over a week and no change at alll..was hoping so.much this will help...I dont understand how it worked for the rest of the reviewers...</li>
    <li> Being on a splint for most of 9 weeks (Summer time) after I tore a ligament on my right hand, it left me a horrible looking tan line! I was self-conscious about it so I got myself the bleaching cream.  By applying it after shower (once a day) and not as directed, I noticed a huge difference 2 weeks later.  The whole arm color actually evened out.  My mom has liver spots on her arms and it also helped lessened her discoloration.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell and it dries the skin mildly (-1 star ) otherwise it is a very effective whitening product.</li>
    <li> amazing product i have used so many bleach creams and i think this one is by far the best. there is many other bleach creams out there that work great the only problem for me is that i have oily skin problems and every time i used them i will just break out and get a lot of pimples. piona on the other hand is a great product that works amazing bleaching your face without  leaving the oily residue the next day even if you wash your face</li>
    <li> I noticed this lightening my face in a matter of 2 weeks. I am a dark chocolate girl, from the Caribbean. This is a smaller bottle than expected but it goes a long ways. I have been using mine for over a month and there is a quarter left. I am using it every day twice a day, on my face and neck. I am noticing it badly lighten my neck, but my far is definitely more than 3 shades lighter than it was before using this. When I use to wear mascara, I could not notice my lashes because my skin was so dark, but now I can tell that I have gotten so much lighter because my mascara pops. This definitely works, at least on dark chocolates like myself.  I bought the skin lotion along with this and got all excited it would do the same to my skin… it didn&#x27;t do s***. SO I might just buy this and use it on my legs and arms too</li>
    <li> Very effective product. Works very well.</li>
    <li> Product worked slightly, but the day I stopped I broke out so bad like never before. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this I&#x27;ve never suffered from&lt;br /&gt;Acne this sucks.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderfull I couldn&#x27;t believe that anything would make my dark spots go away I ordered this product on Febraury 26 got it March 7 I used it twice a day after one month I noticed a big difference it did a really pleasant job I fell in love with it totally and I recommend it and this is a really honest review coming from the heart I am going to order it for my mom and my sister cuz this is my true miracle.</li>
    <li> From the first day that i started using this product I saw results right away.  The second day I got two shades lighter. This product is very powerful indeed. I think I will purchase the soap to just to experiment</li>
    <li> i bough this product upon reviewing several past customer review and i must say, am amazed at the result. Good for anyone trying to light dark areas of the body</li>
    <li> This is the best cream ever. I have been using it with the Kojic acid soap and oh my amazing results.  I use it mornings and nights and after a week I am a shade lighter. I made sure I washed my face with the soap 2-3 times and waited for my skin to completely dry before using the cream so it could be absorbed properly. I also rub the cream in and have it lay on my skin for 30sec before i start massaging it in. My skin glows and I feel amazing. I will definitely have one from now on. Dont forget to wear sun blocker when you go out though.</li>
    <li> This creme is amazing. I&#x27;m in the process of getting rid of blemish marks and in one week I&#x27;ve seen results. I recommend this to anyone who needs to have dark spots removed.</li>
    <li> it was what I expected. I had a scar and applied a dot to it and lightened in 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, I don&#x27;t use it everyday and already seeing the result. It&#x27;s too small tho. They should make it a little bigger</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had an allergic reaction to a lip product and my normally pink lips turned very dark brown, almost black.  I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for about a week and  my lips are almost back to their regular color.  I&#x27;m so pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> sorry guys... i had HIGH HOPES for this product based on some of the reviews, but i was HIGHLY disappointed.  i am a caramel complexioned black woman and have several dark spots/scars from mosquito bites from last summer that i wanted to fade before this summer ... i treated the areas EVERYDAY and i&#x27;m now at the bottom of the jar and honestly, there is only a SLIGHT change to the discoloration and that probably would have occurred without any treatment!  i do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This crème really works, within two weeks my entire face was evened out! I never seen results that quick before. . .</li>
    <li> Ok so, let me brag about this product because im in love. My neck / chest were so much lighter than my skin and thats what the sun does to you right!? So I decided to purchase this product after reading the reviews and HOLY Shiiishhh.. It works. Today is my seventh consecutively day of  using Piona.. lovinggggg the results so muchhh.&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to mention that it has a strong smell and it itches but hey... it works.</li>
    <li> I read most of the review abt  how fast result were n how well it worked for a majority,  So I decided to make a purchase. Im happy I did, results came fast n quick. It took literally  a week. Be careful as it really will lighten you up. Am afican american and I have a light brown skin tone. But face however is pretty dark from moving to FL. But since I moved back home to ohio this cream has been working wonders. I had to give it a break for about a week. Because I was getting to light.</li>
    <li> Very good work well love it!</li>
    <li> I used this bleaching cream over a month ago and figured now would be a good time to write a review since it has been awhile. I used this cream on my overly dark nipples and my arms because they were a lot more tan than the rest of my body (I am pretty fair skinned too, I just have a yellow under-tone). So I used it on my nipples morning and night and it worked incredibly well, phenomenally, in fact. I used to be very uncomfortable with my breasts because of my dark nipples, and now they look decently normal. My arms lightened up fairly well, and even occasionally I would use it on my entire body just to brighten it up as I have pretty dull looking skin. One down side was the fact that it made my cheeks look pretty red, like I was constantly blushing, but after a few hours it went away. It never burned my skin though, and was never drying. Everything is still as pale as they had been even though I stopped its use for a month or so. Very impressed, and just ordered another one a few minutes ago.</li>
    <li> Ok so I recently received my order on the fifth of febuary, and let me jus say I loveeeee it. Its has worked less than ten days, and has worked evenly. My skin is really dark and my neck is even darker so im still giving the neck time to catch up. My skin is glowing, becoming more even its give me this foundation look &amp; I ♥♡ it.</li>
    <li> I wouldnt really know if this is working. It isnt unpleasant which is good</li>
    <li> It worked even though I only applied it about three times a week. I had a very dark spot on the left side of my face about the size of a nickel just below eight smaller black spots the size of BB&#x27;s. The large spot is completely gone the smaller ones are about half as dark and I can see they are getting lighter and will be skin colored in a few months.</li>
    <li> It does work. Just not as quickly as I thought. But it does I&#x27;m fact work. It has significantly lightened dark spots on my body including my under arms and thighs. I&#x27;m a dark skinned woman and I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ve finally found something that works.</li>
    <li> I am already fair-skinned, but I was hoping to eliminate the vestiges of my last tan. The cream had a very mild effect, but not enough for me to spend the money to purchase again.</li>
    <li> This stuff irritated my face like crazy. I broke out in a rash so bad I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Fourth time ordering! &amp; my experience has always been the same amazing results!!!   Definitely works! I really started to notice the difference in my skin tone within 1 week. It made my skin tighter and gave it a glow. I do recommend when using be sure to apply it to your lips and ears, you dont want darker lips and ears than your face! Over all great product , does exactly what it says it will</li>
    <li> Make my skin SOOOO DRY...SORRY NOT FOR ME...</li>
    <li> I had some dark areas around my body I wanted lightened along with a scar from a dog bite. I followed the directions, and initially I saw results. I was happy, but as of last week I started to feel my skin raw in the areas I had been applying the cream. Before I knew it, it seems to have burned my skin so now those areas are darker than before!! I feel really disappointed and hopeless seeing as how I just made the situation worse. Maybe it works on some, but it just ended up messing my skin up.</li>
    <li> Helps with my dark spots from acne!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really work.</li>
    <li> Very good I have good results from it, I will recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This was the first bleach cream I purchased, and I&#x27;m happy to say I made a good choice. I had tried other &amp;#34;lightening&amp;#34; creams that are over the counter at my local beauty shops, and they were fine, but I never saw any dramatic results. I did plenty of research and stumbled upon this cream and thanks to all the great reviews I figured I would give it a try. SO GLAD I DID.&lt;br /&gt;I initially purchased this to help with hyper-pigmentation along my back thighs, butt, and underarms. I&#x27;m an African American female, medium  tone with a red undertone to my skin and have always had dark, DARK areas on the back of my thighs and butt and inner thigh my entire life(they looked almost like burn areas), but recently as I&#x27;ve gotten older have also noticed it getting worse at my under arms, as well some darkening around my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The under arm darkening is due to aluminum in deodorant, so along with this cream I made the change to Toms deodorant which is free of the aluminum. (I would say its vital to make this change as well if you are looking to brighten your under arm area) My darkening at my chin I believe is caused by hormones from birth control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been 2 weeks now since starting this cream and it has made dramatic changes! I also purchased it along with the Kojic Acid soap and glutathione antioxidant pills and wash twice a day(morning and night) and apply the Piona cream after. I leave the kojic soap on for a few minutes while in the shower to let it do its work, then rinse and apply a thin layer of the cream in the affected areas. I have to admit, it has worked SO well, I am deciding to use it along my arms - darkened by the sun over the years, and work to even out my skin tone overall to match the areas of my body that don&#x27;t get as much sun. (stomach and thighs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its working wonders! My skin is glowing! Each day I can visually SEE that its working. There will be slight changes from the day before and I can see the lighter complexion coming through. Its great to see improvement on a daily basis, because it helps to keep you from getting discouraged. Of course from other reviews I&#x27;ve read that is a person to person change, it may not be as drastic with everyone. if its not working within 1-2 weeks try using it with Kojic acid soap and continue to use it for up to 6 weeks. They say if no change is seen then, it may just not work with your body. I also like that it does not contain the common bleaching agent hydroquinone, because I&#x27;ve heard that is a strong agent that causes burning and sometimes splotchy results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is somewhat medicine like at first, but you get used to it in a couple days. I wouldn&#x27;t say it stinks at all, but that is a personal preference. If you use this over large areas of your body, you will need to purchase 2 jars at a time, or be sure to order a second jar as soon as you start to get low. I&#x27;m on my second jar after just 2 weeks, so it doesn&#x27;t last very long. :( Again that&#x27;s only if you are using it over large areas. It would be great if they had jars larger than 4 oz. cause it gets pricey ordering one after another... but it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Well worth the money. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Started seeing a difference after about a week of use. Use 2x a day on face only. Exfoliate well before using. It does work. Takes time, not overnight. Face has acne scars and blemishes. Started lightening up and easier to cover with makeup. Skin appears much clearer then when using other store bought products. Will continue to use and buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using the product.. Starting to see some glimpse of improvement in terms of the dark spots.</li>
    <li> Works Extremely well and I am a brown skinned black female with discoloration due to acne, hereditary dark circles under my eyes as well. I tend to have dark marks after acne so I wanted to try this product. I am very pleased with how fast my skin has responded to this product and I recommend spending the money for it. It IS a bit pricey, but if you think about how much you would pay for a prescription strength product, its just about breaks even. I say try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Just be sure to watch your skin because I have gotten a bit lighter than I anticipated and I just really try to be careful to use on spots. It just lightens whatever area it is applied to.Just a tip, If you want to use a soap in conjunction with, try Diana Stalder Kojic Acid Soap. It works wonders as well.</li>
    <li> I am so upset at the condition of my package. I got my cream damaged and opened. The protective seal is broken and the product looks used. I&#x27;m so frustrated</li>
    <li> I am an African American male with a medium brown complexion. I have never written a review here but since I didn&#x27;t seen any men I thought it might help. I have had uneven skin since high school. Between living in Texas with its brutal summer heat to shaving and razor bumps. I have always had uneven light and dark toned skin on my face. My body looks great its just my face and neck I was worried about. I have spent hundreds over the years between going to the dermatologist to over the counter creams that did absolutely nothing but take my money. I can truly say that this cream has made a TREMENDOUS improvement in lightening my skin beyond my wildest dream. I now only apply it ever other day and only once not twice a day. The only bad is that it does have a strong odor and for me it has caused some slight acne bumps. I decreased the usage and it seems to be workin for that. I have friends that have noticed the change and are now calling me light skinned. lol  Wow!! This cream works fellas.</li>
    <li> It seems to be lightening my scars</li>
    <li> This stuff does work. I have already used majority of this product and I have notice a difference in tone. I have also used this for scar blemishes an they have lightened up but not dramatically. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I am white and I had a really bad tan and this is working amazing getting rid of the tan. I do wish there were larger sizes though! it also kept my skin moisturized and didn&#x27;t dry it out like a lot of the reviews have said</li>
    <li> The only think that they should donis add the serum with the cream, but other than that it is a good product</li>
    <li> This stuff is unbelievable I love it</li>
    <li> Great for scar removal will definitely purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> This product works but you have to continue using it on a daily basis or else your skin will turn back to its original color...I bought it last month for $36 and now it is $65...that is a huge jump...</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well. Her use it on my hands, and then started using it on my recent plastic surgery scars on my stomach. I could see a difference within two or three days. However, the effect is not permanent. You have to continuously apply it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little while now and I noticed my darker birthmark getting lighter. It should be used everyday consistantly but I forget so I&#x27;m sure it would be much lighter if I used it as directed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AHMAZING...../ ★★★★★</li>
    <li> This honestly did not do anything for me. I have used it for 2 months. But then again, no other skin lightening product has worked on me either. I guess my particular skin is just un-lighten-able, haha.  This cream is a bit runny. It is also uncomfortably sticky, so you can&#x27;t really lather it on like a smooth silky lotion (which you could do with lightening creams such as Caro White for example). Since it&#x27;s so sticky, I&#x27;m assuming its meant to be dotted onto the areas that are dark instead of lightening the body as a whole, but even still the texture is sticky and a bit nasty feeling. It also has a perfume-y smell, which I didn&#x27;t mind that much.</li>
    <li> The BEST. It works!!!!</li>
    <li> This product did the trick!!! It removed all the blemishes from my face and beneath my chin!! Let&#x27;s see if it will lighten some scars that I have!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as an overall lightner only using it over night after my shower. Didn&#x27;t really seem to do much at first but after a week and a half I started to notice it had really bleached a lot of small dark spots on my face and around knuckles even feet but those are always light. It&#x27;s not a bad product not quite the intensity I was expecting from all of the reviews but from almost EVERYTHING! I&#x27;ve tried so far this seems to have actually done the most. Would definitely purchase again if I found it cheaper.</li>
    <li> I had very dark underarms , since my pregnancy, no matter what I did I could not lighten them , I used so many products and wasters so much money. So I gave this cream a final shot... It was like magic...my underarm became light, I ordered another box. I love it I&#x27;m posting a pic of before and after to show my results.</li>
    <li> Cleaning and exfoliating skin is KEY to getting results!! I promise. I used this product for a few weeks, morning and night- after washing my face and I saw no results. However when I began exfoliating gently with an unused toothbrush and soap, I began seeing results in just a few days. You want to remove all of the old, dead skin cells so the cream can penetrate your clean skin instead of trying to penetrate a layer of dirt!</li>
    <li> Ummm this stuff broke me out like no other. And I never get acne at all. So the fact that it made me break out disgusting bumps I stopped using it. Be careful. It&#x27;s not worth having acne for. I&#x27;m guessing the chemicals in it are too strong for my skin.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to brighten my face to even it out with the rest of my body. And I PROMISE YOU THIS WORKED a little too much I had to stop using it because it was a little too strong. My face went from Lupita Nyongo to Tyra Banks in about 2 weeks!! I will be purchasing again but I&#x27;ll mix it with something else so its not as strong.</li>
    <li> This is miracle cream it works quick any dark spots discoloration this cream get rid of an quick</li>
    <li> it seemed to help but it takes time, be patient. it smells like sulfur but it goes away after 5 to 10 minutes</li>
    <li> Works better than the much more expensive KARE melarase, which I used forever w/o great results. Just started to irritate my skin. Was using it for discoloration on my body.  Piona works better and I am using it on my face to even out skin tone.  Purchased the Piona lotion for my body and am hoping for the same good results.&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/11/15&lt;br /&gt;Stopped working.  Dark skin tone returned on elbows.</li>
    <li> I used this the first day it came and a couple of hours latter I could see my sun spot&#x27;s a little lighter&lt;br /&gt;but it dries your skin so fast if you try to use this every day twice a day (the direction way)&lt;br /&gt;I had a few Laser skin treatments and a lot of Hydroquinone that Helped a bit,&lt;br /&gt;I can see this works faster, why it says on the box that you can just use this for 13 days&lt;br /&gt;is this worst than Hydroquinone?</li>
    <li> This may work for darker skin tones that need to be lightened I couldn&#x27;t contest that. I am olive skin tonned. I was trying to use the product to lighten knuckle tattoos. Just so you all of you that may be thinking along the ame lines knows, it won;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I have been using it liberally and I haven&#x27;t seen any change in the tattoo or in my skin color around the tattoo. Just putting my 2 cents out there. :)</li>
    <li> I love this cream worth every dollar... I love my skin it glows.  I still am not finish using it but i can already tell n notice the big change in my skin..</li>
    <li> I am still using this product.  I do like it and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell to it.  It is not all greasy.  I do see little results and I do use it everyday.  I have noticed some clearing of minor dark spots I had on my face.  I would buy this product again one I ran out.  I do believe there is a soap that should be used along with this bleaching cream.  I would say try this cream and see in about a month or 2 how good it is.  I gave it 4 stars because it is still a work in progress to see major results.</li>
    <li> excellent product. Saw results in 3 days.</li>
    <li> This product worked for me. I used it for about a week twice a day on my underarms and knees. This is great you just have to be constant. I really do hate the strong chemical smell but its worth it in the long run.</li>
