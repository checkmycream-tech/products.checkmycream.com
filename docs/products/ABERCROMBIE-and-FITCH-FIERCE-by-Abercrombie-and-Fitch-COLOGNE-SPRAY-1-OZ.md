      <li>Great smelling stuff.  </li>
      <li>great product and arrived on time</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 bottles and they will need more, it is the best cologne for men ever.  </li>
      <li>Although smelling good and having a great scent to be remembered by is a plus, its not going to get you everything in life.</li>
      <li>If you want to smell good like the A&amp;F clothes do at the store, you will propably have to spray about 10 sprays on you like they do on the clothes in store.</li>
      <li>You get that ability from something called good looks and the way you carry yourself as a person.</li>
      <li>You WILL NOT have flocks of amazing looking girls chasing after you because you smell good.  </li>
      <li>The scent of cologne is great but has got a reputation of being more of a teenagers cologne.</li>
      <li>I no longer have to wait until we get to the Abercrombie store to smell this amazing aroma.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend really liked this scent.</li>
      <li>Its a good product anyways :)</li>
      <li>one of my all time favorite scents....</li>
      <li>I wasnt 100% sure</li>
      <li>All in all, Fantastic fragrance!</li>
      <li>The only thing \\&quot;Fierce\\&quot; about it is that it probably an excellent insect repellant.</li>
      <li>Love the smell....</li>
      <li>You may get SOME compliments on a particular cologne, but its not going to solve all of your life problems with not being able to attract a good looking girl.</li>
      <li>This cologne smells incredible and every time I&#x27;ve worn it when on a date I get remarks such as, \\&quot;Oh</li>
      <li>Shipping was fantastic as well.</li>
      <li>I get so many hot girls with this stuff\\&quot; ,</li>
      <li>I wound up selling my bottle which was 90% full on ebay for $50</li>
      <li>My sons love this, my husband wants some now.  </li>
      <li>This is a very popular scent and the price for the product was a savings over the usual one--very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much, exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>great for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Its a little fruity, though, but it smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>The best place to buy this stuff if you must is from an A&amp;F store because about 85% of the ones online are fake.       </li>
      <li>but i remember everytime i used to walk past the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store it smelled soo good.  </li>
      <li>Now everyone is always sniffing me haha.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, considering the reviews about this cologne I was expecting a more long lasting fragrance.</li>
      <li>I would only get complimented on the cologne right after it was sprayed on.</li>

<li> I think a&amp;f should make this a body spray and sell it for no more than $20 because thats what people are using the cologne as, and it really doesnt stand up to the word cologne.</li>
<li> The only drawback is that there is a heavily muscled Man-torso on the bottle, and my guy would rather not be looking at another dude.  </li>
<li> As soon as the cologne begins to sink in, its like it just blows away in the wind and you cant smell it at all after about 1 hour, and thats using the typical cologne</li>
<li> Bought it for my son,he was afraid it was not the real thing, but I informed him it was.</li>
<li> so i could at least make up some of the wasted money.    </li>
<li> Hard to fin in Italy</li>
<li> If anyone checks frangrancenet for reviews, beware as they do not allow negative comments on colognes.</li>
<li> The fragrance is very faint and does not last any time.</li>
<li> I was disappointed as my son had recommended it to me and said he got compliments on it all the time.</li>
<li> To keep things succinct, the smell is sickening.</li>

    <li> This is the same nauseating scent that hits you when you walk into any Aberchrombie &amp; Fitch retail outlet. To keep things succinct, the smell is sickening. The only thing \\&quot;Fierce\\&quot; about it is that it probably an excellent insect repellant. And rest be assured, that is not the only thing it will be repelling.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!! and so will your co-workers!! Affordable price and the results..well you will just have to see for yourself!!!</li>
    <li> This cologne smells incredible and every time I&#x27;ve worn it when on a date I get remarks such as, \\&quot;Oh my gosh, is that you that smells like heaven?\\&quot; recommend it to anyone lookin to do some womanizing. Shipping was fantastic as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne after read severals reviews over Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Fierce cologne. The product arrived in perfect conditions and I was very satisfied with the shop purchase. Nevertheless, considering the reviews about this cologne I was expecting a more long lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne at an A&amp;F store months ago for $70 and have regretted it ever since. The cologne smells unbelievable when you first put it on and for anout the 1st 1/2 hour. I would only get complimented on the cologne right after it was sprayed on. As soon as the cologne begins to sink in, its like it just blows away in the wind and you cant smell it at all after about 1 hour, and thats using the typical cologne ammount(1 spray on each wrist and i did 2 sprays on the neck). If you want to smell good like the A&amp;F clothes do at the store, you will propably have to spray about 10 sprays on you like they do on the clothes in store. With that being said, your $70 bottle is only gonna last about 2-3 weeks.         The scent of cologne is great but has got a reputation of being more of a teenagers cologne. I would not recommend this to anyone over the age of 20. I would not recommend this colgne to anyone really because its a waste. I think a&amp;f should make this a body spray and sell it for no more than $20 because thats what people are using the cologne as, and it really doesnt stand up to the word cologne. I wound up selling my bottle which was 90% full on ebay for $50 so i could at least make up some of the wasted money.    NOTE: If anyone checks frangrancenet for reviews, beware as they do not allow negative comments on colognes. If you have ever wondered how you see nothing but great reviews on there,then there&#x27;s your answer. The best place to buy this stuff if you must is from an A&amp;F store because about 85% of the ones online are fake.       Also, anyone who is buying a cologne and sees reviews with things such as \\&quot; I get so many hot girls with this stuff\\&quot; , thats BS. You may get SOME compliments on a particular cologne, but its not going to solve all of your life problems with not being able to attract a good looking girl. You WILL NOT have flocks of amazing looking girls chasing after you because you smell good.  You get that ability from something called good looks and the way you carry yourself as a person. Although smelling good and having a great scent to be remembered by is a plus, its not going to get you everything in life.</li>
    <li> My sons love this, my husband wants some now.  I ordered 2 bottles and they will need more, it is the best cologne for men ever.  Great smelling stuff.  Ladies get this for all your men...</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend for christmas.  i dont shop too often but i remember everytime i used to walk past the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store it smelled soo good.  I wasnt 100% sure this was the scent i was after, but it came in a timely manner and on christmas, voila! my boyfriend smells delicious.  The only drawback is that there is a heavily muscled Man-torso on the bottle, and my guy would rather not be looking at another dude.  All in all, Fantastic fragrance!</li>
    <li> Hard to fin in Italy but I always try to buy it for my husband.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend really liked this scent. Its a little fruity, though, but it smells pretty good. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling cologne ever. I no longer have to wait until we get to the Abercrombie store to smell this amazing aroma.</li>
    <li> Love the smell....just the price. After i ordered this I found one a lot cheaper. Its a good product anyways :)</li>

    <li> Great cologne. Bought it for my son,he was afraid it was not the real thing, but I informed him it was.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is very faint and does not last any time. I was disappointed as my son had recommended it to me and said he got compliments on it all the time. When I wear it you can&#x27;t even tell it. Must be my body chemistry or something.</li>
    <li> Fierce is the best smelling cologne ever. I&#x27;m so happy I saved a lot of money from buying it off of amazon. Now everyone is always sniffing me haha.</li>
    <li> one of my all time favorite scents....i was so happy to find it here ..........a woodsy , kinda of amber feel to the scent........great for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This is a very popular scent and the price for the product was a savings over the usual one--very satisfied.</li>
