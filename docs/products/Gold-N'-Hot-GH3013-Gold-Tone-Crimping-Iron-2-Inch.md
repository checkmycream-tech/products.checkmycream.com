<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for my ten year old daughter and I don&#x27;t know who is having more fun with it, her or me.  Exact same crimping style I got when I was her age.  Used it on myself for Halloween and ended up keeping my crimped hair all weekend.</li>
    <li> Worked great and the price was good</li>
    <li> The iron heated up quickly and was hot. Sadly the crimps didn&#x27;t last long and it  made my hair extremely puffy and left it with a hard texture.</li>
    <li> This was ordered so I could fix my hair for an 80s party.  It worked great and gave me that crazy 80s big hair look.</li>
    <li> I have really coarse, thick hair, and with My old crimper it took 1 hour to do My whole hair... As a mother of two small children, I do not have that time. Gold n&#x27; Hot heats up fast, and crimps my hair just as fast! I&#x27;m very picky, but this product is awesome!</li>
    <li> Crimps exactly as expected, I suggest this one over the others because the price is lower and it crimps beautifully!</li>
    <li> Works great! Great price! Granddaughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I love it !!! Really really good crimper !</li>
    <li> You will love it!  My girls wore their hair with crimps the first day of school and what a hit!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome crimper. Except you have to really press them together to create a clean crimped look otherwise it just looks like a bad frizzy hair day .</li>
    <li> Great buys , good quality .</li>
    <li> Works as expected and creates really nice crimp style.</li>
    <li> Crimps your hair just like it should. Used it to crimp my hair for an 80&#x27;s party. worked out well</li>
    <li> This is great! It only takes a few seconds to heat up and crimps perfectly. Its heavy and sturdy. I have pretty thick hair to my waist and it takes under ten minutes to do all of it. Very happy. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money!!!!</li>
    <li> VERY hot.  It works really quickly.  Don&#x27;t hold it on too long or you&#x27;ll burn that hair off!  Fantastic updated product from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Just bought for my 35th 80&#x27;s party and I got it in the mail super fast and I love it!! it works awesome and seems to be very good quality~!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my older-than-dirt Sassoon crimper. Yes, I said Sassoon. It was that old. This one did my entire head in 1/10th of the time. Heats up quickly, does not damage my thin hair and was comfortable to use. I highly recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> I didnt real like the crimps</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Absolutely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome I love it. It&#x27;s really hot and work as perfect. Trust me buy this product you won&#x27;t regret:).</li>
    <li> I just had to buy a crimper, I had one back in the day and my nieces are crimping their hair too!</li>
    <li> Great Crimping iron, The iron gets hot and crimps the hair fast and easily. Crimping lasted 2 days. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have very long and very straight hair. I ordered this to assist me with a costume and I have used it nearly every day. It gives me light waves and they actually hold, which is a first for me. It does get pretty hot, but isn&#x27;t that the point.?</li>
    <li> This Seller is Very loyal to his/her customers. I must say they keep you updated on shipping and contact you afterwards to make sure your satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PICTURE OF MY HAIR CRIMPED I posted it on my website:[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Heated VERY FAST and Packaging says its all&lt;br /&gt;-Crimped My entire Hair from Root to bottom THICK COURSE HAIR  in 20 mins&lt;br /&gt;-Crimps lasts up to 3 days plus if you don&#x27;t wash your hair&lt;br /&gt;- Shipping on time and very prompt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Crimper get a little warm on handle but what hot hair tool doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thanks to your company for fast great shipping and friendly service :)</li>
    <li> Was hesitant about this at first but I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I wish there was a temp control gauge since it does get quite hot but it only takes about 3 seconds on your hair for it to kink. Like some of the other reviews when you first get it, it does smell funny. That went away though after a couple uses. I have thicker hair that normally doesn&#x27;t hold style very well but this lasted me a couple days without having to redo it. Overall a good buy.</li>
    <li> Great. Heats up FAST. Crimps are the perfect size, not too fluffy, not too small. Great to add a bit of body to your hair.</li>
    <li> This iron got super hot, and took only 45 minutes to crimp my entire head, which says ALOT considering it usually takes over an hour to straighten. Results were awesome too! I highly recommend for anyone looking for a little 80&#x27;s flair:)</li>
    <li> Completely fried my hair!! Did NOT work at all, it only straightened my hair and left &amp;#34;imprints&amp;#34; instead of actually crimping my hair. All this product does is damage your hair.</li>
    <li> Use this on my daughter&#x27;s very long hair.  It is medium thickness &amp; only takes 15-20 minutes total!  She gets tons of compliments every time we crimp her hair. It gives her a ton of volume!  Truly love this crisper...it reminds me of when I use to crimp mine! To add a little more edge...I will sometimes add a few blocks of color using hair chalk. Tip: Don&#x27;t use it on full heat! It gets super hot!</li>
    <li> I recieved this crimper very quickly which i was happy about. (only reason I gave 1 star.) When I plugged in the crimper it would not even turn on. Something was wrong with the button. I now have to send it back and they won&#x27;t replace the crimper even though they sent me a non-working one. Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do but I don&#x27;t believe the style suits me well. It makes my hair look very kinky and I believe I would look better with more widely spaced rollers.</li>
    <li> It works great.  It heats up fast and crimps the hair in 4 or 5 seconds.  It is wide so you can crimp a decent amount of  hair at a time.  Anyone looking for a crimping iron, this is a good one.</li>
    <li> I bought this earlier tonight and brought it in to my hair stylist so she could crimp my hair. It heated up really fast and worked really fast. It didn&#x27;t take long to crimp my whole head! I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This thing gets hot and does the job! Adds volume like you have never seen before!!!</li>
    <li> Love it . It works 👍😻</li>
    <li> I use a crimper for a root lift but no one seems to make dual voltage crimpers, so my non US crimper wouldn&#x27;t work in the US.  I bought the Gold &amp; Hot to use while travelling &amp; it was great.  Heated up quickly, not too heavy and gave a nice crimp.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my granddaughter for her 12th birthday and she loves it.  I helped her the first time and she now can crimp her hair quickly before walking to school.</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast! That&#x27;s always a plus for me. The crimper gets hot very fast and does an outstanding job. I love it!</li>
    <li> This crimper is great in the morning when you don&#x27;t have much time.  It heats up incredibly fast and stays hot.</li>
    <li> this iron works great!!!!  i would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants tiny crimps. it is really easy to use</li>
    <li> it does the job at a better price than what you will find purchasing at a salon offline</li>
    <li> I really like this crimper. I bought it for an 80&#x27;s dance I was in.  It heats up fast and gives my hair A nice crimped look.</li>
    <li> It does a good job of crimping, but I would have liked bigger waves.  It is a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> It does what they said it would do and did the job just fine. What can you say about a crimping iron? It worked.</li>
    <li> i am sooooo happy and satisfied with this beautiful item. it&#x27;s amazing how it can turn my hair voluminous and i get complimented by a lot of my friends and colleagues. great buy!!! oh and it gets hot fast too. the heat is well maintained all throughout the time i iron my hair.</li>
    <li> Best I ever tried! fast to heat up, doesnt take 30mins like others its more like 5 mins. Has adjustable heat levels, careful when using a high heat setting, only use if you have troublesome hair that takes a lot to curl r crimp. Crimps nicely leaving hair shiny not frayed!</li>
    <li> THIS CRIMPER IS OK, NOTHING REALLY WRONG WITH IT... JUST WASN&#x27;T A FAN OF HOW SMALL THE CRIMPS WERE. IT REALLY JUST POOFS OUT YOUR HAIR WITH SMALL CRIMPS. NOT REALLY WHAT WAS EXPECTING. HEATED QUICKLY AND FEELS DURABLE, JUST DIDN&#x27;T REALLY LIKE THE OUTCOME OF CRIMP SIZE OR THE EXTREME VOLUME</li>
    <li> This crimping iron is Awesome!! I like how it heats up really quickly :) It gives you volume to your hair as well! The price is amazing too and I love it :D</li>
    <li> feels like the 80&#x27;s are back!</li>
    <li> My two young daughters loved how thier hair looked. Easy to use and works very well. Brings back memories of the 80s!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great heats up fast, and has been great with every use.</li>
    <li> Bringing the 80s back</li>
    <li> Worked great on my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.  Heats up fast and very hot!  Great price for the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> It heats up very fast and does the job. Although i was hoping for more of a bigger wave like crip vs small crimps..Arrived on time but I wish it was what i wanted.</li>
    <li> Fast shopping and works wonderful!! My hair that is a inch passed my shoulders only took 15 mins to do</li>
    <li> This product gets hot really quick so be careful and it works fantastic! Just be careful using it because its hot and you can burn yourself. It does deliver!</li>
    <li> My 10 year old LOVES this product.  It is HOTT!!!The outside gets  warm, a little too warm for me to let her use it unattended.</li>
    <li> I dig this crimper - it does a great job and works well.  That said, it does make smaller crimps than my previous crimper I&#x27;d had since the early 90s, so it yields a slightly different result than I had anticipated.  It makes, like, fine mermaid crimps.  Very pretty, but a different look than I had initially hoped for.  Still, I am happy with this product and the result was good, even if different than anticipated - will keep this product and use time and again.</li>
    <li> Love, love this iron!  Purchased for Granddaughter for Christmas present.  She has long hair and used it to crimp her hair.  Got hot quickly and did a great crimping job quickly!  Sisters love it, too.  Would highly recommend it.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> works great... watch settings can burn your hair....</li>
    <li> This was a gift, but the recipient uses it often, and has never complained!</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for granddaughter, she loves it</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  I have 3 girls with all different hair types and it works and the cripped looks stays for all of them.  The only thing that is awkward is the on/off switch and wheel next to it.  I can tell when it is on, but not the setting.</li>
    <li> Good quality, and does what it says it will!  I like that you can control the temperature for different hair types.  GREAT product!</li>
    <li> Works great...used it for an 80&#x27;s party! Just like the old school crimper! Gets hot...stays hot! Love the outcome!</li>
    <li> I have really thin hair, so I like to crimp it just a little bit to give it some extra volume.  My really old crimper broke, so I was in the market for a new one.  I got a conair one that didn&#x27;t get hot at all and didn&#x27;t even crimp my fine hair, so I got this one for about 6 dollars more and it is amazing! It took less than 5 minutes to heat up and it crimps so well!! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good crimper.</li>
    <li> crimps and heats very good</li>
    <li> The curls came too small.</li>
    <li> This crimper is great. It makes really nice crimps and theyve stay crimped for even two days straight. One time i was caught in a light rain shower, yet my hair stayed crimped, and i hadn&#x27;t used any kind of water-proof spray or hair gel. HOWEVER, this iron really really makes your hair smell. It&#x27;s kind of like a burnt hair smell mixed with the smell of something else. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it&#x27;s not exactly pleasant. Even after washing my hair, conditioning it, and appling a serum, i could still smell the smell of that iron in my hair. This is very annoying and unpleasant. Otherwise, this crimping iron does a great job!</li>
    <li> I decided that before I turn 30, I wanted to bring &amp;#34;crimping back&amp;#34; so I ordered this. It was PERFECT!!!! Works great! Only takes a second though, so be careful you know what you&#x27;re doing</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughters fine hair.</li>
    <li> My mom doesn&#x27;t have an account so she got it on mine. I would never use this thing because I don&#x27;t want my hair fried. I&#x27;m a natural 3c and my mind is made. My mom however have relaxed hair and she said she&#x27;s been looking for this thing since the 90&#x27;s or early 2000&#x27;s. She used to have one but lended it to her sister who never gave it back. The krinkles come out looking like perfect alligator teeth marks and the hair smells like the burnt bacon my mom always cooks but I never eat. My mom rates it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I loved it. It gets hot immediately. I actually have wavy hair but I guess it will work for who has straight hair too.</li>
    <li> good product the only thing is you have to hold on to the very end because the rest of it is hot but it does a good job crimping</li>
    <li> It feels cheap, like its going to break.. and it smells burnt every time i turn it on, this is very bad quality</li>
    <li> I received this crimper early so that was great but it doesn&#x27;t work so now I have to go through a pain to get one that does. I&#x27;m sure it would work wonders if it was working but now I can&#x27;t rate on that.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my daughter - like that the plates are ceramic.  Does a great job with crimping.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a wider crimp. It works well but the smaller width is too small for my liking and makes my hair too poofy</li>
    <li> Ok.  80s girl here.  This is just as good as when I was 14!  Or better.  Crimps held all night on really paper thin hair and gave hair extra volume too!!  Love. It.</li>
    <li> This iron is the best iron I have ever bought my baby girl loves me to do her hair for school like every week am happy she loves this that way I get her to wash her hair more often thanks amazon</li>
    <li> I bought this for an 80s party, and it did a great job. I used crimping irons back in the day, and this lived up to my memories. I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for 80s style crimped hair.</li>
    <li> I receive my crimper the other day it is great and gives wonderful crimps if you want great small crimps I am suggesting and recommending that you buy this product for yourself or someone else. it looks really good when done, even people commented on my hair as well and loved it. Don&#x27;t hesitate and buy this now.</li>
    <li> This is the first crimping iron I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I think it does a great job!  Sometimes my ends stick out a little crazy...but it&#x27;s probably because I don&#x27;t know how the heck to crimp my hair, not because of any fault in the crimping iron.</li>
    <li> Box said 400 degrees heat nd I believe it.  I have thin, fine hair and I tested it by taking small portion of hair and waved  3 seconds and it waved that fast!  I was afraid to use further because didn&#x27;t want to burn my hair up.</li>
    <li> Heats up super fast and gets really hot.  My girls and I love it and use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Love this crimping iron! Heats fast does the job made well overall great product. Would definitely recommend ... creates very defined crimped hair.</li>
    <li> BEST CRIMPER EVER!!! I love this crimper, it is light and easy to use, just dont put it super close to your head it will burn you.  This will be the only crimper i ever use</li>
    <li> I have very fine, straight hair. Usually, crimpers leave my hair looking 80s fabulous. This one leaves my entire head a frizzy mess.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the great waves of hair</li>
    <li> It came right on time and works perfectly.  For someone who likes crimped hair that isn&#x27;t big, I really like this.</li>
    <li> This worked wonderful on my thick hair. Took only 20 minutes and it was done. It did great and kept the crimp all day. Even worked on my sister&#x27;s thin hair. This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> It crimps my hair like it says it would. Just be sure to take small sections in layers. Wait for the crimper to be very hot, and press for 3 seconds. After following these instructions, my hair was perfectly crimped. The crimps on this particular crimper are pretty small and deep. It works perfectly. I recommend this one!</li>
    <li> This is better than the one I had when I was a kid in the 80s. So glad I got it!</li>
    <li> Really really good, I still can&#x27;t believe the price. I have long hair and it takes me no more than 15 minutes. I get lots of volume and it doesn&#x27;t fade away until I wash it. Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I am not sure how much that is saying since I haven&#x27;t used a crimper since the 80&#x27;s... but it&#x27;s still an amazing crimper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 7 year old needed her hair crimped for dance pictures and an upcoming recital.  I ordered this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to crimp her hair Friday night for pictures on Saturday just in case this didn&#x27;t work as well as I was hoping it would.  I started out spraying her hair down with the [[ASIN:B001S48HLG Got2b Guardian angel Gloss Finish Flat Iron Balm, 6.8-Ounce]], then sectioned her hair off into 10 sections or so.  (Her hair is almost waist length.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked at how little time I actually had to hold the crimper in place for.  I started at the root, put the hair in the crimper, squeezed down for a second, let go, moved down the hair, squeezed down for a second, moved down, etc.  I didn&#x27;t want to burn her hair, so I literally held it for a second or so and it took beautifully.  I had her whole head done in about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had her sleep in a silk sleeping cap so that her hair wouldn&#x27;t rub all over her pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she got up in the morning, I finished it off with Mastey Oil Treatment (I didn&#x27;t buy that through Amazon) and [[ASIN:B002KKV066 Garnier Fructis Style Volumizing Anti Humidity Hairspray, 8.25 Ounce]].  She looked gorgeous.  There are 11 other girls in her dance class and most of their mothers asked me how I got her hair like I did (they were all supposed to have the same hair, some parents used small braids, I think one used a crimper, and only one had hair whose crimp resembled my daughter&#x27;s.)  The owner of the studio came up to my daughter, held her hair in her hands and said I LOVE THIS HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has really thin hair that doesn&#x27;t hold any type of curl for very long unless we use the sponge curlers on wet hair and let her sleep in it overnight, heated hair appliances rarely create something in her hair that lasts long.  This held all night, all day Saturday, and all day Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved it! So glad I picked this one.all day Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved it! So glad I picked this one.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do- crimps hair.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that there were no instructions enclosed.  There is a small flat dial on the handle that has no indication for levels of heat intensity. So it is a guessing game as to whether it should be turned clockwise or counter clockwise. So this could potentially BURN , and or dry out your hair if left on to long.</li>
    <li> Randomly decided, &amp;#34;Hey, I want to crimp my hair! Let me try this iron.&amp;#34; I love it. Totally worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> The crimper works very well. My only two complaints are the lack of a temperature setting, and how much smaller the size of the crimps are than I had imagined they&#x27;d be.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up super fast, looks to be made well, and succeeds in doing what its supposed to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this crimping iron twice and I love it! It&#x27;s a lot of fun creating this effect on hair and it creates lots of volume.</li>
    <li> This product heats up super fast and it is HOT!!!! It crimps my hair and it stays crimped, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold style well. I would be wary of someone not especially skilled using the product (ex: kids) as if left on too long I suspect that the hair could be burned off. The ONLY thing is that I wish it had an auto off to compensate for my forgetfulness.</li>
    <li> This crimper brings me back to my childhood. It&#x27;s wide enough it does large sections and looks amazing!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter had been asking for one for a while.  I actually had a Conair one in my cart and saw that it did not get great reviews, but saw this one and thought I would try it as it gave much better reviews.  I am glad I did.  It heats very quickly and does the job.  Last well into the next day even...my girls are very happy!</li>
    <li> I purchased a hot iron like this 26 years ago. I am just know replacing it. Apparently I didn&#x27;t pack correctly when moving and part of the frame cracked. Otherwise I would still have it.</li>
    <li> This crimping iron worked really well on my hair.  The crimps were well defined and it only took a short amount of time to crimp my hair because the iron does get very hot.  I have long hair and it probably took 15 minutes to crimp my entire head because you do not have to hold the iron for long on your hair.  The only negative about this iron is that it has a little bit of a strange plastic-like smell to it which also makes your hair smell a little (but not too bad) and can be masked by hair products/sprays.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend and she loved it! Heated up very quickly. She has very fine, straight hair and the crimps held all night. Very fast and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It looks like I braided the girls&#x27; hair at night and it is all wavy the next day. Everyone at school loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I give this crimping iron 2 stars because the ONLY thing I like about it is the fact that it heats up fast! My old iron took 10-15 minutes to heat up, this one however, only takes a minute. However, because the iron doesn&#x27;t have a temperature setting, I end up frying my hair because it&#x27;s on full blast - get extremely hot - maybe good for someone with very thick hair. My hair is very thin and when I used the iron the steam comes out and I can hear it scorching every single hair. I am afraid to set my hair on fire. So after a few times of using it, I noticed that my hair is dry and brittle, and not because I switched shampoos or anything (been using the same one for a year), but because I started using this iron. The design is good, it&#x27;s nice and light, but the big negative for someone who has thin hair is that there is no temperature setting to control the heat.</li>
    <li> works really well but the outside gets sooooooooooo hot. But it really crimps</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, the recipient really likes it very much and would recommend it to all of her friends.</li>
