      <li>but I really do love this.</li>
      <li>I also love that the handle detaches and has the hand strap.</li>

      <li>Perfect to get areas on back that you can&#x27;t reach with hands.</li>
      <li>Being 8 months pregnant this brush has been really nice to use.</li>

      <li>but it turned out to be soft and comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>This is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever bought after my friend recommended buying one.</li>
      <li>Plus I love that it&#x27;s all natural as I like to do organic and natural in every aspect of my life as much as I can.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>recommend this to everyone who is looking to make their skin look fresh and young!</li>
      <li>This brush has worked great for both wet and dry use.</li>
      <li>It would always itch and bother me when lying in bed, but I really haven&#x27;t been feeling that annoyance</li>
      <li>I really like this body brush.</li>
      <li>I was very nervous that the bristles would feel prickly</li>

      <li>have a super itchy back all the time</li>
      <li>and I have seen some significant improvement in the dry skin under my arms.  </li>
      <li>and I recommend it to anyone who liked to do dry body brushing, or even using it while wet!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product the past several weeks and enjoy the almost massage-like bristles that make my skin feel renewed and fresh.</li>
      <li>so when the bristles start falling out, you have the next new one.</li>
      <li>and it really worked to scratch my body and remove all the dry skin cells which cause the itching.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft but still firm enough to deep clean.</li>
      <li>I love that it has the removable long handle for hard to reach areas.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s heavy-duty enough, yet quite soft on the skin.  </li>

    <li> I received this body brush very quickly! Works great and I love how you can separate the handle from the brush. I can easily hang it in the shower and the rubber handle is well gripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone who is looking to make their skin look fresh and young!</li>

I have had really dry skin under my arms, on my chest.  With a long handle it is a little awkward to get to since it is so close to my arms.  Just take the handle off and strap into the the cloth strap that is attached and you can vigorously get to the areas needed.  I&#x27;ve been using the brush for about three weeks and I have seen some significant improvement in the dry skin under my arms.  It would always itch and bother me when lying in bed, but I really haven&#x27;t been feeling that annoyance lately.&lt;br /&gt;For me, the value was in the removable handle and in the ability to actually make my skin look and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not usually a five star kind of guy, but I really do love this.</li>
