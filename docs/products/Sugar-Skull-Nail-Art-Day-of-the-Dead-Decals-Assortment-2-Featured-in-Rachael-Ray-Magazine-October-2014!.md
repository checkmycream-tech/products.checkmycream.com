<li> I don&#x27;t know why my order is so different from other reviews.</li>
<li> Unless you are a man with big nails, these little skulls will not fit on your nail.</li>
<li> Also I do NOT have small hands or nails, I would rate my nails as totally average.</li>
<li> Will use for day of the dead crafts.</li>
<li> /&gt;This was a waste of money</li>
<li> With such intricate detail, bleeding makes it look sloppy.</li>
<li> The pics are really smalls, so it is impossible to tell that these are sugar skulls, unless one looks closely</li>
<li> Also, then they are hard to remove.</li>
<li> Not too hard on the pocketbook, either!</li>
<li> The decals are poorly printed with almost no visible color whatsoever.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The designs were super cute but the film was really thick and didn&#x27;t form to my nails very well. If you could put them on thinner film I&#x27;d buy them again! Good luck!</li>
    <li> nice came very quickly.</li>
    <li> These look awesome, but they&#x27;re not entirely opaque, so be sure to use them on a lighter background color.</li>
    <li> cute granddaughters will love them!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Cute to wear. Not too hard on the pocketbook, either! If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying, go ahead &amp; do it! Super cute!</li>
    <li> great&lt;br /&gt;received then today. thank you</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why my order is so different from other reviews. The decals are poorly printed with almost no visible color whatsoever. These are ending up in the trash.</li>
    <li> Loved these!! Arrived on time. And they are so cute and detailed. Looks just like the picture and so easy to use. Defiantly recommend this seller and the product!!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better decal!</li>
    <li> They were so easy to use</li>
    <li> This are hard to apply ( they smudge easily). Also, then they are hard to remove. The pics are really smalls, so it is impossible to tell that these are sugar skulls, unless one looks closely</li>
    <li> Very Cute! I haven&#x27;t put them on yet so I can&#x27;t speak to the application, but they are adorable and just what I was looking for. Not sure how small other people&#x27;s nail beds are, but these are just the right size for my nails, not too large as others have said. I have standard to large nail beds, but they are much smaller than my nails.</li>
    <li> I loved the designs. But! I didn&#x27;t like how the design didn&#x27;t slide of of the white on its own. I had to cut the film it was on to form my finger because you wear the decal WITH the film it&#x27;s on. It started lifting after my clear coat started chipping. That sucked.</li>
    <li> Although I like the designs of these nail decals, the size of them is WAY TO BIG for most nails. Unless you are a man with big nails, these little skulls will not fit on your nail. I bought these for me and my 8 year old daughter for halloween.  She could NOT use even 1 of the various designs and I could only use 2 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a waste of money and I do not recommend these unless you have very large nail beds.  Also I do NOT have small hands or nails, I would rate my nails as totally average.</li>
    <li> I am so very pleased with these. The decals arrive looking exactly like the picture shows. They fit perfectly on my nails and are very easy to apply. I used sally Hansen diamond clear coat and they lasted for over a week!  They are super eye-catching and I get non stop compliments. Any manicurist would charge you an arm and a leg for these kinds of designs. and my package arrived two weeks early! !! I thought there was no way I would get them in time for Halloween.  So I&#x27;m not just pleased with the item itself im pleased with the vendor too! WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN! !!!</li>
    <li> Will use for day of the dead crafts.</li>
    <li> These nail decals are spectacular! Beautiful artwork makes your nails and masterpiece!</li>
    <li> Looking at the pictures of these decals, I expected crisp and clean lines in the designs. The sheet I received looks like it has bled into the paper. With such intricate detail, bleeding makes it look sloppy.</li>
    <li> than set #1, but both sets are really cute.  there are a couple that are too big to fit on my fingernails, but most of them do.  they are good quality and thick enough that you don&#x27;t worry about them ripping if you must move them around.  they hold up to wear with minimal top coating, too.  no fading or changing of colour.  wear over light polish and they really stand out.</li>
    <li> If you know how to use water decals, these are pretty cool. Just make sure the base color is light.</li>
    <li> I bought these for Halloween this year and shared with friends.  They went perfectly with my sugar skull makeup.  Very fun item.</li>
    <li> I just used them and they are so cute and super easy to put on!</li>
    <li> i did not think they were water placement decals i thought they were 3d like</li>
