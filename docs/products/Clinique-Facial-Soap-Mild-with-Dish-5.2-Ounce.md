      <li>and i love it  </li>
      <li>I USED THIS FOR MANY YEARS</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I love it.</li>
      <li>Glad I found it again.</li>
      <li>Glad to to able to order on line, no need to go to mall</li>
      <li>and once I added that to my classic 3 step regimen (with the mild soap and #2 clarifyer)I&#x27;ve been able to keep a complexion to be proud of throughout my forties.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought I liked this soap because it made my crappy skin feel smooth</li>
      <li>Lovely, \\&quot;plushy\\&quot; feeling lather, great mild cleaning facial soap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still the same great skin cleanser I used to use.  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>primarily I would like to know if it is paraben free</li>
      <li>, it is better to use with a facial sponge tho, smells nice and great for sensitive skins.</li>
      <li>, I was I requested, all was ok, thanks a lot for all, I will buying more</li>
      <li>Pleasant, barely detectible scent.  </li>
      <li>Makes your face feel smooth and clean.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;re worth it!  </li>
      <li>(It&#x27;s a full size bar)</li>
      <li>all was ok thanks</li>
      <li>Bought it because they were out of mild, and returned it.</li>
      <li>Good quality face soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out skin or leave residue.  </li>
      <li>fast shipment!!</li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>, this big huge bar with container, I love the way my skin feels after using the is clinique product.</li>
      <li>and it was definitely less effective!</li>
      <li>Effectively leaves skin clean but not stripped or tight feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first time I used this soap was in my teens when my mother gave me a sample.  </li>
      <li>Finally is clearing up my skin! :)</li>
      <li>, I do recommend it and I will buy this again when I run out which I probably won&#x27;t be anytime soon because these bars last me months which is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t even wash it off with another face wash at first.</li>
      <li>Within days of using it, my acne was fading fast.  </li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t think much about cleansers.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended, even by my Dermatologist!</li>
      <li>Clinique, please move to a gentle, humane policy .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would not recommend it and luckily I only used a free trial size.</li>
      <li>way cheap because the bar will last you forever</li>
      <li>Maybe the soap would be good for someone with extremely dry, non acne prone skin who is not sensitive.</li>
      <li>i have been using this with other clinique products for more then 20 years.</li>
      <li>By that time my skin was pretty clear</li>
      <li>I started breaking out way more than usual, and my face was becoming permanently flushed especially on my cheeks.</li>
      <li>I mistakenly bought the extra mild once</li>
      <li>Since I can&#x27;t know if this particular product is cruelty-free</li>
      <li>pertains to the Mild soap, for \\&quot;mixed skin</li>
      <li>really miss the old sliding case, too!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this soap.</li>
      <li>A few days in, I started getting more clogged pores.</li>
      <li>I got the one for dry skin even though my face is always slicked in oil as I have learned that my skin is super sensitive and the drugstore brand cleansers irritate it which is why it produces so much oil.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember the problem I was having; I&#x27;ve always had problems with dry skin, but in college I got my very first bout of acne, and it may have been at that time</li>
      <li>PS Also agree the extra mild does not work the same way.</li>
      <li>clear, I&#x27;ve already seen results after weeks nw.</li>
      <li>I continued to use it until my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>So I believe it is this waxy film that really irritated my face after several uses.</li>
      <li>old face of mine and helps it to remain somewhat youthful looking.</li>
      <li>a month later I cant really tell that I have been using either one.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wish I had saved an old one.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so clean and tight after I wash it.  </li>
      <li>I actually couldn&#x27;t afford to use it again until four years later when I was working full time, but bought a big bar at Crossroads Mall in Kalamazoo sometime in the fall of 1985 and never looked back.  </li>
      <li>I am about a million years old and this stuff makes me look like I am only 35!</li>
      <li>A hot mess.  </li>
      <li>Recently, I&#x27;ve had some major breakout going on with my face and this soap has helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My RA gave me a little chunk of this stuff my first year in undergrad.  </li>

    <li> Great product.....fast shipment!!</li>
    <li> My RA gave me a little chunk of this stuff my first year in undergrad.  That was thirty years ago.  I can&#x27;t remember the problem I was having; I&#x27;ve always had problems with dry skin, but in college I got my very first bout of acne, and it may have been at that time I started using Clinique Facial Soap.  I actually couldn&#x27;t afford to use it again until four years later when I was working full time, but bought a big bar at Crossroads Mall in Kalamazoo sometime in the fall of 1985 and never looked back.  A couple of years later I broke out again in one area of my face; the woman at the Clinique counter in Hudson&#x27;s (now part of Macy&#x27;s)prescribed their facial scrub cleaner and once I added that to my classic 3 step regimen (with the mild soap and #2 clarifyer)I&#x27;ve been able to keep a complexion to be proud of throughout my forties.  (There are a gazillion other things about me that I&#x27;d like to trade in, but this isn&#x27;t one of them).  Since skin problems like acne and facial eczema run in my family, and I&#x27;m the only one of my sisters to have been doing this regularly, I have to think the Clinique definitely helps in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pertains to the Mild soap, for \\&quot;mixed skin types\\&quot; (oily in areas, dry in others).  I mistakenly bought the extra mild once and it was definitely less effective!</li>
    <li> it wont dry your skin and it cleans well , it is better to use with a facial sponge tho, smells nice and great for sensitive skins. I am 42 and people think i look like in my late 20&#x27;s. i have been using this with other clinique products for more then 20 years.</li>

And it&#x27;s easy to clean.  This big bar might last me forever!</li>
    <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve had some major breakout going on with my face and this soap has helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I do recommend it and I will buy this again when I run out which I probably won&#x27;t be anytime soon because these bars last me months which is fantastic! Lol. (It&#x27;s a full size bar)</li>
    <li> Great product---I&#x27;ve been using this for years.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful, keeps your face fresh and oil free. It even deminishes dark spots leaving it radiant n clear, I&#x27;ve already seen results after weeks nw.</li>

    <li> I USED THIS FOR MANY YEARS and i love it  I used to habve acne as a teen and now i continue to use it with an exfoliating pad .</li>
    <li> Oh my very favorite soap, this big huge bar with container, I love the way my skin feels after using the is clinique product.</li>
    <li> I have used Clinique Facial soap for several years. Glad to to able to order on line, no need to go to mall</li>

I will not ever be giving this up.</li>
    <li> all was ok thanks, I was I requested, all was ok, thanks a lot for all, I will buying more</li>
    <li> Love this soap! Finally is clearing up my skin! :)</li>
    <li> I use Clinique soap for washing my face when taking my daily shower.  It is too expensive for me to use on my entire body but I trust it is being kind to this 81 yr. old face of mine and helps it to remain somewhat youthful looking.</li>
    <li> I agree, this is the best face soap, cleans w/o drying.  Been using it for years, also...  Here&#x27;s my problem; I just bought this in L&amp;T for $13.00 w/o the dish.  With the dish, Maybe $1.00 more! Checked again to see if I was mistaken, regarding the size, but I&#x27;m not. Add tax to that, and this price is outrageous! To that 81 yr. old, beautiful face, Keep using it, but get it in Macy&#x27;s or Lord&amp;Taylor!  You&#x27;re worth it!  PS Also agree the extra mild does not work the same way. Bought it because they were out of mild, and returned it. Love Amazon for the convenience, as well, but the price has to be close!</li>
    <li> excellent for kid&#x27;s acne</li>
    <li> been using this product for years and continue to be very happy</li>
    <li> Cleans without drying. Immediate difference in pore size noticed. Highly recommended, even by my Dermatologist! I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this soap was in my teens when my mother gave me a sample.  My skin was looking pretty bad at that point.  Within days of using it, my acne was fading fast.  I continued to use it until my early 20&#x27;s.  By that time my skin was pretty clear and I didn&#x27;t think much about cleansers.  But, when I hit 30 my skin went crazy.  I was constantly breaking out.  I tried everything under the sun.  Some things would work for a little while but usually my skin would go back to the way it was.  A hot mess.  Then my mother gave me a bar of this stuff again and now my acne is gone.  I can&#x27;t believe I forgot how amazing this stuff is.  My skin feels so clean and tight after I wash it.  My skin glows.  I will never go back.</li>
    <li> I used this years ago, and now, have rediscovered it.  It&#x27;s still the same great skin cleanser I used to use.  Makes your face feel smooth and clean.  I use it in the morning and in the evening.  Glad I found it again.</li>
    <li> awesome....exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I have always been fond of Clinque products. This one is no exception. I works well on my skin......not drying.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Lovely, \\&quot;plushy\\&quot; feeling lather, great mild cleaning facial soap. Effectively leaves skin clean but not stripped or tight feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loses stars because I just learned yesterday about Clinique&#x27;s sad insistence on animal testing.  Since I can&#x27;t know if this particular product is cruelty-free I can&#x27;t say I love it. Clinique, please move to a gentle, humane policy .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really miss the old sliding case, too! Wish I had saved an old one.</li>
