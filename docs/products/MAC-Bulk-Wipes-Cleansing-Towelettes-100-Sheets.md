      <li>Love MAC</li>

      <li>sure won&#x27;t have me buying them</li>
      <li>love them well worth your money!!</li>
      <li>If that&#x27;s not enough, the scent is wonderful - clean, light and fresh.</li>

      <li>this is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It smells a lot like Tea Tree, which I&#x27;m not a big fan of (kind of moldy smell), but it doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin or anything--only smell it when I use it and rub the wipe on my nose.</li>
      <li>my skin looks really nice on the next day!</li>
      <li>the only con is the intense smell that kind of smells like someone&#x27;s vagina or something.</li>
      <li>highly recommend!!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Sorry Amazon, you&#x27;re always my first choice but not this time...</li>
      <li>I mean they might as well be baby wipes anyway lol.</li>
      <li>its more like a cleanse than anything i love the thing they come in its like a open and close thing rather then a top that sticks on they do dry out easily but other than that!!</li>
      <li>They get the job done and pretty much remove any trace of makeup</li>
      <li>The packaging is such that it is easy to take a wipe when needed and the wipes remain moist til they run out.</li>
      <li>The packaging of this product is very clever, desogned to keep the towelettes moist.  </li>
      <li>Gently cleans my face.</li>
      <li>It cleans the makeup off my skin gently and really well, leaving no oily residue.</li>
      <li>so i cant really complain about that.  </li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t have much of a scent to them</li>
      <li>they are mainly for like foundation not so much of the eyes because it didn&#x27;t take off my eye makeup</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a MAC professional member and these are pretty much a staple of our kits.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this wipes.</li>
      <li>i HIGHLY recommend.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these wipes for several years now and really like them.  </li>
      <li>On the positive side, you don&#x27;t really have to rub your face hard to remove makeup with these unlike other makeup remover wipes.</li>

<li> Not sure if anyone else has noticed that....maybe we all like MAC so much that we sort of ignore it.</li>
<li> 100 wipes in a package last a LONG time.</li>
<li> I use these for makeup removal only because they don&#x27;t leave a particularly freshly cleaned skin feeling behind.</li>
<li> Leave this nifty little collapsible pack of wipes near your bathroom sink and I promise u will never wake up with a make up smeared face.</li>
<li> but i live in the desert with the least humidity that causes nose bleeds and physical problems</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t leave a white residue like some of the other products do.</li>
<li> and they still don&#x27;t dry out.</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry and there is no perfumey smell to them.</li>
<li> They never seem to dry up.</li>
<li> but a clean face ,cutting back on pore clogged break outs.</li>
<li> They are strong smelling and to me, smell like an unpleasant \\&quot;mildewy\\&quot; scent.</li>
<li> After I use them I splash my face with cold water and it leaves my face feeling tight and clean.</li>
<li> all my acne vanished after i started to remove makeup with this one because other makeup wipes or face wash from other brands left the makeup behind and clogged my pores.  </li>
<li> it dries out a little bit when i get to the bottom.  </li>
<li> so i put a little water sometimes</li>
<li> The 100 pack of wipes stayed wet and worked for at least 3 YEARS.</li>
<li> If anything they can leave you feeling shiny, oily, and heavy feeling afterwards.</li>
<li> and/or stop working after a few months, but they didn&#x27;t!</li>
<li> these wipes help to remove eye makeup but always leaves a little behind as i use MAC&#x27;s waterproof Liquidlast eyeliner and Lancome&#x27;s thick waterproof mascara.</li>
<li> afterwards whereas neutrogena wipes broke me out really bad on the next morning.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not thrilled about is the greasy feeling it leaves behind and the fragrance.</li>
<li> Unfortunately it does not work , at least not with the package I received.  </li>
<li> I felt stupid buying 100 wipes at the time because I just knew they&#x27;d go dry</li>
<li> I get really lazy and don&#x27;t wash my face before I go to sleep at night, but it&#x27;s really bad for my skin because of the amount of makeup I use.</li>

    <li> Great product!  Excellent transaction!</li>
    <li> Been using these for years. Love MAC</li>
    <li> at mac this item is only 26 dollars if you are selling this on amazon and i can just purchase it in MAC why would   it cost more?</li>
    <li> The packaging of this product is very clever, desogned to keep the towelettes moist.  Unfortunately it does not work , at least not with the package I received.  But the really unbearable feature of this product is the heavy ,smelly fragrance ugh.  I used the wipe about 2 hours ago and I am still reeking.  I will not be using this product, 99 towelettes going into the trash.</li>
    <li> I get really lazy and don&#x27;t wash my face before I go to sleep at night, but it&#x27;s really bad for my skin because of the amount of makeup I use. I use this before I go to sleep, and my skin has since improved. It smells a lot like Tea Tree, which I&#x27;m not a big fan of (kind of moldy smell), but it doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin or anything--only smell it when I use it and rub the wipe on my nose.</li>
    <li> The MAC face wipes are nice. Gently cleans my face. I like the 100 sheet package, so I don&#x27;t have to buy them as often.</li>
    <li> I love these makeup remover wipes. I&#x27;ve been using them for quite a while, and will probably never switch to another.It cleans the makeup off my skin gently and really well, leaving no oily residue. If that&#x27;s not enough, the scent is wonderful - clean, light and fresh. The packaging is such that it is easy to take a wipe when needed and the wipes remain moist til they run out. I highly recommend this wipes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these wipes for several years now and really like them.  They have a very light herbal fragrance and is such a nice way to end the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered another package from Mac online and thought, &#x27;gee I should check Amazon, maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay tax&#x27;.  WELL!!!  Imagine my surprise when I came here and saw the price.  They are $26 on Mac for the 100 count; that&#x27;s their regular price.  They often run free shipping promos so a buck and cents in tax sure won&#x27;t have me buying them here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Amazon, you&#x27;re always my first choice but not this time...this vendor should be investigated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a MAC professional member and these are pretty much a staple of our kits. They get the job done and pretty much remove any trace of makeup you want to remove - even the most stubborn/long wearing formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m not thrilled about is the greasy feeling it leaves behind and the fragrance. I use these for makeup removal only because they don&#x27;t leave a particularly freshly cleaned skin feeling behind. If anything they can leave you feeling shiny, oily, and heavy feeling afterwards. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as part of a facial cleansing regimen except maybe to remove makeup prior to cleansing. On the positive side, you don&#x27;t really have to rub your face hard to remove makeup with these unlike other makeup remover wipes. Nice for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish MAC would change the fragrance of these wipes. They are strong smelling and to me, smell like an unpleasant \\&quot;mildewy\\&quot; scent. Not sure if anyone else has noticed that....maybe we all like MAC so much that we sort of ignore it. 100 wipes in a package last a LONG time. What&#x27;s great is they rarely, if ever, dry out easily. I&#x27;ve seen people leave packages open for days and they still don&#x27;t dry out. They have a smaller travel sized package now I suggest people try before they commit to this larger one.</li>
    <li> These are all I use to remove my make-up. They are by far the best wipes on the market. You don&#x27;t even have to wash your face afterwards because they do such a great job all by themselves. They don&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry and there is no perfumey smell to them. They don&#x27;t leave a white residue like some of the other products do. The pack stays moist for months and months unlike some of the competitors if you don&#x27;t use them often enough. They never seem to dry up. I just love them and think that they are a great buy.</li>
    <li> Mac makeup wipes are the best.  They work well without a lot of rubbing.  Good price and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> i purchased this because MAC has great makeup, they also have great make up remover! i use it every day, i would buy again!</li>
    <li> Love these wipes!  They get all of my make up off.  After I use them I splash my face with cold water and it leaves my face feeling tight and clean.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes i had first bought these wipes at the mac store and they where actually 15.00 in the store idk why they are 30.00 on here but i love these wipes! they are mainly for like foundation not so much of the eyes because it didn&#x27;t take off my eye makeup that good they don&#x27;t have much of a scent to them its more like a cleanse than anything i love the thing they come in its like a open and close thing rather then a top that sticks on they do dry out easily but other than that!! love them well worth your money!!</li>
    <li> Love these wipes, my face is smoother and looks healthier.  Easy to use, great fragrance.  Relaxing part of my bedtime routine</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t put makeup on often...maybe once or twice a week. The 100 pack of wipes stayed wet and worked for at least 3 YEARS. I felt stupid buying 100 wipes at the time because I just knew they&#x27;d go dry and/or stop working after a few months, but they didn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Leave this nifty little collapsible pack of wipes near your bathroom sink and I promise u will never wake up with a make up smeared face. Hangover mayB .....but a clean face ,cutting back on pore clogged break outs.</li>
    <li> it did not break me out and yet did a perfect job cleaning out my makeup to the point no makeup was picked up when i wiped my face with a strong toner(glycolic and lactic acid) afterwards whereas neutrogena wipes broke me out really bad on the next morning. the only con is the intense smell that kind of smells like someone&#x27;s vagina or something. i wish MAC changes the smell.. but i got used to it after awhile and it does what it needs to do.  all my acne vanished after i started to remove makeup with this one because other makeup wipes or face wash from other brands left the makeup behind and clogged my pores.  i HIGHLY recommend.  this is the best product if you love makeup.. this is worth every penny. i use this, wash my face with Estee Lauder face wash, and then use glycolic(20%)/lactic acid(15%) and no makeup comes out on the cotton ball.. my skin looks really nice on the next day! highly recommend!!  it dries out a little bit when i get to the bottom.  so i put a little water sometimes which helps but i live in the desert with the least humidity that causes nose bleeds and physical problems so i cant really complain about that.  the eye makeup needs to be removed with oil tho if you use waterproof eyeliner and mascara.  these wipes help to remove eye makeup but always leaves a little behind as i use MAC&#x27;s waterproof Liquidlast eyeliner and Lancome&#x27;s thick waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> I normally love this product,but the wipes came to me mostly dried out. I have to moisten them with water to even be able to wipe my face. Dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Unlike the MAC Makeup powder I purchased on Amazon that seemed to not be legit....these do seem to be. Then again how legit do you have to be.....I mean they might as well be baby wipes anyway lol.</li>
