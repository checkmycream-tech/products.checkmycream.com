    <li> I have problem and this soap seems to do the trick for helping to clear up my problem</li>
    <li> What a bargin. I seem to be always ashy when leaving the shower but this stuff makes my body feel great. I use it for my hair and face also and I like the results.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discount for testing and reviewing purposes. All opinions expressed are honest and solely mine. I love this soap. I use it solely on my face right now. Feels nice and extra soft after using it. Highly recommend. Best soap I have ever come across. I will be getting more. Product is as described and better than on the product page description. Smells great to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Many products dont feel as great after continued use but that is not the case with this one. This soap is by far the best one Ive ever had for my face. Leaves my face feeling smooth and I have very dry skin. Does not dry skin out. The smell reminds me of chanel 5 to.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  I also use Black Cumin Seed oil in moderation as well. My favorite thing to do is to use my deep cleansing brush with this soap.</li>
    <li> just another soap. thought it might help some itchy spots on my stomach. didn&#x27;t last too long either especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful soap! Leave your skin squeaky clean and fresh! I bought only one bar of this product but came back after using it and got 2 packs of 6 bars to share with my family.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleansing soap I have ever used for my face. I have very oily and sensitive skin, and this soap is fantastic.  It is very rich and creamy.  It smells good, too.</li>
    <li> Really good for my complexion</li>
    <li> This Soap Is &amp;#34;AWESOME&amp;#34;!!! I only ordered one bar however, I plan to order the six pack!  I used it the first night the next morning. My face was so soft and relaxed!!! Love It!</li>
    <li> Soap is very refreshing on the skin as it exfoliate and leave a smooth finish. Great natural smell.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I love it yet though. The frangrance is very nice and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> This soap makes your skin so soft!!  It also smells very good!  It goes on the skin ver smooth.  It is pricey!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about a month now, and I love it! It makes my face nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Itis wonderful for  skin My husband loves it Order  a pack of it</li>
    <li> This soap has dyes in it. Not natural at all. Very disappointed, should have looked at ingredients before purchasing.</li>
    <li> This soap has quality of black seeds plus exfoliating properties keeps my skin soft and hydrating.little pricy but great soap</li>
    <li> Great soap just cost to much</li>
    <li> It indicates that you can use it on your face, but it caused mine to break out.  Great soap  for the rest of the body though.</li>
    <li> My skin so clear &amp; soft</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel very smooth! I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Helped with my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I live in Alaska, and have bad dry skin. Tired of moisturizers and &#x27;extra&#x27; things necessary to keep skin not looking or feeling like an alligator.  Not even half way through this bar and already notable improvement! without adding layers of moisturizers -- use it in the shower, no dryness, no roughness.... Highly recommend.  Going back to buy the 6 pack !</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  I do feel it helps my skin.  I bought it for myself but my teenage son has found it to be great on his skin.  Wish it was a bit cheaper but I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> It is very nice on your skin.  I really love this stuff and I can&#x27;t say enough about what it does for my skin except I wish I would have known about it sooner.</li>
    <li> Read so much about black seed oil soaps... This was ok... But nothing to write home about as far as skincare.</li>
    <li> I had hope for all natural ingredients...I should have read the description better.  The soap was OK....just a little scratchy with the seeds in it.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!! I use daily and it provides excellent results to more clearer, softer, firmer skin.</li>
    <li> Toxic ingredients. It&#x27;s a white soap with some black specks in it. But it has yellow 6, red 40, and blue 1 lake listed on the box which isn&#x27;t included on sellers list of ingredients. There may be other toxic ingredients that they didn&#x27;t list and I haven&#x27;t uncovered. I should have read ALL the reviews!</li>
    <li> this soap is awesome very good for your face</li>
    <li> It was great make me feel clean</li>
    <li> my first time using this soap was a friend in Kuwait. with the water being so hard, this soap made it a joy to wash with. it left me feeling soft and refreshed. didnt dry out my skin......i recommend if you like natural</li>
    <li> Blackseed soap and Shea Butter wonderful combination,  loved it so much I ordered six more bars.</li>
    <li> Great soap. No smell. Makes skin softer.</li>
    <li> Excellent...Thank You..i will order again.</li>
    <li> so far it has improved my eczema but I still have small spots of it.  Have only used for a few though. So far I do like the soap.</li>
    <li> SMELLS GOOD, SOFT FOR MY SKIN, WILL GIVE AS GIFTS</li>
    <li> No results yet, just starting using the soap. It does make the skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> Horrible commercial fragrance!  I take black seed oil as a daily supplement. I thought this soap would have a similar fragrance.  NOPE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sickening fragrance was so strong I could smell it without removing the soap from the cellophane it was sealed in. The black seed was listed FAR below fragrance on the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfumy smell is so bad, I will not be using this soap on my skin!  It is going back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is a white bar with tiny black \\&quot;pepper\\&quot; looking specks.  Perhaps the pepper looking specs are black seed hulls? I can&#x27;t see anything on the label indicating there is a therapeutic amount of Black Seed Oil in this bar. It seems like false advertising to me to call this Black Seed Soap unless it is referring to the black specs in an otherwise commercial type white grossly perfumed white bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try my hand at making some black seed oil soap that really does contain black seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate using several different oils directly on my skin.  Black seed oil is one of them.  I use it on my face too, but I am careful not to get it in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an organic alternative, I would reccomend any of Tropical Traditions coconut oil soaps with or without essential oils added.  My DIL in Alaska says the Tropical Traditions coconut oil soaps works better than any other soaps she has tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance on buying this Black Seed Soap because I am a huge fan of Black Seed Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this Black Seed soap!  Gross chemical soap product!  What a disappointing purchase!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin soft. There is a fresh smell to it. Fantastic.</li>
