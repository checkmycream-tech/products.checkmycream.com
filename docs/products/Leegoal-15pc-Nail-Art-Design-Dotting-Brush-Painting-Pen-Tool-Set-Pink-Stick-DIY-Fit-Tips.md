      <li>Don&#x27;t know if they are any good as they will be a birthday present for my daughter but don&#x27;t imagine they are high quality based on price.</li>
      <li>It was OK but one of the brushes was not very glued in and was easily to come out.</li>
      <li>These brushes are very nice but they are not super high quality.</li>
      <li>Took awhile to receive, but once arrived, was exactly the product.</li>
      <li>And i cut a few bristles on a certain brush for a more precise drawing.  </li>
      <li>Theses lovely pink brushes works well when training students how to hold a brush and concentrate on detail.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping - product as described.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m very upset with the actual experience</li>
      <li>as I went to clean it with a little nail polish remover, the paint came off.</li>
      <li>These brushes are easy to clean so after a few uses they got a bit hard and not as flexible as I needed them to be to draw my art.</li>
      <li>I am a major nail art and cosmetics person in general</li>
      <li>None of the brushes are small enough to make precise designs</li>
      <li>The only complaint I have is the pink comes off easily</li>

<li> Arrived way earlier then expected.  </li>
<li> I ordered these a while ago and the bottom metal piece connected to the wood came off 2 brushes which was pretty frustrating.</li>
<li> but that was expected.</li>
<li> As well as the delivery taking longer then expected.</li>
<li> Wasnt due until September 19 - October 7.</li>
<li> Came before expected and is fantabulous!</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t used these for heavy duty work like gel or anything</li>
<li> tube n watch a video on how to do it and go to work, within a few minutes my nails are decorated.</li>
<li> Also the bristles were uneven.</li>
<li> but after a few uses they start to seperate the tops fall off the handles.</li>
<li> They are a little stiff though.  </li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> Although the part where you hold the brush is like this plastic material and get stuck and icky over your hands</li>
<li> so when you go to make a design the little parts sticking out hit the nail making it sloppy.</li>
<li> Not a good product.  </li>
<li> But nothing a little crazy glue couldn&#x27;t fix ...</li>
<li> These brushes were poorly made.</li>
<li> Not happy at all.</li>

    <li> Came before expected and is fantabulous!</li>
    <li> Great for the price but after a few uses they start to seperate the tops fall off the handles.</li>
    <li> These brushes were poorly made. I opened the package and when I took the brushes out the heads fell off. Not a good product.  As well as the delivery taking longer then expected.</li>
    <li> My daughter was excited to use these brushes. With all the new polishes she got for Christmas, she has been doing her nails quite a bit. Good price on the lot.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying ... This is my hubby&#x27;s account but I&#x27;m the one that purchased the nail art brushes... (Lol)&lt;br /&gt;I only gave the brushes a 3 star cause some came in detached ... But nothing a little crazy glue couldn&#x27;t fix ... I just hope it doesn&#x27;t happen to the rest .....</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay the tips keep falling off I had to glue some of them</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price for how many brushes you get. Great for making designs on nails.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes! Well worth the price</li>
    <li> Just love my new nail art design brushes.  Going to get started with them shortly and so excited to see the brushes were just as the pics&#x27; showed them. Going for my lines, dots, design and create such beautiful things. Grand baby has already saw them and have to order more one for her, and order for others for Christmas.</li>
    <li> They broke off the wooden sticks almost instantly</li>
    <li> Pretty nice, all the brushes came.. Although the part where you hold the brush is like this plastic material and get stuck and icky over your hands</li>
    <li> These pink brushes are very cute for someone girly like me! I don&#x27;t know what some of the brushes are used for though. :/ They&#x27;re very easy to use and it&#x27;s very cheap for 15 brushes ! (:</li>
    <li> Fast shipping - product as described.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for nail art. I  able to accomplish many different designs with ease. It just takes a while to get it but that was expected.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get started</li>

    <li> These brushes are good for nail art if you only use them every once in a while. I am a major nail art and cosmetics person in general so I use brushes for nail art often. These brushes are easy to clean so after a few uses they got a bit hard and not as flexible as I needed them to be to draw my art.</li>
    <li> This item you get what you pay for, heads fall off, the bristles are cheap! I wouldn&#x27;t order these if they were giving them away!</li>
    <li> Just got them! So happy with them, exactly like the photo and they&#x27;re amazing. Couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this product !</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with my nail art brushes.</li>
    <li> I loved it and arrived fast!!</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expect. Happy customer!</li>
    <li> I ordered these a while ago and the bottom metal piece connected to the wood came off 2 brushes which was pretty frustrating. the brush parts on the brushes have some sticking out so when you go to make a design the little parts sticking out hit the nail making it sloppy. Didn&#x27;t really like these brushes.</li>
    <li> Arrived way earlier then expected.  Exactly what I wanted great conditions.  Have no problem with them.</li>
    <li> All were as described!  I haven&#x27;t gotten to use them all, but I love them so far.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> Now all I need to do is become more creatice This set is awesome!</li>
    <li> When I got them out of the plastic bag they came in some of the brushes ditched front the wooden stick</li>
    <li> Good quality. Just want I needed. Real wood. Great deal for the price!</li>
    <li> I have yet to receive this. Not happy at all. I&#x27;m very upset with the actual experience it&#x27;s been almost a month since I ordered.</li>
    <li> Wasnt due until September 19 - October 7. I got them yesterday and i love them!  They are a little stiff though.  And i cut a few bristles on a certain brush for a more precise drawing.  Just a tip.  Lol.  Thank you so so much!!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and brushes are good for the price you pay.you cant beat that</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used these for heavy duty work like gel or anything but these work pretty great for the price,I would definitely recommend! The only thing is the gel brush is very tiny, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using that one anytime soon but the other brushes are great.</li>
    <li> They are a really nice set</li>
    <li> Very nice paint brush&#x27;s. Paint with them all the time. easy to wash off and use over and over again with any kind of paints.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly much faster than the time listed. Don&#x27;t know if they are any good as they will be a birthday present for my daughter but don&#x27;t imagine they are high quality based on price.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected. Just what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> These work great I&#x27;m a beginner. I love putting little designs on my nails. I find a design I like n go to you tube n watch a video on how to do it and go to work, within a few minutes my nails are decorated. For the price they are awesome, take care of them n they will take care of you.</li>
    <li> Two of the tools came in broken but besides that they are good tools</li>
    <li> None of the brushes are small enough to make precise designs and s soon as I went to clean it with a little nail polish remover, the paint came off.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very nice but they are not super high quality. They work very well and are a great price, but more so for beginners because they aren&#x27;t the best. I really like them though and they work well. I would recommend these if you are just starting out and need practice.</li>
    <li> Good price, not great quality</li>
    <li> Theses lovely pink brushes works well when training students how to hold a brush and concentrate on detail. I love the shade of pink and the large variety at a good cost too.</li>
    <li> perfect! great sizes of brushes at a perfect price.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. The brushes were bent when I got them. Also the bristles were uneven.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Took awhile to receive, but once arrived, was exactly the product. Nice to do business with you</li>
    <li> Everything looked great, arrived within the time expected and the condition is excellent. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My niece loved these!</li>
    <li> Fantastic price-thank you!</li>
