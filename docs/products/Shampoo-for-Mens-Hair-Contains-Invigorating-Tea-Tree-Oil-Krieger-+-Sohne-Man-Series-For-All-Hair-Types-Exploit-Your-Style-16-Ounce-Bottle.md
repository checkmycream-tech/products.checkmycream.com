<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What a great shampoo. Hubz loves it. Makes his hair soft and smells good too !</li>
    <li> Smells great and cleans without all those un natural additives in most shampoos.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo! It lathers really well so a little goes a long way, the scent and the tingle is very nice. My hair feels softer and has nice body. It seems to air dry faster, not sure if that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t have the build up on it or what. Overall, I am very pleased and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> great shampoo but its pretty strong and took my breath away when my husband used it in the shower. It does make his hair soft and seems to have less dandruff</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. I am pretty picky, and my problem with most men&#x27;s shampoo is that they tend to be very strongly scented. krieger+sohne has a pleasant minty scent, and tingles slightly when I use it. My hair feels nice and clean without feeling overly perfumed or dry.</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo.  I have always been a fan of tea tree oil.  The shampoo has a nice minty smell.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband to use,but I ended up using it also! Clean,fresh scent,leaves my scalp a little &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34;!!! It must be the tee tree oil in it.I am so glad I tried this shampoo,love ot!</li>
    <li> Love it, got it for the hubby. Its smells great (minty) &amp; he said his scalp feels revive (&amp; it tingles).</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Has a fragrance that reminds me of mint.  Makes my hair feel clean all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched to this brand 100% now.  It&#x27;s that great of quality!</li>
    <li> Best you can Get! I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it! The smell is great and leaves his hair feeling fresh and clean. Another kicker is that it was delivered lightning fast! I read some of the bad reviews and I don&#x27;t understand. I&#x27;m going to try it tonight for myself. It smells amazing and I love the way it makes my friends hair look. Price is no different than salon shampoos and I&#x27;ve had some bad experiences with them. My boyfriend is sold on this and won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> My wife is jealous than I have a better shampoo than her now!&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an expensive shampoo with great reviews that SHOULD help with dry scalp and dandruff control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I have some psoriasis along my hair line and a good dandruff shampoo never seems to do the trick for me. I&#x27;ve tried many of the store brands and some of the stronger stuff (T-Gel) and the only thing that really works is the T-Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the T-Gel AND this shampoo (with the k+s conditioner) leave my hair feeling dry afterward. I alternate use between this and the T-Gel to control my psoriasis, so I can&#x27;t really credit this shampoo with doing anything special other than smelling pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying this again, my next shampoo and conditioner combo will come from the salon at the recommendation of a friend who cuts my hair (a professional).</li>
    <li> Been using this product for the last 2 days and I&#x27;ve seen the difference. My hair is softer and man the smell of this shampoo is awesome. Would totally recommend this to anybody. Great product really happy I got it.</li>
    <li> Both my hubby and I love this shampoo. It is refreshing and makes out hair feel strong and healthy.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband because he has really bad dandruff and dry scalp.  He loves it. It is really helping get rid of his dandruff and his hair really looks healthy and shiny. Good shampoo, smells like mint but nothing overwhelming or in a bad way.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this stuff. He is scared his hair is thinning and the addition of the tea tree oil makes his hair extra moisturized and sleek but not oily. It doesn&#x27;t dry out his hair, I think we need a subscription service for this.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband he has long  straight, hair. he told me its was an alright product but it did tangle hes hair a little as not to use this product when taking a shower because the cool sensation can burn a little on your body. but it did leave his hair fresh and flake free</li>
    <li> My husband has just found his new favorite shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it smell  great for a Man&#x27;s shampoo but it does exactly what it was designed to do, heals the scalp and reduces flaking. We have already noticed a difference in the little white flakes on the dark shirts!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful consistency, scent and hubby love&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;I got this for him for a great promotional price, and I&#x27;m glad I did. He&#x27;s loving the product&#x27;s results, and I&#x27;m really digging the smell!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Took a chance on this product since I haven&#x27;t used before and I&#x27;m glad I did! It smells great, wakes me up during my morning shower. And a little bit will do ya! No residue just good clean hair after every use! I&#x27;m going to try their other products! Seller A+!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Although this shampoo was probably meant to market towards maled, as a female I LOVE this shampoo. After only 1 wash my hair and scalp felt clean, my hair was soft, and smelt wonderful! I have been using H&amp;S shampoo because I thought it did a great job at keeping my scalp clean and free of buildup, but this shampoo outperforms my old shampoo!</li>
    <li> Got this as part of a gift basket. It smells great and the recipient loves it. He says it&#x27;s exactly what he needs.</li>
    <li> Sooo refreshing! My son loves it!</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo with a great minty smell!  Lathers nicely and leaves hair feeling fresh!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo along with excellent service!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo for my husband, so this review is based on him using it and what hes told me about it. I personally have not used it. Okay so he said the shampoo smells really good, that a little goes a long way and that it tingles. He said that it left his hair feeling really clean. This is now his new favorite shampoo and hes already told me when this bottle gets low he wants me to order more.</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS SHAMPOO FOR MY HUSBAND TO USE BECAUSE HE HAVE REALLY BAD DANDRUFF. IT REALLY CAUGHT MY EYES BECAUSE OF THE TEA TREE OIL I KNOW THAT&#x27;S IN ALOT OF MY HAIR PRODUCTS AND ALL OF MY PRODUCTS ARE GREAT. HE SAID IT ALSO MADE HIS HAIR MORE SOFT AND NOT AS BRITTLE LIKE. IT DON&#x27;T TAKE MUCH OF THE SHAMPOO TO GET YOUR HAIR CLEAN. HE WAS&#x27;NT LOSING HIS HAIR  HE JUST HAD REALLY BAD DANDRUFF AND THIS SHAMPOO REDUCED HIS DANDRUFF TO ALMOST NONE. SO WERE STICKING WITH THIS BECAUSE IT WORKS GREAT!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, this shampoo seems to make it look and feel thicker though also a little more dry, but overall I find the trade off to be positive. The shampoo has a VERY strong peppermint scent. I find the scent to be very pleasant, though it may be too strong for some people. The shampoo has a pleasant tingling sensation, more so than other tea tree oil shampoo that I have used, and leaves my hair feeling very clean. After rinsing my hair literally feels squeaky clean, which I like, though I find it unusual from shampoos that I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do plan on reordering and continuing to use this product.</li>
    <li> I know this product is for men but I have been using it for a week now for my winter dandruff if you do not like a strong peppermint smell this product is not for you but if you do this shampoo is refreshing and leaves your scalp tingling&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is also a great clarifier it seemed to strip all the old buildup off of my hair.</li>
    <li> My husband is very picky about his shampoos. I have bought tons of dandruff shampoos and his hasn&#x27;t liked a one of them until now. I had the opportunity to review this product and he really love it. I was amazed when I heard him say that. The shampoo is thick and not watery. The smell is really nice and not over powering. I would recommend this shampoo for anyone needing a really good dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it and his scalp feels better already.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo. My husband loves it already!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and does a great job cleaning the hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great (like mint) and tingles your scalp.  It works very much like the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo.  It cleanses well and washes away easily.  It is a great all-around shampoo.</li>
    <li> I know it says for men, but my husband wasn&#x27;t really into it.....so I used it myself and I think its great!</li>
    <li> Gives your scalp a wake-up call!</li>
    <li> Would definitely purchase this product again. Works great and reminds me of Christmas candy canes!</li>
    <li> Krieger and shone make a shampoo ideal for men. a biting fresh fragrance,invigorating to the scalp and manageable hair between shampooings. I am well pleased with the product. the only drawback is being careful to keep the shampoo well away from the eyes as it can react sharply. but all in all a great product</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.  I have also used it.  It made my hair shine, gave it body and I love it.</li>
    <li> Smells manly what more can I ask</li>
    <li> My son said he loves the smell and softer hair.</li>
    <li> Not a bad shampoo, but not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband.  He has sensitive skin and he is very happy with this product.  I think tea tree oil is a great product1</li>
    <li> This is the best tea tree shampoo! It makes your hair tingle, of course, so you can feel that deep down clean. But it also breaks down dandruff flakes to powder and is great at stopping the crazy itching from dandruff and psoriasis.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shampoo. I bought this for my son because he has a very dry hair and scalp. I used this one time and he looked to be much better. He commented several times on how nice his hair felt and that it was no longer itching. This is great for anyone living in dry areas who may get dandruff in the colder seasons. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband to use. He liked the smell, peppermint and it lathered great. So if he is happy, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It has a very nice minty smell and as far as I can tell is high quality.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband but I like it too!  It makes your hair squeaky clean and has a great aroma, almost minty.  It tingles the scalp and lathers well.  Neither one of us has dandruff so I can&#x27;t speak to that part of the shampoo.  This product compares to a salon product.</li>
    <li> This is the best.  My hair is so soft after using and I love how it feels so cool and refreshing</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great and gives my hair tons of body.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and plan to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great and has a nice cool feeling on your scalp.  Only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s a bit pricey but only if you&#x27;re used to buying supermarket shampoo. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Since beginning a Rogaine regimen, my scalp became drier and dandruff appeared (lots of new hair though). This shampoo has completely eradicated the dandruff and, moreover, leaves my scalp feeling invigorated. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product, love the smell!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this product!! I keep smelling my husbands hair after he uses this!!</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great, refreshing, and smells good too.</li>
    <li> My dad and son love it!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this shampoo. He loves anything that gives him that &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; feeling. This shampoo does this and gets his thick hair clean.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. Smell good and very clean</li>
    <li> We love this shampoo!  It feels so good and refreshing on the scalp, and leaves good body in your hair!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband and he just loves it! He was a big fan of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Shampoo but now he switches to this brand for its lower cost and comparable quality! Highly recommend this shampoo for whoever loves tea tree shampoo!!</li>
    <li> Makes hair feel super clean.</li>
    <li> It is good but smell too strong</li>
    <li> Smells great, the husband loves it!  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product for men and women. My daughter, son, and I all used it on our hair to try it out. We all liked the smell of it and how nice it made our hair feel. We all have some dandruff at times and after using this shampoo we all were nice and clean. I do like the tea tree oil in it because that helps to make sure that my kids don&#x27;t have head lice. I do normally put a little bit of tea tree oil in other shampoo that I normally use for this reason. I like that with this shampoo I didn&#x27;t have to put anything extra in it, it already had tea tree oil in it. I do like that this product is manufactured in the USA. Also I like that it is for all hair types. I also like that it is paraben free. It is 100% Money Back Guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product. I was offered this product for a great deal to try and give my honest opinion. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> My kids use this and their dandruff has decreased significantly</li>
    <li> My husband has very dry scalp and after using this product his hair and scalp do not appear to be dry and scaly as before.  Great product</li>
    <li> got for hubby...so far so good...he likes it and it seems to be working</li>
    <li> Rich lather, smells great and the husband loves it!</li>
    <li> After only 2 days of using it, I can tell a positive improvement in how my hair feels and looks. Plus the minty smell is quite nice.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells awesome and feels just the same on&lt;br /&gt;your scalp.Gets the job done in a robust way!</li>
    <li> No words can express how much i love this product. My hair is so soft and shiny just after one use. My hair has more volume and doesn&#x27;t get oily quickly. I used to wash my hair everyday, but now i only have to wash my hair every other day. It keeps my hair fresh!</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive about purchasing this shampoo solely because there wasn&#x27;t much information available about it online. But, other reviews won me over due to them seeming like they were written by actual people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works. It may be a little pricey, but you don&#x27;t need much per use, and you come out smelling pretty damn good. The mint smell isn&#x27;t heavy, it&#x27;s spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a very dry scalp for literally all of my life, asks have never liked how head and shoulders left my hair feeling, and I was glad to find that this shampoo and conditioner fixed both for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy both bottles again.</li>
    <li> Very fragrant and luxurious shampoo.  The bottle is large and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this shampoo and love it.  It helps for dry, itchy scalps and is perfect for everyday use!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! It smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> Works and smells great</li>
    <li> perfect! you will be amazed at the results</li>
    <li> Why would you want to put tea tree oil in your hair when it is known to have estrogenic effects? This is probably the worst ingredient for men.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this shampoo!! He says it tingles and the smell reminds him of the shampoo they use at the salon he gets his hair cut at. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The dryness that I&#x27;v suffered with forever has subsided...</li>
    <li> This shampoo was not for me at all. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and it has just made my scalp very itchy all day and given me more dandruff. Probably a decent shampoo, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting it to cure dandruff.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Fresh &amp; clean.  Great seller!</li>
    <li> My husband is really enjoying the this shampoo so far. He likes tea tree oil and likes the way this product makes his hair feel and smell. Has a somewhat more masculine scent then just the tea tree oil and I like the way his hair smells too.</li>
    <li> Yeah the smell is great the mint is quite refreshing. My biggest compliment to this shampoo is how it&#x27;s left my hair after only a couple weeks of use. The name brand shampoos in store shelves left my hair poofy and unsightly for years. This product has given me smoother, shinier more awesome hair. Seriously don&#x27;t be afraid of trying new things this is one great shampoo</li>
    <li> My husband was glad to see a product come into the shower that is just for him.  The smell is really nice for me as well.  Definitely a manly smell.  Smells like a nice cologne as he is stepping out of the shower.  Musty minty.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with a discount to review. I got this for my guy and it did great on his scalp. He gets dandruff easily and this has helped keep it reduced. His scalp is clean and smells good. He likes it and uses it when necessary to keep a fresh and clean head of hair.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband to try, because he likes to use a shampoo with peppermint and tea tree oil, he really liked it. Smells great,  made his scalp feel good,  would recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this on discount from a group this in no way biased my review! I love this shampoo!I have psoriasis on my scalp and this shampoo with the tea tree oil in it is amazing! Works better than the tar shampoos and smells invigorating! And no dandruff!!</li>
    <li> As other shampoos were causing my scalp to be irritated &amp; break out. My hair stylist recommended a Tea Tree Shampoo and when I was offered this one at a reduced price for my most honest unbiased review I couldn&#x27;t pass it up! The smell is very minty while washing but it doesn&#x27;t linger after a shower, hair just smells clean &amp; fresh. Gentle, but does tingle my scalp alittle . It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my hair as some  shampoos have. I have been using conditioner too so my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out. I have thick slightly wavy hair &amp; this leaves it soft &amp; clean feeling. Also now my hair seems to have a better natural shine now that my scalp is better!</li>
    <li> I know this is technically for men, but I love it!  It is the first time using tea tree oil shampoo for me.  My hair is looking shinier already.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo for my husband he has dry scalp and mild dandruff. He uses this shampoo on a daily basis a little bit goes a long way he has short hair so all he need is a quarter size amount. The shampoo is green and smells like peppermint my husband can actually feel it working on your scalp and hair. He has definitely noticed a difference his scalp isn&#x27;t as dry as it use to be and his hair looks thicker, healthier and feels softer .</li>
    <li> Works great! My husband loves it and will be ordering it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: my husband will now no longer use a different brand. He loves the way his hair feels and the smell! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> this shampoo is amazing.  it does a great job of cleaning the junk out of my hair and it smells amazing.  great lathering - a bit tingly ( from the essential oils, I&#x27;m guessing - but I love this!)  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome in the hair, leaves hair healthy/shiny, and even leaves the bathroom smelling great after a shampoo.  It does beautifully on men&#x27;s long locks as well, and has become a favorite in the family now.  We definitely want to get more.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> very refreshing smell and it works nice for my hair</li>
    <li> Just as advertised, nice quality</li>
    <li> While this product may do amazing things for others, this was a huge waste of money and a painful experience for me.  I have extremely dry skin, and this compounded the problem.  When I switch to a new shampoo I usually get bad dandruff for a few days and then after continued use it goes away and all is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seemed to rip the moisture from my body to the point that places that fold and crease (base of skull/top of neck, behind your ear) would crack and bleed.  I was literally pulling my skin off the day after using this, even when using a conditioner.  I used for 2 weeks straight and was advised by my doctor to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To a normal person this is probably a great product, but someone with dry skin/eczema/psoriasis this product will probably be unbearable for you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Edit**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer reached out to me and I was thankful for that. I gave the shampoo to my sister and she loves the product so adjusted the rating to reflect that.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, he has really bad dandruff from psoriasis. The very first use his scalp was much better, and it smells great</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, good refreshing clean feeling during and after use that stays for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t noticed the deep cleansing benefits yet since started using it recently.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel like your average shampoo so makes me think it is worth it since it falls a little bit on the expensive side.&lt;br /&gt;Going to try this bottle and might repeat if I consider worth it.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this, makes his head tingle and the smell wakes him up. Says his hair feels clean and styles nicely after washing. He thinks it could use more tea tree but what does he know.</li>
    <li> Seem to do a very good job</li>
    <li> Smells and works great!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Good and tingly on the scalp</li>
    <li> Great product for men. Leaves hair silky and manageable. Love it</li>
    <li> My hubby loves this shampoo which makes his day- refresh !</li>
    <li> It says it for men but I am a woman and I used it. I love the feeling it gave my hair, the tea tree oil is what really makes the difference.</li>
    <li> This thing belongs in the Red Dot Design Awards runner up. The bottle is gorgeously designed and masculine. This isn&#x27;t your shampoo bottle that your friend will think your girlfriend left it over at your place and then you broke up abruptly leaving that bottle at your house which is why your friend has never heard of or about your non-existant girlfriend. That&#x27;s just too complicated, unlike this minimalistic beautiful bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, the contents inside are just as awesome. Very minty, smells rejuvenating in the morning when I use it. Not sure if it&#x27;s keeping my dandruff in check since it&#x27;s not the dry season here yet but I haven&#x27;t had dandruff since using it so take that with a grain of salt or pepper or maybe a whole full course meal if you&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really good stuff and I like that it&#x27;s more natural with the tea tree oil&#x27;s, I&#x27;m not one for documentaries and hugging trees (unhygienic) but the whole palm oil craze and how that&#x27;s destroying our rainforests is a testament to how awesome this product is for not containing palm oils!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like heaven in your hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells good and lathers nicely. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Hubby is really enjoying how his hair feels and it smells great too.</li>
    <li> Hair smells great and leaves your hair feeling clean and residue free. It lasts a long time as it lathers well. My child has eczema and sometimes affects the scalp, this has been great and it does not irritate.</li>
    <li> This is so refreshing. My husband, my son, and myself all use and love tgis. Soft, manageable, and full of volume, love my hair. The tingly clean is fantastic too.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this shampoo because it has a minty scent, leaves his hair soft and keeps his scalp healthy (no dandruff). I was curious about it so I tried it too and I also like the scent and that it has tea tree oil in it. I normally use a shampoo with tea tree oil in it to help reduce dandruff. I actually got my own bottle of Krieger + Sohne to use (they are the most beautiful deep blue bottles) and got the Conditioner too.</li>
    <li> Great product so far.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> I look for new men&#x27;s grooming products for fun, and put them in DH&#x27;s cabinet in the bathroom for him to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34;. He&#x27;s pretty set in his ways, so he would never buy a new product for himself. He pretty much sticks to Axe or Dove for Men. Since we often get coupons for these products or get a deal with Subscribe and Save, we rarely if ever pay more than three dollars a bottle for shampoo. Like many people, I was very curious about this product. DH has very dark hair and light skin which makes dry scalp more apparent. So DH started using it recently. I asked him how the new shampoo was, and he said I guess it&#x27;s alright, why? I told him about the reviews for it on Amazon and about the cost of this product. He just about hit the floor. Why would any guy pay over twenty dollars for shampoo? We have almost no hair! He mentioned that his men&#x27;s haircut place sells a very well known salon brand tea-tree shampoo and even it isn&#x27;t twenty dollars. So from our perspective, this product is a rip off.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband, and he has thoroughly enjoyed it.  I have also used it on occasion.  I love the way that it gets down deep to my scalp, healing the dryness.  It leaves my hair very soft and manageable.  This is a high end product.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s not just for men.</li>
    <li> It smells great and was quickly picked up off the counter by my husband and moved to his shower!  He loves it!</li>
    <li> Love the smell,  love the feel.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Fast shipping, great product!</li>
    <li> my husband has a fallen hair due to hot warm water everytime he took a bath.. but this shampoo made his hair so strong and less dndruff.. the tea tree oil helps a lot to maintain his hair from not falling and it also comes from a big bottle which you can use for a long period of time!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! Only 4 stars because the bottle seemed to not be full , like maybe the machine filling it stopped before the end. Anyhow, onto the Shapiro!  We live in the dry desert , and this shampoo is like a continuous drink of water for my hair. It smells amazing , and rinses clean. We are impressed enough to buy it for our teen age boys ! I will update in a month to let readers know how it works over an extended period of time!</li>
    <li> Very refreshing fragrance.</li>
    <li> My Brother loves it! and will be returning for more!</li>
    <li> This is a nice shampoo for the guys.  The men in my family have all enjoyed using it.  I tried it as well and it left my hair soft and manageable.  The scent is pleasing and invigorating.  A small amount is all that is needed.  It lathers very nicely.  One final thing I like about this shampoo is that I have &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; my husband&#x27;s masculine scented products and they have left me all itchy.  No such problems here :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for just over a week now and it is just great! I have tried many dandruff shampoos but none of them work that well. Krieger + Sohne shampoo along with the K + S conditioner does an amazing job preventing my dandruff. My hair is left soft and shiny and my wife absolutely loves the smell, she is very sensitive to scents but is in love with this one. I have tried other top brands such as Argan oil and Crew but I will be sticking with K + S for now as it is worth every cent! I have also purchased the forming cream and styling gel and will report back when I have had the opportunity to give them a try too.  Happy customer!</li>
    <li> I got this for my son to use because he has problems with dandruff and being a teenager he seems to like having his own products that mom just buys for him. He loves that it is just for him and uses it every time he washes his hair. I have noticed a great improvement not only with dandruff but with the shine and texture of his hair now. He has beautiful hair again and I am sure he appreciates that as well.</li>
    <li> The whole family uses this shampoo. We do like it.</li>
    <li> I received this price at a deep discount in order to give my honest opinion.  Well to to begin with I am a women of 40 Who Colors her hair and the shampoo left my hair feeling soft and managable.  I have used it for a few days in a row now and my hair does not look oily and it looks soft. it is very manageable. My husband complimented the smell of my hair. I love beauty products with tea tree and peppermint. in fact I often add a theraputic grade tea oil  ant peppermint oil to my shampoos that do not have it in them already. I have used many brands of tea tree shampoo from Melaleuca to Traders Joes and I believe this one leaves my hair softer and shinier.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Bought the shampoo and conditioner together. I love both of them. The smell is amazing! The lather is wonderful and it gives a slight tingle which is wonderful! I will be a repeat customer of this shampoo and conditioner brand!</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping my husbands dandruff problem without the harsh chemical smell</li>
    <li> It says for men... but he didn&#x27;t like smell. I LOVE this. Feels great, smells great. .I make sure to have in my shower when I know it will be a long day. .great way to start the day</li>
    <li> its basically peppermint oil shampoo.  Gives you a cooling sensation as you would expect from a product with peppermint oil.  Nothing really special about it that I can tell...id order it again I guess, will take a year for me to go through the bottle though (its not that large of a bottle btw but decent sized)</li>
    <li> Good seller. Excellent product. It is Minty and makes  my scalp feel cool AND rinses leaving my hair free of residues. So clean it streaks</li>
    <li> This shampoo has been a great hit! It&#x27;s the same the salon uses but at a much better price. Amazing smell!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome! I love this and it makes my hair feel healthier.</li>
    <li> Smells good cleans good... good shampoo</li>
    <li> Works well... but pricing could be better.</li>
    <li> Smells great leaves hair feeling soft and smelling clean!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great with my hair</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Hair feels good &amp; soft. Old lady loves the smell. Everyone&#x27;s happy.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this shampoo. He is used to me buying him cheap drug store stuff so when he got this, he was very excited and definitely like the scent and texture it leaves his hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my fiance and He loves it! It has a wonderful minty smell and leaves his hair looking really nice! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to try a great shampoo for men.</li>
    <li> Really good. The service is great</li>
    <li> I have tried many shampoos in my life and now that I am bit older, I am inclined to go with shampoos of higher quality that cost a bit more. I started to use this shampoo and then travelled to a friends house for the weekend, forgetting the shampoo. Trust me I noticed a difference. This shampoo makes your hair thicker and it&#x27;s noticable. Good product.</li>
    <li> Wow. Just wow. This shampoo is awesome! First of all, a very little bit goes a long way! It&#x27;s not like other shampoos where you have to use a bunch of it to get a good lather. I have fairly short hair but I only needed to use about a dime size of this stuff and it was more than enough! The tea tree oil smells great and it gave my scalp a nice and refreshing feel afterwards. If tea tree oil shampoo is your thing, pick yourself up a bottle of this ASAP. And if tea tree oil shampoo isn&#x27;t your thing, give it a shot, you&#x27;ll probably love it! I received a discount on this product in exchange for my fair, honest and unbiased review. I really do love this stuff, even at full price.</li>
    <li> My son loves this product!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it, very high quality.</li>
    <li> Very minty!!! Beware when you use this that it tingles!!! I personally love the smell but my husband was caught off guard! He said he loved it though once he tried it. He has nice hair for a guy and using this and the conditioner it was shiny and soft. I even tried it on my own hair and was pretty pleased with the results using the shampoo and conditioner. Great cleansing and great conditioning!</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my husband, but I also use it to care my hair. My hair has several times dye and perm, it becomes very dry and hard to modeling. After several times use , my hair becomes more moisture and easy to comb. I&#x27;ll keep to use and hope it will keep works well on my hair!</li>
    <li> Really love this product works great exceeded my  expectations</li>
    <li> Made detangeling a breeze. I use it as an overnight prepoo. My hair feels devine after using. Im stocking up on this.</li>
    <li> I have thick brown hair and a lot of it. This product is not for me. It left my hair dry and dull but it cleans it and takes all oil or product in it. I understand it&#x27;s a shampoo and it&#x27;s suppose to clean it.. But it shouldn&#x27;t make it this dry and dead. I did enjoy the smell but you can find better for cheaper</li>
    <li> Got this for husbands severe dandruff.  This has helped tremendously.  Wonderful smelling shampoo.  Will reorder.</li>
    <li> Works well but not a fan of the scent.</li>
    <li> A strong peppermint scent that will wake you right up in the morning. And the packaging is beautiful. I can&#x27;t wait to wrap the whole set up to give as a gift. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but thought I would give this new brand a try and so glad I did. Shipping was fast, the product is amazing, and customer service went above and beyond. I think I just found my new favorite men&#x27;s hair care brand.</li>
    <li> This is a nice minty and refreshing shampoo. I am not a man and I am loving this shampoo. I have issues with dandruff, eczema and psoriasis and this actually made my scalp feel better. Hopefully I will see a lot less flaking. Even if I don&#x27;t it smells so nice and works so well, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Talk about aromatherapy! The minty freshness is enveloping while you shower and the smell persists in the house for an hour. This is the shampoo  to buy if that&#x27;s what you are looking for! Oh, and it shampoos your hair pretty well too.</li>
    <li> August 2016 update: This shampoo is outstanding! I received my first bottle April of 2015. I just ran out! Seriously, 1.5 years for a $12 bottle of shampoo? I have tried a few others during that time, but this is my go-to as it does a great job of cleaning my hair. I use Ice Spiker hair glue to hold my very fine hair in place, and this removes all traces of it easily and it doesn&#x27;t strip it out like some strong shampoos do. I&#x27;m ordering another bottle for the next 1.5 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review 5/25/15:&lt;br /&gt;Wow, this is refreshing! I love tea tree oil shampoos because they do a great job of deep cleaning my hair and scalp without drying my skin. The scent is awesome and manly, and the bottle is even &amp;#34;brotastic&amp;#34;. The seller provided the product for testing purposes. The review and opinion shared here is my own.</li>
    <li> This shampoo knocks the others out of the water! I love using it, because I get a lot of compliments every time I use it. Great for all types of hair, and keeps the hair healthy! I&#x27;d recommend this shampoo to anyone trying to keep their hair clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to try it out. I was AMAZED at the difference!  Loved the smell and feel of the shampoo. My boys have stolen it and love it too. My wife has even commented on how fresh my hair smells. 5 stars!!  I will be a long term customer. Thank you for great shipping and a great product. Top shelf!</li>
    <li> Smell  is minty and fresh! Helps with Dandruff!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Works great!</li>
    <li> Great product that gets your hair very clean and from what I noticed dandruff free. I use this on my beard from time to time as well.</li>
    <li> My husband love this shampoo and planning to order soon.</li>
    <li> Never have spent this much money on a shampoo before but I can say that I am very happy with this purchase and really like the product.</li>
    <li> my bf is using this and he has super soft hair now.</li>
    <li> For some reason, after searching the Tea Tree Oil shampoos available on Amazon, I selected this one, having never tried it before.  I had been using Kiehl&#x27;s similar product.  After a few washes, it seems like a fine shampoo with a great scent and lather.  I do not know if the strength of the scent translates to tea tree oil &amp;quot;potency&amp;quot; or concentration, but if it does, then the shampoo is probably rather &amp;quot;potent&amp;quot;, as well.  No adverse issues; the item was promptly shipped and was well packaged.</li>
    <li> Excellent product as I use this with K + S conditioner. Smells great and makes my hair look terrific.</li>
    <li> I use similar products and found this one to be the most pleasant smelling one yet.  I am not a big fan of the smell of tea tree oil but do love its benefits.  This brand has given it the minty smell and feel that leaves you feeling clean and invigorated.  Men if you use the shampoo in the shower like a body wash I would not recommend washing a lower section and leaving it sit to long unless you like that warm tingling sensation.  At the discounted price for this review this was and excellent product for nearly nothing, but at full retail price its about double to my normal go to brand which is very similar.  Yes i would recommend this product but more so when it is on sale.</li>
    <li> Good product, but it&#x27;s not worth the price. I can get a great bottle of shampoo for a quarter of the price. I typically use American Crew daily shampoo, and will probably go back to that once this runs out.</li>
    <li> My hubby and I are both using the shampoo and we love it.  It is refreshing and makes out hair feel strong and healthy.  I am going to order the conditioner because we like the shampoo so much.  Thanks for making this amazing product!</li>
    <li> This is a quality product an a great replacement for my former shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have had slight dandriff issues, and Head+Shoulders never really knocked it out of the park for me, but this shampoo works very well.  Good minty smell, washes out easily, and my hair feels good afterwards.  Probably not relevant, but if you were wondering: asian male, medium length black hair, leaves it shiny.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo for my husband and he is very happy with it.  We both love the smell, it has helped his dandruff greatly and his hair and scalp look healthier.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo, and it leaves my hair soft.  The shampoo came super quick and was packaged perfectly.  I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Boyfriend LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product ,leaves hair clean and manageable.Very subtle refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the bomb! More clam then the peach tree. Love it.</li>
    <li> This Shampoo smells amazing like a peppermint stick, which is perfect for the holidays. I plan to give it to my son since he has started using manly shampoos and conditioners. I wanted to try this because it has tea tree oil in it to help reduce dandruff which I thought was wonderful since it is a natural substance. I recommend this for any man or child to clean the hair naturally while still smelling delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample to test for my review purposes.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Would buy again and again and again and again.</li>
    <li> Personally, it made my scalp more irritated than it used to be, but not too much that I wouldn&#x27;t use it since I had it. I think the menthol triggered a negative effect.</li>
    <li> Great product! Will definitely be a repeat customer. Smells great</li>
    <li> Just started using this product for the first time and I was amazed how it worked. Smells incredible to me and makes my hair more soft. The wife loves it when I use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have for everyone. Was worth every penny spent on it and plan on purchasing more!</li>
    <li> Item as decribed. Fast shipping. Packaging in tact. So far product seems to be good quality!</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo definitely worth the price. Nice fresh smell</li>
    <li> Impressed with this product..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had Malin &amp; Goetz in my cart, need smoething that is really good for my scalp and cleaning all of the product I use.. gel, hairspray, and sometimes a little fiber pomade... Krieger did the trick for half of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service as well.  They called me to ask how I liked it and have me 5 bucks off.. ( too bad I accidently deleted the email &amp; coupon) oh well... will order more!</li>
    <li> Great product... leaves hair (the little I have) feeling clean.  Im guessing they use tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left off one star since the seal came unglued in the summer heat and got all over the product during shipping.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son to use to combat a dandruff problem.  He said the product works pretty well.  His only complaint was that it smelled like toothpaste....</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality shampoo that you would expect to find at a upper end department store or salon. My husband is used to the all in one type shampoo/conditioner/body wash products that are available at the grocery store, so he wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to do with this shampoo when I told him to try it out. At first he thought it was too fancy, and almost refused to use it. The shampoo does have a strong mint aroma when you open the bottle and while using it, but after the first use (where you get used to the idea that not all shampoos are Suave) my husband is loving this shampoo. He is a mechanic by trade, and manages to get a lot of &#x27;stuff&#x27; into his hair by the end of the day. This shampoo does a great job of cleaning it out, and leaving his hair &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27;, but not stripped of moisture. His hair is soft, and he enjoys the tea tree and mint &#x27;tingle&#x27; and smell. The bottle should last for some time, as a small amount of shampoo goes along way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My husband continues to use this Shampoo, and requested that I order some extra bottle for him to gift for the holidays!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo the past couple of days and I have a few things to say:&lt;br /&gt;-I have trouble using any shampoo without getting some form of dandruff, with this (although it isn&#x27;t anti-dandruff) it comes out rather easier and no troubles have formed so far.&lt;br /&gt;-The mint - or peppermint (as I like to say) is definitely refreshing. I leave in my scalp for 1-2 minutes after its in to feel the cool feeling, and afterwards my scalp is refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;-The container is quite a sight itself, it sets itself away from anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a conclusion, wish they made a bigger bottle for the shampoo because I will most likely be reordering. These&#x27;s not many times I look forward to take a shower just to use shampoo, but thats the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions, please ask and ill get back to ya.&lt;br /&gt;-Tom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit 8/22/14: The shampoo is just as good as the first time I used it. Thought it was worth mentioning that it had 3+ ounces when compared to a family members shampoo (believe it was Nuvea).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An idea occurred to me as well, if a body wash were possible it would be a 1-2-3 punch with the shampoo, gel and body wash.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he really likes it. We used to use a different brand of tea tree to help wtih his scalp health and found this to work better. Great product.</li>
    <li> I realize this is a &amp;#34;mens&amp;#34; shampoo, I am a woman.  I have naturally tangly, slightly wavy, color treated hair down to my mid back (think where your bra starts).  I love the light, subtle smell of this shampoo.  Rinses clean does not weigh down hair or ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this shampoo with K + S Men&#x27;s Hair Conditioner - Stylist-Level Hair Care Products for Men - Infused with Peppermint Oil for Dandruff &amp; Dry Scalp (also sold on Amazon).  This shampoo does a great job cleaning.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:fee4daac843df8045b2613ba61828282]] SALON QUALITY is definitely the best description of this Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo came packaged in a small Amazon box, well protected with air pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when unboxing this bottle was the weight.  The bottle itself is high quality, heavy duty, and filled with 16 ounces of shampoo.  Do not drop this on your foot in the shower or you&#x27;ll be hurting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle definitely has a very manly look and feel to it and the scent of the shampoo is terrific.  I really like that that it contains tea tree oil, which was recommended for my dry scalp from my dermatologist.  I also like the fact that it&#x27;s paraben free and comes with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> My husband used this. He describes it as refreshing and said it is salon quality. He said it made his hair feel clean. His only complaint is that he does not feel it should cost 21 bucks. Maybe 10 bucks. But then again my husband does not understand how much good beauty products actually cost.</li>
    <li> This is quite possibly the best buy I have made on Amazon to date. I know its men&#x27;s shampoo and I did buy it for my husband...But I use it everyday! The smell is amazing. It clears my head and keeps me cool, and living in AZ thats a good thing. I will buy this time and time again. It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great product. It smells and feels terrific. I used to use Crew and other brands specifically geared toward men, but this has supplanted them. Most importantly, the girlfriend loves it. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> I work as a BBQ chef, and have my head in an 8 foot tall industrial  wood smoker for 10-14 hours a day.  That smell sticks to you, and you end up waking up at night with a pillow case that smells of campfire.  This shampoo has done the best job at removing the wood smoke smell from my hair, and leaves it silky and smooth to boot.  Plus its made in the USA.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> it smells great but i still have dandruff right after use hairdryer and keep losing significant amount of hair. Maybe because my problem is way too serious. it says it&#x27;s USA product not from German. I was expecting this product can be compare to Aveda Invati Exfoliating Shampoo but i might go back to Aveda.</li>
    <li> smell very good，feel good</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I use it every day and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp. What a great deal on a great product!</li>
    <li> Great buy. My hair was thicker and straighter after one use. A must have product for all men. Will buy again as a present for my family. The peppermint smell is awesome too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been 3 years since I purchased it from Amazon and still have a little left in the bottle. I used it every other day and a very small amount is all you need for a darker, richer hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually swapped out my expensive salon shampoos for this. It smells fresh,feels completely refreshing, and leaves my hair very clean and shiny. Thank you for this great product!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo! Cleans my hair and refreshes my scalp. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo leave your head feeling fresh right when you put it on.  Not only does this amazing shampoo leave your head smelling great it also keeps it moist not dry like other shampoos which causes you to scratch your head.  I would recommend this shampoo to any man who wants a great shampoo that loves the scent of mint and wants to keep there hair moist.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband but it turns out we both really like it.  I find the scent quite pleasant and refreshing even though some other reviewers mentioned that it was too strong.  There was a shipping matter which required me to reach out to the company&#x27;s customer support and I have to say it is on the top of my list of great companies to deal with after that.  They responded immediately to my inquiry and promptly and swiftly made the matter right, even going above and beyond my expectation,</li>
    <li> Worked great and smelled amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with a dry itchy scalp for a while. I usually just keep my head shaved and it seems to take care of it, but it&#x27;s time I got my dew on. So I basically tried everything from target, from head and shoulders, Pantene, up to the more expensive American Crew. This includes shampoo and conditioner, separate and together. I bought this stuff simply off the reviews. I started noticing the difference after about a week or too, and haven&#x27;t had any problems the past few months. Needless to say this will most likely be my Shampoo for a while. After washing while still in the shower my hair feels a little rough, I don&#x27;t use conditioner. But after I&#x27;m out and dried it feels just fine. I&#x27;m sure conditioner may work but don&#x27;t feel like having it return my initial problem. Oh, and did I mention this stuff smells amazing to me. I&#x27;ve never been excited to wash my hair before on a daily basis. It reminds me of a mint and chocolate chip ice cream. Seems pretty weird, but I&#x27;m a fan. For the price, amount, and results, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo with excellent cleaning qualities.  It has a very clean, minty scent and a lightly invigorating &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; on the scalp while shampooing.  I would compare this favorably with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special Shampoo - that shampoo has a stronger peppermint aroma and the tingle is a little stronger.  However, depending on the merchant, Krieger + Soehne costs from 10 to 15% less than the Paul Mitchell.  I tried a tea tree style shampoo from Suave and my scalp started breaking out so - at least for me - paying more for better and more natural ingredients definitely helps.  I would buy this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I typically use gel in my hair almost every day so I need to wash it out every night. The shampoo never gets my scalp too dry and leaves my hair feeling fresh, clean, and smelling like awesomeness. Paired with the matching conditioner and my hair feels flawless.</li>
    <li> My husbands hair is nice when he uses this.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is fantastic. It smells amazing, right after use I got a compliment; something that doesn’t happen often. After using it my hair felt amazing; it felt softer than I had ever felt before and applying felt satisfying. I would suggest this to anyone, for any use: from a casual daily shower, getting ready for a big date, to a professional hair stylist.</li>
    <li> The smell is invigorating and leaves my hair very clean!</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;m glad I stumbled upon it. Every time I use it, I feel very refreshed and my hair looks and feels great. Scent is subtle and pleasing.</li>
    <li> I love this!  It helps my head so much from being itchy and having dandruff.  It has peppermint oil in it and smells so nice!  The peppermint smell keeps my bathroom smelling nice for hours, too.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and husband likes the tingling action. Uses medicated shampoos for dandruff/itch. No issues switching, and I prefer this smell soooo much better.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I ordered this for my teenage son. He loved the product so much he convinced me to try it. I am a female with colored hair and use a lot of styling products. This product was exception at removing build up from my hair/clarifying. In addition it did not at all affect my color-treated hair. I have and would continue to recommend this product to others. Thanks.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My husband was skeptical to try it but once he did, he asked where did I get it from and to get some more! Did everything it promised and it was an easy one step for him</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a little while so I could use the product before leaving a review--I am glad I did because it is more impressive then I thought at first.  It does a great job of cleaning your hair of all the gels and other products that get put on and even works to strip the built up products!  Used it on my hair and noticed after a week of continued use, my hair no longer had that oily matted down look.  It was lighter and easier to style.  I recommend giving it a shot.  I was turned off at first by the smell (because it is minty--assume it is the tea tree oil) but it does not linger on your hair!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband, but ended up stealing it from him for my self.  Great shampoo!  Love the tea tree oil, feel it tingling and working on my scalp.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is not bad among many others. Nothing exceptional. Although it has very nice mint it is not cooling, the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; on the scalp is almost &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34;. If you expect &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; effect try Philip B Peppermint and Avocado shampoo and feel a difference. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Really nice shampoo.  I have had problems with a dry scalp and dandruff throughout the years and this is the first shampoo that has made the situation better.  Would definitely recommend this brand to anyone looking for a good smelling shampoo or anyone like me who has had problems with dry scalp/dandruff.</li>
    <li> My husband love the shampoo. It does very good cleaning job as well as keeping hair smooth and in very good smell. It also works for dandruff. After he use krieger+shone tea tree oil shampoo, the annoying dandruff also disappeared. I will recommend it my friends.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo for my husband and he absolutely loves it. It has a refreshing smell and he says it leaves his scalp feeling squeaky clean!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, and had a great smell.  It gets the product out of my hair and leaves it fresh.  I am surprised at how little it takes to get a good amount of lather going.  And it has a bit of a tingle, too.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I am a Tea Tree fan! No surpris  that I like the smell of this shampoo a lot. I feel actually the vitalizing effect on my scalp from is the essential oil. My hair feels nicely cleaned and not oily at all! I would recommend this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Ok, ill admit it, i use this on my hair, and im a girl! I swear i have never come across a shampoo for women that smells so GOOD. and the minty feeling it leaves on my scalp is amazing. I told my husband sorry bud, this is mine now! I actually dont wash my hair daily, so i only use it about 2 or 3 times a week and it really helps with my greasy hair. This is a must for men or WOMEN.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this product as I give it to my husband to use! Tea Tree Oil is so good and healthy and the hint of Mint isn&#x27;t overpowering as it usually is! Great item for those that want to try something new and away from what we know as the main stream of hair products! Thanks for such a great product that my husband can enjoy using!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:d7b0b3e97f014bbfee6abbc5796e904a]] I Love the krieger + s&amp;ouml;hne hair products! This shampoo is refreshing and relaxing.  It keeps my hair clean, smooth, and smelling wonderful!</li>
    <li> I honestly figured this would be another shampoo, I mean to most guys shampoo is shampoo, it&#x27;s not as appreciated as it is from women.  Well...I stand corrected.  Smell reminds me of the hotel Live Aqua in Cancun, has that &amp;#34;aromatherapy&amp;#34; smell which was pleasant.  After applying, your scalp definitely tingles....very nice feeling, no other shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used did that.  Hair/scalp felt clean and refreshed after rinsing.  Overall...very impressed, never thought I&#x27;d be saying that about a shampoo.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband. He really enjoyed it. It left his hair soft and smelling good.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shampoo. The smell is just a tad too strong from my preference but other than that this product is great!</li>
    <li> I got this as a stocking stuffer for my husband. He has not used it yet. I&#x27;ve opened it to smell it though and it smells soo good! If it really makes his head tingle when he uses it, I might have to steal it sometimes ;-)</li>
    <li> I gave this to someone else to try because there isn&#x27;t a man in my house. He says he loves the shampoo it makes such a great difference in his hair. He said he never had his hair fill this way before.</li>
    <li> Leaves your Hair feeling cleaner and softer than most mens shampoo&#x27;s out there . I got it for my son to remove all the hair products that he uses on his hair then my husband tried it and now there wanting more . A really great product ,would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo!! Like the Tea Oil and how it gets all the the sweat out of my hair when using it after my workout!</li>
    <li> smell and works great! would buy again!</li>
    <li> Great smell, and I enjoy the tingle. I would probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> Originally, I purchased this shampoo for my husband however, as soon as I got a whiff of the tea tree oil I claimed it for myself. I love the scent of this shampoo and how a little goes a long way. My scalp and hair feels terrific.I might share this shampoo with him...or I might just keep it to myself!</li>
    <li> My husband prefer his own shampoo so I decide to use it today and oh gosh, love smell my hair and it soft my hair. I wish conditioner come with it. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this shampoo! And it smells amazing!!! Great stuff, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells so clean and refreshing. My husband really liked the way it made his hair and scalp feel and said it felt really nice while he used it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s refreshing, but the scent isn&#x27;t too appealing.</li>
    <li> A refreshing shampoo that not only leaves a refreshing peppermint aroma, but it leaves your hair feeling silky and smooth. The shampoo does not leave a &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; feel to your hair. It is a light textured shampoo that leaves a shiny luster even after drying the hair without extra added product.</li>
    <li> My husbands absolute favorite shampoo! He loves the smell and his hair feels thicker!</li>
    <li> Great product! Exactly as described! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I had took my time to give a candid review about the product. Frankly , i should admit that i bought this product after seeing many positive reviews and its almost fair to give good reviews to this product. During my initial periods i faced some difficulty with this product giving sort of burning sensation to my face and ears , however i think i might have got used to it in the long run. So you are expected to feel some sort of sensation during the initial trials and it works good to remove the flakes and dust off your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the hard part is the magic works only for max 3 days, after which you see those back in your scalp and there you go for the next round of usage.Its not going to permanently remove your flakes, and i have been using this for past 2 - 3 months and have not experienced a permanent move-out. Secondly it leaves your scalp very dry and hence ensure to use a conditioner or a moisturizing oil like the virgin coconut oil in tiny amount on your scalp and hair to maintain its health.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple of weeks now and it is awesome! I have tried a lot of dandruff shampoos but none of them would work. This shampoo does a great job of keeping my dandruff under control and smells really good too. It does not leave my hair soft whatsoever but it does feel clean. I am tempted to try the matching conditioner but I have never used conditioner because I have greasy hair so I&#x27;m a little hesitant. I think that this shampoo is a little on the pricey side but it is worth every penny and I can tell it is going to last for a few months since you only have to use a little amount at a time.</li>
    <li> Got this shampoo for my son. First, I love Tea Tree oil! It&#x27;s fantastic for the skin. Keeps my face clear so I was excited to see this in a shampoo. It smells like mint chocolate chip. Yummy. Nice tingle and nice clean hair and scalp. Recommended.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this..tea tree oil is one of the few things my husband isn&#x27;t allegic too!  The smell is very manly and he was grateful to be able to use something other than bar soap he was previosly using.  Will be making this purchase again!</li>
    <li> Terrific shampoo but the cap is terrible, it spills badly</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo!  Hair feels nice and clean after.  However it does smell a bit like mint chocolate chip ice cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using this shampoo and I like the way it smells. I have short hair and a small dab is all it takes to wash my hair. It tingles when applied ans makes my hair more manageable. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Stole this from my hubby and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  2/17/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hubby has been using it as well as I have since we first ordered it.  (Ordered a 2nd bottle). I have noticed new growth in my hair and and decreased oily scalp problems.  I recently ordered the conditioner and have only used it twice, but will leave a review for that once I have used it longer!</li>
    <li> Better than tigi use every other day works great</li>
    <li> Works well.  Pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> Lathers with small amount like it!</li>
    <li> Totally overpriced, joins the numerous low quality shampoo crowd who tries to be special by just having mint/menthol effect</li>
    <li> love it, light weight , works great, and awesome buy. slender and easy to clean</li>
    <li> So far, he likes it! So I have no complaints! He said it helps with his flakes too!</li>
    <li> Like most men, I just want clean hair. This product delivers that with a masculine scent. The best all-around shampoo I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son who is 21 years old. He really likes the cool feeling on his scalp that it leaves. I also tried it just to see what it felt like. It leaves a tingling menthol type feel on my scalp and on any skin that it touched, especially my forehead and back. I like the cool feeling, as well. I did find it was a little drying though. I don&#x27;t consider this a moisturizing shampoo because of that. However, it is geared towards men and many men with short hair don&#x27;t really need conditioner anyways, so then this would be great for them. My son had no complaints. It does rinse off easily, too. It also feels like it is stripping your hair of all excess oils and product buildup, which is good for people who put a lot of stuff in there hair. In the shampoo description on the bottle, it does say that it is supposed to, even though on this product page it does not state that. This shampoo is especially good for people with oily hair. Great stocking stuffer for the men in your life. It will leave their scalp and skin feeling invigorated and thoroughly cleanses their hair.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo,i have very thick hair and this makes it very soft and smells very good and you only have to use is a little, well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! My husband LOVES this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Kept getting tiny white flakes with a dandruff shampoo then I found out it might not be dandruff but build-up from the shampoo. Tea tree oil shampoos seemed to be recommended but finding a shampoo with tea tree that doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume isn&#x27;t an easy task.  Stumbled on the K&amp;S and after using it for a bit the little flakes are gone.  The mint smell is nice too, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> Has a great smell. You can feel the tingling when you use it.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying that this is excellent shampoo. It smells great and leaves the scalp with a clean tingly feeling. I will surely be ordering it again. I have been looking for an alternative to Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo and this seems to fit the bill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the bottle arrived the cap wasn&#x27;t sealed correctly and had leaked some shampoo all over the inside of the box  - both the Amazon customer service as well as the manufacturer were friendly and accommodating regarding remedying the problem.</li>
    <li> Quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - I tested this product against the other tea tree shampoos on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is clearly the superior product.</li>
    <li> I order the Krieger + Sohne shampoo/conditioner as a set on Feb 9 and received on Feb 14 with Prime no rush shipping. Both my hubby and I tried it (I am a woman with hairs a bit under my shoulder). I like its smell because I am a peppermint lover. The peppermint in this shampoo is a bit stronger than other shampoo products that I have used contains peppermint. Overall, I love it. However, my hubby thinks the consistency is strange. Therefore, we give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> My husband has bee using both the shampoo and condition and he says that it has been helping him.</li>
    <li> Seems to be an effective product. No problems with my order.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is great. Makes my hair and scalp feel clean and energized.</li>
    <li> Sports clips uses a similar shampoo which I have always enjoyed.  Love having this at home.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I wanted to try this out after having had some tea tree type of shampoo used once a few years ago at a salon which gave my scalp a neat tingle. After having used this a while after switching over from bulk shampoo bought at Target, I can honestly say, the only neat thing about this shampoo is that it makes the room smell like peppermint when using it. It also when it runs onto my face can make certain skin areas get that peppermint cooling effect from the oil used, and I don&#x27;t know if that is a good thing if it runs around the eyes. Regarless, I won&#x27;t be spending this much money on shampoo ever again.. at least until I&#x27;m married and the wife decides she wants expensive shampoos...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-month update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So three months have gone by and I have noticed that this shampoo no longer has as potent of a smell when in use. Perhaps the bottle requires shaking before use, I&#x27;m not sure. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again, however, because at 29, I have never had more flaky dry scalp in my life. I will most definitely be going back to the cheaper Suave for Men brand.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo I would highly recommend this shampoo for great looking hair.</li>
    <li> Great price! Smells fresh and leaves my hair soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Reviewing after using this product for about one month. I previously used Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo and conditioner. I have this product a shot because laziness took over and I wanted my shampoo delivered toto me. First impressions: smells great, nice and minty. It definitely cleans your hair as well as Paul Mitchell. The only reason I&#x27;m going with 4 stars instead of five is that it dries my hair out more than I&#x27;d care to. If you have oily hair this product will probably knock your socks off. For the price and quality, it&#x27;s definitely worth giving it a try.</li>
    <li> This says it is for men but I had to give it a try because I was blown away with the scent. This shampoo smells absolutely amazing! The Peppermint smell is fantastic in the morning! I have super long hair and I always have to use conditioner. This is true with this shampoo as well. It seems to strip out the gunk from my hair and leaves it sort of squeaky. After I use conditioner though my hair feels like silk. It brushes out easily and my hair feels especially clean. I have recently stopped washing my hair daily and since using this shampoo it still feels clean and silky. I love this product..but don&#x27;t forget the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo. Great smell, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> The lid was cracked so son&#x27;s had leaked. Pretty good product that smells good.</li>
    <li> Love the tea tree smell and it leaves my hair feeling clean!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, nice smell (mint), good level of moisture. Overall a quality shampoo, even for ladies hair (which I am lol). 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. But if $20 for shampoo doesn&#x27;t make you cringe then I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product and its series! Probably the best I have used. The quality of the shampoo is well over the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, but I battle with product build up and hair loss, and i&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and love how great my hair smells and feels!</li>
    <li> My husband normally uses Crew for men shampoo but we were given an opportunity to try this and I am just as happy with it.  He honestly doesn&#x27;t care much and says it all is the same to him but I like the smell. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  Price is right, and it works well.  My wife likes the smell, so that&#x27;s also a plus.  Only cons: I haven&#x27;t gotten any stronger using it, but maybe that takes time.  Also, doesn&#x27;t taste good.  However I usually have food around so that&#x27;s not a big deal either.</li>
    <li> Smells great and has a delightful ting to the scalp. Feels like a spa in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this product. Although it is a men&#x27;s shampoo, I have been using it myself. It is great for my dandruff and itchy scalp. It works better than Head and Shoulders and Clear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I like it so much that I ordered it again. Best anti dandruff shampoo on market</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo - definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and got it here so quick!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo!  I decided to try it and I am glad that I did.  It has a nice minty scent and a cool refreshing feeling when I get out the shower.  It is especially helpful on rough mornings to help wake up and get my day going.</li>
    <li> Love it!  The shampoo smells great and is great for my husband&#x27;s needs! He absolutely loves this item!!!</li>
    <li> I wish Krieger &amp; Sohne would update the title on this shampoo because I have been the one using it on my very long light brown hair! I absolutely LOVE this shampoo! The directions on it state to wet hair, apply shampoo, work into a lather, &amp; rinse. The word \\&quot;repeat\\&quot; is not in the directions? Why? Because it does the job of getting your hair clean the first time! You can smell the peppermint oil &amp; feel it working on your hair &amp; scalp as well. This leaves my hair with a nice, soft, clean look. I also follow up with their forming cream [[ASIN:B00JBDEXO6 Forming Cream for Mens Hair - 30% Larger Package - Medium Hold, Medium Shine - Krieger + S&amp;ouml;hne Man Series - Styling for All Hair Types - Non Flaking, Non Greasy - Exploit Your Style - 4 Ounce Jar]] (again, not just for men!) which I&#x27;m able to use on my hair whether it&#x27;s wet or dry &amp; it helps bring out the natural curls in my hair &amp; give it more body &amp; bounce (also another product of theirs with a fabulous smell!) I very highly recommend their products, this lady&#x27;s hair loves them!</li>
    <li> I love this product,  I bought it for my husband but I use it too, it smells wonderful and leave my scalp and hair feeling great.</li>
    <li> This is amazing shampoo!  I like the peppermint fragrance and leaves my hair wonderfully clean and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a super sensitive scalp, have tried every kind of shampoo out there to keep my scalp free and clear.  This stuff is amazing, the tea tree oil is apparently high enough concentration to keep my scalp happy, and the menthol is extremely refreshing.  I started using this to wash my face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers are right, girls will try to steal it, no question about it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is definitely not worth its price or the the number of emails and phone calls I received from the seller nudging me to write a favorable review. In fact, I am motivated to write this unfavorable review because of the seller&#x27;s tactics and my sense that reviews written about the product are inflated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has a a mild Scope mouthwash scent that is not remarkable or associated with the tingly sensation I expected from a mint shampoo described as \\&quot;invigorating.\\&quot; Honestly, it reminds me of a hand soap in its appearance. It doesn&#x27;t dry out hair and that I expect when I pay $20 for shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t appreciate about my experience with this shampoo is receiving phonecalls calls both last night and tonight and multiple emails from the seller. Maybe some customers are into that but the person on the other line was very awkward and left me feeling irritated and a little creeped out. When I order a product I do not appreciate being followed up with about whether I am satisfied with the product when it feels like a reminder to post a favorable review.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! Feels great on my scalp and the scent is just right, not too strong. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very good product, help treating the oily hair too. I love the smell a lot!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! My boyfriend loves it and I even use it too because I love the minty feeling on my scalp!</li>
    <li> My son was like to use,because he said that was fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Great product! He liked as his gift &amp; has said nothing but good things about it</li>
    <li> This was a great replacement to head and shoulders for my husband.  It smells a lot better and seems to cut down on the dandruff more than the other brand.</li>
    <li> Great smell and leaves hair very clean.  Ps, the wife uses it too....not just for men!</li>
    <li> My Husband will not use any other shampoo. He loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this for my husband!!  He enjoys it also!</li>
    <li> For real the best shampoo for dry scalp. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell and I love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s made of not-horrible-for-you-stuff. It works really well and leaves hair soft and clean, which is particularly nice for a shampoo.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is okay, but nothing special. This poor review was earned by the company Pro Store Solutions for hounding me by phone and email to interact with them after the sale. I even got added to their newsletter mailing list without my consent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a hair cleaning product, not a life style. I regret buying it and will never do so again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mint shampoo, that tingled. This seems to be harder than it sounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried different well-reviewed shampoos that I could find at the grocery store, but none were really what I was looking for. I decided to try Krieger&#x27;s shampoo, as it also has good reviews, and nominally does what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reader, it does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that a shampoo roughly 500% spendier than the bland grocery store stuff would be, well, at least 200% better. Maybe 150% better? Well, I guess it&#x27;s about... 115% better than most. Maybe 110%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when using it was that it didn&#x27;t lather very well. I ended up having to use a bit more than I normally would have to get the same amount of later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice mild mint smell, a different quality from your normal mint smell, which I guess is the tea tree oil. Oddly, the smell the mint in my restroom for hours afterward seemed to be stronger than the smell as I was actually putting it on my head. I would have preferred a stronger mint smell, but oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the tingle, the one feature I was really looking for that&#x27;s so hard to find. Well, it didn&#x27;t tingle. I used it for a couple days, hoping it would align its charkas with my scalp or something, scrubbed harder to tell my scarp that I mean business, but nope, no tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I would have liked more money going into making a good product rather than silly &amp;#34;RAAR I&#x27;M A MANLY MAN&amp;#34; marketing (not to mention the bizarre RAAR I&#x27;M A MANLY MAN follow-on emails they sent me after I bought it), but apparently you buy shampoo in the world you&#x27;ve got, not the world you wish you had. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s worked for so many other people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. Yay for Prime&#x27;s return policy?</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband, but I ran out of my regular shampoo before he did... and now its mine!!  I know its supposed to be for men, but I love it.  It smells amazing and it feels good on my head while shampooing.. kind of tingly.  My hair stays clean for days while still shiny.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Very nice $5.00 shampoo.  Same major ingredients as $2.00 Suave shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;There are much better choices.  Use Neutragena T/Gel and any good health&lt;br /&gt;store organic shampoo.  Brilliant marketing.</li>
    <li> really love the shampoo, even my wife also love so much!</li>
    <li> The shampoo leaves my hair feeling and looking clean, and it smells great, as well. I can recommend it without hesitation.</li>
    <li> The shampoo lathers up perfectly and smells TERRIFIC.  I will be buying this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love the blue bottle, love how you don&#x27;t need a lot to for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;the tingling sensation  that you get from it is nice cause it cools you down. My boyfriend loves this an more so cause it helps promote healthy hair an with him stressing over hair loss he like this idea :)</li>
    <li> Good lather, tingly and refreshing.  On my second bottle now, so that&#x27;s saying something; I don&#x27;t usually order the same thing twice because I like to try new things but in this case I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll find anything I like better.</li>
    <li> Smells like peppermint husband doesn&#x27;t like the smell. Looks like I will be using it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband but I end up using it now. Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, my boys love it</li>
    <li> Working great for the dandruff. Makes my scalp feel so good. Doesn&#x27;t take much and lathers very well. I love the smell too. Plan on purchasing another bottle.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shampoo. He said it really feels like it is getting his hair clean. It&#x27;s a plus that it also smells great.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, wonderful seller</li>
    <li> A peppermint-tea tree oil shampoo.  Great Feel - very refreshing.  Wife loves the smell too!</li>
    <li> Oh...man I fall in love with this product..Just after one wash I fill the difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine as a shampoo, but it&#x27;s so so minty. It made my skin feel so weird and cold and sensitive. If you&#x27;re into that, then you&#x27;ll like it, but I absolutely hated the feeling.</li>
    <li> This is really high quality Salon shampoo. Nice sized bottle too!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I love the smell and the cool tingling sensation on my scalp. It lathers well and makes me feel fresh!</li>
    <li> I love the way this shampoo feels on my head. The feeling lasts long after my shower, too. I am going to find a conditioner from this company. This is the 4th time I have purchased this product.</li>
    <li> So far so good with this shampoo. Lets see if my husbands hair loss slows down.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo for my husband since he has curly hair with huge volume. Living in a dry desert climate and washing hair everyday makes his head each and leaves some dandruff. I bought several different product for his dandruff but I didn’t find any that worked as I hoped. Then I got this one and it was a pleasant surprise. It really works and of course I am very happy. My husband is not a big fan of the strong scent but he says this is ok. I got it more for functioning reason so it works for us. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell and loved the feeling it leaves my hair after im done shampooing. Tea tree has always been a scent that I loved, mix with being in a shampoo and going on to my hair, can life get any better? This shampoo leaves my hair smooth, shiney, the feeling of clean and the most wonderful, herbal scent my nose has ever sniffed.</li>
    <li> My husband love this shampoo. It gets all the hair product out with one wash!!</li>
    <li> Have used other tee tree shampoos before, this one lathered better than those. Tingly and smells good like most. My hair is a bit long to want to use this but my husband thought it was very good.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS SHAMPOO AS A PROMOTION FOR $1.00.  This is a lovely shampoo.  Purchased for my teenaged son, along with the pomade, and he loves both.  The product is wonderful, and the sophisticated packing is nice to look at.  Will definitely purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Smells SO GOOD! I think it smells exactly like candycanes. I bought it for my husband to try, but I must confess that I&#x27;ve used it a few times because it smells so good and I like the tea tree oil - it feels invigorating/tingly. It&#x27;s a good clarifying shampoo. I think we need to try the conditioner next.</li>
    <li> This stuff is invigorating...The smell of it really gives me a boost in the morning</li>
    <li> Buy it for my son , it&#x27;s work very well to reduce dandruff. and smell good</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo an I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the sensation I feel on my scalp when I use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Better than name brand tea tree oil shampoo.</li>
    <li> Everyone else has written about the smell or such but, while they are correct, I&#x27;ve noticed that this shampoo and conditioner are also very economical even at the higher price.  Just a very very small amount of either the shampoo or conditioner goes a long way.  Really glad I switched from Crew to,this product.</li>
    <li> This is good shampoo. I bought it for my husband to help with his dry scalp and he loves it! The tea tree oil tingles on his scalp and his scalp has no dandruff. Good stuff and I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and makes the hair fab.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for about a week or two and he has no complaints. This is a great shampoo and does it&#x27;s job, and it smells great - like peppermint!</li>
    <li> Smells yummy, lathers really nicely. A little goes a long ways!</li>
    <li> this shampoo dose work good&lt;br /&gt;these are my own words&lt;br /&gt;i had received this product&lt;br /&gt;in return  for my review</li>
    <li> I bought this men&#x27;s shampoo for myself and omg, I love it.  The smell is amazing and is peppermint/tea tree oil-ish.  It tingles on the scalp and I was able to skip a normal wash, which never happens.  My hair feels so soft and smoothed out.  I love this stuff!  I used argan oil as a follow up conditioner and it&#x27;s an amazing combo!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome. I love the tea tree oil&#x27;s nourishing and therapeutic qualities. It smells great and makes my scalp feel clean and my hair fresh. I have found it does help with my light dandruff problem. Although it is a &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; shampoo, and my fiance likes to use it, I steal some from him because it makes my hair shiny and feel full and healthy. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he says he loves it. He says it cleans his hair really well and feels great on his scalp when he uses it. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and is pleasant. His hair has looked shiny and full since he&#x27;s been using it. It&#x27;s hard to get a strong opinion out of him on products like this, but with this one he flat out said that he really likes it. So it must be doing something good for that kind of response!</li>
    <li> Being the only woman in a house full of men, I bought this shampoo specifically for one of my children since he is always reaching for my high-end salon products.  After rolling his eyes and cocking his head in skepticism, he decided to give it a try.  His review is, &amp;#34;My hair not only smells great and feels awesome, but I like the way my scalp tingles.  You know, kinda like a little head massage!&amp;#34;  Now he is the one hiding &amp;#34;HIS&amp;#34; product from his brothers and mine are safe from his grasp for now!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband but curiosity got the best of me. I tried it and it smells great. Seriously - it was a strong enough smell to fill the shower but not so strong that it&#x27;s overwhelming, The shampoo quality was on par with what I&#x27;d expect...but I love that it has tea tree oil and the smell is great.</li>
    <li> If you buy this product, you will receive annoying emails and subjected to telemarketing phone calls from the maker!  The shampoo is fine, I suppose, but notice how many tersely-worded five-star reviews there are for the product!  No one likes shampoo that much!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works very well!</li>
    <li> So I gave this to my Father in law and then asked him for his review. He said that based on the description it was spot on, exactly as described. He has been using this for a couple weeks now and says that he likes the smell and the way it makes his hair feel. It doesn&#x27;t dry out his hair like he would have expected the tea tree oil to do and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down too much either. Feels really clean not like some of the shampoos that leave your hair feeling gunky afterwards. He says he will continue using it until the bottle is empty.  Overall he seems pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> hubands love its, smell so good, sometimes I use it too</li>
    <li> I love how this left my hair.. I love tea tree oil but this smells more like mint.. The mint overpowers the tea tree oil and it smells wonderful.. It has a smell of both .. I used it and then I love the way it left my scalp feeling.. I felt so clean and my scalp was tingly with a mint smell feeling.. wonderful product.</li>
    <li> My son likes this. He said it made his hair feel clean.  Not sure if it prevented hair loss.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have quite a temperamental scalp and this definitely helps soothe it!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this! It has nice clean minty smell and leaves his hair feeling very nice and not oily. Just make sure not to get it in your eyes!! I will continue to get this product for him :)</li>
    <li> 5 Stars for the shampoo. Hubby likes and so do I. Smells like peppermint and hair feels a lot stronger.</li>
    <li> This has become my new favorite conditioner! I use it with their shampoo. It has just the right amount of tea tree scent, but is not overwhelming. My favorite thing about these products is that my hair does not feel heavy, weighted down or greasy at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> My hubby really likes this! Me too!</li>
    <li> great price, fast shipping, great shampoo</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo, cleans fantastic. Really makes your scalp feel great. Only suggestion I can give is to get the conditioner also. They work much better when used together. You definitely will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!!!!!</li>
    <li> you have to use both shampoo and conditioner in the first use you will see the diference your hair is really soft and ready for any style 5 stars</li>
    <li> I have dry scalp and this shampoo worked on my scalp and took the itchiness away!</li>
    <li> Great Product! My husband loves it.  Leaves is hair clean with no residue build up.</li>
    <li> Great for helping with my dandruff. I love it&#x27;s fresh tingly feel and it really gets my very oily hair clean with no shampoo residue.</li>
    <li> Only used this a couple of times,and you can really smell the tea tree. The wife really likes me using it. As a plus it seems like mosquitoes don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> it takes out all the grease even after a few days of build up.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be a miracle shampoo but after a week of use I don&#x27;t really see a difference compared to normal cheaper shampoos. It&#x27;s not bad don&#x27;t get me wrong and I might change my opinion on it later on but for $20.00, I mean come on, my hair is still kind of dry so I might be forced to buy the conditioner to see results. But the weird thing is I noticed this company has all these good reviews more than any other shampoo product on amazon but when you look at sales there ranked 67th in sales. This leads me to believe these reviews could be fake, I might buy the conditioner and hopefully my hair will be more manageable, but I&#x27;m not too surprised with this.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is now my Hubby&#x27;s favorite....and mine too because the smell is intoxicating!! He says his hair feels 10x cleaner after using this shampoo compared to other brands. It gets all the gel out of his hair without leaving any residue at all.....and did I mention yet how GREAT IT SMELLS!??!?!??!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is AMAZING!! I bought this shampoo for my fiance and he absolutely loves it. It smells good, it makes his hair feel great and it literally leaves his head tingling. He uses lots of product in his hair and this shampoo gets all of that junk out. Normally he uses whatever is in the shower, so whatever i am using, but this is a great &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; shampoo that doesnt smell flowering or girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a great value for your money. The shampoo is a big bottle but it lasts a long time because you only need to use a little bit. I highly recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> Smells like candy canes. Cleans hair very well.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works great.</li>
    <li> My husband didn&#x27;t care for it.  He thought it was too minty and a little over powering to the eyes</li>
    <li> My husband has such dry hair.  I could see the difference after one use.  I know he loved it.  I tried a little too and loved the clean fresh smell of the tea tree.</li>
    <li> Really like this stuff.  I thought all shampoos were the same and never really paid much attention.  This stuff smells fantastic and really cleans.  It has tea tree oil in it, which is really fresh.  Get&#x27;s me kick-started early mornings.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I also like about it is it is very concentrated.  I only need a very small amount.  Good value for money.  I have the impression i need about 1/4 of the product vs. others I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly recommend this and the service was fast and product arrived in perfect condition.  Please note -  mine arrived with a disc top cap rather than a pump in the picture.  That&#x27;s even better than a pump - especially toward the end of the bottle where you can easily invert it overnight in the shower to get the last bit out.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I gave it a try.  Bottles look great in my new bathroom also.</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo. It smells like wintergreen chewing gum, more minty that tea tree oil.  I was hoping for a stronger tea tree oil presence but no ingredients list was in the item description so I took a chance on it anyway because of the positive reviews. Not the strongest tea tree oil shampoo out there but a solid product anyway.</li>
    <li> K+S is a shampoo that keeps every promise that it makes.  It promises a clean wash and to deal with dandruff and dry scalp.  After the first day my hair felt better and looked better.  The surprise was the peppermint smell.  It&#x27;s not over powering but it is refreshing(cleans out your sinuses).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until this product I only bought shampoo at grocery stores, so the price kind of made me step back and ask was I going to regret this.  But I went ahead and purchased, and was thankful I did.  This product taught me an important lesson.  Quality comes at a cost.</li>
    <li> Ι don&#x27;t know where or how my girlfriend found this product but she made an excellent choice . Fine product . My hair feel clean and my scalp feels healthy .</li>
    <li> I like this better than the Paul Mitchel Tea Tree so far.</li>
    <li> I know this is supposed to be for men but I used it and loved it!! I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and love them both. If you have never used a hair product with tea tree in it, or even if you have, you must try this one. The shampoo makes your scalp tingle as it cleans. You can feel it working. The conditioner has a nice scent that is good for men or women. It leaves your hair so clean and fresh feeling. It is really good for anyone that uses a lot of styling product in their hair. This will remove all of the build up.&lt;br /&gt;Both the shampoo and conditioner come in beautiful shades of blue bottles that look nice in the bathroom. I would highly recommend these products to any if my friends!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. My wife officially has labeled me a metrosexual now and that&#x27;s fine by me...</li>
    <li> What does it smell like mint?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should have done my research. This is a problem when buying beauty products online; you can’t smell it. It works out most of the time for me, but I have an issue with shampoo that smells like food. My basic rule is “if it is not meant to be put in your mouth, it shouldn&#x27;t smell like something you eat.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mint, cherry, vanilla, peach… those are scents for dental floss, lip balm, frosting, and pie filling… NOT shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must be crazy for not wanting my shampoo to smell like toothpaste, because I haven’t found many people who share me same disdain.</li>
    <li> Feels expensive&lt;br /&gt;Smells great</li>
    <li> First off I would like to say this product surpass any other shampoo I have ever used in my life. I personally bought the entire set from them to see if all the products stand up to the standard and honestly they all passed with flying colors. I have multipe comments from family, friends and even co-workers on how healthy my hair looks now.</li>
    <li> I received the shampoo today, then let my boy&#x27;s use as soon as possible.  Because my boy&#x27;s hair always smell so bad. I keep change any kinds of shampoo, but still smell doesn&#x27;t change.  But This shampoo maybe Tea Tree Oil, smell ok.  I will keep it for them use.  Thank you!I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.&lt;br /&gt;Good shampoo, purchased again.  Because we love it.&lt;br /&gt;This very good shampoo,  My husband use it.  That 3rd bottle,  He love this shampoo a lot.  And he told me, he feel his hair not lost a lot now. He said that he will keep to use this shampoo  forever not change any more.&lt;br /&gt;Now,  My boy ask me buy him a bottle for school.  super great one!&lt;br /&gt;My husband keep use this shampoo almost half year already,  he feel less lose hair.  Good news!&lt;br /&gt;Since my family start use this shampoo, No the other shampoo anymore.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells wonderful.  It also leaves your hair feeling clean and refreshed.  I ordered both it and the Conditioner and I am pleased with my purchase.  I am def. Planning on buying from this company again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He is so happy with this product. Smells great and leather well to clean hair effectively.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product for people who suffer from an itchy, flaky scalp or psoriasis such as myself.  The tea tree oil is very invigorating and has helped control the itch better than the leading dandruff shampoos.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Leaves scalp tingling</li>
    <li> So my husband has been using this shampoo for about a week.  He says that it lathers well and tingles when washing his hair (which he likes).  He also appreciates that the shampoo smells great as well.  He rated it 3.5 stars, and felt that it was not much different than the cheaper shampoos.  He will continue using and will update review if needed.</li>
    <li> I purchase this regularly,and will continue too. Really great product.</li>
    <li> This is great. Smells great and helps the hair</li>
    <li> I am finding krieger and S&amp;ouml;hne to be a really great men&#x27;s hair product company. As far as the shampoo goes I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it which is nice and the tea tree makes my scalp tingle. It clears up the itching from my psoriasis and it smells nice. My hair always feels great after. I have also used their gel and forming cream and I am overall very happy with the high quality of their products and will continue to buy their products as one of my first choices for men&#x27;s hair care.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my son and he says he really like the fresh tingling sensation he gets when he uses this. He also likes that this shampoo does not leave his scalp feeling dry.</li>
    <li> My hubby LOVES this shampoo! He has been using it for a few months now and told me he really likes it. Guess that means I&#x27;ll have to get him more.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing this shampoo.  My husband likes it very much and says it works well (and it has a wonderful smell.)  But, I wish it came in a bigger bottle for the cost.  Very disappointing that they raised the already high price.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells good and when lathered in and left to work for a few minutes feels good too, but perhaps is intended for a different hair type. I have fairly short, straight, thick hair that tends towards oily/greasy. When I use this shampoo, even twice during the same shower - thoroughly lathered and left in for minutes on end, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean when I get out. Sure enough, by mid-day my hair feels like it has wax in it and looks greasy/dirty. One has to ask, why bother with this product?</li>
    <li> Moisturize my scalp after the 1st time it also made my hair shiny and beautiful. all thanx 2 my mom for recommending!</li>
    <li> Has a nice mint smell, which is a nice change from smelling like a frat guy as other brands push.  Feels great.</li>
    <li> Great smell, and good product for men.</li>
    <li> Product was not quite what I expected as far as results...</li>
    <li> I am a woman not a man but this is great stuff.  The tea tree oil helps your scalp stay healthy and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome! It feels great on the scalp and leaves my hair clean and soft!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used. a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> When you&#x27;re a dude and get compliments on how good your hair smells, if you&#x27;re like me it almost feels weird. But the biggest compliment I can give the product is that it WORKS AS ADVERTISED. I have seen fewer flakes when wearing dark tees. I think I just found my new shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to review this product and to give my thoughts and opinions. While I&#x27;m a fan of peppermint smelling shampoos, this one is actually very refreshing. It really gives you that fresh and clean feeling. This product lathers very nicely, it gives you a tingling sensation on your scalp and really gets all the buildup and dirt out of your hair. Hair look very shiny and healthy after use. Overall, I think this product is great and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Great product with a great scent!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t fully realize how good this shampoo was until I ran out.  Every other shampoo I tried was so inferior.  It feels good, leaves my hair really shiny and I can wash several time a day if I choose with out drying out my hair.  I never need to use conditioner.  My kids love it too.</li>
    <li> After one shampooing I could tell a difference. Now after several, I can feel a significant change in texture. Hair feels thicker and holds shape. I believe it will do exactly as advertised and prevent further hair breakage.</li>
    <li> Long-time consumer of Head &amp; Shoulders, which is still a great product, but this shampoo leaves my hair and scalp cleaner than I&#x27;ve felt in a long time. Originally, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the peppermint smell, but when I tried it I was amazed. It even made me a little hungry. However... I think the packaging could be better. The bottom of the bottle was cracked and a good amount of the shampoo managed to leak out.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for regular hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells amazing! Gets the job done right and leaves hair soft and manageable!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shampoo.  It strips the hair of gels leaving it clean and fresh smelling. I tried it and loved it as well!</li>
    <li> Beautifully packaged. Has a nice minty smell. Can&#x27;t wait to give this as a gift to my mint loving brother in law.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  You do not need to use a lot of it to get a nice lather and it smells spearminty.  My hair feels thicker and my scalp is not so dry.  I had  bought it for my husband but I am the one who is using it.</li>
    <li> I got this Shampoo for my son since he is now turning into a little man he loves the manly scents and body washes. I also loved the smell of this Shampoo it smelled like a peppermint candy cane which was so perfect since it is almost the Holidays. We liked this product a lot! **We were provided this to test by Krieger +Sohne</li>
    <li> Great deal, love it! thanks</li>
    <li> Good stuff, would compare it to other better known brands. This smells a bit better though than the P.M tea tree stuff. Seems to work just as well, however is perhaps a little pricey for what it is.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  It smells great and leaves your hair and scalp feeling super clean.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Good stuff at a fair price-will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> Bought this product after receiving a nice price discount.  Smells wonderful and works well.  However, for the price, I feel there are better products out there.  I would buy it again with a coupon, but would never pay regular price.</li>
    <li> good shampoo. didnt really understand why it was for men, bought it anyway, and so far i like the fragrance &amp; overall effect of the tea tree.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product - I would compare to Paul Mitchell Tea Tree formula at a very competitive price. Happy to support a smaller company making quality goods.</li>
    <li> I actually gave it to my dad and he loved it.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I found this shampoo. Its like nothing i have used before and that fresh peppermint scent is the best. It does the job in cleaning my hair and leaving nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> One thing you must know is this shampoo has a VERY STRONG MINT SCENT. I didn&#x27;t know what tea tree oil smelled like when I bought this product, but it makes your bathroom smell like Christmas all year long. Really, I was disappointed in the scent because I was expecting a more masculine scent, seeing as this is the &amp;#34;best shampoo for men.&amp;#34; If you like the smell of mint, I would highly recommend buying this product, otherwise buy another shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does have a nice design which makes you feel like you&#x27;re using designer product. The shampoo itself is thick, creamy and light-green in color and does a good job of washing hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel like all its oils get stripped after a wash like it might with really cheap shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a quality shampoo, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider it the &amp;#34;best shampoo for men&amp;#34; because it doesn&#x27;t have the manly scents like you might get from Old Spice.</li>
    <li> I am a woman and use Paul Mitchell products. This shampoo is amazing. I love the smell and the quality is professional salon product. I will be buying this again. This product works well for keeping scalp clear of dandruff if you have it but if you don&#x27;t that does not matter because tea tree oil is a natural ingredient that cleans and is healthy for your scalp. You will be so glad you purchased this shampoo. It makes your hair clean and soft and you do not have to use much to do the job. Only one wash will do as well. I have thick hair and usually have to do two times but not with this product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Definitely a great buy to an introduction for further purchases! My husband definitely loves this product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo lathers really nicely and creates a thick soapy mixture once you rub it into your hair.  It smells strongly of peppermint and I felt a tingling sensation when I used it.  I have long, thick hair and this tea tree based shampoo left my locks feeling soft and clean.  The refreshing smell lingers in my hair after I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a female, and enjoy using this to clean my hair.  Love the way it lathers with such a small amount needed.  The bottle opens easily, unlike a lot of other shampoo brands.  I love the fact that it is made in the USA and that it does not contain a bunch of chemically based ingredients..no Parabens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received sample for review.</li>
    <li> I know this is a men’s shampoo, but it also says for all hair types. My hair is very coarse and tightly coiled and I loved the shampoo. I also have mild Pityriasis rosea  which essentially means my scalp tends to be drier than others.  The shampoo smells like spearmint which is refreshing. The tingle caused by the peppermint oil isn&#x27;t overpowering like some shampoos I&#x27;ve tried it is very invigorating. I especially enjoyed the fact that while the tea tree and peppermint are in this products don’t leave your hair feeling lifeless. The shampoo is also very emollient.</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo for my husband. He has been using its for about a week now. He doesn&#x27;t really like the smell much but I do. It smells like peppermint. He says his beard feels much softer since using this. He is overall pretty happy with it</li>
    <li> Wow! Maybe I have to use this in the mornings - because once I started working the shampoo into my hair - it released all that peppermint - and the steam of the water - mixed all together - it was like  - I can&#x27;t describe it but - invigorating! (It is late and I should be in bed) I did not even want to &#x27;destroy&#x27; the effect with conditioner and am still surrounded by a cloud of minty freshness, my hair feels clean - I truly love this! Oh, I&#x27;m a female, this is NOT just for the guys ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;It is morning - I let my hair dry on its own and it is so silky - and soft - I am really happy :)&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again - oh, and the husband is intrigued now, so he&#x27;ll be using it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd Update:&lt;br /&gt;Hubby used it and loved it!!! He isn&#x27;t one to go for gimmicks etc - but he really liked it - and his hair looks great! (He is so lucky, age 60 and a full head of hair!)</li>
    <li> As a hairstylist, I&#x27;ve used tons of shampoo in the past. I&#x27;ve found that a lot of tea tree shampoos are runny and very watery, but this product has a nice, thick consistency! I feel like it lathers well, which is a quality I love, especially in a shampoo containing tea tree oil.  The tingle was nice, and it seemed to rinse clean.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s incredibly conditioning, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be since it&#x27;s marketed as a men&#x27;s shampoo.  I think this shampoo worked especially well on my oily hair that I hadn&#x27;t washed in a few days.  It busted through the oil well, and then I followed it with my regular shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I would use this and recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a week now.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it! I love the smell!! It even helps wake you up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recomend this shampoo to anyone looking for something that cleans well while making your hair smell fantastic!</li>
    <li> Tingly! Makes my head feel great and smells wonderful. It works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Smells great and refreshing.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My husband loves the shampoo.  He suffers from bad dandruff, this shampoo has helped with that.  My husband says the shampoo smells like mint chocolate chip and it feels cool and refreshing on his scalp.  It leaves his hair smelling so good and soft.  I appreciate that it is manufactured in the USA.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband. He enjoys the smell and the tingle on his scalp. Great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo that delivers the soothe as promised. I will be getting the conditioner in the future. </li>
    <li> This shampoo has a very pleasant peppermint scent and works really well.  The peppermint scent is great for waking you up in the morning!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this product!</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo, excellent peppermint smell and the tingle is intense. Lathers very well i only need about a dime size for my head, hair is about  1.5 inches long but there&#x27;s plenty of suds left over</li>
    <li> Lives up to its reviews. I&#x27;ve used this product for 5 weeks and i could not be happier. I have thrown out all my other shampoos</li>
