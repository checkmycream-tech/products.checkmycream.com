<li> smells a lot different from what I expected.</li>

<li> Smells a little bit different than I smelled in the mall...</li>
<li> Item was as expected and undamaged.  </li>
<li> If you put the perfume on, no one can tell after 15 minutes that you are wearing it unless they get extremely close.</li>
<li> It is very faint smelling which is not much of an issue, but the big issue with it is that the smell does not last at all.</li>
<li> Not sure about the fragnace.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s nothing worse than someone wearing overpowering perfume.</li>
<li> I like how it&#x27;s faint and leaves a bit of mystery.</li>

    <li> Smells a little bit different than I smelled in the mall... But it&#x27;s still good</li>
    <li> The smell is delicious and the packaging is wonderful.  Of course we all wish that there were stands for these containers but they look just fine lying on their sides.  I have this myself and ordered one on Amazon for my granddaughter.  We are both Katy Perry fans.</li>
    <li> Love the lok of the bottle. Not sure about the fragnace. smells a lot different from what I expected.</li>
    <li> A very lovely scent in an incredibly stunning bottle. The fragrance is very clean and light, with a soft sweetness. My boyfriend says it makes him think of blueberries, and I think I know what he means. I looove the way this cool bottle looks laying on my dresser. Note: it does not stand up in the traditional sense, you lay the bottle on its side (there is no stand for it).</li>
    <li> I like the smell, it&#x27;s not my favorite but is nice. It smells like vanilla and flowers. Bottle is Darker than the photo, a Sapphire  blue. I love the bottle, it&#x27;s a nice size amount of perfume.</li>
    <li> I searched high and low for this perfume and found it here.  Item was as expected and undamaged.  Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan. It smells to me like vanilla and citronella. Think Vanilla Fields plus bug spray. I ended up giving it to my daughter who gladly accepted it. The bottle is really neat though. 2 stars</li>
    <li> excellent than expected</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this perfume and so did my fiance when looking to make the purchase. It is very faint smelling which is not much of an issue, but the big issue with it is that the smell does not last at all. If you put the perfume on, no one can tell after 15 minutes that you are wearing it unless they get extremely close.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my daughter as a gift.  She loves it.  The smell is light, not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous packaging and it lasts forever. you only need 1-2 spritz to keep it going all day. To me it smells like vanilla blueberry and musk. I hesitated to buy perfume because I&#x27;m stingy but found my self going to the sample at a store constantly and finally ended up buying it on amazon.</li>
    <li> Oh , this is nice from the bottle to what is inside the bottle . A light, yet victorious fragrance . A must in your fragrance collection .</li>
    <li> Best sent she has out</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t bought this perfume yet -- have to wait til payday -- but my coworker had it on and wow oh wow - I have to have it like yeaterday -- smells like heaven!! She&#x27;s a perfume &#x27;junkie&#x27; and its her favorite!! Mine too (purchasing from AmaZon of course)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume!! I receive it earlier than what they told me I would. It was packaged really well. I would definitely recommend this time my friends! Great company.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this perfume. The packaging is just a bonus. Even though people were complaining it didn&#x27;t last and how it&#x27;s not powerful; I like it that way. There&#x27;s nothing worse than someone wearing overpowering perfume. It&#x27;s obnoxious. I like how it&#x27;s faint and leaves a bit of mystery. Like, &amp;#34;what is that smell? It smells delicious.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is just all around awesome. Except for the fact it can&#x27;t stand up. You have to lay it on the side which can prove to be a problem as it rolls a lot.&lt;br /&gt;But overall beautiful perfume. I really like it and the size for what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and 100% satisfied with my experience. Smells amazing and come in a cute bottle</li>
