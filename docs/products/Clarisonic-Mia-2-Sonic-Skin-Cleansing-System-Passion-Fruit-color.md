      <li>Everything came as described and I love my Clarisonic and would recommend it to anyone and everyone who has skin problems or just wants a better clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
      <li>I think that over time, the Clarisonic will significantly improve the damage done.  </li>
      <li>This exact product is authentic</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and was a bit worried that this would be too harsh, but the sensitive brush head is perfect, and the free cleanser sample is great on my skin.</li>
      <li>And CLEAN like it&#x27;s never been.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Travels and works well too get the pores clean.  </li>
      <li>I use my own face wash with it depending if my face is more dry, or has some zits.</li>
      <li>My skin did initially get worse, since the system brought a lot of under the skin imperfections which were just &amp;#34;waiting&amp;#34; to the surface, but I immediately experienced a very clean, great feeling and every day it seemed to improve.</li>
      <li>Not only does it keep my face exfoliated and clean, its helped him with his ingrown hair problem which many man struggle with!</li>
      <li>Such an amazing cleansing tool.</li>
      <li>I have considered dermabrasion and laser, but not crazy about either.  </li>
      <li>Was it worth it?  </li>
      <li>The Mia is absolutely worth trying.</li>
      <li>,  my pores have seemed to almost disappear on my nose and my face is so soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>Well I made the right decision.</li>
      <li>So easy to use, makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
      <li>SURE I WAS GIVING IT TO HER as I was packing my luggage and boxing it back up.  </li>
      <li>my skin is much tighter, lighter and golwy!</li>
      <li>Highly Highly recommended!!</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to use this every day when I first purchased it just because of some of the reviews I read.</li>
      <li>Approaching 50(April 8)</li>
      <li>I first saw the Clarisonic at my hair salon, and thought about purchasing but never did.</li>
      <li>I put off buying a Mia for so long, mostly because I was concerned I would spend a fair amount of money on a product which would ultimately not work like so many I had tried previously.</li>
      <li>Gets skin clean and soft!  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much nicer my skin looked and felt the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>I have suffered from oily skin my entire life - and for the first time, my skin feels truly clean.</li>
      <li>it is the real deal.</li>
      <li>I also find that my makeup goes on much smoother and with the pores clearing and healing, powder smooths and defines,  and does not exacerbate the enlarged pore size.</li>
      <li>I ended up promising this one to my MIL as a &amp;#34;Thank-You&amp;#34; gift.  </li>
      <li>Maybe Clarisonic should make a more &#x27;manly&#x27; model LOL, but behind closed doors</li>
      <li>My face feels so much cleaner after each use.</li>
      <li>I wanted a Clarisonic facial cleaner for a while and my Husband ordered this cute little Mia for my birthday and let me tell you, its a dream come true!</li>
      <li>as many others on amazon are imitation clarisonics.</li>
      <li>the sensitive brush if its ur first time.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly suggest.</li>
      <li>I a harsh critic of many products?  </li>
      <li>its my new addiction.</li>
      <li>Each day, I see years of damage beginning to heal, and my skin reacting to its new health.</li>
      <li>i am 46 years old have suffered from mild adult breakouts, especially after 40.  </li>
      <li>O.M.G., WOW!  </li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Little carrier makes it easy to pack up for overnights.</li>
      <li>I buckled after experiencing another breakout after a &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; period and then reading all of the positive online reviews (hundreds of them on different sites) plus being convinced by friends who swore by the Mia.</li>
      <li>Having tried the first three levels of models, my recommendation is skip the Mia, it isn&#x27;t as powerful as the Mia 2, and I&#x27;m not sure the model above Mia 2 (Avia?) is worth the extra dough, except for the warranty.  </li>
      <li>Was fighting adult cystic acne and the Clairisonic has changed my life.</li>
      <li>This has been noticeable over the last couple weeks since I purchased, and continues to work the material out gently.</li>
      <li>I can actually see how much dirt and makeup is being removed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now a complete believer.</li>
      <li>this will be the next household product that we cannot live without...</li>
      <li>When I was in my teens, I had severe acne, and my parents took me to a dermatologist who unfortunately for me, did more harm than good - not a very good doctor in my humble opinion.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin so soft - I am already noticing the difference in such a short period of time.....</li>

    <li> Everything came as described and I love my Clarisonic and would recommend it to anyone and everyone who has skin problems or just wants a better clean.</li>
    <li> i am 46 years old have suffered from mild adult breakouts, especially after 40.  after buying this product for my daughters and them raving about it, they convinced me i needed one as well.  easy to use and face is so smooth after use. this will be the next household product that we cannot live without...</li>
    <li> this was defective upon arrival, sent it back, bought one elsewhere and use it faithfully</li>
    <li> I wanted a Clarisonic facial cleaner for a while and my Husband ordered this cute little Mia for my birthday and let me tell you, its a dream come true! This little cutie is amazing and my husband even uses it on his face (with his own brush mind you LOL). Not only does it keep my face exfoliated and clean, its helped him with his ingrown hair problem which many man struggle with! So Ladies and Gents, this product is for you! Maybe Clarisonic should make a more &#x27;manly&#x27; model LOL, but behind closed doors My husband doesn&#x27;t care that its light purple. Its a winner!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to use this every day when I first purchased it just because of some of the reviews I read. I started off using this once a week and gradually increased to every day. This product is the best! My skin feels and looks great. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the clarisonic its my new addiction. This exact product is authentic so i suggest you buy this one as many others on amazon are imitation clarisonics. I use this every day and it cleans my face so well. It&#x27;s been a week and I&#x27;ve already got noticeably(by others as well as myself) clearer and cleaner skin. I can&#x27;t wait to deck mine out with the different brush heads and try out everything for this (specifically the deep pore set) Right now I use my mario badescu enzyme cleanser gel which is perfect with the clarisonic. I am a happy happy gal.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft - I am already noticing the difference in such a short period of time.....My facialist recommended this product to me.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I can actually see how much dirt and makeup is being removed. So glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> u won&#x27;t go wrong with this gadget. and i know why everyone raves about it now.get the sensitive brush if its ur first time.</li>
    <li> This product charges easily.  Is easy to care for and make my skin feel wonderful.  People have said that my skin is glowing.  I also find that my night cream and morning primer go on more smoothly and I need less product.</li>
    <li> Wow! Best purchase EVER!! Was fighting adult cystic acne and the Clairisonic has changed my life. Highly Highly recommended!! I charge it once a week and it&#x27;s good to go !</li>
    <li> I only wish I had gotten a Clarisonic sooner. I use it with the Clinique three step cleansing and conditioning system and my skin has never felt better. I have suffered from oily skin my entire life - and for the first time, my skin feels truly clean. But its more than that. With oily skin comes clogged pores, and with clogged pores, enlarged pores. This occurs due to sebum - skin oils, and trapped debris clogging them. The Mia 2 has the ability to truly begin to work the material out of the pore, and let them heal and close. This has been noticeable over the last couple weeks since I purchased, and continues to work the material out gently. I first saw the Clarisonic at my hair salon, and thought about purchasing but never did. Its used for facials at the salon.  The Clarisonic skin cleansing system was recommended to me by a friend and I decided to purchase. Each day, I see years of damage beginning to heal, and my skin reacting to its new health. When I was in my teens, I had severe acne, and my parents took me to a dermatologist who unfortunately for me, did more harm than good - not a very good doctor in my humble opinion. He left my skin rather ravaged. I have considered dermabrasion and laser, but not crazy about either.  I think that over time, the Clarisonic will significantly improve the damage done.  I also find that my makeup goes on much smoother and with the pores clearing and healing, powder smooths and defines,  and does not exacerbate the enlarged pore size. I have also noticed that fine lines are lessening.  Of course everyone is different, so this is just my experience.  But I will say this - I will never be without a Clarisonic skin cleansing system again. It truly is my new best friend.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to give this a 5 star rating but I truly feel a difference.  I was having hormonal breakouts and black heads.  My skin is clear and the black heads have lessened.  Great product!</li>
    <li> this product is amazing. i have never used anything that made my face feel soo smooth. It slouches off dead skin cells and makes your face feel rejuvinated.</li>
    <li> I have had combination oily/breakout skin on and off over the last few years, generally due to stress. I put off buying a Mia for so long, mostly because I was concerned I would spend a fair amount of money on a product which would ultimately not work like so many I had tried previously. I buckled after experiencing another breakout after a &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; period and then reading all of the positive online reviews (hundreds of them on different sites) plus being convinced by friends who swore by the Mia. My skin did initially get worse, since the system brought a lot of under the skin imperfections which were just &amp;#34;waiting&amp;#34; to the surface, but I immediately experienced a very clean, great feeling and every day it seemed to improve. My husband has even noticed how much better my skin looks, both with and without makeup on. The Mia is absolutely worth trying. I&#x27;m now a complete believer.</li>
    <li> Love the Mia. Travels and works well too get the pores clean.  It is waterproof and the charge Lars fur a very long time.</li>
    <li> Having tried the first three levels of models, my recommendation is skip the Mia, it isn&#x27;t as powerful as the Mia 2, and I&#x27;m not sure the model above Mia 2 (Avia?) is worth the extra dough, except for the warranty.  ALSO, DON&#x27;T BUY EXCEPT FROM AUTHORIZED SELLERS!!  There are knockoffs, with cheap parts that fail and no warranty!  You will be sorry!!  SkinStore on Amazon is authorized, I emailed Clarisonic and got a list of &amp;#34;Approved US Online Dealers&amp;#34;.  Not sure this Amazon dealer named &amp;#34;Clarisonic&amp;#34; is authorized, fyi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I bought one of these this summer, at the recommendation of some Youtube video on skincare.  The reviewer raved about it.  I was skeptical.  While we were staying with the In-Laws over the summer, I ordered this one.  O.M.G., WOW!  Gets skin clean and soft!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much nicer my skin looked and felt the first time I used it.  And CLEAN like it&#x27;s never been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I a harsh critic of many products?  YES.  Did I really spend that kind of money for a face scrubber?  YES!  Was it worth it?  YES, YES IT IS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so good that my MIL and daughter stole it from me every morning (icky-factor, but hey, I couldn&#x27;t be a meanie) -- and they LOVED IT TOO!  I ended up promising this one to my MIL as a &amp;#34;Thank-You&amp;#34; gift.  When I told her I was going to give it to her (so she wouldn&#x27;t get one herself before I left, and wouldn&#x27;t have to wait 1-2 weeks for delivery), she bossed me and MADE SURE I WAS GIVING IT TO HER as I was packing my luggage and boxing it back up.  Maybe rude, yes -- but it&#x27;s that great!  And she did put up with us for an extended period, so well-earned, MIL.  Well-earned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered a replacement for myself, and one for my daughter.  Now I&#x27;m broke, but everyone is happy!!  I&#x27;ve also recommended it to all my (skeptical, haha!) friends -- their loss!</li>
    <li> My face feels so much cleaner after each use. I also use the refreshing gel with my mia. After a couple days of not using my mia my face feels dirty.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter after we got the larger version.  She loved the color and it makes getting ready for bed much easier when she has her own.  Little carrier makes it easy to pack up for overnights.</li>
    <li> So far I am very happy with my Clarisonic. I have been wanting one for quite awhile but when I went to purchase it I was hesitant because of the reviews about counterfeits on the market. I reviewed the sellers information and decided on OskinZone Well I made the right decision. I had no problem registering my machine. it is the real deal. I have Referred my sisters and several friends to this seller.</li>
    <li> OMGoodness! This is a great product! After using it for only two days my face has improved dramatically! Approaching 50(April 8) I have had different face concerns,  my pores have seemed to almost disappear on my nose and my face is so soft and smooth! I will never quit using this...I love it!</li>
    <li> I received a Clarisonic  Mia 2 for my birthday and liked it so much that I just purchased one for my daughter for her birthday. It does all it claims to do.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter&#x27;s birthday at her request.  She had done a lot of research into it before asking for it.  So far she is very happy with it.  She has had it a few weeks and says that her skin is definitely feeling smoother.</li>
    <li> Love the system.  I use my own face wash with it depending if my face is more dry, or has some zits.</li>
    <li> I love the exfoliation my skin gets when i use this; I also like that my face gets a good clean feeling after I use my Clarisionic. I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic for about a month now and I still love it. The only &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; I have with the product was that I was hoping it would rduce the size of my pores, which it hasn&#x27;t noticably done.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my clarisonic it worked wonders on my skin my skin is much tighter, lighter and golwy! It&#x27;s very easy to use and store!</li>
    <li> In love! Such an amazing cleansing tool. I dont know how I lived without this product before. I highly suggest.</li>
    <li> So easy to use, makes my skin feel so soft. I have sensitive skin and was a bit worried that this would be too harsh, but the sensitive brush head is perfect, and the free cleanser sample is great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the Clarisonic! I was worried about adding something else to my routine in the morning and night when I am pressed for time, but it only takes 1 minute! It is great! I love how it beeps to let you know to change &amp;#34;zones&amp;#34; on your face so you spend the right amout of time on each part of your face. My face does seem cleaner and my complexion brighter! It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
