      <li>So far the best matching one I can find for my platinum hair XD</li>
      <li>worked very well and was beautiful.</li>
      <li>For Halloween, super good.</li>
      <li>The clip is huge and the pieces of nylon hair was just clumping out!</li>

      <li>We had to cut it shorter, but I creatively turned the excess hair into a pet toy.</li>
      <li>I love these hair pieces.</li>
      <li>i love this :)</li>
      <li>Most people asked me if I dyed my hair though</li>
      <li>so it worked ok.</li>
      <li>i havent tried a curling iron on it yet, but im sure there would not be a problem.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m going to cut mine a bit because I like to wear mine on the side of my head so that you can see it in the front of my hair and unless you put it on the top of your head where you can see the clip you have to cut it just a bit</li>
      <li>These are tons of fun!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to trim the fibers and they don&#x27;t fray.</li>
      <li>Very pretty color, does come rlly long, but blends in perfect when fitted.</li>
      <li>i love this extension its amazing its easy to clip in and its really long and the price was amazing.</li>
      <li>but it looks fine</li>
      <li>Thank you quick shiop!</li>
      <li>The retailer shipped quickly and contents were packaged appropriately.</li>
      <li>Color was accurate though...</li>
      <li>They blended in with her hair really well, like they were her own hair dyed.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic extensions piece and the clip is nicely made and not irritating to hide or to wear at all</li>
      <li>This is a really nice extensions if you want that pop of color and its soft too!</li>
      <li>She was happy and felt like the prettiest pink mermaid ever.</li>
      <li>It says that its synthetic hair and you should not use heat on it, and i dont know if maybe i just got a good one or something, but it totally works with my straighteener.</li>
      <li>I liked that it was overly long because I was able to trim it to match my hair length.</li>
      <li>But luckily the 3 year old still liked it and wore it.</li>
      <li>As described and us super cutie</li>
      <li>just keep it straight because Im pretty sure its not that type of a styling hair extension .</li>
      <li>They do not curl very well and get snarly easily.</li>
      <li>Its perfect for her cosplay and only needs to be trimmed down.</li>
      <li>And it shipped fast!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price, so I&#x27;m not really unhappy.  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t tell if real or synthetic, but still wont try using any hot irons on them just in case.</li>
      <li>I had some problem about my first buy, but he were very patience and send me</li>
      <li>Its okay as long as you dont try to use curling iron on it.</li>
      <li>RUIN too easily , are fragile.</li>
      <li>so I guess I&#x27;m being particular!</li>
      <li>But it stays in and my friends think it is real.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I would recommend purchasing REAL hair extensions.</li>
      <li>I was attempting to get color in my hair that looked real without going with the hair dyeing alternative.</li>
      <li>I have long hair and this is just slightly longer then my own!</li>
      <li>You will need to iron it when you first get it because of the folds in it, but that was easy with a regular iron and left no damage.</li>
      <li>The hair is very shiny and Barbie-esque; obviously fake and plastic, which is great if that is the look you are going for.</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for and a little bit more.</li>
      <li>However if you have thick straight shiny hair, I think they might be able to work.</li>
      <li>I recommend getting an extension hair storer as they can tangle over time without proper maintenance or hang then straight</li>
      <li>I got this for a pink-loving 3 year old who was almost 4.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great in updos and half up have down hair styles as well and just down hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t curl it</li>
      <li>She was not happy with them as they got snarled up very easily and looked gross.</li>
      <li>The extension is very long so you actually stand a chance of not looking tacky with it being super short if you have long hair.</li>
      <li>The clip was solid and easy to hide even in my thin hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> looks great but falls out easily</li>
    <li> When i opened the package and took them out they were super soft and once they were the perfect length of my hair dis is awesome XD</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to try the product anyway. The hair is very shiny and Barbie-esque; obviously fake and plastic, which is great if that is the look you are going for. I was attempting to get color in my hair that looked real without going with the hair dyeing alternative.</li>
    <li> Good hair fibers, nice clip anchor. The retailer shipped quickly and contents were packaged appropriately. It&#x27;s easy to trim the fibers and they don&#x27;t fray.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color, does come rlly long, but blends in perfect when fitted. So far the best matching one I can find for my platinum hair XD</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price, so I&#x27;m not really unhappy.  Several of the fibers came out, but the majority are still intact.  it suits my purpose, which is to add just a dash of color.</li>
    <li> I got this for a pink-loving 3 year old who was almost 4. It was longer than we expected. We had to cut it shorter, but I creatively turned the excess hair into a pet toy. We had to brush the hair clip. After a while, the hair clip got tangled. But luckily the 3 year old still liked it and wore it.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and this is just slightly longer then my own! This is a really nice extensions if you want that pop of color and its soft too! It&#x27;s a fantastic extensions piece and the clip is nicely made and not irritating to hide or to wear at all but I&#x27;m going to cut mine a bit because I like to wear mine on the side of my head so that you can see it in the front of my hair and unless you put it on the top of your head where you can see the clip you have to cut it just a bit so you can hid it under the layers of hair. It&#x27;s also great in updos and half up have down hair styles as well and just down hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t curl it just keep it straight because Im pretty sure its not that type of a styling hair extension . Also it had fast shipping :D  its great for the price of this</li>
    <li> My friend is using this for her Lie Ren cosplay! It came earlier than expected and is really long! Its perfect for her cosplay and only needs to be trimmed down. Will buy again from this seller if I need more extensions!</li>

    <li> It clips on fairly well. It&#x27;s nylon so can&#x27;t be styled but it looks fine</li>
    <li> These are tons of fun!! Thank you quick shiop! Little hard to get into hair but figured it out! Thanks</li>
    <li> The extension is very long so you actually stand a chance of not looking tacky with it being super short if you have long hair. The color is very bright too. I love this!</li>
    <li> very bright and pretty hair extensions! i love the color and they are good quality. can&#x27;t tell if real or synthetic, but still wont try using any hot irons on them just in case.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to add a splash of color to my hair for over a year and when I was told I was not allowed to dye it I got this hair piece. I ADORE it! I just snap it, lift a piece of hair at my root and place it under there and snap it down. It weaves in-between my hair and looks so cute! I had to cut it but that was only because my hair is really short. But it stays in and my friends think it is real. The only trouble I have with it is choosing what color I want to get next!</li>
    <li> The clip was not what is shown in the image.  The length was 12&amp;#34; when the add and the package said 22&amp;#34;.  Color was accurate though...</li>
    <li> Perfect color perfect length! I love the clip it goes on and comes off without pulling my hair out! And it shipped fast!</li>
    <li> The hair extension were a bit of a disappointment - got it for my granddaughter.  She was not happy with them as they got snarled up very easily and looked gross.</li>
    <li> Arrived bent up. Should of expected that for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> I love these hair pieces. I wore them with a blonde wig when I was barbie for halloween and they were cute and sassy!</li>
    <li> Its the perfect color! It&#x27;s a hot/neon pink! It says that its synthetic hair and you should not use heat on it, and i dont know if maybe i just got a good one or something, but it totally works with my straighteener. and i use the highest heat setting on my hair! it came in the package folded, so there was creases in it. I straighteneed it and it did not melt, burn, smell, stick together, or ANYTHING :D i havent tried a curling iron on it yet, but im sure there would not be a problem. i love this :) i cant wait to order more colors!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughters and they love it they shear them and use them all the time.... thanks</li>
    <li> I recommend getting an extension hair storer as they can tangle over time without proper maintenance or hang then straight</li>
    <li> When the item showed up, the clip was different than what is shown in the picture and did not hold in well, but I only needed it for one evening so it worked ok.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought these because her office would not let her dip dye her hair &#x27;unnatural&#x27; colors.  They blended in with her hair really well, like they were her own hair dyed.  Great inexpensive way to give yourself an edge on the weekends without compromising your professionalism during the week.</li>
    <li> The clip in was great for my Wyldstyle costume!</li>
    <li> i love this extension its amazing its easy to clip in and its really long and the price was amazing.</li>
    <li> Clips are junk need to be stronger and a different color then white</li>
    <li> As described and us super cutie</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for and a little bit more. I was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t fall out but it did, not bad but don&#x27;t brush it.it came folded and it looks really fake I don&#x27;t neccesarily think that is bad. I wear them occasionally, if you want to wear them a lot find something else. For Halloween, super good.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality! The clip is huge and the pieces of nylon hair was just clumping out! I tried to contact the seller and got no response.</li>
    <li> This is really great seller! I had some problem about my first buy, but he were very patience and send me another one!&lt;br /&gt;The product is really good, but you have to follow the instructions!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter mermaid birthday party because I was not dying her hair like she thought was a good idea. Great alternative to that situation. worked very well and was beautiful. She was happy and felt like the prettiest pink mermaid ever. She still plays with it in dress up.</li>
    <li> Its okay as long as you dont try to use curling iron on it. It singed and I had to trim it and only use it around the face (shorter chunk of hair) now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wont be buying another one.&lt;br /&gt;They RUIN too easily , are fragile.</li>
    <li> as soon as I opened the envelope it came in, the strands of hair started falling out. the sewing is not even across the barrette and is falling lopsided.</li>
