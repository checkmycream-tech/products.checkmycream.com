      <li>I love chocolate.  </li>
      <li>As time goes on while using the product; i will see if it drys the skin out more or if it helps in keeping the skin moist.</li>
      <li>It has shea butter which really softens my skin and leaves me feeling and smelling GREAT.</li>
      <li>The moisturizing benefits are wonderful for my very dry skin.  </li>
      <li>The smell is great -natural product -reminds me of Hawaii.</li>
      <li>...need to order more because everyone I work with wants some!!!</li>
      <li>The product itself seems to be pretty good so far and smells good as well.</li>
      <li>It seems too strong and lingering.  </li>
      <li>The strong Brazil Nut aroma is just what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>I got this based on others reviews about how fantastic the smell was.  </li>
      <li>wonderful smell, very soft skin, washes off clean and leaves your skin soft after shower.</li>
      <li>The value is so worth it!</li>
      <li>It smells like sweet nutty candy.</li>

      <li>I got this quickly and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>After showering, the smell is not over-powering and I barely even notice it myself, but people are always telling that I smell nice.</li>
      <li>Seems like there is sooooooooo many soaps and body washes that dry the skin out even more than what it</li>
      <li>This is a large bottle and should last a good while.</li>
      <li>It is a little too sweet, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a scent on the skin - which is good.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and it is easy to use because the cap can be  opened and closed with one hand.</li>
      <li>The scent, however, was 4 stars when I first started getting it.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much Tree Hut!</li>
      <li>Leaves you feeling clean but soft.  </li>
      <li>I will try the other scents by this company because this product is long-lasting, cruelty free, smooth, creamy and on subscribe and save.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing less than amazing.  </li>
      <li>so I use less and it foams up nicely.</li>
      <li>I really like the Brazilian Nut Sugar Scrub and thought I&#x27;d try this one.</li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;m ready to switch.  </li>
      <li>This is probably good for your skin if you can get past the smell!</li>
      <li>I is better than other moisturizing bars I have tried.</li>
      <li>Very rich and extremely emollient body wash.</li>
      <li>However I decided to try it this time and really like how soft my skin is.</li>
      <li>Also great gift for someone ill</li>
      <li>Skin soft without chemicals-the only products safe enough to use ever for everyone.</li>
      <li>I have found my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy and leaves your skin feeling moisturized not dried out.  </li>
      <li>Sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>This does not smell like the old formula, sorta plasticy instead of coffee.</li>
      <li>I always used Dove&#x27;s sensitive body wash due to the nature of my skin, but this new product hits all of the marks.</li>

<li> but my only complaint is I would like a stronger aroma since I like it so much.</li>
<li> All liquid items should have the lids taped shut so they will not leak out all over other items that are shipped in the same box.</li>
<li> and I can only think of a few that I became addicted to so quickly.</li>
<li> Other than that, I am hooked onto this body wash</li>
<li> Like the Brazil Nut Cream, I am crazy about the very earthy scent reminiscent of chocolate.</li>
<li> Two bottles of body wash were half empty.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s hard to hard to find around here and at a decent price uses for bubble baths too</li>
<li> And this shower wash smells like decadent dark chocolate with maybe a hint of coffee bean.  </li>
<li> Not worth the $$</li>
<li> My only issue with the product is the consistency is a little thick.</li>
<li> There is a slight smell, but it&#x27;s gone almost immediately.</li>
<li> Bland and weak, very different from the scrub.  </li>
<li> and I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical using this new product.</li>
<li> A person would have to have no sense of smell to not enjoy it.</li>
<li> I have been a fan of tree huts products for the past 7 years</li>
<li> Because of this; i took two stars off because it was a waste of my money for their error in packaging!!</li>
<li> I got some of this shower wash that was being cleared out at Ross and was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it in any local stores.</li>
<li> poor packaging!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> One day I just decided to look online to see if I was wrong...</li>

    <li> Sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Leaves you feeling clean but soft.  Doesn&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;ring in the tub&amp;#34;.  Smells great;  Use it every day.  Also great gift for someone ill</li>
    <li> Very rich and extremely emollient body wash. Like the Brazil Nut Cream, I am crazy about the very earthy scent reminiscent of chocolate. I must confess I have to hide it in my room otherwise my roommate will use it up!</li>
    <li> This is a large bottle and should last a good while. I love the smell and it is easy to use because the cap can be  opened and closed with one hand. I got this quickly and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shower wash feels nice. It smells like sweet nutty candy. It is a little too sweet, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a scent on the skin - which is good.  I don&#x27;t want to smell like Brazilian Nut candy.</li>
    <li> I got this based on others reviews about how fantastic the smell was.  It&#x27;s not horrible.....but not one of my favorites either. Chocolaty.</li>
    <li> The product itself seems to be pretty good so far and smells good as well. As time goes on while using the product; i will see if it drys the skin out more or if it helps in keeping the skin moist. Seems like there is sooooooooo many soaps and body washes that dry the skin out even more than what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very poor packaging!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had body wash soap all over because they had lids that were not taped shut. Two bottles of body wash were half empty. All liquid items should have the lids taped shut so they will not leak out all over other items that are shipped in the same box. Plus they should be put into liquid proof bags, containers and/or separate boxes. Some of the bottles were in plastic bags but still leaked out and some in no bags in which leaked out. Because of this; i took two stars off because it was a waste of my money for their error in packaging!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product it&#x27;s hard to hard to find around here and at a decent price uses for bubble baths too two pack a bargain</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this for my best friend since last fall. However I decided to try it this time and really like how soft my skin is.</li>
    <li> I got this because i love the smell of the matching lotion an body butter but this doesnt smell anything like the butter or lotion. Not worth the $$</li>
    <li> The moisturizing benefits are wonderful for my very dry skin.  I is better than other moisturizing bars I have tried.</li>
    <li> I love love love this line! It smells yummy and feels great! The packaging and shipments was great! The value is so worth it! The bottle size is big!</li>
    <li> Tree Hut&#x27;s Brazilian Nut Shower Wash is so intoxicating, I wanted to stay in the bathtub all day! I use the Brazilian Nut Shea Body Butter also and wanted to try the shower wash to see if it was as nice, and now I cannot imagine not having it on hand indefinitely. It smells good enough to eat, I swear. I&#x27;ve tried a host of shower gels and body washes through the years and I can only think of a few that I became addicted to so quickly. Wonderful, wonderful product, and ecologically, Tree Hut is one of the better companies to deal with. (No animal testing, etc...) I am hoping to keep this body wash on hand ad infinitum now. Love it, love it, love it. A person would have to have no sense of smell to not enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this!  You have to like the chocolate nut smell though.  It feels awesome on the skin as it is silky.</li>
    <li> I love chocolate.  And this shower wash smells like decadent dark chocolate with maybe a hint of coffee bean.  I love, love love it.  I have found my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; shower gel.  It has shea butter which really softens my skin and leaves me feeling and smelling GREAT.</li>
    <li> I have been using the scrub and lotion for years.  The store I get it from doesn&#x27;t sell the shower wash so I just assumed they didn&#x27;t make it.  One day I just decided to look online to see if I was wrong...I WAS!  I love this product and so happy that I found it!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  The scent, however, was 4 stars when I first started getting it.  Now, I&#x27;m ready to switch.  It seems too strong and lingering.  I will try the other scents by this company because this product is long-lasting, cruelty free, smooth, creamy and on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> This does not smell like the old formula, sorta plasticy instead of coffee. But it still has no parabens etc...so that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I really like the Brazilian Nut Sugar Scrub and thought I&#x27;d try this one. Bland and weak, very different from the scrub.  There is a slight smell, but it&#x27;s gone almost immediately.</li>
    <li> wonderful smell, very soft skin, washes off clean and leaves your skin soft after shower. using with brazilian nut sugar scrub and it&#x27;s a perfect combo.</li>
    <li> I find this product to be a sensory pleasure in the shower.  The strong Brazil Nut aroma is just what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love the way it makes my skin feel...all my friends love it...need to order more because everyone I work with wants some!!!</li>
    <li> This is probably good for your skin if you can get past the smell! I didn&#x27;t like it! Wouldn&#x27;t buy again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell and feel of this product!  It&#x27;s nothing less than amazing.  After washing with this, my hands feel as if I put lotion on them.  Simply astonishing.  I hope Tree Hut decides to continue making this product and the Brazilian Nut scent.  Thank you so much Tree Hut!</li>
