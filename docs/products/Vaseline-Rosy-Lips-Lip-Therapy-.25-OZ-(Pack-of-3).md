      <li>Vaseline in its original formula is still my go-to</li>

<li> $10.00 down the drain :&#x27;(</li>

    <li> Works like Vaseline should but the pink is not really noticeable on lips. I will go back to the plain Vaseline.</li>
    <li> Love this chapstick especially this winter! I haven&#x27;t found that it adds much color but it smells nice and really works for chapped lips.</li>
    <li> All I ever wear now. No more chapped lips, ever!</li>
    <li> Sooooo cuuuteee and veeery miiinnniii supppper cute</li>
    <li> This product works miracles for dry/cracked lips! It is the only product that gives me smooth, healed, lips in a short period of time.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It has a nice smell and just a hint of pink.  I do not find it to be overly sticky. Very nice!</li>
    <li> I keep this product all over the house, ie by my computer and by the chair where I read.  It works great to keep lips moist with a slight tint.</li>
    <li> Great to use on chapped lips!! The consistency feels a little different from the regular Vaseline Lip Therapy.  I have very pale lips so this gives me just a hint of pink! If you have already a dark natural lip color, I could see this only showing up as clear. Makes your lips feel extremely smooth after using for just a day....good stuff!</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of this product.  I am an obsessive lip balm girl and so I thought I would give this a try.  It is way too sticky, can&#x27;t stand having it on my lips.  Bummer...$10.00 down the drain :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> Not a fan. I found this cutie patootie tub of Vaseline sweet, but irritating. I&#x27;ve used Vaseline as a lip gloss for decades.  Though this is adorable and it&#x27;s nice to have a tiny hint of color in a gloss thats thicker than you&#x27;d expect, for me, it just made my lips burn.  No worries.  Vaseline in its original formula is still my go-to</li>
    <li> Thick and sticky. I also didn&#x27;t enjoy sticking my finger into this sticky tub every time I wanted to gloss up my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the rosy sheen it gave my lips, though. Not enough, as I threw the product in the trash after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff! I have always had really dry lips no matter what I do, lip scrubs, medicated lip balm, etc. Decided to try this at night before I go to bed, woke up &amp; it was still on &amp; my lips were extremely soft! I only really use this at night but it really helps my lips stay moist all day &amp; I don&#x27;t have to use Chapstick constantly.</li>
    <li> Great ALL DAY moisture! Perfect for this Chicago wind chill.</li>
    <li> I loved it So small, very cute and it has a good smell..&lt;br /&gt;No damages at all with the pack :)</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  With my lip color it didn&#x27;t really show up as pink at all (I have pretty pale lips) so I was a little disappointed there.  It is nice and moisturizing and the container is adorable.  However, I have long nails and found it difficult to apply without getting it under my nails.  Had to bend my smallest finger and use the joint part to reach far into the pot and get some out.</li>
    <li> As vaseline it is good. I would have preferred it as a lipstick tube.</li>
    <li> Vaseline&#x27;s Rosy Lips Lip Therapy brings moisture to my lips and really smells like roses. It isn&#x27;t neccessarily like a lip gloss that has taste or anything, (probably because it&#x27;s vaseline for your lips), but it gets the job done.</li>
