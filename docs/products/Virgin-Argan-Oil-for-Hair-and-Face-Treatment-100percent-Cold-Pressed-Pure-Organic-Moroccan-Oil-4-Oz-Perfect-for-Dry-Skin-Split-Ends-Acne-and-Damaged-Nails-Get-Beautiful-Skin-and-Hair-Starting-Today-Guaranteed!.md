<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great oil for all your beauty needs.  I use it on my face, hair and dry skin.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I tried this oil because a neighbor suggested it.  It&#x27;s OK, as oils go.</li>
    <li> Good product, price and seller!</li>
    <li> I have had a terrible time in the winter with two spots:  my upper arms and my shins.  They get so dry they hurt.  I got my BebeLush Argan Oil and started using it a week and a half ago; and it&#x27;s making a huge difference in my skin.  No more cracking, no more dryness.  The oil feels luxurious, and is never greasy.  My skin has improved immensely!</li>
    <li> Well, this is 4fl oz bottle, but the oil is just  2/3 bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It is less than 3fl oz. I upload the pic. here &amp; you can see the lid is still sealed (plastic sealed).</li>
    <li> I am so thankful that I purchased this Argan Oil over a few others I was looking at. It is such high quality, and makes my hair and skin feel amazing, and NOT oily!  I would highly recommend to anyone looking into getting the top of the line, and healthiest for you Argan oil!</li>
    <li> I received a bottle for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that BebeLush Argan oil is 100% pure &amp; certified organic. You can also use the BebeLush 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil on your hair and on your skin. It comes with a dropper in the cap which makes it very easy to apply to your nails and cuticles. It has a shelf life of three years which means that this bottle will last a very long time. I also appreciate that the bottle is glass and not plastic. It does a wonderful job of keeping my cuticles soft.</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptical when I first ordered this Argan oil, but I thought I would give it a try because of the reviews and recommendations from other sources....and I can now say that I would definitely recommend this oil to everyone!!! Like the other reviews mentioned, it is VERY moisturizing yet does not have a greasy film that is left behind.  I use it on my legs, elbows, hair, cuticles and face.  I was scared to try it on my face because I have oily skin and the thought of putting an oil on my face was a bit terrifying. However, my face does not get greasy or break out when I use the Bebe Lush Argan oil. For my hair I apply it after my hair has been dried.  I put 2-3 drops in my hands, rub them together and then apply it to my hair.  My hair gets a bit frizzy after blow drying, and this argan oil eliminates my frizz and adds a nice shine to my hair. I will continue to ONLY use this specific product(Bebe Lush Aragan oil). I love it!</li>
    <li> This is good Argan Oil. It moisturizes my skin and I can tell the difference after applying it. In addition to moisturizing your skin, you can also use this for brittle nails or dry hair and it will help with those too. It&#x27;s imported from Morroco and is totally natural</li>
    <li> This seemed to be a new hype item on the market. I was like no way can a little bottle of oil do so much. Plus, it is pricey and that can be off-putting. I finally went for it though since I had a coupon, and am I ever glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately opened this up and put some of the oils on my hair. I try to only wash my hair every 2-3 days, so hate to use store bought spray leave in conditioners that weigh my hair down and leave them greasy looking. I am also working on replacing my home items with natural alternatives as we use things up. I was doubtful an oil could help with dry looking ends without make me look greasy. I was wrong. I put 3 drops in my hands and rubbed them together and ran the oil through the ends of my hair. It soaked in so fast leaving absolutely no reside or oily look to my hair. The ends were smooth and shiny looking immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only needing to use a few drops, this bottle will last a very long time, making the sticker shock of a non-sale price more bearable. The shelf life says 3 years, and mine was bottled 11/1/2013, so it has 2.5 years of life left. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll make it that long, but I like seeing items that won&#x27;t expire in 6 months or a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what all this oil will do. I mostly planned to use it on my hair as a leave in conditioner or as a heat protectant before I blow dry or flat iron my hair. I&#x27;m sure it has some other uses too, but I&#x27;ll need to look up and see what they are.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday on my face. Great stuff. Keeps my skin clearn. I even put it on my scalp at night too!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves Argan oil. She uses it for everything. Moisturizing skin, good for the hair, and many other things. She looks radiant after a week of using it. I think she looks younger every day and that she looks absolutely amazing (and I say that with a perfectly unbiased standpoint, i swear!).</li>
    <li> I received one 4 fl. oz. bottle of BebeLush Virgin Argan Oil to review!  Argan Oil is awesome for your skin, as well as for your hair.  It helps frizzy, tangles and unmanageable hair, making it look healthy, shiny and glowing!  The best thing about this oil is it’s a natural leave-in conditioner, so you get beautiful silky shiny hair.  Argan Oil is one of my favorite products, I love what it does for my skin and hair, my skin looks silky smooth and my hair looks shiny!  I would highly recommend the BebeLush Argan Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I love how it goes on dry and keeps my skin soft. I live in extreme heat and do not like heavy oils, this was nice and light.</li>
    <li> This particular 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil is great. I have been using it on my very dry feet and cuticles and it is amazing.  I garden a lot and each day after being in the dirt my feet are so dry and cracked, and my cuticles are a disaster, but after using Argan Oil they are refreshed again.  I&#x27;m also using the Argan Oil in my hair.  Summer is here and between swimming and fun in the sun my hair is already getting dry.  After I get out of the shower  I put the oil on my ends and it softens my hair and manages the dry frizz.  The oil is a bit greasy (even though description says it is dry) and I was worried about putting it on my hair, however, it doesn&#x27;t leave any trace of grease at all.  I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This bottle is huge, and considering you only need to use a few drops it should last quite a while. I like that this oil is organic and has a manufacturing date as well as a shelf life date, I know I&#x27;m getting a fresh product. The oil itself is light amber color with out any scent and absorbs quickly. It&#x27;s not greasy but you have to be careful to use only a few drops at a time. I have used it on my dry skin, nail beds and the ends of my hair and I&#x27;m very pleased how well it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this both as a leave-in treatment on my hair after using my regular shampoo and conditioner and as a general skin moisturizer. I use it on my face, where I have skin so dry that it flakes off if I don&#x27;t take special care of it, in conjunction with my favorite brand of \\&quot;anti wrinkle firming moisturizing cream.\\&quot; The cream I use is pretty thick, so I add a little bit of argan oil to a dollop of the moisturizer in the palm of my hand and mix it all together then apply it to my face - love the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it by itself on other dry areas (elbows, knees, feet, etc.) after showering, while my skin is still damp. It&#x27;s pretty amazing how quickly it absorbs into my skin and how much more \\&quot;youthful\\&quot; my skin looks and feels after applying it. I definitely notice a difference if I don&#x27;t use it for a few days, I start resembling a crocodile again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also appreciate that a little bit goes a long way - I have long hair (about shoulderblade length) and I don&#x27;t even need to use a full dropper for the leave-in treatment. I also really like the scent of the product (and that there isn&#x27;t any \\&quot;added\\&quot; fragrance, I just like the way natural argan oil smells).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for review purposes; all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I love the large bottle. It will last a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much to get the desired results. I don&#x27;t use argan oil on my face, but I do on the upper arms. Keeps my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> You are going to love this one as it has so many different functions that it can be used for that you might just be able to use this one product and get rid of all those others! It can do it all from helping your skin, to your nails to having shiny and beautiful hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using Argan Oil in my hair. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it frankly. That is how dry and frizzy my hair gets down here in this humid Georgia air and believe me, you don&#x27;t want to have wavy or curly hair here because it sure reeks havoc on your hair in the summer! I have gotten to where I wear it up or in a ponytail most of the summer because it just won&#x27;t cooperate, that&#x27;s how humid it is, unless I use the Argan Oil after I am done styling, I still will run some over my dry and styled hair to keep in patted down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really bad nails I guess due to the RA being so out of control. I have had professionals try to repair my nails and they just won&#x27;t cooperate. They are growing funny and won&#x27;t grow past the tips of my fingers, so they are very short but they are still very fragile and break at the slightest thing. So, I am trying to do what the directions say but some nights I am bad to forget especially if I have been sick and fell asleep without realizing it. Hopefully, I will get better at this as time goes on because I really need this benefit most of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would think that an oil would clog your skin up but I have been using it now for awhile and it really does seem to make things smoother and it absorbs really quick. Of course, like I have mentioned numerous times, I have very dry skin, so pretty much anything I put on my face gets absorbed pretty quick, but still, I have used some products in the past that made me look like I had put Crisco grease on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Oh, one last thing that you might like to know, this product has a shelf life of up to 3 years and mine said it was manufactured in November 2013 so this will be good until November 2016. That is quite a long time, but am glad to know because I have been wondering how long Argan Oil lasts and am finally glad someone answered that question! Each bottle will give you the date it was made so you will always know when your 3 years are up.ber 2016.

    <li> The Virgin Argan Oil is a great buy. Your skin and hair will thank you for investing into the Virgin Argan Oil product.  The Virgin Argan Oil for Hair &amp; Face Treatment from the BeBeLush Beauty Company worked miracles on my hair. My hair was extremely damaged from dying it and blowing drying it so much. My split ends were outrageous, their was no depth or volume in my hair when I styled it. Besides from all the split ends I had a great amount of burnt roots from the bleaching and dying my hair constantly. I was always experimenting with my hair, I guess that’s a fault I have always trying something new with my hair. However, the Virgin Argan Oil product worked really well for me. My hair looks extremely healthy. I have been using the product for about two week s now, and I have fewer split ends and damage roots. I noticed lately my hair has more depth and volume to it. The BeBeLush Beauty Company made the Argan Oil a multi purpose product.After only a few short weeks of using the product you will see for yourself how amazing it is. So why not get better skin and hair sooner than later?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion. To read the rest of my review, please visit the blog (Krazy Coupon Club)! Above is just a small portion of my thoughts.</li>
    <li> Not oily. Great for hair tonic.</li>
    <li> I purchased the argan oil and was anxious to see if it was beneficial to apply on my elbows and feet as they were very rough and dry. After about the third application I started to notice a difference in the softening of the elbows and on my ankle area of the feet.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this if you too have dry rough areas requiring special care.</li>
    <li> My experience with Argan Oil is the most amazing treatment to use for wet or dry hair! I will NEVER be without this wonderful product! My daughter being a hairdresser for 14 years has used numerous different leave in hair treatments on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutey NOTHING on todays market compares to the look, as well as the feel I get using this Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and PLEASE DON&#x27;T ever go away!!</li>
    <li> I dont know what the hype is. I used a little bit on my wet hair and it left it greasy. If you already have nice hair, this wont do anything. And mine says it has a 3 year shelf life.. and apparently it was made 1 year ago.. so its old too.</li>
    <li> I have used it on my face and in my hair, and I am loving it. I also apply it to my husbands elbows and they are so soft and smooth now. I&#x27;m always looking for different things to review and use on my face and this is one of the best things so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters it helps with dry skin, stretch marks, acne, skin blemishes, psoriasis, eczema, brittle nails and peeling cuticles.My hair looks healthy and smooth, there are days when its frizzy and since I been using this it looks good.</li>
    <li> Nice&lt;br /&gt;I like that the oil was so light. It absorbed into my skin very easily and doesn&#x27;t have a scent.  I clean my face with oils and it makes for a really luxurious oil cleansing session! My skin is usually very smooth in the first place but this oil made it feel even softer. Like silk!</li>
    <li> Soothing, moisturizing and a definite boost to my aging skin.  Had to give up this luxury item from other websites because of the price. My skin is so dry, especially in the winter.  This goes on as soon as I wash, especially my face and hands.  I love to use 100% argan oil, but have let it go because of previous price experiences.  So excited to find it here for a reasonable price!  Great product!  Can&#x27;t thank you enough!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin. My ankles scale and crack. My legs are dry and itchy. A friend insisted that I try Argan Oil. I bought some. The change was amazing. My ankles are soft and my legs have stopped itching. I put a few drops in my hands and put it into my clean hair. It glistens. In other words, I LOVE Argan Oil and I intend to use it forever.</li>
    <li> I would strongly recommend this Argan Oil. It was recommended to me by watching the Mama Natural channel and I am glad I purchased it. I would purchase this again, it is worth the money and is really nice for hair. I use it on my little one too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the right amount. If you use too little, doesn&#x27;t look like you used any. Use two drops too many and it looks like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in days.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works fairly fast.  I&#x27;ve used it less than one month and have seen changes in creases around mouth and cheeks.  I highly recommed this Argon Oil  Product by Poppy.  Joan Porter</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife as she wanted to try some argan oil products. I am impressed with the results she has gotten and she is now a big believer in argan oil.  She likes the way her face feels after using this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This high quality virgin argan oil does wonder for my wife&#x27;s skin and especially her hair. A little bit, goes a long way. She adds this to her hair post shower and it makes for very soft and shiny and flowing hair. I am impressed with the results she has gotten and she is now a big believer in argan oil. More importantly, the argan oil does not negatively impact her coloring and hair treatments, so she is also pleased about that.</li>
    <li> Some of the ways that I use Argan Oil:&lt;br /&gt;-Remove makeup on eyes and face&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturize the face and body&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturize nails and cuticles&lt;br /&gt;-Deep conditioner for hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil has become one of my favorite products. Winter left my hands red and dry. After the first application of Argan Oil, my hands felt silky and supple. Even coconut oil could not touch the dryness of my hands. I love that Argan Oil absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling. After a few days, the skin on my hands felt young and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have even been using Jojoba Oil to moisturize my face and my legs. The best application so far has been to moisturize my dry hands after gardening or washing dishes by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil does have a bit of a nutty smell to it. The smell reminds me of Neem Oil. The smell disappears within a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend Bebe Lush&#x27;s 100% organic Argan Oil. Argan Oil is the best natural beauty treatment for skin, hair and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the product to facilitate this review. No other compensation was received. All opinions are my own and are honest.</li>
    <li> Although I believe the product was of good quality and came VERY quickly, I&#x27;m sorry but, I don&#x27;t care for the smell of it at all. I wish I could give it a higher rating but, the smell just wasn&#x27;t great for me..Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I have used this as a hair treatment and as an ingredient in my lotions. It works great. My hair feels amazing. I will buy BeBe Lush Argan oil again.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BebeLush 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil by BebeLush comes in a 4 fl. oz. bottle where most other 100% Argan Oil’s come in 2oz – what great value! I’ve been using BebeLush on my hair, skin, and nails. My hair is softer, stronger, and frizz-free. You can use this as a styling agent. Put a few drops on your fingertips and apply the oil to the tips of your hair, or all over – it just depends on how frizzy your hair is. My hair tends to be flat near the roots, and frizzy at the tips. So I usually have to style my hair so it doesn’t look so flat near my foots and use this oil to smooth out the tips of my hair. My cuticles are softer, my nails are shinier, and my skin is softer and has a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> I use it on my hair every morning after a shower. Keeps it from getting static-y, removes frizziness, and makes it super soft all day. Great in the 4oz size too!</li>
