      <li>no my skin is so incredibly soft and smooth and looks amazing!!</li>
      <li>This by far was the most effective, and fascinating, face product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a skeptic, but if you are wondering if this is a good product, it absolutely is!</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this and really liked it, so I ended up purchasing the full size.  </li>
      <li>Love the way my skin is so smooth after using it,</li>
      <li>It was silky smooth, glowing, and more even.</li>

      <li>Really made my skin noticeably more luminous and fresh looking.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many facials, laser treatments etc &amp; this is definitely a keeper :)</li>
      <li>Weirdly gross and super effective.</li>
      <li>I recommend it for every skin type, even the most sensitive because I have the most sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Works great removing dead skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an outstanding product.  Very effective but gentle even for sensitive, rosacea skin like mine.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! after only 1 use, my skin looks so great....feels extremely clean and soft...even the pores look smaller...wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Yes please! Refill my bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this I wasn&#x27;t sure but I gave it another try and really took the time to massage it in and to luxuriate in the soft skin it left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is certainly pricey and not something I could afford to use often but it is worth the splurge!</li>
    <li> Love this peel! Not abrasive like scrubs which really helps my sensitive dry flaky skin. Will never go back to using scrubs. Also, this peel is fun to use and watching all the dead skin fall off :P Will buy once I run out!</li>
    <li> Tried a sample and was very pleased with the results, 1st time to use the mask.</li>
    <li> Love this! Really made my skin noticeably more luminous and fresh looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked at many reviews... Am I the ONLY one whose face turned red and has been super suuuuuper dry and scaley and flaking after using it!? It gave me the total opposite effect as anyone else.. And I do not have sensitive skin, yes I did follow directions on the bottle. No lotion is helping, I feel like I&#x27;ve had an actual chemical peel and it&#x27;s taking days to crust up and flake! Like I got a major sun burn. :( I can&#x27;t find anything on the Internet to help me figure out what&#x27;s going on! As far as I&#x27;ve read there was not suppose to be a long time side effect. Super disappointed...</li>
    <li> I am buying my second tube and I&#x27;m not even done with the first one yet. This stuff is fantastic. Nothing new to add here - just wanted to add my voice to the chorus of people singing its praises. I have problem skin - breakouts, blackheads, redness, sensitivity, oily - you name it. This has completely changed my skin. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Just so so...made me break out. Not sure what all the fuss is about.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders. Its a thin gel you put on your face then massage it in a circular motion, It actually pulls dead skin off your face to leave behind nothing but bright beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> I love how amazing my skin feels when I use the peel!!!!</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! It makes my skin soft, looks younger, and has reduced my breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is expensive but one of the best treatments that I have used on my face. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It has really helped clear my face up</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Great price and it actually works at leaving my skin smooth and polished.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly. My skin is so soft!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying this is my first Amazon review.. I love this so much that I just had to share!! I have dark spots on my face &amp; have had IPL light treatments in the past to take care of the problem.. Not anymore! Birchbox sent this to me &amp; after my first use, my husband was shocked! I&#x27;ve had many facials, laser treatments etc &amp; this is definitely a keeper :)</li>
    <li> Weirdly gross and super effective. I love it!</li>
    <li> Received a sample in Birchbox.  This is the only product I have ordered from a Birchbox.  It is so simple and quick to use.  It&#x27;s actually fun to see the dead skin and impurities slough off.  After the 3 minutes, your skin will be smoother with a rosy glow.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! this product is wonderful. I use it twice a week and my skin looks great. Buy the way I am 55.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best skin care products I have EVER used!!! I recieved a small sample of it with a purchase at Ulta and I fell in love the first time I used it! This is magic in a bottle! I love how soft my skin is after each use. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone know!</li>
    <li> This product did no more than any other face scrub. Look at the ingredients and you will see the benificial items needed for the skin is at the bottom of the list. I believe that what other reviewers think is dead skin cells is actually the gel scrub rolling off forming small lumps and balls. I don&#x27;t like giving negative reviews  but, my honest opinion may be worth something to another shopper. You will be buying an expensive face scrub.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  It goes on silky and then you start to feel it beading up as all the dead skin just balls up under your fingertips.  I let my two teenage girls use it too and it was fantastic.  It does not burn or itch or make my skin flaky or red.  It DOES leave my skin feeling so soft and shiny and reallllllly clean looking.  After my daughters used it, their faces were so clear and healthy looking.  Their acne was better for over two weeks too.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. Really brightens your skin</li>
    <li> I received this product in my November Birchbox and was curious because I had never used a chemical peel before.  I had heard that your skin can peel for days afterward.  I have very sensitive, combination skin, and have to be careful with what I use.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this peel last night.  Figured it was worth a try.  And I am so glad I tried it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very odd process, as while you are rubbing in the product, your dead skin immediately starts to slough off in little balls.  I thought I was using it incorrectly and that the product was just coming right off.  I was wrong.  Those little balls are your nasty, dead skin cells peeling right off.  Gross right??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Massaging it into my skin for 3 minutes was probably more than I needed because after a while I felt like I was rubbing only my skin and the product was gone.  2 minutes will probably be all that I need.&lt;br /&gt;My face felt so smooth and looked great after I rinsed it off.  The dry, peeling skin was gone and my skin looked brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A miracle product, and after only the one use, I have purchased it today.  Cannot wait to receive it!</li>
    <li> I got this in a trial size and I dont know if I used it wrong or what but it was clear at first then it was like I was rubbing glue on my face. I tried washing it off because it was really sticking and burning a bit. I do have sensitive skin or maybe it was a bad reaction. I could not wash this crap off my face. I washed as much as I could off and picked the rest off. My skin feels really dry and I still feel a burning. but my face is not red but it is a little irritated with bumps. I see this had really good reviews. I&#x27;m glad it worked for most people but I did not like it and I will not use it again.</li>
    <li> It was okay.....got pimples from them</li>
    <li> just used it! My skin is very smooth... one caution... if you have tiny facial &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; this stuff can &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to it.&lt;br /&gt;I had a few areas on my jawline where it stuck to tiny hairs... i scrubbed and scrubbed... didnt budge them.&lt;br /&gt;then used a scrub... stil didnt budge them. Tried a facial oil to slide them off... didnt work... Finally just had to&lt;br /&gt;pull the little bits off one by one. Left those areas of my face reddened and I do no generally have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I repeated the peel just on my nose and it worked perfectly.. my skin is so silky eveywhere now and I imagine by morning&lt;br /&gt;the redness will be gone. even though I had a mixed experience... I think i&#x27;d use it again!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Helped with ingrown hairs better than any product I have ever used, would recommend this to anybody especially guys. Great product</li>
    <li> As my skin ages I find that it lacks luster.  Moisturizers do not seem to work as they once did.  This product addresses both of these issues.  First, it seems to get rid of all that is causing the lack of luster, namely dead cells.  In doing so, I think it is preparing the skin to accept the moisturizers and actually makes them more effective.  I love it!  I thought I have sensitive skin, but I can use it a few times a week without any problems. Great for those dark spots also making them less apparent.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, and hadn&#x27;t found a product I could happily exfoliate with. I saw a video for use of this product (recommends in the shower, and with slightly different instructions from what is on the box). The reviews here had me hopeful, but concerned with the dreaded sticky balls that just won&#x27;t come off.  I used this in the shower, with a slightly damp face, and rubbed until the gel had disappeared (which did not take 2 minutes) and immediately rinsed. No sticky balls, just smooth skin that felt AMAZING.  I used a little product on my upper chest with the same results.</li>
    <li> I spend hundreds on products every year. Nothing has worked as well as this peel. It doesn&#x27;t take a day or two weeks to see results. You see it in 60 seconds. I recommend it for every skin type, even the most sensitive because I have the most sensitive skin. Don&#x27;t look for samples. JUST BUY IT.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing. I noticed a difference right away. i just can not justify the price.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel smooth and super clean.  After using, my pores are visibly cleaner and less clogged or &#x27;large&#x27;-looking.  Makes my skin tingle/burn just a little bit, so may not be not ideal for those with sensitive skin.  I love love love this, and wish I would have found this ages ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to see what else this company makes, because this product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this and really liked it, so I ended up purchasing the full size.  The peel does not burn at all.  Skin does come off, so it definitely works.  The only reason I gave it four stars is that I haven&#x27;t tried any other facial peels that I would be able to compare it with.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!  Helping with breakouts. Pores clear.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial beauty product I&#x27;ve ever bought!! It&#x27;s VERY worth the money and a little goes a long way!! I cant believe how smooth it makes my face and my skin actually does look brighter after using! I use it about once a week give or take a few days.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I never spend money on beauty products,  but I tried this and got hooked. Really does make a huge difference with regular use!</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic. I got it as a sample in my birchbox.&lt;br /&gt;The moment I put it on my skin I get white chunks coming off of my face.&lt;br /&gt;The product starts off as a clear gel and you are supposed to massage it into your skin for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;After, my skin felt great and looked amazing. The next day I got compliments saying how refreshed I looked.&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty expensive, and if I had the money to throw down on this product I would, but for now I will save my money.</li>
    <li> I got this in a birch box and fell in love. I had to quickly order larger size.  You instantly feel the dead layers melting away.  It makes your skin feel silky.  Worth every penny</li>
    <li> Great!! I had a mini chemical peel which left  me with a zillion little white flakes even several days later.  Tired of trying to pick them off tweezers and having makeup only make it look worse, I decided to try this stuff which I had received as a sample from Birchbox. One application got at least 80 percent of it all off.  I don&#x27;t know how it works but it does, and it will become a new weekly must do for me.</li>
    <li> Fast, super great and effective product...I am so thankful I found it.  My sunburned and dry skin looks fabulous thanks to Real Chemistry!!!!</li>
    <li> OK...this stuff is seriously freaky. It is like this thin, clear substance and you put it on your face, let it sit for 20 seconds and then massage it into the skin for 1-2 minutes. I&#x27;ll be darned but chunks of skin just fell off my face!! At first I thought maybe it is like those stupid ear candles that leave wax residue and you think it came out of your ear...no my skin is so incredibly soft and smooth and looks amazing!! I swear even my freckles I have had all my life seem lighter and I&#x27;ve only used this product twice!!! You use such a tiny amount...this product is, hands down, worth the price! I have never seen anything like it. I might start getting this for every close friend&#x27;s birthday. I believe everyone needs to try this insane stuff!!</li>
    <li> Out of the many peels I have tried over the years this one is quick and easy and leaves my skin so soft and ready for the next step in my daily routine! Leaves my skin glowing</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!!! It feels really weird at first because the gel seems to mix with the dead skin, but this product has done wonders for my complexion! Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This does make my skin very smooth. Just not sure it does anything beyond that.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works great removing dead skin. You didn&#x27;t even know you had.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product in my December birchbox and got three uses out of it. By the third use, I knew I would buy this product. After the first use, my skin was glowing but I wasnalso using a new face lotion and I wasn&#x27;t sure which product was responsible. After the second use I was shocked that a product could be so amazing. My skin was luminous for days after use. I used it that third time just to ensure to myself that I wasn&#x27;t imagining it. I am buying it now! This product is excellent! It sloughs away dead skin cells and leaves your skin looking fresh and beautiful!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. I have always been scared to death to use any chemical peel. My skin is so sensitive.  I got this in my June birchbox. I was goino to give it to a friend but she talked me into just trying it. So I did. Guess what? No irritation, no burning ....nothing painful at all.  Got 3 uses out of the tiny .17 oz bottle. And my skin......FABULOUS.  SO SOFT. Its brighter, softer and actually have gotten compliments how good I look without makeup. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Never write a review but this is the Greatest ever.  I have good skin, but fair and can be sensitive at times.  I&#x27;ve never used a scrub, mask or anything but received this in Birchbox so decided i would try it.  Could always wash it off if it burned.  To my utter surprise it was Great.  I have never felt my skin so very smooth.  Doesn&#x27;t take long and i use it once a week and have ordered the large size which arrived promptly.  Telling others.  Try it, you will Not be disappointed! I look forward to using it each time.  WOW</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful.  Much more effective and gentle than physical facial scrubs. You use so little that, compared to a lot of another exfolients on the market, it lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff you see coming off is, in fact, skin cells.  I know this because I used some on a pretty nasty callous that I have on my foot just to see if it would be effective there.  It was.  Tons of stuff came off and left the callous with a smooth surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait until the body version comes out.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in a birch box and have used it twice and when I have money to buy it I will. Because it works fast and feels awesome . It makes my face look like it&#x27;s been to a spa when all I had to do was apply , massage and rinse . Love this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so bizarre.  I got it as a sample, which is great, because I never would have cold-purchased something like this.  I put it on my face, and almost immediately got this odd, chunky, white stuff all over.  Strange- but it works!!  My skin is so smooth and soft, and the dry skin I have been unable to get rid of by exfoliating (among other things) was instantly gone.  A bit expensive, but I will definitely be buying this.  Great marketing move by sending out samples.  Well done.</li>
    <li> No a good product. Made my face break out terribly and biggest wast of money I&#x27;ve ever spent! Would not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Please listen women! All women (well and men too), no matter what kind of skin you have, purchase this immediately! It single handedly changed my skin. I had very fair, oily, comodone/acne proned, sensitive skin until I received this as a sample in my birchbox. After one use I was floored by my skin. It was silky smooth, glowing, and more even. All my acne scars disappeared or faded. My husband even asked what did I do. After the second use, everything was gone! Not one comodone, pimple, dark circle, or discolored area left. My skin was less oily, my foundation glided on and stayed on, and everyone wanted to know what I had done! Seriously, this is the only treatment you&#x27;ll ever need. As for the price, you&#x27;ll only have to buy it 2-3 times a year. Which when you add up all the stuff you won&#x27;t be buying to fix the problems this corrects, you&#x27;ll actually save some money!!!!!! Trust me!!! It&#x27;s UH-maaazing!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have extremely sensitive, combination pale skin.  Even facial cleansers make my skin burn.  This product is amazing.  It really only takes 3 minutes.  It&#x27;s kinda creepy because you actually feel the skin sloughing off and balling up under your fingers.  The only (minor) complaint I have is if you let this dry on your face for longer than a few minutes without massaging it like the instructions say, it dries on your skin and is kinda difficult to get off.  I had a small patch dry under my jawline and I had to seriously scrub at it and pick at it to get it off.  But if you follow the instructions, this is a miracle product.  Your skin will feel like silk.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> As the other 5 star reviews state, this stuff is amazing.  A bit pricey, but totally worth it with how you skin looks and feels afterwards.  It&#x27;s also instantly gratifying to see the dead skin slough off as you&#x27;re rubbing! :)</li>
    <li> Amazing! This is one of, if not the best, skin care product that I have ever used.  I received a sample of it in a recent Birchbox and I was hooked! I&#x27;m a skeptic, but if you are wondering if this is a good product, it absolutely is! Order it now!</li>
    <li> After receiving this product as a sample, I immediately tried it. I love trying face peels and masks as I have problem skin. So I&#x27;m always looking for a quick fix. This by far was the most effective, and fascinating, face product I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin had lots of rosacea, acne scars, and acne. So I try to use very gentle products. This peel showed instant results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend leaving your face slightly wet after cleansing. Not dropping wet, but just a little moisture. Then when you put it on, just lightly spread it. After 15 seconds or so, that&#x27;s when you start rubbing it. Your dead skin actually peels off! The first time I used it there was SO much dead skin. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. After the sample ran out I instantly purchased the full size product. I also recommend wiping it off with warm water and a soft cloth to get the dead skin off. I use this product once a week because I don&#x27;t want to overwork my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Wow. What a great product!!!</li>
    <li> I used this a good three times and i can clearly say without a doubt this is the best exfoliator i&#x27;ve used. In a matter of seconds my dead skin on my face was in little balls and my skin was more soft and luminous</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin is so smooth after using it,</li>
    <li> I love this product! I got a sample of this several months ago through Birchbox, and was excited to finally see it available through Amazon. It is a fabulous chemical peel. There is no burning on the skin, it is quick (less than 3 minutes really), and leaves the skin feeling smooth. Watching and feeling the dead skin ball up as you rub is great because you can tell it is working immediately. I have very dry and very sensitive skin so I do not use physical exfoliating products on my skin to reduce damage. I use this product once a week (sometimes more often as a spot treatment). It is absolutely worth the price!</li>
