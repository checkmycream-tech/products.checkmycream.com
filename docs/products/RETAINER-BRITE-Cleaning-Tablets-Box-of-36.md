      <li>Effective.  </li>

      <li>I leave my trays soaking in warm water for about 10 minutes</li>
      <li>Rose Greco</li>
      <li>good product works ok.</li>
      <li>The solution is very strong and you must rinse it well to remove all of the solution or your mouth will become irritated by the residue.</li>
      <li>Of all the cleaners I tried (vinegar, H202, etc..), this one was by far the best.  </li>
      <li>I just want to say this retainer brite is the best product by far.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my retsainer sparking clean and it smells good too.  </li>
      <li>I feel that it is a notch better than just brushing.</li>
      <li>Retainer Brite does a LOT better job on my Invisaligns than the Efferdent....</li>
      <li>I brush my retainers with my toothbrush and it works much better.</li>
      <li>Most of the time I would soak my aligners while I am eating and then scrub with a toothbrush when I am done.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a mouth guard for more years than I care to count.</li>
      <li>Retainer Brite is my favorite product for safely cleaning retainers.</li>
      <li>I also tried the SonicBright product and find that this one works about 100 times better.</li>
      <li>Much better for retainers than denture cleanser.</li>
      <li>Product is just slightly better than soaking liners in liquid Dawn dish soap.  </li>
      <li>I would not be able to get through my treatment without Retainer Brite.</li>
      <li>or maybe I am expecting more that I should</li>
      <li>I admit to still placing my retainers in mouthwash for most of the work week.</li>
      <li>Which created a lovely brownish gray film in the crevices.</li>
      <li>They worked OK, but made the retainers cloudy.  </li>
      <li>I am sure they would work even better in an ultrasonic machine.  </li>
      <li>Love the product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Makes me feel, confident &amp; relaxed to know</li>
      <li>I see more results using.</li>

      <li>Noticed my teeth becoming discolored and figured out</li>
      <li>I love the clean feel after using the Retainer Brite tablets.</li>
      <li>My retainer stays clean for about 3 1/2 weeks and it smells much better than soap, or your breath.</li>
      <li>While these tablets couldn&#x27;t completely dispel that many years of filth, they did a darn good job of returning them to their &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>But, this works great on general maintenance of your retainer.</li>
      <li>I just soak my retainers in water along with one tablet for about 20 minutes and it cleans up perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>But even using them a couple times a week makes a huge difference in their look and taste.</li>
      <li>My dentist gave me a few samples to try and I was impressed with its ease of use, safety, and efficiency.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and it helps me so much with my retainer. :)</li>

      <li>My invisalign do not get completely clean with this product.  </li>
      <li>I have used this cleaner for awhile and am finding they clean just as well while not making my invisiligns cloudy.  </li>
      <li>A good product to clean my night guard daily.</li>
      <li>Now I use one tablet a day to keep it stain free and fresh.</li>
      <li>Just soak for 15 minutes, the water turns blue and the tab fizzes, then voila - rinse it off and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>

      <li>Very easy to use, just pop in a denture container, fill with warm water and simply drop in 1 tablet of blue fizzing retainer brite.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t work like right away, but i&#x27;ve noticed the improvement in my retainers after doing a couple.  </li>
      <li>Rinse off thoroughly with clean water and its ready for use again.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It cleans my retainer but I don&#x27;t think my retainer is greatly cleansed by it. It&#x27;s a sufficient job however.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but before I would place an order from amazon I would do my homework.The price was horrible .I have also had several problems in the past year receiving damaged products from amazon.I will no longer use your service</li>
    <li> I have been using store-bought cleaners for 2 years with my invisilign.  They worked OK, but made the retainers cloudy.  I have used this cleaner for awhile and am finding they clean just as well while not making my invisiligns cloudy.  The \\&quot;official\\&quot; cleaners also work well, but are quite expensive.  I plan on purchasing this product from now on.</li>
    <li> This product works well, but I object to paying $7.49 shipping for a product that costs $8.99 and weighs a few ounces. Plus the packing slip said \\&quot;FedEx\\&quot; -- I did not need or request express shipment and it was actually shipped via the USPS.</li>
    <li> Retainer Brite is a MUST for anyone with invisalign!!! I would not be able to get through my treatment without Retainer Brite. I use one tablet every night and it keeps every aligner looking like new every day! If you have invisalign, I would highly recommend this product. I picked up a year supply for $40.00. I have recommended this to many friends who have had the same results.</li>
    <li> I just want to say this retainer brite is the best product by far.  It keeps my retsainer sparking clean and it smells good too.  I defintely would recommend this to people that wear a retainer for night.  The other products that I used in the past just didn&#x27;t cut it. I would purchase this product again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing invisible retainers since a couple of months now and my orthodontist recommended me Retainer Brite for cleaning up the retainers regularly. I just soak my retainers in water along with one tablet for about 20 minutes and it cleans up perfectly fine. It does what it is expected to. 101% recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this for my invisalign and it works great.  I leave my trays soaking in warm water for about 10 minutes and they come out clean!</li>
    <li> These do an excellent job of cleaning Invisiline retainers. And they are cheaper than the cleaning powder sold by Invisiline. It&#x27;s much easier than using a toothbrush.  Shipping costs were a bit high though.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with how this stuff makes Invisaligns look... Clean! Almost better, no more fussy kid complaining about how hard it is to brush his Invisaligns! Must not leave any after-taste or I would have heard about it. ; )&lt;br /&gt;The tablets (still in their individual sealed packets) have a really strong chemical odor and totally stunk up the bathroom closet where they are stored. I fixed that by putting them in a quart zip-lock freezer bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Not all of them have the strong chemical odor, which is great!</li>
    <li> I bought these to use for my daughter&#x27;s retainer when we ran out of what the orthdontist gave us. They seem to work good. I feel that it is a notch better than just brushing. I will buy these again!</li>
    <li> Easy to use product that will help keep your retainer very clean. You also do need to maybe brush your retainer with a toothbrush and toothpaste to get it a bit cleaner, but the cleaning tablets do wonders!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I use it for my night guard and it keeps it shiny clean.</li>
    <li> The retainer brite cleaning tablets do work for my invisalign trays but I had to soak them in water much longer than 15 minutes to remove and thoroughly clean my invisalign trays. This will not work since I have to keep them in 22  hours or longer. Most of the time I would soak my aligners while I am eating and then scrub with a toothbrush when I am done. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the soaking in the water or the tablets that assisted in cleaning them thoroughly.</li>
    <li> My invisalign are unstained and appear clean after using this product. The product is easy to use- just add tablet to warm water and soak your device until water goes from blue to colorless.  I recommend purchasing a denture cleaning cup to make use of this product easier. Though the product works well, the price of the product does add up (especially if you want to use this several times a day)...I only use this once a day and do the old toothpaste and brush the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product under different circumstances and this product does not work for me.  I want clean aligners and I must be doing something wrong.  Any suggestions would be helpful at this time.</li>
    <li> This works great for basic stains and overall maintenance for retainers. I unfortunately had a very difficult stain to remove from my Invisalign that would not come out no matter what I tried. But, this works great on general maintenance of your retainer.</li>
    <li> This works really well on orthodontic retainers. The solution is very strong and you must rinse it well to remove all of the solution or your mouth will become irritated by the residue. My daughter uses it every other day, hand cleaning on the off days with baking soda. Her retainer looks brand new after 6 months. Buy the largest size you can afford to save money.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Effective.  Quick.  Works better than other tablets I&#x27;ve tried.  Just soak for 15 minutes, the water turns blue and the tab fizzes, then voila - rinse it off and you&#x27;re good to go.  Leaves bite guard clean and without any sort of weird taste or smell.  Thank goodness I no longer have to use a toothbrush to clean the bite guard.</li>
    <li> This product works well, and I received the product quickly.  Only problem was shipping was as much as the product was.  Pretty pricey to buy, too bad shipping is so much!</li>
    <li> Not much difference noted in cleaning or freshening my bite guard. I see more results using. My electric toothbrush and some mouthwash or toothpaste. Unfortunately the plaque deposits have not changed.</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing time-saver! I cannot believe I didn&#x27;t get this sooner. I feel so silly brushing my retainers every night like a maniac, or washing with mouthwash. This is absolutely amazing. Just toss it in a glass of water with the retainers and let it sit there for about 15 minutes, until the water turns clear. That simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use retainer brite to clean my Invisalign trays every morning. Very easy to use, just pop in a denture container, fill with warm water and simply drop in 1 tablet of blue fizzing retainer brite. The blue water turns back to clear when the cleaning is complete which is about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I discovered that I could purchase this product online instead of carefully planning where to buy product other than at the dentist. What a joy to order online &amp; receive a stockpile of the magic tablets. Makes me feel, confident &amp; relaxed to know I have a good amount.</li>
    <li> These destroyed my retainers. Yes, I followed the instructions. I will take this up directly with the manufacturers but it is just a warning to anyone thinking of buying.&lt;br /&gt;Zero stars.</li>
    <li> These tablets work great on their own.  I am sure they would work even better in an ultrasonic machine.  I will be re-ordering them when I run out.</li>
    <li> In 1990 when I got retainers, my Wash., DC orthodontist gave me a starter kit of Retainer Brite.  I have since moved to CA and now am in TX.  I recommended Retainer Brite to both CA orthodontists and my present orthodontist in TX.  After all three orthodontists tried Retainer Brite, they have since been recommending it (and giving starter kits) to their patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By using Retainer Brite, your retainer&#x27;s wires won&#x27;t break compared to manual brushing with a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My retainers soak during the day in the Retainer Brite case because I only wear my retainers at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retainer Brite has a nice minty essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retainer Brite is the best retainer cleaner ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  been using this product for years. There&#x27;s no smell, no taste and cleans well. I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> I had been leaving my retainers to soak in mouth wash the past, oh, 5 years or so. Which created a lovely brownish gray film in the crevices. While these tablets couldn&#x27;t completely dispel that many years of filth, they did a darn good job of returning them to their &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; state. Given the cost and the time (which is pretty negligible all things considered, but still something as a working mom) I admit to still placing my retainers in mouthwash for most of the work week. But even using them a couple times a week makes a huge difference in their look and taste. So overall, I highly recommend these tablets.</li>
    <li> cleans my retainers which are over 2 years old, that they are clear every time. All I do is drop the round tablet in a small container like a coffee cup and put the retainers in. Lots of fizz. I leave in there for about a hr or 2.</li>
    <li> My invisalign do not get completely clean with this product.  They get soaked enough time.  I even brush them with the products and still they seem they have a film.</li>
    <li> Since the denture cleaner tablets that I had previously used successfullly for Invisalign retainers would corrode the metal in hard plastic and metal retainers, I ordered Retainer Brite tablets on the recommendation of orthodontist&#x27;s office. I used them twice with no apparent diminution in the deposits that had formed on my retainers. So on my next routine dental visit, the staff put them into their ultrasonic cleaner, and they came out clean. So these are worthless for me.</li>
    <li> Use this product always and it works great. Will definitely purchase again. I like the ease of ordering this product online.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dentist to clean my oral appliance for sleep apnea. Just once a month for my appliance. It&#x27;s a fizzy fix that really makes it feel clean. I would not hesitate to use it for toothbrushes also. An easy way to deep clean around the bristles.</li>
    <li> The tablets were useful for eliminating odor and tartar buildup, however I found it usually takes two tablets and twice the recommended time to fully clean my retainer.</li>
    <li> Retainer Brite is my favorite product for safely cleaning retainers. My son uses it daily.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed by this product. I had been using Polident(and the generic works just as well) with decent results. Still had to brush a little after the soak. So I thought I would try this. It&#x27;s a lot more expensive, plus the shipping, but I thought if it worked it would be worth it....it&#x27;s no better than the generic Polident!!(actually the generic Polident may be a little better!)SAVE your MONEY!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE 10/12/10:&lt;br /&gt;I have actually been using Retainer Brite for a while now(just ran out), and had to use the Efferdent...well...I am ashamed to say that I was wrong. Retainer Brite does a LOT better job on my Invisaligns than the Efferdent....I just reordered 2 boxes.</li>
    <li> Instructions are clear and product behaves as expected.  I am planning to buy more in the future if I need it.</li>
    <li> Product is just slightly better than soaking liners in liquid Dawn dish soap.  Plaque build up on a liner used for several months is difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work like right away, but i&#x27;ve noticed the improvement in my retainers after doing a couple.  I dont do them everyday like the box suggests, because then they run out too fast (and a tad expensive), but they work!  Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is waaaay better than the other Invisalign stuff.  My transparent plastic stuff (even when some gunk is built up) gets all cleaned out.  I leave them in there just a little bit after the blue water becomes clear.    I tried the Invisalign cleaners and quite hesitatingly ordered this one just cause the other stuff is pricey.  Wow! i am so happy. cause this stuff is so much cheaper. gonna order me a whole lot more.  [...]</li>
    <li> I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to brush my Invisalign if I used this product. I use it every day and it does help clean the retainers, but I still have to brush them. It also takes about 20 minutes to turn from blue to clear.</li>
    <li> Works good. Will be buying more later once this supply is out. Invisalign feels much cleaner after using this product.</li>
    <li> You need to change the picture... I thought I was getting two boxes of 36...the pic is very misleading to people.</li>
    <li> Cleans and freshens my retainers every time. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 years now and it never disappoints.</li>
    <li> Works great in cleaning dental retainers and night guards!  Worked in the dental field and this is where I first found this great product originally.</li>
    <li> These tablets work GREAT!! They clean my retainer and it does not have a stinky smell. I recommend these tablets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a mouth guard for more years than I care to count. Didn&#x27;t even know they had to be \\&quot;cleaned\\&quot;  other than using a toothbrush. Noticed my teeth becoming discolored and figured out it was from mouth guard. Now I use one tablet a day to keep it stain free and fresh. Keep your mouth guard away from your dog - notorious for eating them because of the tartar buildup on the guard.</li>
    <li> I have invisalign and this product works the best for keeping them clean. I use it in the evenings after dinner and it keeps my trays fresh and clean. I also tried the SonicBright product and find that this one works about 100 times better.</li>
    <li> This could last you an entire 3 years!!! My orthodontist said it&#x27;s alright for me to use this once a month, so yes, this could last you about 3 years. Its works very well for me. Whenever it&#x27;s really nasty or gross, its gets everything off. My retainer stays clean for about 3 1/2 weeks and it smells much better than soap, or your breath. You don&#x27;t need to get a new pack every month, you can just wash it with soap and water every day, and on the first day of the month, use the Retainer Brite. I love this product and it helps me so much with my retainer. :)</li>
    <li> Good value for the money.  I can&#x27;t even find retainer brite where I live and it works very well.  Much better for retainers than denture cleanser.</li>
    <li> Not good cleaning dentures.  I guess I did not read this properly and got them to clean dentures.  It does not work good for that.</li>
    <li> good product works ok. It works like advertised does not clean as good as I thought it should or maybe I am expecting more that I should</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past 2 years .It gives your retainer a fresh clean feeling. Definelty remommend this product! Rose Greco</li>
    <li> Love the product.&lt;br /&gt;It does clear up stains very well. I&#x27;m using it for Invisalign and it works great with them.</li>
    <li> A good product to clean my night guard daily. It&#x27;s fresh and feels clean after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
    <li> Keeps my retainers like new. I was ready to throw my retainers away and order a new pair, then I decided to give this product a try and it worked perfectly from the first use. I only use it twice a week and my retainers look always clear, clean, and fresh.</li>
    <li> Hey! Guess what?! They cleaned my retainer like it&#x27;s supposed to and leaves it minty fresh. I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have been happy with it.</li>
    <li> Of all the cleaners I tried (vinegar, H202, etc..), this one was by far the best.  And, I only needed 1/2 a tablet every other day to keep my trays clean and sparkly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not completely satisfied with this product. I use it for invisalign trays, and I always have to SCRUB the trays afterward with a toothbrush. It never really cleans them completely. I don&#x27;t know if that invisalign&#x27;s fault, or if retainer brite is not very good. But I&#x27;m going to give something else a try just to see.</li>
    <li> Did not receive and did not get feedback after several attempts. Tried posting comment about the bundle but it would not go through because the feedback was not positive. I recommend ordering one item and do not bundle the items they recommend because they do not bundle the items you request.</li>
    <li> Although it may not get rid of all the stains in your retainer the first time you use it, using it on the weekly basis will produce results. I also noticed the \\&quot;plasticy\\&quot; smell my retainers developed is gone. It shipped quickly and it comes with enough tablets to last over half a year.</li>
    <li> I chose the four star rating as this product is very beneficial to keeping retainers very clean and sanitary at each use.</li>
    <li> While I mostly clean my Invisalign trays with soap and water, I thought they needed a more thorough cleaning every few days. Retainer Brite seems to do the trick. I love the clean feel after using the Retainer Brite tablets. I just throw some lukewarm water and a tablet in a cup and let trays soak for 20 minutes or so. Great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff fizzes the retainer clean and leaves it fresh smelling and tasting; my son was balking at wearing his retainer due to its bad smell/taste.</li>
    <li> I wear a night guard at when I sleep to protect my teeth and jaw from my habit of grinding. The TMJ specialist that I received my night guard from told me to only wash it gently with water and a toothbrush. Well after a few years you can only imagine how disgusting the night guard was getting. I saw a huge difference in the first soak with retainer brite. After several soaks it looks almost brand new. I would recommend this for anyone with any sort of dental accessory.</li>
    <li> I use Retainer Brite for my night guard.  My dentist gave me a few samples to try and I was impressed with its ease of use, safety, and efficiency.  I put the purple tablet in a small conainter with just enough water to cover my night guard, drop one purple pill in there, give it a swirl, and forget about it for at least 15 minutes.  I know when its all done when the purple bubbly water has turned all clear.  Expect there to be some visible small mineral residue settled in the clear water.  Rinse off thoroughly with clean water and its ready for use again.  Don&#x27;t make the mistake of not using this product...brushing with toothpaste will only introduce scratches to your dental appliance where bacteria can hide and develop (&#x3D; bad breath).  Use Retainer Brite for a reliable cleaning job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to clean my retainer. My retainer is a clear plastic and it had become very white and even dark yellow/brown in some creases. I tried the clear mouthwashes and hydrogen peroxide to kill bacteria and several denture cleaners to no avail. I brushed it with a denture brush and brushed so hard I thought I would break it. I scraped it with toothpics etc. I didn&#x27;t want to put the thing in my mouth it looked so bad. So, I asked my orthodontist what I could use and he recommended Retainer Brite. It cleaned my retainer so well on the very first soak that I was convinced. I have tried nothing else and have been using Retainer Brite for about 2 years now and I do not have to brush my retainer at all now. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I use these with the Cordless Sonic Cleaner, which I also bought through Amazon, to clean my clear, plastic retainer.  I haven&#x27;t tried anything else other than the toothbrush and toothpaste, but when I use these tablets, I&#x27;m very pleased with the cleaning.  I also read or saw somewhere on TV that these kinds of tablets can be used to clean the toilet bowl (and I&#x27;m not surprised....I just need to remember to try them).</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Did not clean my retainers. Actually left residue on them and made them dirtier. Also I might have had an allergic reaction to it. After I used it a few times I belched constantly for several weeks. It was horrible and I never used it again. I brush my retainers with my toothbrush and it works much better.</li>
    <li> Great product that does the job.  Leaves appliances odor free and clean.  I highly recommend it to anyone with retainers.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of these from my doctor and they do the trick. They get out all the built up junk and they smell nice after cleaning.</li>
