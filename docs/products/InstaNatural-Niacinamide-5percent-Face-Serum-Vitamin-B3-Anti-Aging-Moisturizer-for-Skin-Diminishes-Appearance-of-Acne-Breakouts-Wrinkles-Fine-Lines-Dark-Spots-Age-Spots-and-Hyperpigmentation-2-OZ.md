<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a real paying customer who is very happy with my purchases from InstaNatural.  Packaging is great and comes nicely sealed.  I ordered this product along with the Facial Oil Cleanser, the Moroccan Rose Water and the Night Cream.  I am using Rose Hip Oil as a daily moisturizer not this brand as I already have.  Not sure on the facial oil yet.  All the products except for Rose Water can be dispensed without contaminating the product.  Suggest a sprayer or top dispenser for the Rose Water too.  So far my skin is happy with no break outs or itchiness which I get right away if it&#x27;s going to happen.  I live in the desert of Arizona so the climate is very dry which translates into dry skin.  Products absorb well with no oily feel left over.  I do agree with another reviewer that real results take time.  It&#x27;s only been 4 days so giving 60 days to see a difference in wrinkles, firmness and discoloration fading.  Plan on trying a few other products.  Love the lifetime guarantee and the price point.  Customer service is very responsive.</li>
    <li> I recently gave birth, which left me with some pregnancy mask in my cheekbones. This serum has helped reduce the look of the pigmentation but also has helped soften my skin and reduce the my pores...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with this product. It made my skin feel a little greasy after.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve basically only been using it a short time I am only giving it 4 stars. I like the way it goes on how well it absorbs and how light it feels on the skin. I have seen some minor improvement in fine wrinkles, but feel I need to use it longer to be more able to give it a better rating. I like it well enough to keep using it at this point.</li>
    <li> this is such a silky serum. it moisturizes so nicely and make my skin feel so soft and smooth, perfect for my makeup application. it has helped reduce the redness and hyper-pigmentation and has helped brighten up my complexion. will definitely repurchase. great deal! good amount of product for the price.</li>
    <li> I use almost everything that comes from instanaturals. This is my favorite. Moisturizing but light and doesn&#x27;t csue breakouts! Improved my skin tone so much that I stopped using foundation. Excellent product, will keep using til instanaturals change its formula or stop making it.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent serum. The next day my skin felt soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION AS WELL!</li>
    <li> Serum is very thick and of better quality than niacinamide that I have purchased before.  The price for the size was also very good.  Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I apply it morning and night to dry skin and my face feels SO incredibly soft. I use this before applying makeup with just a dab if moisturizer and my makeup glides on and looks perfect! This came in only a few days after I ordered it, I&#x27;m talking less than a week. And I have received a few emails from the owner of the company making sure everything is going well with the products. InstaNatural is such an amazing company! I will absolutely be ordering from them again.. Especially this serum. It makes my ever so dry skin feel so soft and hydrated!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. She has sensitive skin and this product caused her face to turn bright red and burn.</li>
    <li> A nice moisturizer - but I have not noticed any amazing results. Yes fine lines do temporarily look less noticeable but any decent moisturizer will do that.  However I am ordering again as I have extremely dry skin and this stuff definitely moisturizes. I do not need any additional moisturizer afterwards and it is less expensive than the DHC Extra Night-time Moisturizer that I have been using for years.</li>
    <li> I have used InstaNatural Niacinamide serum for for approx 6 months. It is a wonderful product. My skin has made some great changes. My deeper lines between my eyes appear smoothed. My facial skin appears to have a healthy glow like it used to when I was much younger. The few dark spots I have are strongly diminished now. In other words it has been a great find. Other products I have purchased like this serum have lasted maybe a couple of weeks. This lasts much longer. Also I do not like reading reviews where the product has only been used only a short time. This doesn&#x27;t tell me anything. Serums etc that you apply on your skin take several weeks, if not longer to see  if there has been any changes to your skin. That&#x27;s why I wait until I have used a product long enough to see if it works or not. So using this product for as long as I have should help you make a more appropriate decision as to whether you should use it on your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this serum, helps me control my acne. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and it has made a huge difference in my skin, I had severe acne scars and almost ever lotion or serum I used made me break out, this serum didn&#x27;t do that and wile I also used retin-a (for 2 years now) I never saw much of a difference with the retin-a alone, it does make me look a bit glossy but I rather look glossy than to have this hideous scars on my face. Overall I love this product and I will definitely keep buying it..</li>
    <li> I like that this product has no sulfates, parabens, or alcohol. It goes on smoothly, no smell, and is absorbed quickly.  It moisturizes my skin and since I have sensitive skin I am happy to report I have had no side effects or reactions to this product.</li>
    <li> Love how this product reduces discoloration and gives my skin a smooth appearance.  Absorbs quickly and provides great hydration!</li>
    <li> Love this makes my skin look and feel younger!!</li>
    <li> InstaNatural Niacinamide Vitamin B3 serum is a very nice moisturizing and restorative serum without all the greasy after effect you get with regular moisturizers. I got this on a promotion to try as I had tried InstaNaturals Vitamin C Serum and just loved it. I love this B3 serum as well in that this is very calming to my skin.  It does leave your skin feeling fresh and hydrated but also calming minimizing pores, and does not feel tight or mask like.  I have become a huge fan of serums compared to just using moisturizer lotions and cream since trying InstaNaturals facial line. Great line of all natural facial products that get results without compromising your health with all the crazy chemicals you find in some of the major brands. Winner!</li>
    <li> I am using this for acne, and have noticed a modest decrease in number of pimples!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It keep my skin soft and hydrated</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my acne. Made my skin greasy. I still gave it 3 stars cuz I got it fast</li>
    <li> Such a great serum. Pure and fresh and makes skin smooth !  It has definitely worked on my granddaughters acne !!  100% improvement</li>
    <li> I love my natural Serums that I Purchase from Amazon. They work great!</li>
    <li> The consistency is more like a lotion than a serum, which I was not expecting.However, it&#x27;s not heavy and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Love InstaNatural, works well. Leaves your face feeling hydrated. Smell is mild, a definite plus.</li>
    <li> Works great! Evens out skin tone due to sun damage and discoloration while also lessening menopausal related acne issues along jawline. Makes face somewhat oily by morning when used at night so I have not tried it during the day for this reason. Seems to be helping with fine lines but haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really tell about deeper creases.</li>
    <li> Really love this product works great exceeded my  expectations</li>
    <li> I used this twice the day I got it and was asked about my skin the next day! It definitely helps heal your skin. My acne is almost gone. I am anxious to see how my skin looks with continued use. I went out with NO cover up on today. I use cover up everyday. Not anymore!!!</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a week and have not noticed a change in the texture of my skin.  It may take a few weeks to see anything when using a new product, so I will update if there are any changes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really pleased with this product so far as I have been with the Niacinamide 5% Face Cream.  Please check out my review on the Night Cream  Niacinamide Moisturizer. My face has improved so much in terms of evenness and tone within 24 hours of using these products.  They really do deliver results.  Skin looks better, brighter, more even and the acne scars are becoming smoother and less visible.  I&#x27;ve also been really impressed with this company&#x27;s customer service.  There was a minor mix-up with my order and InstaNatural went above and beyond to fix the problem in a prompt and timely manner.  Great customer service!  High quality, effective products!  I would recommend to everyone without reservation.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea and I have been looking for anything that helps. While the B3 Serum has not cured the Rosacea, it has noticeably reduced the symptoms &amp; a little goes a long way. Several drops a day are enough to treat my whole face.</li>
    <li> I wanted this item so bad and instead I received the wrong product once again.  I love instanaturals but this is the second time I got something different than what ordered.</li>
    <li> Recently received this product and have used it a few times....remarkably I have noticed a change in my skin&#x27;s apoearance and have been tempted to go to work without any foundation!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this as face cream. It helps my dry skin stay moist and works well under my mineral make-up. It doesn&#x27;t take much product to cover the face so it lasts quite a while. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and plan to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> This came in very secured packaging!  No longer than I&#x27;ve used this I could not believe the positive effects it has shown!  I absolute love this and will keep it in my daily regimen!!!&lt;br /&gt;Also, so appreciate the information that was given from the provider, thank you!</li>
    <li> Not sure the cause of my face rash, I know it&#x27;s not acne and it&#x27;s not roseacea either, Dr think it&#x27;s related to immune disorder..?!!?? I have small tiny red bump with no pus on my cheeks only and this product seems to keep it under control, it didn&#x27;t clear but it isn&#x27;t getting worse either, I have used Retin A and Fineacea before but other than drying my skin its all they did. The serum texture is so easy to spread on the face and get absorbe very quickly with no greassy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Love it so far and will keep in touch in a few month for the clearing part :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 3 months, and I do notice that my skin is overall clearer and brighter. I also use the insta Natural Argan oil on top of the Niacinamide, and it does a good job of sealing in the moisture overnight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple niacinamide creams and this one is my favorite. It will leave your skin soft all day.</li>
    <li> Product seems to be working. My skim is feeling much more moisturized &amp; younger looking. I have only been using it for about 2 weeks but results do far are good!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Not sure if it is helping with age spots and lines, BUT my skin is super sensitive and this is a product that I can wear and moisturizes my skin without making me break out in hives or causing my eyelids to swell.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I will continue to buy.  Great price as well for the quality of the product.  I also appreciate that this product along with many other InstaNatural products are vegan.</li>
    <li> Extremely impressed with this product. I have battled acne 15 years now. I was quite surprised to see that putting this serum on after toning would immediately improve the texture and moisture-quality of my skin. In less than two days of use I noticed less white-heads, black heads and pimples. Also less wrinkles and flaking. My skin was so dry and oily as a result of being dry. This seems to balance the skin so that it glows and doesn&#x27;t over-produce oil ... I sure wish I had found this product earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/5/17 -- Why have you changed the packaging? I hate the new dropper style method for dispensing product. It wastes product and invites the opportunity to contaminate the product accidentally when trying to replace the dropper back into the bottle. And the dropper doesn&#x27;t seem to be as much as the pump delivered? If I want to get another dose, it&#x27;s not easy to get the dropper back in the bottle and suck up more. Luckily I was able to fish a black pump from an old blue bottle of this product out of the trash and use that. It dispenses the perfect amount without any mess or waste. I really wish the company would consider going back to that pump for dispensing product. It works so much better. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the product itself. Just the packaging.</li>
    <li> Not only did I order this on a Thursday and received it on a Monday, but it cleared up my acne 100%. I had my doubts because I had used everything possible even prescription creams and NOTHING. It kept coming back. I have been using it for less than a month and it&#x27;s completely GONE! Yes, I have some light scars, but I&#x27;m not embarrassed to wear a lot of my clothes anymore. Thus serum is a must have! I regret not having to purchase it sooner. Just glad I got it and have better looking skin just in time for my husband&#x27;s birthday. FYI I also used this on my back (where my main acne problem was) and face. I&#x27;m seriously blown away.</li>
    <li> Used as directed with no change whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Just started using so can not comment on long term benefits, but I like the way my skin feels. Not greasy either.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it ! This Niacinamide Vitamin B3 serum goes on very smoothly. and makes my skin actually feel very plump! Only a very small dab will do your whole face and neck. I don&#x27;t notice any smell or any residue. Can&#x27;t wait to see what this does for my skin!</li>
    <li> I have an uneven skin tone due to the marks made from past pimples and was hoping the vitamin b3 serum would help fade them away, but there hasn&#x27;t been any improvement in my skin tone. I&#x27;ve been using the serum for over a month right now and haven&#x27;t seen a hint of my dark spots being lightened. Another con for me was that initially the serum felt greasy on my skin but eventually that greasy feeling has gone away. Despite my minor disappointment about this, I will continue using it because it is a good enough moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to the topical antibiotic (clyndamycin) that I&#x27;ve been using the last two years to control my acne. I was skeptical at first, but it hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts, my skin feels more hydrated, and the redness reduced dramatically after the first few days. I&#x27;ve been recommending this to all of my friends that have sensitive skin. So glad to be free of topical antibiotics!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this serum, considering all the 5 star reviews it has. But I have come to the realization that alot of these glowing reviews are paid, given free products or discounts.&lt;br /&gt;I did not like this serum, it did nothing for me, total waste of my money. I&#x27;ll stick with my old tried and true: Cellbone Vitamin C serum, Hyaluronic acid, and Neostrata Bionic Face cream.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  I have been using this more than the Vitamin C serum since it spreads more easily.  I probably should have tried each one separately so I&#x27;d be able to attribute skin changes to one or the other.  I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this one again.</li>
    <li> I am seeing results already! Even my husband can notice a difference! I am VERY pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> love this serum, best I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! love how soft my face feels, diminishes fine lines too!</li>
    <li> Works very well for acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
    <li> I got this serum to replace my day and night creams. I have very sensitive skin that becomes very dry in the winter and I only use this in the evenings before bed and I don&#x27;t use it during the day or any other moisturizer during the day and my skin is completely hydrated. I also noticed that redness and unneveness in my skin has improved as well as sometimes I feel like my skin gets puffy I think from maybe eating certain foods but this product has eliminated that. I definitely also feel like my skin has been looking plumper and it is actually so soft its crazy how soft it is. I use a few of Instanatural products and love all of them but I also just have to mention that the customer service of this company is beyond amazing. They have personally emailed me to make sure that I have been satisfied with all of their products and all of their products are guaranteed and if you have any questions or concerns they will do what they can to ensure that you are a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently started noticing some uneven color on my face.  I did some research to see what the causes might be and also what I might try to even out the skin-tone.  Niacinamide came up repeatedly so I decided to give it a try.  It is working well and has an overall positive effect on my very sensitive skin.  Most skin care products are developed as a line of products that are most effective when used together.  I purchased several products from this line &amp; I&#x27;m very happy.  Excellent to support my aging skin.</li>
    <li> Being 30 now it is time to think about anti-aging ;-) But I am still fighting with breakouts from time to time, so I am careful and do research what products are suitable for me. After I&#x27;ve read that Niacinamide is a great alternative for Retinol products (that can be pretty irritating) and has great effects regarding aging AND acne (well at least brackish skin like mine) I have been searching for a Niacinamide Serum in Germany for a long time. Most products were just to expensive to give it a try. I was happy to find this product on amazon.com and even happier that shipping to Germany is possible at reasonable cost.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I use the Olay Regenerist Serum (as it contains Niacinamide as well), but this product is even better. I started using the Fluid a week ago and already can see changes. Especially the redness caused by acne scars is fading really fast and so the skin tone appears even. The texture is good, applying make-up after is no problem, but I prefer Olay&#x27;s texture as it is less sticky and absorbs faster. However, the overall effect of this product is the main reason to buy it and I will definitely do so again.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will also try one of the eye products to fight fine lines :-)</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look and feel amazing!  I&#x27;m 56 and my skin was looking very tired.  This made me very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> 2 weeks, definitely seeing results. Pairing with niapads</li>
    <li> It really worked for me</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product. It is highly concentrated, meaning  a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Great Product and Great customer service from Instanatural.  Will definitely continue to buy this product from Instanatural!!!</li>
    <li> Great product for acne.</li>
    <li> My skin soaks this up and it seems to &amp;#34;Plump&amp;#34;it. I will but more!!</li>
    <li> Gosh this product is incredible! I love the bottle cause all you need is one squeeze and nothing goes to waste- the cream applies so nicely on to my skin and I can see a glow after a week of using it</li>
    <li> The serum absorbs quickly into my skin.  I haven&#x27;t found it to be oily or too heavy like some other serums.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times (morning and night), but I do think I am already noticing a difference.</li>
    <li> I have received this product for free, in return for my HONEST review. First off let me say great product. I am very happy with all of InstaNatural products. This is an amazing moisturizer that leaves my skin looking fantastic. It takes away any redness I have and doesnt clog my pores or make my skin oily. My skin definitely looks more radiant and even. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> great product.brightens,refreshes,tones.customer service 5 stars.definately buy this product you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I just wish they sold it in larger amount for the body.</li>
    <li> I received the order today but the box was opened and the bottle was leaking.</li>
    <li> If your getting up there in age late 40&#x27;s50&#x27;s this is like gold in a serum it makes your skin feel soft and hydrated all day !!</li>
    <li> Working great so far!</li>
    <li> This product has literally behaved as a skin miracle for me.  I am 45 with some aging (fine lines, discoloration) and adult acne.  I&#x27;ve eliminated all silicones from my skincare which has helped prevent acne, but not 100%.  I purchased this and the bottle was sealed but leaked a little.  I almost returned it, but it didn&#x27;t appear that the product was compromised even though it leaked, so went ahead any tried it anyway.  I assume the leakage is the reason this has been pulled, but I hope they get this figured out soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night I used this I was just worried I&#x27;d wake up with a faceful of pimples, and I did not.  It seemed a little bit moisturizing so I used it the next morning under my makeup, and again that night.  By that third morning, I felt any pimples I had had dried out quite a bit, and my skin looked decent.  I assumed it was a fluke, but at least I wasn&#x27;t breaking out from the product so continued to use it nightly as well as some mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a months and my skin looks really amazing to me.  Discoloration and redness are really reduced and I think my pores look smaller.  I&#x27;ve told my husband that I think is might be a miracle product, so he&#x27;s beginning to use it as well.  I haven&#x27;t gone out without foundation in probably 25 years and when I look in the mirror today I think that I can do it.  I am hopeful that this effect continues with daily use, but still not getting my hopes up....but I am still giving the product 5 stars because in one month I feel it has completely changed my skin.  It is the only new product I&#x27;ve introduced to my skincare and makeup.</li>
    <li> I can see a visible reduction in my pore size. It is a bit heavy for my oily skin so I use it only once a day. Overall it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Been using it for two weeks and can see improvement in texture and smaller pores.</li>
    <li> Definite improvement in smoothness of skin after 3 weeks of use, haven&#x27;t noticed a change to age spots though.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results, I have been using it for a week now.</li>
    <li> Wowwwww this stuff cleared the olllld (~5 years) acne scars on my back in a bit over a month. I&#x27;m so impressed. When applied liberally to my back every night, the bottle lasted about 2 months! It spreads that well.</li>
    <li> Great product so far. Used for almost two weeks. Pores already seem smaller and skin seems smoother. No breakouts and no tiny, little bumps near my eyes that I sometimes have gotten with other serums. It&#x27;s also a good, light moisturizer for the really dry climate I live in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too early to tell if it will address some slight post-acne redness and one, annoying small brown spot, likely from sun damage, but from my research on this product&#x27;s active ingredients it should help considerably...given time. Everything else so far is just a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more when this runs out, but this bottle will definitely last quite a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best serum!! I got a facial moisturizer to use during the day but I now use this serum both day and night... I pair it with olive oil at night and a facial moisturizer for the day. My face hasn&#x27;t felt consistently better!</li>
    <li> This serum is easily absorbed and on my skin and leaves it feeling very soft.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive and I have experienced adverse reactions to many products.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!</li>
    <li> I like it.  Nothing revolutionary, but it makes my skin feel nice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. The serum feels nice on the face. However, it doesn&#x27;t do half the things it promises to do! I really wish they stop making all these claims that their product can&#x27;t deliver on.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Skin was getting thin and dry/crepe-y, now visibly plumper and more hydrated.  A little goes a loooong way.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has made my skin look more youthful and clear. I get so many compliments. Thank you for making a great product!</li>
    <li> I have really bad hyperpigmentation due to acne and was very thrilled to know about this B3 serum. Its been 2 months now and I havent seen any difference in my acne marks. I have red-purplish acne marks, old and new, and had used it regularly for 2 months. But the marks and hyperpigmentation hasnt changed or lighten a bit. I desperately wanted this to work and was very optimistic about this serum. I dont have wrinkles so I cant say if this is good for wrinkles or not but definately doesnt work on hyperpigmentation due to acne atleast in my experience. I would like to return this product. Very disappointed and sad!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, goes on dry and not oily. Works well under makeup too</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of this product, but after a few weeks of use it started to clog my pores pretty badly.</li>
    <li> I love this product it really works on eliminating sun spots and small rough spots on skin. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly, creamy, I noticed a difference in my skin in two weeks&#x27; time.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. It is creamy and luxurious on my skin without being greasy. It absorbs well and I feel I don&#x27;t need any other moisturizer. My skin feels and looks smoother.  I like the pure and simple ingredients. And feel it is helping my mature skin look it&#x27;s best!</li>
    <li> Did not see any results.</li>
    <li> NO need for any additional lotion.  This is my new favorite &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; my skin is oily and sensitive.  This is a great product.  Non greasy, non pore clogging, no issues with breakouts with this product.  A very small amount goes a long way, so it will last a long time. Will definitely reorder when out.</li>
    <li> Can definitely tell adifference. Skin feels tighter and looks better, brighter. Will definitely buy again. Still great results so far. Love this product,</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with my face wash and I love the way my skin looks and feels afterward</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for 2 weeks and so far I really like it and most definitely would purchase again.  I was looking for something light for the summer for my oily skin, but would use this all year long as my only moisturizer.  This serum has not caused any new breakouts, but as far as helping with acne, I need to use it a little longer to really give my honest opinion.  I will say that it reduces the redness.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for about a week and it seems to help the quality of our skin and appears to help heal cuts and scrapes a bit more quickly.  Using the product for a longer time may generate additional comments - but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> 4 stars only because the bottle is glass and prone to breaking and the pump has been changed to a dropper. Fantastic otherwise</li>
    <li> This has done wonders for my daughter&#x27;s acne. She&#x27;s tried many products and this one here by far has given the best results. She was always so insecure about her acne and now she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about it. So glad we found this product.</li>
    <li> I loved this product I did receive it complimentary but it does everything it claims to do, will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> I can already tell a positive difference in my skin after about 2 weeks of using this product. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference one way or the other with this product, so I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t work and not saying it does.  The bottle arrived and was leaking.  I suspect it was from the delivery carrier leaving it in my metal mail box on a 90 degree day instead of on my porch in the shade, so I&#x27;m guessing the heat inside the mailbox was close to 140 degrees and probably caused the bottle to leak and may have even ruined the contents, I really can&#x27;t be sure.  I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it would be unfair to say it didn&#x27;t work under the circumstances.</li>
    <li> Hard to find Niacinamide at this concentration. Very effective at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I really like this brand. Feels great on my skin and I feel great</li>
    <li> This works great and I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Really satisfied with this product and would recommend this to friends and family! Thanks again-  Rebecca Schneider</li>
    <li> It seems to be doing it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;Application is at nite time and i notice by the next face scrub in the morning skin is firming and spots seem to be diminishing after a weeks usage.</li>
    <li> this InstaNatural Niacinamide Vitamin B3 serum is wonderful.  It feels so nice going on, absorbs quickly and I am finding that it is fixing the dry spots I used to have on my face.  My skin looks more hydrated and brighter.  This is a really nice facial serum.</li>
    <li> This serum is a terrific moisturizer but it has not lightened my freckles/sun spots.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> The texture is awful! They should do something better....it&#x27;s foamy!</li>
    <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this good in a long time!</li>
    <li> I use this serum over my toner (InstaNatural Moroccan Rosewater Toner) and under my moisturizer (InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil) every night. I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s light, smells great and you get fast results. I would definitely recommend this product to others. InstaNatural is 90% of my facial routine!</li>
    <li> This serum is very moisturizing without causing any irritation and has helped to reduce redness and inflammation. I have also noticed some reduction of dark spots and old scars.</li>
    <li> I have stopped using this as my skin feels gummy/tacky. Not much of a worry overnight but not pleasant during the day. Probably should request a refund since it is just sitting in a drawer.</li>
    <li> 1st time trying Vitamin B3 serum.. love the texture and safe ingredients. Still using the product. Looking forward to see the result.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with acne on my chin. This product has helped clear up my skin without feeling greasy or showing thru makeup.  Took one star away bc I prefer to only use on my chin but pump squirts too much product and you have no control over it.</li>
    <li> This is a very silky smooth serum. I have tried vitaminc serums, aa well as other beauty serums and this is one of my favorites. I use it every night after cleansing and toning my face. I also ise in the morning before applying makeup to help with a silky smooth application of foundation.  It makes your skin feel great and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in a timely manner.  Good quality.  I would order this again.</li>
    <li> It seems to be doing the trick. I visited Alta yesterday and there was a lady measuring moisture in our skin. She asked if she could test my skin and I said well you&#x27;ll probably get &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; skin because that&#x27;s what most professionals tell me. To my surprise, mine fell in the range of moisturized skin, and I can only attribute that to using the vitamin B3 serum.  I never leave home without it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week and I like the feel of the Serum.  It adds a glow and I see some shrinking of blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;The amount to apply is questionable...sure it depends upon skin type and some close experimentation.</li>
    <li> This serum is a little different then any other serum I have used before. It comes in a blue cobalt glass bottle with a push pump. It&#x27;s made in America and it doesn&#x27;t test on animals! The serum it&#x27;s self is a cloudy white gel..ish and when you put it on it starts to feel a little like lotion (which I don&#x27;t think is a bad thing). But the reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five is because of the smell. It&#x27;s not terrible but it&#x27;s not amazing. It honestly reminds me of the way play dough smells. Which again I&#x27;ve had worse smelling facial products on my face before so it&#x27;s not too bad! * purchased with a promotional disclunt*</li>
    <li> This seller is fast. The niacinamide is wonderful and has brightened up my skin considerably.</li>
    <li> Seen no change in my skin...its gel like consistency is a gel version of water. I seen no change in wrinkles, crows feet or deep frown and laugh lines. I prefer using other brands available through Amazon that have proven results for me in the past. Stay with what I know works.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in a timely manner. Good quality. I  am impressed with the results. This is a very silky smooth serum. You only need a little to apply to your skin which absorbs quickly. Been using in the morning and at night and I would order this again. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> The product takes a while to rub in and absorb. Skin felt smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new products, especially if it&#x27;s for my sensitive skin. But, the already excellent reviews made me give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;It only took a few days to notice my skin looking clearer than before. A week or two later, my complexion had become clearer.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product, definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a skin problem that just wouldn&#x27;t go away, there was an report on TV about B3 that it cured my problem. It works but takes time to start to work, about 3 weeks.  Will buy again. Don in Seattle.</li>
    <li> I only just received the product, but already want to leave a positive feedback about the company. I&#x27;m from the Netherlands, and since they don&#x27;t ship there I had the item delivered at a friends address in LA. Unfortunately the package got lost. But... they were so kind to ship it all the way to the Netherlands for me again! So happy!&lt;br /&gt;So I only just started using the product, but already loving the creamy consistency. I use it at night and wake up with very soft skin. Will review more in a little while on how it will be treating my skin in the long run!</li>
    <li> Great product....i have been using for less than a week...and I see the results already......will be it again</li>
    <li> In a short amount of time, my skin seems to be improving!</li>
    <li> I love it. It smells good. after use it, my skin feels better.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. It broke me out the first few days . It had to be returned.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb! Everytime i use this my skin gets more clear and even toned. My skin stays hydrated all day!!</li>
    <li> I got this to use on my breakout prone skin, but it&#x27;s really heavy and greasy feeling, so now I just use it in stretch marks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult for me to review the results from using the product because I am not using it. Why? Because the product leaves a tacky residue that doesn&#x27;t go away even if I use moisturizer over it or coconut oil. I was extremely disappointed. I wish I could have used it. I do want to say the product goes on easily.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My skin hasnt felt or looked this great in years!  Truly amazing....</li>
    <li> I reviewed this product for I love to review. I&#x27;m so glad I used this product because I have been looking for an all in one serum. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I came to know about the significance of B3 in collagen production when I got a free sample of B3 Metacell Renewal cream from Skinceuticals. I loved it. HOWEVER, it cost over one hundred dollars! So I found the Instanatural Niacinamide serum instead. Serums usually  have higher concentration of the actives which was a plus. I found this to be really moisturizing and has a  slip that is very characteristic of vitamin B3. I use this before any cream. I have been having drier skin in the last year and this product has helped retain  moisture.</li>
    <li> To everyone that says this product did not help with acne, I can tell you that it helped me. Studies show that topical Niacinamide helped reduce acne in patients over an 8 week course. So if you did not use for a full 8 weeks or more please do not give this product a 1 star... It takes time to heal acne. Do yourself a favor and at least use it for a full 6 to 8 weeks to give it a chance before you write it off as not helping your acne. I&#x27;m not saying it will help everyone, but then again neither will benzoyl peroxide.</li>
    <li> Wonderful refreshing skin serum. Noticed a difference after a few days.My husband liked it so much that he asked for a bottle for himself.Nice consistency.Not oily or greasy.</li>
    <li> This is working great on my old blotchy skin, especially on my face. I have had positive comments from others who say my face looks much clearer and I have only been using this B3 for just around a week. I am trying it on my forearms too and it seems to be clearing up some rash looking spots.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a product that work on old skin. I am 82. I do notice it has a warming sensation on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Gene</li>
    <li> Bought it about a month ago and been using everyday before sleep. Will list some pros and cons based from my observation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Soothes irritated skin&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturizes well&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly reduces redness of acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t really prevent acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t see any results regarding lightening of dark spots</li>
    <li> I am still assessing if this product is working as promoted.  Not sure if I would buy it again because I find it to be a little too greasy in comparison to another brand I had purchased.</li>
    <li> I like it but expensive for how much u get</li>
    <li> I use this on my scar and so far has really seen its lightening up. ;)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great to use for non greasy and effective skin care. I like that it makes my skin feel soft and supple and helps to promote a wrinkle free face.</li>
    <li> A product that does what it claims to do! I have 44 year old skin and it has never looked or felt better since using InstaNatural products. Truly impressed with these products and the best customer service one can ask for.</li>
    <li> Feels light and works well on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous. Has made a huge difference in my skin</li>
    <li> Amazing product ! Suggested by a friend &amp; I love it!</li>
    <li> Only been using this for a week so I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference</li>
    <li> Love this product. I really like the InstaNatural product line. Products that I received generally do what it promises.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I love this serum!!!!! Customer for life!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This has helped my skin from the terrible dryness I suffer from.  It is quickly absorbed and easy to apply sunscreen and makeup over it.  Attractive bottle and serum is easily dispensed onto finger tip.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The Niacinamide cream from InstaNatural is a great way to reduce dark spots on your face.  I have a few spots on my face with slightly darker pigmentation and have noticed that even with just a couple of weeks of use, those spots are lightening.  Now, I should mention, I do have very fair skin and I do not think this would work well or be recommended for those with darker complexions.  I am looking forward to see if my continued use of this product will minimize signs of aging as my skin does feel healthier and softer, so I think it will!</li>
    <li> Personally I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements with regards to Age Spots, Hyper-pigmentation, Redness, &amp; Blotchy spots but it is an excellent moisturizer leaving my skin very soft and smooth and no  breakouts since I have started using it. It does not make my skin oily and absorbs well. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I rarely submit reviews on Amazon, but this product merits one. I recently discovered the benefits of Vitamin B3 for hyper pigmentation and acne. I have been using other Vit. B3 skin products, such as Skinceuticals Metacell B3 Serum and CeraVe PM lotion. While I still love the Skinceuticals Metacell B3 serum, InstaNatural&#x27;s product is very comparable to the former, having the same 5% concentration of Vit. B3, at a fraction of the price. InstaNatural&#x27;s serum has a very nice gel-like consistency, that melts on the skin leaving no oily residue when applied. I also like that the first ingredient is organic aloe vera, and that it contains neem oil (for its natural antiseptic, antibacterial properties) along high concentrations of glycerin (10%, v. 15% for Skinceuticals) and hyaluronic acid (a whopping 5% v 1% Skinceuticals!). All in all, it&#x27;s a fantastic product, a staple my skin regime from now on. My teenage daughter has also started using it for her acne, and, so far, her skin appears clearer and healthier.</li>
    <li> I used the entire bottle twice a day and saw no difference in fine lines anywhere on my face.  I gave it a two stars because it felt nice on my face and did not cause any irritating side affects.  Honestly, I believe vit B3 can be very helpful for anti aging, but when purchased in a bottle it&lt;br /&gt;cannot maintain its effectiveness as it ages and loses the potency.  I&#x27;m going to try the vitamin B3 capsules diluted in warm water.</li>
    <li> stuff rarely works but this does.</li>
    <li> What I loved was how this helps even the skin texture, makes it smoother, and reduces redness in the skin. I also have natural red undertones, and when my skin is looking uneven, I&#x27;m usually seeing lots of red in the mirror. While using my InstaNatural B3 serum, I really noticed my skin tone looking much move even. The redness has hardly been noticeable after use, and my blemish scarring has appeared lighter and less noticeable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have made a big change effecting my hormones, my acne has naturally been improving over the last few weeks, but my InstaNatural B3 serum along with a mask, have both seemed to help improve my acne as well. I have noticed a substantial decrease in blemishes popping up the last few weeks, and the ones that have have seemed to disappear more quickly and have not gotten as big and ugly, or super red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this serum both day and night, and in the morning would use it alone as a moisturizer, and it seemed to keep my skin perfectly hydrated. I love that this serum actually feels more like a cream.  It goes on nice and even, and right away makes my skin feel smoother and softer, as well a bit plumper too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve absolutely loved using my InstaNatural Vitamin B3 serum and am so excited to see future results I can get from using regularly, for longer!</li>
    <li> This serum with niacinamide from InstaNatural is moderately viscous and has a creamy white color.  It has a faint and pleasantly vegetal odor from the organic aloe vera juice and other botanical ingredients.  When massaged into the skin, it is readily absorbed, leaving behind only a silky texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several ingredients in this serum to help lock in moisture and prevent drying, and others that may have an antibacterial effect and help with skin infections like acne vulgaris.  Niacinamide has been shown to have positive effects on skin structure and pigmentation.  This formula also doesn’t block pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this serum isn’t a miracle in a bottle, but it certainly does improve the appearance and texture of skin when used on a regular basis.  I like to apply it after bathing or washing my face and it is also soothing after facial peels or exfoliating scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is packaged in a cobalt blue glass bottle to protect the contents from light and it has a convenient pump top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided by InstaNatural for testing and evaluation.</li>
    <li> Just received my Vitamin B3 Serum only a week ago, so I can&#x27;t really tell a difference other than my skin feels softer. I&#x27;m not only using it on my face but also on my arms for those sun damaged areas.  Will let you know in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality product that should be part of your daily routine.</li>
    <li> After only a short time of using this serum I already notice a better appearance of my face.  It looks smoother and brighter.</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle of this for review on my blog.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a little over  a week or so and I have been very pleased with the effects. I got it initally for a sun spot on my face, but I had a nasty outbreak of acne and I used this to clear it up- over night it seemed. I had no itching or other ill effects like can occur from other acne products.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any change in my sun spot, but I am using it twice a day, and hope I will see results soon! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> So I am writing an unbiased review of the Insta Natural B3 Serum. I am a sceptic by nature. I also have tried just about everything out there for anti aging. Crazy expensive creams, lotions, potions and notions with the promise of youth. I took a risk on Insta Natural and I have to say I am absolutely loving how my face feels and looks after only two weeks of use. So much, that I felt I cannot be without it in my arsenal of beauty products…I just ordered my second. This product works extremely well on mature skin…I am 50 AND I can KICK and STRETCH and KICK!! Humor aside…I am truly seeing something different…perhaps the all natural ingredients?!?! I don&#x27;t know…but something is definitely different and in a very great way. My skin just looks healthier and uplifted. I actually look forward to slathering this on my face when I get home after work….quite addicting. ALSO…no BREAKOUTS for me whatsoever and I have extremely sensitive skin. I truly am loving this serum and am thankful I stumbled upon it. Thank you Insta Natural for such a lovely product. For all you skeptics out there…this is not a forced writing. This is simply a review based on factual evidence on my face. I am ditching the $100+ serums, creams etc…I can attest to better results with this one product plus Cerave moisturizer! SO PLEASED!</li>
    <li> I received Niacinamide Cream on June 3,2014. I&#x27;ve been using it for 9 days. I have used so many products trying to rid&lt;br /&gt;my face of  sun damage. It&#x27;s too soon for me to see any difference in my discoloration. But I do see a difference in the&lt;br /&gt;texture of my skin. It&#x27; locks in moisture and leaves my face looking brighter. I&#x27;m happy with this product so far, I will continue&lt;br /&gt;to use it and hope that I have finally found the miracle cream to get rid of this discoloration. happy so far.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this. I have acne, plus wrinkles plus dark spots, ugh yea. It made my face feel very soft after using it, but I started to break out. I could be from something else but I stopped for a time. Once my skin clears up I&#x27;m going to give it another shot and follow up.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum. I have been battling acne for the better part of 6 years now. I&#x27;m 30 years old, and not only has this serum helped with my current inflammation, but it is also lightening my dark spots and acne scars. Will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I am 52 and still have a problem using serums and moisturers- most make my skin super greasy after an hour or so. I have been using this twice a day with no problem at all. In only a week i feel my skin looks younger (i don&#x27;t know how you get lines and oil but i do!) i feel some sun spots are fading as well. Very reasonably priced compared to products that i have purchased and better on my skin</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I feel about this. I can&#x27;t see a difference in my skin. It does leave my skin soft and plumpy but only sometimes. But I love that it only took three days to deliver c:</li>
    <li> I only review the truly horrible or great- incase one wonders why I use rating of only 5 stars or 1. This is serum is INCREDIBLE. No idea how it works- but I know it does. I am one of the unfortunate women; wrinkles and break-outs, dark skin that pimples leave a black mark weeks after healing, dry skin that needs hydration... all possible problematic annoyances are available (or will soon be) on my face. I have used pretty much every make- just to name a few in each category; expensive-Praire, organic-Eminence, simple-Avalon, pseudo prescription-Obagi, spa recommended- IS Clinical. None can measure to what this serum can do. Your skin will glow. I can breakout just looking at a lotion- not with this serum (you can actually use it as your face moisturizer- its rich). Scars soften and disappear. Brilliant! Hurry and buy it- you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t help me with my acne problem at all. Ii is not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Very smooth going on.</li>
    <li> I looked for the Vitamin B3 Serum when I heard how great benefits on TV. I&#x27;d been scrubbing my face daily just to remove dead skin just so my face didn&#x27;t feel dry and scaly. It was a constant thing. When I tried the B3 serum I was thoroughly impressed. It moisturizes but the longer you use it, the less you need. You only need a couple of drops for your face and neck. I tried a lotion bought in a store that had B3 in it and used it on my face. Though it worked, my face was constantly greasy and getting moreso as the day wore on. With the B3 serum, it softens, keeps dead skin away but doesn&#x27;t leave you with that greasy look or feeling. You also can&#x27;t beat the price of this one. I ordered another one right away because I like it so much! Great product, fantastic results all at a wonderful price!</li>
    <li> I really like the cream.  It seems to help with dark spots.  It absorbs quick and leaves my skin feeling softer.</li>
    <li> This niacinamide serum smells and acts identically (in my opinion) to another by Leora Beauty but the InstaNatural serum is half as expensive. I think it&#x27;s a great value if you are looking for a serum like this - lasted a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is awesome. At first, I didn&#x27;t realize how great it worked but then I tried some other serums and my skin got dry and sort of broke out. After going back to this serum, my face was smooth and moisturized again after less than a week. It really improves the texture and quality of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this company has the best customer service in the world.</li>
    <li> I was sent this fore revew, however this does not effect my thoughts or opinions. This makes my face feel so smooth. When my face was feeling dry or irritated this soothes it immediately. The texture is heavenly. This is one product I never forget to use. I couple weeks ago I had a reaction to something on my face and this help calm it down and sooth it so fast. I am so happy this was on hand. My skin overall feels much softer.</li>
    <li> I like the way this feels on my skin. I have noticed a little bit of a difference in acne spots and discolorations I have had on my face, but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a significant difference. It&#x27;s been a few weeks and I am looking forward to seeing if more of a change is apparent in a few more weeks. I really like that there is an option to try it risk free, because not every product will work the same for every person. I tried this along with InstaNatural&#x27;s rose water and if I had to choose between the two, I would go with the rose water because I think it does more and feels better on the skin, but these two products do work well in conjunction with one another.</li>
    <li> I have been going to an aesthetician for facials geared toward age reversal and rejuvenation.  She recommended a similar product for about five times the price! My husband and I both started using the majority of the InstaNatural line, and we have both been amazed at the improvements in color, tone and hydration! My skin no longer looks dry and tired, but fresh, healthy and vibrant now! InstaNatural provides very high quality products at such an affordable price, you just can&#x27;t beat end results!</li>
    <li> So far so good! I have been very impressed with all of their products that I&#x27;ve tried. All have had nice packaging &amp; a good amount of product. Their serums are a great consistency  (not watered down or too thin), go on smoothly &amp; absorb nicely. I will continue to use &amp; would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Give me more time to tell You if result or not</li>
    <li> Love all of InstaNatural products.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it makes my skin feel smoother and has a healthy glow!</li>
    <li> Excellent serum. Very happy to have this!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this as much as other InstaNatural products that I&#x27;ve been using; but it causes my skin to break out.  I stopped using it until my face cleared up and then tried it again, same problem.  It appears to be a wonderful product just not for me.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is light weight and if I&#x27;m describing the feeling right, it makes your skin feel as if it&#x27;s breathing after you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;It  makes my skin feel soft and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Okay first of all I know that I&#x27;m not supposed to squeeze pimples in the first place, BUT, second of all I think that using this product helped to heal it instantaneously when I did, and I also will credit it for preventing any more pimples from occurring at that same time.</li>
    <li> I defanately love this product, it feels very nice on my skin, I believe my skin has improved and I will continue to purchase this along with the Vitamin C I love them both together, I feel my skin looks brighter and tighter and younger than before, I am very pleased. Most of all nothing has made me break out..It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  I use on my face, neck and recent surgical scars.  It makes my face feel amazing and moisturized.  My scars are healing faster and looking better.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great saw results in 10 days!</li>
    <li> This feels nice and I think it is doing a good job.</li>
    <li> I wanted a lotion or serum containing nicotinamide (aka niacinamide), a form of vitamin B3. Topical as well as oral nicotinamide has been shown to protect skin from sun-induced immune suppression, thereby lowering the risk of some common skin cancers. Use your favorite medical publication search engine to read the papers. Anyway, I wanted to buy a topical 5% nicotinamide cream or lotion and saw InstaNatural&#x27;s serum and ordered it. I was unable to tell from reviews if this was scented too much for me (I&#x27;m very scent adverse) or otherwise objectionable.  I&#x27;m happy to say the stuff is great, no scent as far as I can tell, and easy to use every day on sun damaged skin areas. It soaks in quickly so you can put sun lotions, moisturizing creams, etc. over it. The 2 oz. bottle will last awhile - I&#x27;ve used it every day for 6 weeks on my head &amp; face and it is less than half gone. The bottle&#x27;s pump works well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is overrated.  It just makes my skin kind of sticky and greasy looking. I read that it was good for acne and shrinks pores. I see nothing spectacular like what I read. Some of these reviewers can be a little dramatic.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the lightness of this cream. It goes on very easily. It does a little while to dry and my skin is left with a slightly sticky feeling for several hours to half a day. After a few uses, I didn&#x27;t mind the sticky feeling. Otherwise, my skin looks better and feels better. My face looks and feels moisturized and plump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample of this product to review. No other compensation was received. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This is Great. I got it for my mom and she loves it. You can really see the difference.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel good and clean when I put it on. It kind of foams before it soaks in.</li>
    <li> Product came quick im excited to see how it works. Will leave more feedback in a couple of weeks! Seems creamy when i put it on but not greasy at all!</li>
    <li> After turning fifty, my dermotologist recommended switching from retin A to niacinamide. This product is at a quality level equal to some brand names, at half the price. My skin has improved and I get compliments on my glow.</li>
    <li> I actually love this serum. It goes on creamy and I have noticed some fading of a bad sun spot I got while in Mexico. If it had bearberry extract too, it would make it perfect, as my skin still has a lot of overall uneven discoloration that I think bearberry would help. Bearberry also helps with dark spots under arms and other areas that get dark from shaving. So, while I love this serum, I will be looking for one with bearberry too when I purchase next.</li>
    <li> My wife loves how easy this product is to use. It goes on her skin great and doesn&#x27;t drip off like some similar products. This moisturizes her skin and makes it feels soft. She also has some scars from living in the Philippines. Some fire ants got her leg and she wanted to get rid of the scar. This stuff works great on that too. The scar is beginning to fade. I have a scar from surgery, that I may try this on to see what happens. This product does wonders for the skin and my wife is telling all her friends about it. Was happily provided a review product to try out. We can&#x27;t wait to try out more of their products.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s too early to see results, and mostly because it&#x27;s a very sticky serum. I wear it only when I&#x27;m at home. Fragance free, do not irritate my skin but I don&#x27;t apply it near my eyes so I don&#x27;t know if it would. Maybe that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to be used, I&#x27;m ok with it though.</li>
    <li> This is one of the smoothest serum that I have ever used, I love the feel of the softness on my face.</li>
    <li> I do love this.  I love serums.  I switch off between this and a retinol serum. I&#x27;m 48, but I figure eventually I&#x27;ll look like I&#x27;m 12.</li>
    <li> I had heard that Niacinamide cream was good for damaged skin.  After years of having horses and being in the weather, cold or hot, rain or shine, my skin is definitely damaged.  I have never found a cream that did anything for my skin.  This cream does keep it moisturized and smooth but I guess the damage is just too much for any cream to completely fix, including this one.  I do like it for moisturizing properties though.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitamin C Serum for quite a long time now, but this was my first experience with Niacinamide Serum (B3). I struggle with acne through out the year and also have &amp;#34;worry lines&amp;#34; on my forehead along with some dark circles around my eyes and sometimes my face has a rosacia like effect where it stays quite red on the cheeks and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;When I began using this serum along with my Vitamin C, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see any drastic differences or results, mainly because I do regularly use so many serums and creams. But I was entirely surprised and elated to see that &amp;#34;worry lines&amp;#34; on my face begin to fill in because of the plumping effect of B3 and because of that I began using it on my stretch marks which are also starting to get smaller and diminish in color. I have also noticed the dark circles and redness diminishing and my tone is more natural. I am also excited that my acne is not as intense during that time of the month and I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of cover up because I look like a hormonal teenager.&lt;br /&gt;I have been so excited to see how well B3 works and how moisturized my skin feels after using it as well. When I use this product I can actually go without my usual day cream and wear it by itself because it offers amazing moisturization while doing all those other great things. This is a great addition to any beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> This has changed my face and my self confidence. Menopause has brought me huge cystic acne. InstaNaturals complete line of skin care has helped me manage outbreaks. But I still had dark spots from previous acne. This product has made them invisible. It&#x27;s put a pep back in my step!</li>
    <li> The company provides excellent service and everything was up to par.  I&#x27;ve heard really good things about this product so I am hopeful to see big results soon. Will update when appropriate.</li>
    <li> Good so far. Just using at night because skin is extra oily if I put on in morning ( I have very oily skin to begin with.)</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s Amazon headline says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Niacinamide Vitamin B3 5% Serum,&amp;#34; but that concentration is not shown anywhere on the bottle or box I received. Therefore I doubt the “serum” actually contains 5% niacinamide, and I&#x27;m returning the product.</li>
    <li> just didn&#x27;t see any difference from my skin also realized after I bought it that this product contains sodium benzoate which has been known to cause cancer</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!!! Noticed a change with in a week of use. Leaves my skin looking youthful and dewy. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed Vitamin B3 was not the main ingredient and too many other additives.  That was my fault for not checking ingredients before ordering.  Also, when applying is too sticky for me.  Nonetheless, will keep using for a month to see if I get the results I want.</li>
    <li> I have seen quite an improvement in my skin tone and fine lines. My face is clearer, brighter and supple. I have sensitive skin that breaks out in hives if a product disagrees with me. Happily, I have had only positive results thus far.  My skin drinks this stuff up. A little goes a long way. I use twice a day. I&#x27;ve only been using about 2 weeks and anticipate even more improvement with prolonged use. The price point is quite affordable, as I&#x27;ve used many expensive high end brands of creams and had allergic reactions or no results. This is wonderful with its natural ingredients.  So glad I found it! Terrific!</li>
    <li> I can tell no difference in my skin while using this serum for 4 weeks</li>
    <li> I use this after vitamin C</li>
    <li> Work well on my skin, but small bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> This is my new addition to my skincare routine and I am loving the results so far! I am a big fan of InstaNatural products and this serum is my new favorite! My skin is glowing and acne and scars are clearing fast! My scars are really stubborn so I plan to purchease their Scar cream also.</li>
    <li> I was so hopeful for this to work. Considered getting this for the Niacinamide and was sold once I read the rest of the ingredients. Sad to say I have see no results. Also after spot testing it successfully for a few days it turned out to be the thing breaking me out a few weeks later.</li>
    <li> I checked out getting Niacinamide on the recommendation of a dermatologist. I was a little skeptical about this particular product, but in combination with my normal facial regimen I&#x27;ve noticed a great difference in my skin quality. I think by itself this formula is a little sticky. I combine this with a pump of hyaluronic acid serum and a pump of red raspberry seed oil, and sometimes a little aloe gel when my face is puffy. I use an extra pump at night before bed. After using this for a month or two my skin has become noticeably more plump and even. And I still have a ton left. Great for the price, will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I just received this product.  I was trying it as an economical alternative to NIA 24 serum, a 5% niacinamide product I have had success with.  The 5% is the magic number which this product lists in the marketing title.  However, I should have examined the label more closely.  Despite the marketing, nowhere does the label state that the niacinamide is 5% strength.  It is listed as the third ingredient and that&#x27;s it.  I also checked the website and nothing.  It smells pleasant and has a smooth texture but so do a lot of cheaper moisturizers not claiming to be a 5% product.  Amazon has sent me a prepaid return label but I thought others should know this is not a 5% product.  If it was, it would be listed on the label.  The marketing title on this product is a case of false advertising.</li>
    <li> I love the B3 Serum.  The product is great and so is the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent serum. I have been using it about 2 weeks and feel that my face is noticeably smoother and that my pores appear smaller. I think it is working on my age spots too but it&#x27;s too soon to tell. Anyway, it&#x27;s a great product at a great price and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This cream did not help my skins appearance like al the reviews said. Nor does it smell nice like some reviews stated. It smells like NOTHING. A little like cardboard honestly. But i gave 4 stars because InstaNatural sent me an email and asked how the product was working and I told them it wasn&#x27;t working for me. A few days later I check my bank account and there was a refund for $17 in there. We didn&#x27;t even talk about a refund. I was not expecting that. So I give them 5 stars for customer service. But I took one star off because the product didn&#x27;t even my red patchy skin tone on my face.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this cream.  It has not amazingly cleared my skin, but I do notice fewer fine lines, and the blemishes seem to heal faster with less discoloration.  I like that it is light and lasts a long time, as well as the glass pump- it&#x27;s sanitary.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this, after a week of using this, my scar seems less visible and skin looks very refreshing, i think its worth a shot for those with bad skin like mine. This also helped blend in some pigmentation of my skin.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell any difference, wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this.</li>
    <li> best moisturizer EVER!</li>
    <li> Nice serum dispensed from a easy pump bottle. You only need a little to apply to your skin which absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this two months ago. I am impressed with the results. I only use it every other night because I have oily skin. It has really reduced the wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes. It has reduced the dark circles under my eyes. The few other lotions I tried had little or no effect on these problems. It is a small bottle, but a little goes a long way. It has also helped with red and dry skin conditions. Best thing I have tried yet! I have not noticed much change on the few dark spots I have. But I still have over half a bottle left. I will definitely buy again. And the best thing is it all natural. Definitely recommend it. Do not waste your money on Botox or strong chemicals. This really works.</li>
    <li> I am a woman of a &#x27;certain&#x27; age.  I have pretty good skin tone and a good complexion that I want to maintain.  After researching serums, I decided to try this product.  I&#x27;ve now been using it mostly once a day for about 6 weeks.  I noticed from the first time I started using the serum, that my skin felt extremely soft and dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t yet vouch for the long-term effects, but I can say that this product absorbs easily.  Has a pleasant texture and a mild fragrance. I absolutely LOVE the way my skin feels when I use it and intend to keep this product in my regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s important that these products be stored in this type of bottle as the contents can be degraded by excess exposure to light.  I appreciate the pump dispenser which allows me to use the product sparingly.  A few drops are all I need as it easily spreads across my face and neck.  I also like that this formulation uses natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to InstaNatura for providing a high-quality product with good packaging and all at a very reasonable price.  I&#x27;m a guaranteed return customer.</li>
    <li> I gave this serum a try for several days, but I don&#x27;t like its texture. It&#x27;s a bit too thick and heavy; it sits on my skin and does not absorb. So, even after several minutes, it feels sticky and tacky to the touch. I&#x27;ve tried using it alone, and tried adding my regular moisturizer over it after waiting a few minutes for it to absorb. Neither is a good solution.</li>
    <li> I have Leukemia &amp; must take multiple vitamins. This product is easier to use than trying to swallow huge pills. Keeps my blood levels normal. I received this free for my evaluation</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with vitamin C serum for a short time and it seems to be improving the texture of the skin on my face.  I decided to try them because I noticed some pigmentation that was darker than any of the freckles under one of my eyebrows.  The patch of skin has already begun to lighten and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight tightening of the facial skin in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to apply, soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.  Finding products that actually work and are reasonably priced is always welcome.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased two bottles of this.  A little goes a long way, so I should be good for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> This product works really well. I enjoy using this in my daily morning routine. It doesn&#x27;t smell nasty, and it doesn&#x27;t make your face oily. It also dries really fast! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of these types of serums, so when I was given the chance to try this product for free  I looked forward to continuing my regimen of using vitamin C serums daily. I&#x27;ve seen lots of reviews for similar products that claim an overnight change, wrinkles disappearing, gone are the age spots, and skin is younger looking. That&#x27;s not realistic. I use skincare products to delay the signs of aging and hope with long-term use, some of the fine lines will be less noticeable and spots will fade a bit. Body Merry makes a great hyaluronic acid and vitamin C serum (this product), and of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried, which is quite a lot, this is definitely my favorite. The formula is slightly thicker than others I&#x27;ve tried and my skin feels temporarily tighter after I apply it. I use it mostly in the morning before a moisturizer with sunscreen and feel confident I&#x27;m doing good for my skin. I can&#x27;t say after a week that my skin is 10 years younger, but I can say it feels better, which means I feel better about myself, and I feel confident that I&#x27;m doing something that will benefit me for years to come.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It is great moisturizer.  One thing missing is the instant wrinkle remover as I&#x27;ve had in similar products. (the ingredient that puffs out wrinkles).  The cream is light and non-greasy.  There is no need to apply additional moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This serum is a must.  It leaves the skin soft and clear.  I find that lotions tend to leave a film and or residue.  This serum does not.  leave any residue and seems to nourish the skin instead.  The best compliments are when I wear no makeup and others comment on vitality of my skin.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have combo oily skin and was looking to improve my sallow skin. Hard to tell if it helped with this. Used it twice a day and it left me greasy with congested pore and breakouts. Smells plasticky too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of Indian descent. On second day of use I saw a huge change on my skin. Pores are smaller and skin looks clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Niacinamide Serum long enough to say I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. I have noticed improvement in my skin tone and is calming my skin from many different sensitivities I suffer with. I don&#x27;t believe in miracle products, but believe I will continue to use this in the future as it does address my areas of concern.  Be sure to use sparingly for best results otherwise could be sticky or feel over-moisturized.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. It really moist your face and neck. I do recommend this product</li>
    <li> If you are one who suffers from acne then you should get this. I would also like to suggest this if you if you have a hyper-pigmentation. What is that. It is where the skin is darker or lighter than your other skin tone. It will help you lighten that up. So if you are one who has both acne and hyper-pigmentation this is a wonder serum for you.I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! If will lighten and clear up acne all in one product. Should you have some redness it will help with that too. I have been using this product for more than 7 days to give my thoughts of this. I have noticed this serum is very moisturizing while it is working too.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers thought this was great so I gave it a try. Too oily for my skin, at least during warm weather.  Will try again in winter or give it away. The packaging is nice (blue cobalt glass bottle) and the ingredients are good--maybe just not good for me.</li>
    <li> After using 3 bottles of this product, I feel that I can venture to say that this works! I use it right after a vitamin C / Retinol product which I have been using for several years. This Vitamin B product seems to combine well with the Vitamin C</li>
    <li> I have been using this Instanaturals Niacinamide serum for 3months.Iam very impressed with this product.I have acne prone skin.When I started using this my face started clearing up and its feels very soft.It doesn&#x27;t do anything for my acne marks,but my acne is completely cleared and iam very happy with it.Its a white light moisturizer with no fragrance.I ordered this with the vitamin c serum ,but when used together I had a tingling feel.so I avoid using it together. Iam happy with my purchase and I will recommend to those who have combination,acne prone skin..</li>
    <li> Niacinamide is the 3rd ingredient in this serum cream. Not sure if this is working yet!!</li>
    <li> We have been using the product for about a month.  So far so good. However, it takes 7 or 8 weeks for the skin to renew, so we have to wait and see. However, two suggestions re: the label.&lt;br /&gt; The label should allow viewing the contents so as to not run out, and it should clearly state 5% B3.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;:</li>
    <li> I have been a customer with Amazon for a long time, and this is the first time I have written a review. This product is incredible. I have had moderate acne and oily skin for a long time throughout my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s and used different forms of benzyl peroxide with some benefit. However, in every picture, my skin always looked red, irritated and itchy. I stopped using all of my current products when this arrived in April and started washing my face with a very mild cleanser at the end of the day in order to remove my makeup. After, I applied the niacinamide serum and massaged it slowly into every area. My skin was oilier and broke out a little over the next two weeks, but I stuck with it. My skin is radiant now with almost no blemishes. I use this product once a day generously before bed and don&#x27;t even wash it in the morning before I apply my makeup. I also have a few brown spots on my cheeks from pregnancy hormones and sun exposure. These spots have faded and almost disappeared. I am ordering a second bottle today.</li>
    <li> what an amazing product. I used my first night and once I woke up the next morning I could immediately tell a difference in my skin. My pores were so large due to using the product &amp;#34;Proactive&amp;#34; something I would never recommend. Proactive damaged my skin and anything I did could never improve my appearance again. I used the &amp;#34;Nacinamide&amp;#34; which I love it has no odor, non greasy and glads on very easily. one I woke up my pores were smaller, Skin looked youthful,around my eye area looked brightened for and skin felt so soft. I will continue buying this product from now on. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well the Niacinamide cream worked, I have been using it on a few trouble spots on my face as well as my body. I suffer from some areas of hyperpigmentation and this stuff has worked wonders on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also started using it on my arms, I suffer from Keratosis Pilaris, which is basically a keratin build up in the hair follicles, resulting in very small rough red bumps. It is life threatening or even that noticeable, but it has always been something I have detested. And I hated it whenever someone would brush against or touch my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I don’t even worry about it, the Niacinamide Cream has softened my skin so much its unreal, and even my husband has noticed the difference. My arms no longer feel rough and the redness that is often associated with the keratosis is all but gone! I could not recommend this stuff enough, especially to anyone suffering from KP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely something worth having in your beauty arsenal.</li>
    <li> This serum feels like a moisturizer! I like the fact that it has neem oil and Rosemary in it, so it keeps skin free from blemishes. Even mature skin needs help at those times of the month!  Niacinamide is a wonderful thing that does so much good for the skin! Reducing hyper pigmentation, reducing fine lines and shrinking pores.Lots of research went into the making of this serum I&#x27;m sure.. Nice combination of ingredients and I like the rich feel of this serum! My skin feels tighter, moisturized and more youghtful! The serum does what it claims to do</li>
    <li> I love this product! It leaves my face so smooth and has helped with the hyperpigmentation in my skin. The B3 is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin really soft. Its hard to find a product that fights acne and aging at the same time so I love it. After applying for just a couple of days my acne spots are less swollen and my skin is happy and smooth.</li>
    <li> Received this product as a gift and was somewhat  skeptical but pleasantly surprised.  Facial lines seem to diminish after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> Works great use my derma roller smooths my skin</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It asorbs well and makes my skin very smooth. I well be ordering again!</li>
    <li> it is a great product</li>
    <li> I am someone who suffers from dry skin, so when I was able to review this product from the company I was so happy! First off, I use the product every night and I never wake up to dry skin, or even greasy skin. Some creams end up making my skin feel greasy, but this cream always feels smooth and nice on my skin. My acne is going away which I&#x27;m sure is from this product. I also love how they did not test on animals to make this which is always a plus for me. Great product and very happy with the company.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it, makes my skin really supple, &amp; very smooth. Cleared up my skin😄......😊🙌</li>
    <li> It feels nice on my skin. I&#x27;ve only used it for two days now :) ill give it a month to see it helps. Ill keep everyone updated!</li>
    <li> Sinks in pretty well; good under a light moisturizer. Definitely makes my skin dewy in the morning (after putting it on at night). Not sure I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement in pores/acne/wrinkles yet-- my skin just usually looks like I&#x27;m having a good skin day when I have this on. I&#x27;ve only used it for about two weeks, though. No irritation.</li>
    <li> this product feels amazing on my face, very moisturizing effects</li>
    <li> its great I love trying products for free thanks I do recommend this product because it really does what it says</li>
    <li> I am most satisfied with InstaNatural&#x27;s Niacinamide Vitamin B3 5% Serum!  I just started using it, and it makes my skin feel wonderful!  I don&#x27;t use it everyday as I&#x27;m using other serums and was able to receive help as to how to rotate these serums for them to perform most effectively.  I love the InstaNatural because it feels silky-smooth going on, it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of odor, the bottle has a convenient pump, and the price is very reasonable (especially since it comes in a 2-ounce bottle).  I think I&#x27;ll stick with InstaNatural from now on!  Try it -- you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> This serum is working wonders for my skin, and the customer service is outstanding!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and does seem to plump skin.&lt;br /&gt;I try to follow the guidelines in &amp;#34;Eat Right for your (blood) Type&amp;#34; by D&#x27;Adamo. In this book, or in his other one, &amp;#34;Live Right for your Type,&amp;#34; he recommends niacinimide lotion for people with blood type B. I bought this because of his recommendation.</li>
    <li> This product is great! As a long time acne and PCOS sufferer, I still suffer from painful cystic acne and scarring we into my 30s.  To make matters even worse, I have combination skin with extremely dry flaky skin in my acne prone areas. I have tried many products and have been on multiple benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and antibiotic treatments to no success.  I decided to give InstaNatural products a try because of their great reviews and money back guarantee.  I purchased the Vitamin C toner and the Niacinamide Vitamin B3 serum.  First off, the InstaNatural customer service is hands-down the best customer service experience I have ever had. I was sent the wrong product (I received the Youth Express Age Defying moisturizer), and they sent the correct product with free 2-day shipping AND allowed me to keep the wrong product!  Within 2 days of using the toner and moisturizer, my dry skin was gone.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Once I received the Niacinamide serum and began using it for a week, I had a flare up of acne.  This is typical for me when I use a new product because i Have very sensitive skin. InstaNatural customer service checked up on me weekly and reminded me that I could choose to return any or all the products at any time.  I decided to ride it out for 3 weeks and boy am I glad I did!  I reduced my use of the Youth Express Moisturizer to 2-3 times a week and my initial flare up subsided. While I still have a few minor pimples and scars, I have noticed a huge difference in the texture and health of my skin.  My acne is reduced, my scars seem to be fading a bit, and no more dry skin!  My skin has a glow to it that I haven&#x27;t seen since I was a teenager. Although I can&#x27;t pinpoint which product is helping, I do know it is one, if not all of them that is turning my skin around. Thank you InstaNatural. I look forward to trying more of your products.  To those of you considering this product, you really have nothing to lose. Don&#x27;t expect results overnight, but be patient and you will see them.  This is coming from a person who never thought she would have improved skin with little to no acne.</li>
    <li> Trying on this product, there is no scent so for those allergic to any harsh scents this is great. Also I think another benefit of not having a scent is that lets say there is a scent but you do not like it. It goes on skin nice and smooth. You actually do not need to much to apply to your face. I have just used about 2 to 3 little drops (pumps) but very small amount to my face and its just fine. It does absorb into skin beautifully, leaving no greasy or sticky feeling. Usually I apply this before going to bed or before heading out in the morning, prior to applying makeup. Like I have mentioned it does go on quick and dries fast allowing perfect prime time for me to use my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I loved using this under my makeup because it almost acted like a primer/base. It made my skin smooth and ready for the makeup to just glide on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed this product. I think that it&#x27;s benefits are awsome.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how well it will work.. New skin products typically take 4-6 weeks.  But what I can say is that it feels pretty good, but it doesn&#x27;t not smell that great.</li>
    <li> **UPDATE: I gave it to my mom and she LOVES the Vitamin B3 Serum. She is even going to be buying more once she runs out! She said it has evened out her skin tone and makes her face and neck feel really soft and look younger. She uses it in the morning and lets it absorb before applying makeup. She would give this 5 stars, so I&#x27;m averaging our ratings into a 4-star review.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my skin seems to have a negative reaction to this serum. I tried it several different times and it irritated my cheeks, which can be sensitive to certain products. It left those areas dry and red, so I did stop using this serum. I looked up several reviews to see if anyone else had this reaction, however it looks like most people tolerate it just fine. So, it must just be me and I&#x27;m going to see if my mom wants to try it to see how it works for her hyper-pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had great success with other InstaNatural products, but this one just doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite facial serum and moisturizer!  It is rich but not oily and leaves skin so soft. Perfect for under makeup or even as a night cream.  I also like to apply it under my eye area and my neck</li>
    <li> I loved this. it sank right in. Left my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I break out along my jaw line and since I&#x27;ve been using this, I&#x27;ve noticed the blemishes have become smaller and no longer red.</li>
    <li> my skin feels smoother, pores are visibly smaller - friends have commented on my &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week now and love it! My face feels and looks fresher and younger!!</li>
    <li> bought as gift no complaints</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve been using this serum for over a month, I can actually say that I&#x27;m seeing a difference.  I was using a combination of hyaluronic acid and vitamin C serum but tried using this instead of the Vitamin C and am glad I did.  Much more effective.  I&#x27;m at the point of needing to order more which I will do without reservation.</li>
    <li> Seems to tighten skin a bit. No redness or rash so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> THis is a good product.Has helped my complexion greatly</li>
    <li> Been using this for several weeks. My skin has improved. It&#x27;s firmer and stays hydrated with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product and packaging</li>
    <li> I am slowly switching beauty items to more natural products.  Wanted to find gentle, natural hydration for post [not so gentle] salicylic acid peels.  Used this immediately post peel and had good non-greasy hydration.  I have combination skin usually. Two weeks post peel, I use this at night and wake up to clearer skin and smaller pores.  (Now if I can keep the pores from growing throughout the day from my makeup that would be great.)  I also had some scarring on my chin where I had been picking at a recent, recurring zit (shame on me) and it has almost disappeared in approximately 4 weeks.  The Niacinamide also helps plump up under my eyes where I had some unsightly lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is little risk with this purchase with Instanatural&#x27;s money back guarantee and excellent customer service.  I received an email from customer service asking how the product was working, and extending assistance if I had any questions.  I used the opportunity to get clarification on enclosed instructions.  Though this is a serum, I use it in place of a moisturizer after applying another Instanatural serum.  This doesn&#x27;t follow the product instructions (serum + moisturizer), and I appreciate I was able to get further advice from customer service directly.  I recommend giving this company a shot if you are looking to change to natural, effective products.</li>
    <li> love this product works great</li>
    <li> It is really good for acne, it is a thick serum, put in the face and gentle massage until it total absorb, and then apply moisturizer, when I wake up, the acnes almost total dried and your skin no redness or dry. Really good product, I love it</li>
    <li> Maybe this is not for me, I could be overly sensitive to this. But tried it and my skin felt really irritated afterwards. Quite red and warm. My best recommendation is if you have sensitive skin this might not be the product for you.</li>
    <li> I have used it just a few times so far, but I like the ease with which I can apply and leaves my skin feeling satiny smooth.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great product as far as how it feels on the skin. Too early to tell if it actually benefits my skin in any other way.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a few weeks now and I must admit that I am very happy with it. It is not heavy or greasy at all and it leaves my skin feeling smooth. It does not have much of a fragrance for those who do not like scented products and a little goes a long way. I think that this cream is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m blessed with good skin, I have very few scars, I never had severe acne as a teen, I do have the occasional breakout prior to my monthly visit and the pores on my cheeks are a slightly enlarged. I have a small sun spot under my right eye, lets face it, no one wants sunblock in their eye, so that&#x27;s the only explanation I have for it. I wear sunblock religiously I feel that it&#x27;s best to take care of my skin now so I don&#x27;t have to suffer from the results of not doing so later. With that attitude, my skin has rewarded me with very little signs of aging in my 30&#x27;s where as I&#x27;ve seen other&#x27;s my age struggling with crows feet, worry lines, and what I refer to as &amp;#34;smoker&#x27;s lips&amp;#34;. I wear little to no make-up and only have the one sun spot on my face, with the use of this cream I was able to see the little sucker begin to fade from a strawberry color to an almost non-existent peach. I&#x27;ve noticed the skin under my lower lip felt a bit plumper, at first I thought it was swollen, but it&#x27;s still that way. To be honest I would have preferred my upper lip have been affected as my lower lip is a bit more pronounced anyway. Can&#x27;t have it all can we?  I&#x27;ve had no break out as a result in beginning this as a new product on my skin which is not the norm for me. I usually have to give myself a buffer week prior to judging if a product will work for me in the long run or cause more harm than good. This Nicinamide Cream did everything it claimed it would.  I&#x27;m highly satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about a month now, and so far I have been loving it. It glides on very nicely and leaves your skiing feeling brighter and healthier. Results for using this serum are not seen until after a while. I like to use this product before going to bed and leave it on all night.</li>
    <li> So far, acting as predicted.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any differance yet but am still hopeful.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It does an AMAZING job at moisturizing my face, and very high quality in my opinion. It&#x27;s a HUGE bottle too which will last me forever. This has worked WONDERS on my existing acne and I look forward to seeing what results I see in my continued use of the product! A must have for ANYONE that has issues with dry skin and acne. This will be great for the upcoming winter months as well!</li>
    <li> A really good product...Seems expensive, however you need just a drop at night. It&#x27;s very rich and my skin seems so bright and refreshed in the morning. It&#x27;s worth it...thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used other products by Insta Natural and have really been impressed with the level of quality for the amazing price. I bought this cream serum after reading all the great reviews here on Amazon. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and have noticed some great results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. My skin is softer and more luminous.&lt;br /&gt;2. Old scars on my face are fading.&lt;br /&gt;3. My skin tone is more even and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;4. The skin around and under my eyes is brighter- dark circles are gone.&lt;br /&gt;5. The lines around my mouth are diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I should add that I have been using this product in conjunction with COUI Super C serum. I use both products twice daily, and I have been amazed at the positive changes in my skin! This product is now a permanent staple in my beauty regime.&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural&#x27;s customer service is also worth noting. They send me periodic emails with tips for optimal results and queries regarding my satisfaction with the product. I will continue to purchase products from them- I am really impressed with product price, quality, and the excellent service!</li>
    <li> Fantastic company. Never have I seen such amazing customer service. The product itself is great. Within a few days of using it on half of my face, so I would really be able to compare and see if it was making a difference, I could see a difference! I asked my daughter which side of my face looked better and she picked the application side. The biggest improvement I noticed is in the wrinkles</li>
    <li> Excellent cream serum.  Not greasy at all  And keeps skin moist and plumps up fine lines .  I would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I have used several products of the InstaNatural brand. So, before I even used this I new it would be a good product! I was right, it is!  After using it for a couple of weeks I could honestly tell my face feel and looked better! It gives you a firmer and more smooth appearance which of course makes you look younger! Who doesn&#x27;t want that! I am pleased with the cream! Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this product. I like the consistency of it and how it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin.  I am seeing a lightening effect, and I am even more excited about niacin amide&#x27;s function of preventing new dark spots from forming, so this is a base layer for my face, hands and forearms, under my sunscreen every day.  I would and have recommended this product to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks. I replaced my nightly moisturizer with this one to help reduce acne scaring, and improve my complexion. In the three weeks I&#x27;ve been using the product, my skin has become INCREDIBLY soft and supple. I use a lot of products on my skin (consistent chemical peels, serums, potions and lotions) so I always considered my skin very soft. I was surprised that this cream had such an effect given my already intense skincare regimen. I have had zero breakouts when using this product, and I always seem to have a pimple in the works... This has also helped to reduce scarring I&#x27;ve had from past breakouts. Overall, I will continue purchasing this product simply because the price, quality, and effectiveness cannot be beat!</li>
    <li> First let me note for the record, I am a fan of InstaNatural products. So it is somewhat difficult to give this particular product an average rating. It almost makes me feel like a disloyal customer. But I am obliged to give a fair and impartial review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I was not able to use this product after several applications. My skin broke out in a rash almost akin to acne, which took nearly a week to clear up. My wife tried the product and received the same result. We are both quite sure that we followed the directions, but also found that when two people in the same household had the same outcome, there were probably issues regarding the similar nature of our facial skin and the product&#x27;s ability to really moisturize; literally to the point of clogging the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this may not happen to you, as there are quite a few top notch ratings; proceed with the knowledge that the product may not work out for you.</li>
    <li> This product comes in a 2 fl oz (60 mL) container and has a pump for easy application.  You only need the size of a pea to cover your whole face!  This will surely last quite a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your face will feel soft and moisturized after application.  You will know if you applied too much because it will make your face feel like it has a mask on it (I know. . .I didn&#x27;t follow the directions for my first application. Dun dun dun. . .) If you use the recommended amount then your face should feel normal/light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color me impressed! :)</li>
    <li> I got to try this free for review purposes and it so freaking great as a base before make up it makes your skin so plump and moisturized!</li>
    <li> Very excited to receive this based on what the ingredients are suppose to be. But it leaves a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; wherever you apply it, and it makes me break out every time I use it! I tried it for a week at night as part of my nighttime regime and I got the worst most painful blemishes. And to put things in perspective, I am NOT someone with &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;. I have never had a product break me out before...so I was shocked and horrified. Like I said, I don&#x27;t know what that film is but it&#x27;s gross. Also, this is NOT  a &amp;#34; SERUM&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a clear cream that starts to turn white as you rub it in and it takes forever to absorb into your skin. I no longer use it on my face, I actually use it on my elbows, hands and legs before bed so as not to throw almost 20 bucks down the toilet but I really can&#x27;t say its effective in those places either. The fact that 90% of the reviews were sponsored should of been a red flag for me!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son, he has teenage acne. This seems to be helping! Skin is not as red, looks a little clearer. He has only been using it for a couple of weeks, hopefully face will continue to improve.</li>
    <li> Love this serum im looking great</li>
    <li> I received the product about 2 weeks ago.  I started using it the day I got it.  My skin is much smoother.  I have had less acne since using the product.  Seems to be working very well.</li>
    <li> I got this product to help with dark spots and the anti-aging benefit. So far, so good. Seller sent an email with the following tips:&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse and tone your face prior to using the serum.&lt;br /&gt;•Take a small amount of Niacinamide Serum on your fingertips. Rub the fingertips together and then apply on face and neck in an upward circular motion.&lt;br /&gt;•If using a moisturizer, please apply the moisturizer after applying this product.&lt;br /&gt;•Massage it gently into the skin till absorbed completely.&lt;br /&gt;•Apply the serum two times a day, preferably morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is also covered by satisfaction guaranteed, so it is worth the try.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice serum that has Vitamin B3 in it to brighten and plump the skin over time. It comes in a nice pump bottle and is very easy to use. I really like the way it feels on my skin and how nice my skin looks in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is very comfortable on the skin and I had no problems with it. Its not greasy yet glides on the skin nicely and make the face feel very nice while on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try it free to do this review but I really do love InstaNatural beauty product</li>
    <li> Own spots are fading.</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed the way this made my skin feel, did a nice job on lessening redness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 3 weeks. I am noticing a smoothness in my skin that wasn&#x27;t there before and a lightening of a couple &amp;#34;Sun spots&amp;#34; I have. All in all I will more than likely purchase this again. However, it&#x27;ll be a while because a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I love the product...it keeps my face moisturizer  &amp; plumps my wrinkles...people have been complimenting me on looking younger...that&#x27;s always a plus!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Noticeable difference that first morning after putting it on before bed. Skin was smoother, more youthful looking...like how it looked a few years ago (I&#x27;m 44). I&#x27;ve tried many products including numerous Vit C serums...however this product stood out above all of them.  Great price too.  Plan to order some for my mom.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I&#x27;ve really noticed the lightening effect in a very short time.  I really appreciate the 2 oz larger size. I would order this again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for too long, but my skin is really moisturized and the redness seems to go down a bit. Can&#x27;t say it did much for my acne yet, but my acne is hormonal so a lotion probably wouldn&#x27;t fix it.</li>
    <li> Instanaturals serum feels wonderful on my skin. It is odor free and goes on easily. It leave my skin with a slight matte finish that I really like. I like it for my neck after I shave - it reduces itch and rash from razor burn. My wife uses this and has reduced the amount of makeup she has to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product that feels so good.</li>
    <li> Too early to evaluate if spots will diminish but daily use leaves the skin smooth and toned. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my age spots or fine lines. Skin feels smooth, but did before, so I don&#x27;t see any real difference.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Skin feels great and you only need about a dime size for your entire face.  I have mild rosacea (the redness isn&#x27;t too bad but the little pimples are annoying!) and it has really helped clear up my face.  I wear a hat and keep my face out of the sun but in the heat and humidity, my rosacea will still appear and this Vitamin B3 serum really makes a difference.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> So far I like the serum, it is too early for me to really see how well is working for me as I have only used it for a few days. Need more time to really see the results.</li>
    <li> Very good product !!&lt;br /&gt;You can see the difference in&lt;br /&gt;Just days !</li>
    <li> I love this serum my skin is soo plump and smooth this is my new magic face serum with this i don&#x27;t need any thing else other then their C serum skin is firm and glowing in just a short time I feel I&#x27;ve found my fountain of youth</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t certain this product would be right for me but so far I am satisfied. I am using niacinamide to even out the color of my skin. It isn&#x27;t really whitening but fading my uneven spots . I use as a nighttime treatment and is doing the job. It isn&#x27;t a rapid result but a nice gradual effect.</li>
    <li> Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) Moisturizer Cream. It is an amazing anti-aging and skin-lightening serum, that can be used on all skin types, even sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer cream hydrates, firms, and plumps your skin, is non greasy, and absorbs quickly. I like to use just after washing my face, while my skin is still warm and my pores are open, so that it absorbs even more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is thick, and I found that a little goes a long way. I have combination skin, and some moisturizers make my skin look extra oily, but this one didn&#x27;t. It moisturized my skin perfectly, without making me feel oily or greasy, and my skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tackles a variety of issues, from hyperpigmentation, to acne scars, stretch marks, and dryness and redness, using a blend of great ingredients, such as Vitamin B3, aloe vera, avocado oil, and rosemary extract. I didn&#x27;t notice a scent at all, which was nice, and a great change from the overly perfumed moisturizers that are on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product free for review purposes, but all opinions are my own*</li>
    <li> First off, I liked that it was light.  It didn&#x27;t seem greasy, which is a plus.  After using it a few times a week for two weeks, I felt that my skin looked smoother and more clear.  My cheeks glowed a little red too.  I am in the process of trying it out on some scars on my foot to see if it diminishes them.  I will update after that experiment, however I want to do this for about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that they use organic components in their beauty line, BUT for this item you have to look a little further if you&#x27;re concerned with what&#x27;s in your products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;The list of ingredients are Organic Aloe Vera Juice, Vegetable Glycerin, Niacinamide (vitamin B3), Emulsifying wax, Avocado oil, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol (vitamin E), Neem Oil, Rosemary Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Tetrasodium EDTA, sodium bicarbonate, Citric Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not too happy about Phenoxyethanol so that is why I gave this a 4 star rather than a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I checked the rest, and the only other ones to take notice of are Tetrasodium EDTA and Citric Acid.  They both are at a 2 on a scale of 1-10, as seen on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website. Phenoxyethanol is a 4 out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;Not too bad InstaNatural.  Let&#x27;s get ALL the ingredients at 0-2 list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that they will stand by their products and will give you a full refund if you are not satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the scale I was using is from EWG, here a quote from them:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It&#x27;s our mission at Environmental Working Group to use the power of information to protect human health and the environment.

    <li> I have been using Niacinamide Moisturizer Cream by InstaNatural for about 20 days, and so far I like it.  20 days for a skincare product isn&#x27;t quite long enough to verify the long term benefits, such as lightening of the skin and reduction in hyper-pigmentation,  but right away I was able to see a difference in the dryness of my skin, and my skin appears smooth after using it. It is lightweight and absorbs quickly, if you aren&#x27;t using too much, and it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel, which is a requirement for me.  I would definitely say it&#x27;s a good moisturizer, with less harmful ingredients than most on the market, so that is a huge bonus.  Another added bonus is there is a manufacturer guarantee, so if you&#x27;re not satisfied you get a full refund.  Oh, and it&#x27;s not tested on animals!</li>
    <li> Wanted to stop buying very expensive products so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Have been using this for about 3 weeks. Only use it before bed though.. But so far I do like this product. Leaves my face so soft, I mainly bought it for discoloration/ scars on my face and although it&#x27;s probably too soon for any significant changes, I have noticed my scars getting less red. Not only I, but others have noticed my face a lot better too. Would def recommend others to give it a try!</li>
    <li> I feel this is a real adjunct to skin care regimen.  I  Will in all fairness use the whole bottle before rendering a full evaluation, but it is well absorbed and with the quality of its ingredients the trans dermal reception is no doubt of benefit.&lt;br /&gt;MLG</li>
    <li> I am on the 2nd bottle and I am very pleased. It makes my skin feel plump and youthful. I am hoping it will help with old age spots, which will take time to tell of course. I was using a much more expensive niacin product before and it was very nice too but did not make my face glow as this product does.  Billie</li>
    <li> I was completely shocked at how well this moisturized my skin it left it feeling silky soft just after one use and my scars started to fade instantly it was so amazing that i am recommending it to all of my friends, with the vitamins included it&#x27;s just a completely perfect product for anyone! sample provided for review</li>
    <li> I am a professional and I cannot live without this.</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin and this product keeps my skin moisturized without the grease and shine. After using it for a month my face is brighter, even and clear. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This time of year my skin is so dry from the weather and windy days. My usual skin regiment seems like it just needs that little extra something to soften my skin without acne breakout. I am always looking for products to help me with my ever changing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I saw the InstaNatural Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) Serum I thought that would be a great addition for my dry aging skin. I have noticed that it has helped with the blotchy spots and brown age spots making them a bit lighter in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the easy to use pump bottle. You can control the amount of serum that comes out of the bottle since you only have to use very little at a time. The serum is very creamy and goes on smooth. Honestly this is the first time I have ever tried a vitamin serum. I will keep using the InstaNatural Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) Serum hoping it will help plump the skin where my wrinkles are most noticed and give me that much younger looking skin that it promises! Best of all... it is all natural!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long (2 weeks) but I like it so far.  Mild fragrance that&#x27;s pleasant.  I need a surprisingly small amount to cover my entire face and neck.  It moisturizes really well.  I can&#x27;t comment on the wrinkle, tone or complexion claims yet since I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice a big difference.</li>
    <li> It is a little too soon for me to notice results, but do love the texture.  The serum is not heavy or greasy and blends well.  Good to use on it&#x27;s own or with facial moisturizer.  Would recomend.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product! I love it ! Just perfect for me and I recommend it highly - Fast Shipping too !</li>
    <li> Wow!!! Absolutely love it. My skin is very dry and flaky. I have used La Mer for many years and even got a prescription cream from my dermatologist and nothing worked. I ran into this and decided to give it a try. I liked it so much that I ordered  other products from InstaNatural  to see if they are as good. My skin is not only not flaky anymore but it is tighter an has a more youthful look.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Vitamin C serums, but I was looking for a moisturizer for my face that was gentle and worked well. It comes in a nice glass bottle with a pump style top that is great for application. This is fragrance free. I have been using it along with Instanatural Vitamin C serum. I have noticed my skin is so soft, even after the first use. This moisturizer absorbs fast and leaves no residue behind. It is very lightweight and I have had no acne associated with it. Many other moisturizers I have tried before left a heavy feeling on my skin and that caused breakouts. After seeing how gentle this was, I had my daughter who suffers from redness on her face try it. After about a week, her face looks great, the redness has been reduced dramatically and her skin tone looks more even.</li>
    <li> Love this serum, will order again</li>
    <li> This works the BEST after a chemical peel; when your skin is starting to flake and look dry and red, this cleans it up and makes it feel and look better while you wait for the peel to be complete.  More of a cream consistency, really love this product.</li>
    <li> I really love this so far. I can feel it working and can see  results already!</li>
    <li> It has only been a couple of weeks, if that, since I&#x27;ve been using this product so not enough time to see significant changes. I do like the product however. I use it at night under retin-a ( I also have this company&#x27;s retinol serum which I also like and switch off between that and retin-a every few days) to alleviate any dryness and flaking. It has done a great job of that. Since using this product I&#x27;ve not had any retin-a irritation or dryness so I just get all benefits and no adverse effects. The niacinamide serum has virtually no fragrance. I feel like my skin has been looking better but again too soon to tell. My skin is oily and tends to look shiny so I don&#x27;t use this during the day to avoid adding to shine but those with dry skin probably would do well with this.</li>
    <li> This product did some of the things that it was supposed to do. My skin is hydrated and my pores seem to be smaller in just a few days, however, my face seems to be more red all over and I have had a couple of random areas of acne break out that I don&#x27;t normally have any. It seemed very thick and it did not soak in as well or quickly as I would have liked. I did not love this product or hate it and through trial and error I might be able to make it work better for me but it would not be directly out of the packaging. I did receive this product free to test and this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> The pores on my nose are big enough to count. I&#x27;ve been using this pretty strictly for about a week and already see a decrease in either the size or the black heads that reside there; I can&#x27;t tell which but either way they are much less noticeable!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results I am seeing with this product! Very smooth going onto to my face. Been using it for 2 weeks and I can see a reduction already in broken capillaries on my face! It only takes a small amount to cover entire face! I also put it on my chest to help with sundamage.  Leaves my skin dewy fresh but not oily looking! I would purchase it again without hesitation!</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  And thank you for the great service.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this purchase! I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for the last 2 weeks, I apply it in the morning and at night after washing my face. I&#x27;ve totally noticed a change in the way my skin looks and feels. My pores appear smaller, and my skin has more of a healthy glow now. It also makes my face feel super smooth. I have oily skin, and I didn&#x27;t notice an increase in the oiliness - if anything, I feel less oily than before. The main reason I wanted to try this was to help get rid of this acne patch I get near my chin (I&#x27;ve tried so many acne products that didn&#x27;t help at all) While I still get a bit of acne there, this product has helped a lot - way more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried in the last 2 years. Plus it&#x27;s great to know that I&#x27;m applying vitamins to my face, and not some skin-drying, irritating, chemical cream. I&#x27;m hoping that with a couple more weeks of using this it&#x27;ll be totally gone. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product, and I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more when I&#x27;m finally out of my current bottle (a little goes a long way!)</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD QUALITY!!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin a little too shiny but other than that I hope it&#x27;s having a good effect, trying to stop pigmentation from darkening with age spots.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to get amazing results with this cream. However, I had wrong expectations and felt very disappointed. Until costumer service reached out to me and made sure they could help me achieve my goals. I was surprised with their first attempt and then even more surprised when they asked me what I needed and sent me something else for free!!! Amazing costumer care that shows this company&#x27;s true interest in our satisfaction. I recommend this company and its products 100%.</li>
    <li> Great for a number of skin issues such as acne, fine lines, rosacea  and blotchiness. My skin was looking a little sallow and it looks and feels great. (I am 59 don&#x27;t tell anyone).&lt;br /&gt;I use only a pea size of niacinimide . More than a pea size has no benefit. My reasearch also states if it is expensive you are getting ripped off. I always look to see what the first five ingredients are and why they the fact that niacinimide is the third ingredient is perfect. Great product righteous price. I am all about that👍. I give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I Like the way it makes my skin feel and it made my skin look brighter. I bought to reduce hyper pigmentation, I don&#x27;t feel like it really helped in that department!</li>
    <li> I like this serum make my skin so brighter and so moisture , my wrinkie  little smoother.</li>
    <li> This serum works, my skin is beautiful. I look twenty years younger than I am. Ask any of my friends!!</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality and ltitle goes a long way. Will buy after I finally run out!</li>
    <li> Another great InstaNatural product to add to your morning/nightly routines. I had never heard of a vitamin B serum, but I was excited to try it when I was offered it to review. The skin on my face has a bad habit of turning red for no reason. This serum is great for reversing that issue. The serum absorbs quickly into my skin, and as always with InstaNatural, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;There are many other benefits to this serum that I can&#x27;t attest to. It can help lighten skin, and help treat acne. My skin is already so light that I can barely find a concealer to match! I also haven&#x27;t had any acne problems while testing this product. (knock on wood!) If y0ou are looking to lighten you skin tone, or maybe you have some acne problems, give this a go! It might work wonders for you.</li>
    <li> Thank you!!! Amazing results in one week!</li>
    <li> So far, it has done what it promises to do. My skin looks great. I get compliments quite a bit on my skin. So, thank you!</li>
    <li> Bought this product because I heard it can help fight rosacea and this specific product was the best value. It really does help. I put a small amount on my face at night after I was up. Don&#x27;t put too much though because sometimes I&#x27;ll wake up with a few small bumps on the areas that I put the niacinamide but it goes away.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, he has rosacea and it has helped greatly in clearing it up! Very good product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few weeks, and so far, love the feel of my skin.  I believe they said it takes about 6 weeks to notice a difference, but I&#x27;m rating it 5 stars because the company has been so fantastic in responding to my questions.</li>
    <li> I love all of the InstaNatural products but this one is my absolute favorite. It really reduces the redness I get whenever I use a moisturizer and the mild acne I have through by T-zone.</li>
    <li> great product, really works on my dark spots</li>
    <li> Broke me out, must have been too strong.  I purchased the Vitamin C Serum and that is working well.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful, makes your skin feel great. Your skin will feel so soft and smooth. Thank you InstaNatural, love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this serum for over a month now at a frequency of about 5 times per week. I am pleased with the results I have observed so far. My skin is brighter, glowing even. My pores are noticebly smaller as well. I cannot say that it has helped much with reducing the appearance of hyperpigmentation, which I why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used Vit B3 on my skin so I have no reference point and I&#x27;ve only been using it for several days but wow, as a moisturizer it is really wonderful! I really never had the need to moisturize, I had oily skin and trying to dry it out was my goal from 13-40! I started using this to help the appearance of my skin and find that it much softer. I apply it at night and even after washing it in the morning, my skin is soft all day but not in any way greasy. I have tried lotions and creams before and typically use them for a couple of days and just quit because, well, I don&#x27;t feel a difference or they are just oily but I really love this stuff. I will let you know if it does anything to improve the appearance (improve lines/even out skin tone) if I notice it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I saw results with this product.  I feel like I can honestly say I noticed a difference the first day.  It was wonderful.  My skin didn&#x27;t appear as blotchy and red like it normally does.  I must admit, I do forget to add the moisturizing cream after application.  My base makeup does help with that, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week, I noticed my skin was more plump and firm (hint~less wrinkle lines on face).  I love this stuff.  Now, I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m wrinkle free, but hey, my husband says I look like my daughter now, which is a great compliment. Please note: our daughter doesn&#x27;t have any wrinkles, but my face did appear more youthful than it has done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In using this serum, you would first wash and tone your face.  You may apply Vitamin C serum, then apply the Niacinamide Serum.  Apply using upward and circular motions.  This is a great anti-wrinkle exercise.  Follow up with a moisturizing oil such as argon oil, or your favorite moisturizing cream.  You only need a pea size drop of serum (it&#x27;s more like a lotion rather than a liquid serum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product can be tolerated by all skin types, and it gets absorbed quickly.  If you want to speed up your anti-aging routine to diminish wrinkles, or if you are looking for a wonderful skin care product, be sure to order your Niacinamide Serum by InstaNatural today.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this for review on my blog and I really like it. I noticed after a couple of days that I don&#x27;t need to use as much moisturizer as I was using. And you don&#x27;t have to use very much. It says pea size amount on the bottle, but I used less and it was more than enough. Great product</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I have LOVED every Instanatural product I have tried.  So far, I have used their phytoceramides, hyaluronic acid serum, and the product I am reviewing.  I will be receiving the vitamin C serum any day now.  I chose to try the niacinamide product because I have read several places of its benefits, which include, among other things, reducing inflammation, improving cell turnover, and strengthening the skin&#x27;s \\&quot;barrier\\&quot;.  I like to layer skin products on my face, and I like to utilize everything natural that I can.  I layer serums first, finishing with moisturizer.  This moisturizer has a pleasing texture and is versatile; with just a little you can adequately moisturize, and with more you can get a good, rich coverage (not possible with many other moisturizers) which I prefer at times--at night and at other certain times that I like to steep my skin in moisture.  This feature is also great for combination skin like mine, in that you can add more or less where needed.  The formula contains a bit of hyaluronic acid, which I always appreciate when I see it on a label. In fact, all of their products I have tried contain good ingredients--organic, kosher, and botanical substances.  Hint:  anything good for the face is good for the backs of the hands, another highly visible place which betrays one&#x27;s age.  Bottom line--I love Instanatural!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  From the very first use, my facial skin appeared clearer and healthier.  The brown age spots are disappearing.  I plan to continuing using for a long time.</li>
    <li> Leaves me a little greasy feeling. I think it&#x27;s the glycerine- even if I use a very small amount, I can&#x27;t use it all over my face or I feel like my skin can&#x27;t breathe because it has a film on it. That said, it works amazingly well to lessen the inflammation of a pimple ( I have read many articles that talk about the anti-inflammatory properties of Niacinamide, so this comes as no surprise). It also seems to have lessened the perpetual redness I have on my upper chest (the ruddy curse of the natural born red head).  I use it sound my eyes nightly and while I can&#x27;t say that it has made a major difference on my fine lines, I&#x27;m still willing to finish the bottle. It also seems to make my Retin-A more tolerable (less peeling and itchiness). If there were a version without the glycerine (even a mist), I would be the first to buy a vat and dive right in.</li>
    <li> This particular one is for your face and it has a name that for me was a bit hard to pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a pretty blue glass bottle with an attractive label. The blue glass is to protect the product from having too much light hit it.&lt;br /&gt;I started using it and yes, as described above, it is easily absorbed. It has a pump top for easy dispensing onto your fingertips. You don&#x27;t need to put much--the bottle even says, If it feels like you&#x27;re wearing a mask, then you&#x27;ve used too much. I did this the first time when using, and quickly learned that I only need a small amount for my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;It does work well to keep my face moisturized and smooth. As far as fighting acne, and plumping up the skin, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of an effect there. It does seem to make my face look a bit brighter though, which is a really nice thing about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free bottle of Niacinamide Cream Serum for reviewing purposes. All opinions expressed here are solely my own.</li>
    <li> InstaNatural as a brand has always brought quality products which have yet to disappoint. Once I got to try to this Moisturizer Cream of course I expected quality and results. A brief explanation on what the benefits of using Niacinamide are. Vitamin B3 also known as Niacinamide has been linked to eliminating wrinkles and fine lines and used by dermatologist in the treatment of acne.&lt;br /&gt; When applying only less than a pea size should be used. This cream is lightweight and very smooth in texture. It seems to expand when smoothing into face. So this 2fl oz bottle will last a long time even after applying twice a day. After applying you will feel a difference in the feel of your face and that is because it creates a barrier on skin surface to prevent damage from pollution and sun rays. With continuous application you will see signs of smoother and plumper skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. I had a really bad cystic acne breakout during the summer, which&lt;br /&gt;left a lot of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). After applying this serum over the past 2 weeks, a lot&lt;br /&gt;of it has faded away. I have to say that I am definitely pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service was excellent, as well.</li>
    <li> Really hate it. It just makes my skin sticky and greasy looking...very uncomfortable after applying it...</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. It was a creamy texture went going on and caused my skin to look shiny. It appeared that skin broke out more with using it. Hope it works for others though.</li>
    <li> The serum is very moisturizing. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and it&#x27;s very light on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have a reaction, I wish i did not. Was helping.</li>
    <li> I needed something for my crows feet. All the products I have tried just didn&#x27;t work. This stuff is great. It really does plump the skin so it reduces the lines. Even my husband commented on it. Now he is using it to LOL  Really great stuff...Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Use it everyday. Feels great and makes my skin look awesome. One of the few products you will be able to tell a difference in your skin!</li>
    <li> I had have many hyper pigmentation marks due to teenage cystic acne. Though this doesn&#x27;t do miracles (which I wasn&#x27;t expecting), it certainly has improved my overall complexion by adding a certain &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. I highly recommend using pure vitamin e with this</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. First time using it after a dermaroller, I can see result asap. My skin was red from roller the derma and with this product, it somehow soothe the redness and made it fade away a bit better. I&#x27;ll keep using this to see if it&#x27;ll rid of my tiny dark spots. Btw, it isn&#x27;t too oily. Perfect.!</li>
    <li> Nice product make you skin feel good!</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference using this so I probably won&#x27;t put it on my skin regimen...things I can&#x27;t do without list.  Gave it 3 because I love most of this company&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this. I noticed it does NOT contain methylparaben, which I just found out can be drying to the skin- so that&#x27;s a big bonus. love finding no-ad products with major ingredients like niacinamide. I have to check their animal testing status though.</li>
    <li> This leaves my skin moisturized all day but no greasy feel. It also plumps up my wrinkles so they are not so noticeable. I have been reordering this I like it so much. And it is very affordable. It also does not make my face breakout.</li>
    <li> I usually allow myself a few weeks to experience a product before I review it but this one has been a bit different. Cutting to the chase I am impressed with the quality and outcome of this 5% Niacinamide Cream and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I am closing in on 60 yrs old and seek to maintain my skin to look and feel like it is 50 yrs old (maybe 45?). So, in my quest for the fountain of youth, I have decided that the repairs need to come from under the dermis/top skin layer and not just fill in cracks and wrinkles - I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often and would prefer to keep it that way. Realigning my skin has not been easy and everyone&#x27;s skin is different in what it needs to return to youth so I have been reading and researching products and testing them on my skin to see what it needs. I read some major reviews on niacinamide from some very dedicated &amp;#34;skin charmers&amp;#34; (my term) and have even tried concocting my own &amp;#34;potions&amp;#34; which have been rather effective but have cost me a lot of time and effort....&lt;br /&gt;So, in an effort to repair my skin and lessen my time usage I am now on an effective product quest!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been cleaning my skin surface with the RoC cleansing discs and using dermarolling to transform my skin under the dermis then using several surface products to renew my skin. When I read that the new finding is for niacinamide 5% for cell renewal, anti-inflammatory, hydration, skin surface repair etc I went on a perfect product search/quest where it incorporates the ingredients needed for effective skin transformation and... voila...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...then I came across InstaNatural products and I am truly impressed. Everything the &amp;#34;skin charmers&amp;#34; have been using and recommend is in this 5% Niacinamide cream and it is spectacularly creamy and absorbs right away into the skin.  I already knew what needed to be in the niacinamide 5% for my skin and this product has it all for a very nice price. I can actually feel the changes under the skin surface and the surface where it is like orange peel skin shows some leveling in just 4 days/twice a day use so am quite sure I have found a product that I will be using for effective skin repair and maintenance. The changes have been very noticeable and dramatic at my deep smile corners - exactly where I needed the changes most! And my uneven skin coloring seems to be resolving as well. Just remember that every skin has different needs and finding its need is the key to skin recovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin care goal is to find products that incorporate all of the items I have been using so that I am not spending so much time on my skin cleaning/repair regimen. I may have just found the product line to accomplish this!  The cream is easily dispensed and I used 2-3 pea-sized squirts for both my face and neck. Rolls on smooth, slight stickiness until it fully absorbs in and no odor. I use fingertip action to work in the product into my deep/problem areas etc. After it is absorbed I use a VitE cream to cover. No greasiness or burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am not easily impressed with products so I read all of the reviews before I purchase and decided this was worth the risk of investment. Add the money back guarantee and it is worth a try. I wont be returning this product for sure and I have now purchased their VitC and Rose Hip product - I already have a VitC but am so impressed with the InstaNatural product and am willing to see if its better than what I have been using. The Rose Hip will be a new adventure for me.  I am excited about this company and its products.the changes under the skin surface and the surface where it is like orange peel skin shows some leveling in just 4 days/twice a day use so am quite sure I have found a product that I will be using for effective skin repair and maintenance.

    <li> I am a 26 year old man and have had moderate to severe acne for 13 years now.  Throughout this time period, I have struggled to keep my skin clear and have used a variety of different OTC and prescription products.  Many of them were extremely irritating and probably contributed to more breakouts.  I have kept my skin fairly clear the past few years by using a daily regimen of Benzoyl Peroxide and 10% AHA.  This has worked remarkably well but I still wasn&#x27;t entirely satisfied for a variety of reasons.  My skin tone was still a bit poor from Benzoyl Peroxide and I wasn&#x27;t getting any antioxidants in my skin which I have read are also great for breakouts.  Also, I was never completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had always heard that topical vitamin b3 aka Niacinamide is great for acne prone skin.  I have tried a few other Niacinamide containing creams and they have all disappointed.  Many were costly and didn&#x27;t provide a large enough size and others irritated my skin.  I came across this product and decided to give it a try for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Reasonable Price&lt;br /&gt;2. Reasonable Size&lt;br /&gt;3. Nice ingredients list including Aloe Vera, Vitamin E, and of course Niacinamide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now been over 3 weeks of morning and night use and I am very satisfied with the product.  My blotchy skin tone is definitely looking more even and the few pimples that I have had were smaller and less inflamed.  While this product will probably not clear your acne by itself, it is definitely a nice addition in a skin care routine that already contains Benzoyl Peroxide.  It will kind of offset the damage that Benzoyl Peroxide does in my opinion and keeps your skin looking young and fresh.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this serum long enough to know what kind of results I&#x27;ll ultimately get.  InstaNatural didn&#x27;t keep me waiting long for it; the product was packed beautifully and delivered quickly.  For now I can say that it has a lovely, velvety consistency that feels good going on and absorbs quickly.  It is packaged professionally in a cobalt glass bottle with a measured pump, which looks lovely and protects the serum from air, light, and contamination. There have been zero problems.  I have sensitive skin and lots of allergies, so I often get some kind of reaction from a new product, but this has been smooth sailing from the start.  So I&#x27;ll use it faithfully every day and night and update this review when I can tell it has worked its magic.  I&#x27;m confident, and very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  Thought so much of it I bought another and will be back for more...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product for a week, but am noticing that my skin looks firmer and has a nicer &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product is totally worth it!! It makes my face look and feel smoother, more hydrated and it also helps clear my acne!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it morning and night. A little goes a long way. My skin looks great. B3 was recommended by my dermatologist. This product is much more reasonable that his and has the same 5% strength.</li>
    <li> The serum is nice and light.  It did take awhile to rub completely into my facial skin. Larger container than a 1 oz. size, so it should last awhile and I like the pump dispenser. I purchased it because I have read niacinamide is supposed to help reduce skin redness, and this stuff also mentioned helping with enlarged pores, of which I have many.  I use it at night after cleansing my face and sometimes it does make my face kind of red looking after initial application, but it fades out over time and is gone by morning.  Sometimes, my face does feel a little greasy in the morning, but this may be due to my own facial skin oil, as I still have somewhat oily skin even in my early 60&#x27;s. As for the large pores, I&#x27;ve seen no noticeable long term improvement yet, and not sure there is much one can do for enlarged pores if one is genetically predisposed to them and had an oily complexion most of their life.  Oh well, a gal can hope!  Would I purchase again?...yeah, maybe.</li>
    <li> I love how soft it leaves my face. it is an awesome product</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want better skin using natural and harmless products?! I like using this niacinamide daily.  It gives my skin a healthy boost and glow. Not sticky at all and feels light and wonderful and absorbed into skin quickly.</li>
    <li> Out of all the serums I&#x27;ve tried, this one is a definite keeper and re-order. Really brightens and smoothes the face.</li>
    <li> Great product, really brings the spa experience home</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 2 weeks and it&#x27;s a bit early to definitively say this product works...but I can certainly say that my acne has improved over the last couple of weeks (and no new breakouts).  I like it so far and hope to see continued improvements.  Hope to update this rating with one more star after a few months use.</li>
    <li> It made my skin smoother and more supple. I can definitely feel that my skin loves this! Im so happy i was able to get a discount coupon to try it. I will repurchase when i ran out</li>
    <li> I love all the other products I&#x27;ve purchased from this company but this product made me itchy so I gave it to my mother in law, but she loves it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks, and I like it. I feel how my skin is changing. It is softer than before. It doesn&#x27;t make break out and I can see that some dark spots are lightening up. I do recommend this product and will def buy again.</li>
    <li> I have areas on the high points of my cheeks that gets really red periodically and appear inflamed. This cream has really helped with that so needless to say, I am very grateful that I got to try this product. It really works wonders on the splotchy spots on my face. I get very frustrated when my skin goes crazy and either breaks out or goes splotchy and develops inflamed spots. This cream has been a life saver - &#x27;coz I don&#x27;t have to rely on makeup/foundation to hide my imperfections/breakouts all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free - for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I love a good moisturizer, especially those with bonuses like Vitamin B3. Which is why I was supper excited to try the Niacinamide (VitaminB3) Moisturizer Cream by InstaNatural. Whats great about this product is for one it can be used by all skin types. Also that you can use for normal, dry, oily and sensitive skin. (Mine is usually all over the place, sometimes its dry, other times its  oily &amp; then theres times where my skin is picky by being sensitive.) This formula is also lightweight so it will absorb quickly. Plus with daily moisture you will help your body achieve your youthful appearance. On top of that your skin will thank you for the clear, smoother and brighter skin!&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product is because its overall a great moisturizer. With use it will help fight off acne, brightens, helps with hyperqigmentation, firms and plums your skin. Thats not it either, this company has a line of products that I can’t wait to try!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s making a difference.</li>
    <li> Using this in conjunction with Snail Cream and after one month, I see a difference in the smoothness of my skin.</li>
    <li> the bottom with dark glass is good for serum, one drop is good for one hand, I mix 2 drops with day cream easily, I am interested in some drops with my face mask for night time. thank you</li>
    <li> Great results. Fast shipping. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great product. Helps moisturize my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and light!</li>
    <li> After 1 use: My skin was noticeably soft and smooth. It left an all over even tone to my skin without a heavy or greasy feel, although it is a little sticky feeling when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 week:  I noticed that skin under my eyes appeared a little brighter. My skin was noticeably soft, even after washing my face. My skin tone was still even after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks: My skin is still feeling soft all day long and my dark circles are definitely less dark! Even with just using just a teeny bit of product each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks: The difference is visible. I am not talking about looking ten years younger. The results that I am seeing are clearer, smoother, and healthier looking skin on my face. The dark spots are not standing out as drastically and there is a nice healthy glow to my skin.</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  took at least 5 years off my face in only 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> My mother is always telling me I need to moisturize my face. Not just in the summer but always. I never do it, and then I wonder why it becomes dry. I always thought it was a hassle to add putting on cream to my morning and night routine.&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) serum is well tolerated by all skin types! • Can be used on normal, dry, oily and sensitive skin. • Lightweight formula that gets absorbed quickly. • Achieve a youthful appearance. • Gain clear, smoother and brighter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Great for moisturizing the skin naturally 2) Has acne fighting ingredients 3) Skin lightening benefits 4) Firms &amp; Plumps the skin 5) Helpful for Hyperpigmentation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that using this product is very easy. I like how vibrant the bottle looks, and it stands out in the bathroom so I always remember to wear it. It doesn&#x27;t leave any visible cream on my face after I use it and my skin looks a lot more clear. I have been happy with all of the InstaNatural products I have tried in the past, and I can add this to the bundle.</li>
    <li> I like this serum.  I believe it might be improving the appearance of my skin, and it feels nice on my skin.  No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> I am again very impressed with an InstaNatural product. I&#x27;ve been using this serum over the Vitamin C, and recently by itself after toning since I ran out of the Vitamin C, and first off I LOVE the texture! It hydrates beautifully and especially if you refrigerate it, it noticeably reduces redness. I&#x27;ve noticed that if I do get a breakout occasionally, this serum makes it less noticeable and heals it faster without a scar. I think it is also improving my past acne scars. I recommend this product for any routine, it absorbs quickly and feels so luxurious.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I use it as moisturizer and have been very pleased with the results.  It does seem to diminish fine lines and helps fade any discolorations and I feel as though I&#x27;m doing something healthy for my skin. I was just disappointed that when I tried to bounce mine off my tile bathroom floor...it didn&#x27;t bounce. ;)  I am back to buy more!</li>
    <li> I have just been using it for a short time but I like how my skin feels and looks.  Good purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a great moiturizing cream with lots of perks! It isn&#x27;t greasy or oily and rubs in quickly can be used on all skin types. My skin feels softer, the pores on my nose are less visible and it helped fade dark spots! I love creams that help with more than one problem! I am happy to be given the opportunity to review this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been starting to notice a little hyperpigmentation happening so this product was a must have for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and I definitely notice a difference in the texture of my skin because it is very moisturizing! I love the way it feels going on and I love the way it feels after it dries. I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to the consistency and feel of products and this Ista Natural B3 serum definitely passes the test. I have a few acne scars as well that aren&#x27;t very old and I am starting to see them fade a little faster than they normally do with my other products. For that reason alone I think this product is amazing! I&#x27;m very pleased, love the company and their natural products!</li>
    <li> Great value and the skin certainly looks and feels improved.  It is very possible that if it is used every day it will save you from getting a photo facial for dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent follow up by the company.</li>
    <li> great product/service--goes into the skin quickly and no stickiness at all--will reorder</li>
    <li> This has been crucial in helping me with my rosacea.  Excellent product, quick service!</li>
    <li> This is a really easy to use product! It left my skin feeling healthy and smooth. It also has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face kind of greasy and tacky feeling I&#x27;m going to start using it as a night serum to see if that works better and I will update my review in a couple of weeks of anything has changed</li>
    <li> i bought this crap because I have dry skin. Instead it made my face burn and I eventually broke out in pimples because of this. I asked the seller to send me a return label which they agreed to. However I never got anything. It&#x27;s a bs product don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
