<li> I use them to push back my cuticles, and remove still wet polish from my skin.</li>
<li> As other reviewers noted this &amp;#34;model&amp;#34; has two flat ends, so if you want a pointed end you should order something else.</li>

    <li> Use these in connection with my hobby, quilt-making.  They are great for turning down seam allowance on small applique pieces.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, product was as described</li>

    <li> Incredible price, they work just the same as the expensive ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, I received two packs of the crappy orange wood sticks that have pointed on one end and oval on the other end. I specifically ordered what your photo showed and waited 2 weeks for theses frayed splintery sticks. Not happy.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely and securely.</li>
    <li> I recommend this item because its functional in maintaining cuticles for hands and feet. What else can be said about this product well let me think, oh...you can keep it clean by soaking in bleach ( not much only a teaspoon) and plain soap with 4-6 cups of water for a few minutes, then rinse thoroughly. Ready to use again!</li>
    <li> I love using orange wood sticks when doing my nails. They are delicate on the nails yet sturdy enough to clean the nails. They are cheap and disposable which is nice for a quick clean up.</li>
    <li> I was expecting them to be shorter, but these are 7&amp;#34; long. Still, they are very good deal. I&#x27;d buy them again, but this should be enough to last my lifetime.</li>
    <li> These are very sturdy. Usually after one manicure the ends of my orange sticks are mushy and misshapen. I&#x27;ve used one now 4 or 5 times and it looks brand new. At this rate I&#x27;ll have enough to last a lifetime. I think I&#x27;ll give some away!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly they&#x27;re pretty long! Couldn&#x27;t be any less than what I could&#x27;ve asked for. They also are very sturdy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> How wonderful to not have to search for a stick!! I keep them in three different places and always have a fresh stick for my hands and feet. Well priced - every thing an orangewood stick should be</li>
    <li> I use these to remove cuticle and shellac. I don&#x27;t use my metal cuticle pusher anymore. These work better and more gentle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with them, sturdy and they don&#x27;t splinter. I use them to push back my cuticles, and remove still wet polish from my skin.</li>
    <li> Great quality manicure sticks, for the price I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expected but I am very pleased.  As other reviewers noted this &amp;#34;model&amp;#34; has two flat ends, so if you want a pointed end you should order something else.</li>
    <li> If you need a lot of orange wood sticks, for whatever purpose, this is the set for you. What a deal.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about these.  They are orangewood sticks, and are pretty perfect for cuticle care.  My only complaint is that both ends were designed as cuticle pushers.  The other ones I have had a pointed side for cleaning under the nail.  I can use a corner of the cuticle-pushing end for this purpose, so it isn&#x27;t the end of the world, but if you are looking for a pointed end, just know that these don&#x27;t have one.</li>
    <li> Good size package of orangewood sticks to maintain your manicure.  They work great and there are enough of them that you can use them for years!</li>
    <li> They work good. These just don&#x27;t have a point on one end.  Both ends are flat. Would be better for me that way.</li>
    <li> Nothing was broken and that is a positive. I just wish it would of been padded just a little better. I use these to clean up after nail art work. I would buy again great product.</li>
