    <li> Perfect and shipping very fast. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The only brand I use!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find roll-on deodorant at my local shops. It&#x27;s wonderful to have a source of my favorite.</li>
    <li> We bought some of this whilst in the US for the New York Marathon and found it really excellent, so that our normal range we had used in Australia did not stack up, so it was worth importing it.</li>
    <li> Not sure why Secret ROLL-ON&#x27;s have disappeared (especially Unscented) from the store shelves, but glad to have found it here.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and strong BO, not a good combination. I also don&#x27;t like gels or the white solid kinds, so I have trouble finding deodorant I like. This is the best of any I&#x27;ve tried, excellent for dryness and odor and lasts me all day. I use gentler and less-effective stuff on the weekends to give my skin a break, but can wear this every weekday with no problems.</li>
    <li> This is a good roll on, and it does work well.  Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find it at a store.</li>
    <li> Have used for quite a while, always pleased. Will continue to purchase this product in the future. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This deodorant always makes me feel fresh and clean. It is reasonably priced and I always order extra so that I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Roll on deodorants are very hard to find in stores locally. This package will last me for years. Very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> Because I had breast cancer I can only use a roll-on deodorant.  Secret has the best I have been able to find. Too bad I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Received one that broke and leaked</li>
    <li> Secret roll on has been difficult to find in most grocery stores in the area.  This was so convenient to get.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these locally and I really like to use this roll on Secret deodorant.</li>
    <li> Great! I am a fan of this product and have been unable to find it in stores.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant I can use because it doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash. I hope they make it forever!</li>
