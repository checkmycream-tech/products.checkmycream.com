<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good quality.  Very pretty.</li>
    <li> I wore this on my wedding day! I was thrilled with it. It&#x27;s on the smaller side--which is perfect because I didn&#x27;t want an overwhelming size for a tiara. The quality is great, and I am so happy that I chose this one!</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister wedding she look really beautiful</li>
    <li> This tiara was purchased for my daughters pageant. We haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it is gorgeous and lightweight w hooks on e ends to clip into hair w pins. Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter to wear in a wedding and it is perfect for her.  It is a very beautiful tiara and came packaged perfectly.</li>
    <li> This tiara is so much nicer that the plastic cheap ones.&lt;br /&gt;We don&#x27;t know what it is with the young girls these days but they&lt;br /&gt;seem to be wearing tiaras almost everyday.  We hope they&lt;br /&gt;grow up to be the wonderful mother princesses some day.</li>
    <li> This is the same kind of tiara you can get at any bridal shop but for a fraction of the cost. Good quality, good weight, and absolutely dazzling. I love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Oscar party Red Carpet winner.  Not too big and fits nicely on someone who already has a hairdo.  Might be a little too petite for someone looking for a real princess type crown.</li>
    <li> The ultimate gift for girls.  I order them by the half dozen and keep them on hand for birthday parties.  I recommend the headband for girls since they can never figure out the comb style tiara&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was excellent quality!!  I would highly recommend this company to others.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful, inexpensive, and shipping was great....this will make a wonderful accessory on my wedding day....cheap way to have a head piece</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this the moment I opened my package!!! This is a great buy for any bride to be!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great tiara option. Photos don&#x27;t do it justice. My main issue is the means to secure it. Wish this had built-in combs. As the reception went on, it kept going crooked. We kept trying more ways, but that didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> I only had a week before my wedding and realized I did not have my Tiara for my ceremony.  I located this item on Amazon, read the info about the product and made the purchase.  It arrived faster than indicated and was absolutely beautiful.  I looked at other tiaras at the store for about the same price. They were plastic whereas this one was made of a very sturdy metal and polished.  If you need a quality purchase, I recommend this seller to anyone.    Thanks for making my dream day truly beautiful!    Jennifer</li>
    <li> The tiara is very beautiful. It is about an inch tall and is very small, which is exactly what I wanted, but if you are looking for something large and showy, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again. I knew there would be trouble when I opened the package and discovered a crystal laying in the bottom of the plastic. As I opened, more kept falling out, and I had to superglue them in. I noticed that I never found one of them. However, it did not make much difference; you could not tell from afar, and it is much less expensive than the ones you would find at a bridal store, so I can&#x27;t complain too loudly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tiara itself seems quite sturdy and not likely to bend or break easily. If you can handle the crystals falling out, and you like  a small tiara, this may be right for you.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a girlfriend that is getting married next month, and she absolutely loves it!!! Shes going to wear it for her bachlorette party, her dress rehearsals, and possibly on her wedding day if it doesn&#x27;t clash with her dress. For the price, its very nicely made. Its small so its not obnoxious or gaudy. I think its perfect for someone to be a princess for a day... :)</li>
    <li> As always the  picture makes  it look bigger and less obviously plasticy than it is, but it should do fine for one night on the town.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!!! SMALL ENOUGH TO NOT OVERPOWER ANY HAIRDO!!! AM SO HAPPY WITH IT AND CANT WAIT TO WEAR IT FOR MY WEDDING IN OCTOBER!</li>
    <li> One of the stones had fallen out but it was easily glued back in and stayed. I wish it would have had combs on the side bc it kept falling out. Overall was great though.</li>
    <li> I am so excited to wear this on my wedding day. I just got my veil and putting them together makes it looks so awesome.</li>
    <li> I wore this with my veil.  This was soooo cute.  Perfect for my wedding!  Had a do-it yourself wedding and reception.  Amazon was awesome for finding everything I needed at the right price.  Picture perfect.  No disappointment.  This was an awesome touch for my dream wedding and reception!!!  The delivery was awesome and fast.  Just perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friends 3 year old daughter and she loves it. She can really play princess now!</li>
    <li> I wore this for my quince &amp; I flipped it upside down and wore it on my forehead and it was perfect! It was a great compliment :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this tiara for my wedding, and it was exactly what I expected from the description.  It has a great sparkle to it, which is what I was looking for.  It was easy to find wedding jewelry to match the tiara.  It&#x27;s lightweight, yet durable, and doesn&#x27;t sit too high off your head.  It stayed in place through all of the hugs and dancing throughout the night.  It looks way more expensive than it actually is.  I would definitely recommend it to other brides!    &lt;&lt;Footnote&gt;&gt;  1 year later, and the \\&quot;silver\\&quot; on this tiara is tarnished.  If you&#x27;re looking for a tiara that can be used for more than your wedding day, be warned that the silver will tarnish.  You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Jewels fall out pretty easy.  Kids love it though.</li>
    <li> I bought this to wear for my bridals and at my reception, it is soo simply beautiful! Exactly what I wanted and absolutely lovely!</li>
    <li> I like it. You have to be careful handling it as the stones fall out easily.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Fits great, doesn&#x27;t fall off my head and came in a plastic case that I will use to keep it stored in!  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I saw this and realized that it would be perfect for my wedding. I ordered it and it arrived sooner than I expected it to, which was totally amazing! ^_^ Now I&#x27;m even more excited for my big day because I have this perfect icing on the cake. It fits and it&#x27;s flexible so you can modify it. It&#x27;s easy to secure, and it sparkles like a dream. I highly suggest this piece for any bride to be! ^_^</li>
    <li> I bought this for a jr bridesmaid to wear but she was a teenager so tiara would fit an adult. Tiara is beautiful.  Very happy with the quality and sparkle.  It fits pretty well around head  with the band it comes on but it does not come with the little combs. You may want to buy little hairpins or bobbypins to hold down tighter. Also loved the price. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Was a wonderful addition to my wedding. Would recomend this item to anyone for prom, wedding, home comming, barn warming.</li>
    <li> This was an ok type of tiara. It was glittery and beautiful, but had loops on the side (i&#x27;m guessing for a veil). I was able to hide them in my daughters hair, but if she had worn her hair up it would have looked funny.</li>
    <li> Wore this tiara for my son&#x27;s First Birthday party!!! It looked so beautiful!!! It was very durable and stable!! Stayed in place the whole time!! Definitely high quality for the price!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely gorgeous and perfect for my nieces sweet 16. Thank you</li>
    <li> My flower girl and I looked at some tiaras on Amazon. Together we chose this one. At first I was hesitant to purchase it because I didn&#x27;t know if I loved it. I thought for the price that I could maybe find something better at Charming Charlies. The tiara arrived the other day and it is gorgeous!!! I LOVE IT! I did not want to wear a tiara at my wedding, but I almost considered keeping it for myself!</li>
    <li> This book is inspirational, exciting, and heartwarming.The best part is that it&#x27;s true! The author is so descriptive that you can picture yourself in the situation, a truly talented  writer. A must read!</li>
    <li> It was very pretty and sparkly.  The ends of the headband were a little too tight and hurt my head after 45 minutes or so. I wore it for my 30th anniversary Vow Renewal Ceremony.</li>
    <li> I bought this crown for my daughter (with the sensitive head) to wear as a flower girl. We curled her hair and it was adorable. Our only complaint was that it did not include the headband and it was a bit of a challenge to pin down. Regardless it was a good buy and she received plenty of compliments.</li>
    <li> This Tiara is very high quality.. Beautiful and was perfect !!  Super great price and wonderful quality!! :) I loved that it didnt have any combs to get stuck in your head and the size is great.. not super big but not super small didnt fall off at all even when dancing..</li>
    <li> This was beautiful.  Bought it for my niece for Christmas.  Some of the stones fell out by April.</li>
    <li> My flower girls were so thrilled with this tiara.  I ordered it because it was just the right height that it wouldn&#x27;t look ridiculous and it was inexpensive.  The tiara is really great quality and the metal feels sturdy.  The moms of the flower girls were surprised that I would spend so much on this tiara, but I really didn&#x27;t!  There is no comb at the ends, so it kinda just sits on the girls&#x27; heads, which really didn&#x27;t seem to be an issue at all.  Excellent purchase!!</li>
    <li> Super cut and was perfect for my daughters sweet 16.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect tiarra, not to big, not just a thin line of rhinestones, delicate and very pretty. perfect for the bride to be or even veil.</li>
    <li> Just received this today. It&#x27;s beautiful. Definitely looks more expensive than what it is! I gave it 4 stars because it does sort of look odd on my head, but who knows, maybe on prom day it&#x27;ll look better with an updo!</li>
    <li> Just the right size for my chief flower girl I loved it! But more importantly she loved it and she kept it on all day as it was really comfortable!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece for play, and was surprised by the quality. For not much more than a plastic tiara she gets something a lot more like a \\&quot;real\\&quot; princess. Honestly, if you are an adult looking for a tiara this one is worth a try. It is probably the same as a bridal store but without the markup.</li>
    <li> Did not like this item. It was too heavy and did not come w a way to attach a veil or a comb wld had to try and Bobbi pin it.. Again I didn&#x27;t wear and will b trying to sell in yard sale due to return shipping fees</li>
    <li> This is beautiful I bought it for my daughter to wear to her father daughter dance. It&#x27;s worth the money I would have paid more for it wished it came in a better storage box though</li>
    <li> My tiara arrived when I was told it would, and was in a small plastic box that kept it protected during shipping.  I only wore it one night for about 4 hours, but it held up well.  I haven&#x27;t had any stones fall out, and it&#x27;s actually pretty cute.  Not real tall, so if you&#x27;re looking for something with a lot of height I&#x27;d choose something else.  I&#x27;m an adult, but have a smaller head.  I was able to bend this to fit without any problem.  I added a couple of bobby pins to hold it in place.  It suited my purposes very well.</li>
    <li> Perfect for our daughters wedding, she has always been our princess and this made her feel like one, beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is more beautiful than I thought I  love it</li>
    <li> Very nice quality for the price.  Used it for friend&#x27;s bachelorette party.  Definitely could reuse - not cheap/flimsy tiara that you toss after one use.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so amazing .. looked like a queen on my wedding day .. got a lot of complements .. glad I have it</li>
    <li> got for my oldest shes in love with it</li>
    <li> Very Pretty, I would have gave it more stars if the crystals where glued on correctly. Most were off center and a few way off center and probably fell off by now. I got it for my granddaughter, she liked it. Because it&#x27;s metal it should last her awhile.</li>
    <li> Very elegant for the occasion I got it for my daughter for her wedding its  worth every dollar it&#x27;s  very  pretty</li>
    <li> This is absolutely beautiful! i bought this for my mini bride to wear for my wedding and now im contemplating wearing it myself.&lt;br /&gt;It is stunningly beautiful for this price.</li>
    <li> Is just beautiful! I got one for me and one for my flower girl as well for a gift. Very elegant and does not appear as big as it does in picture so just perfect.</li>
    <li> She loved it. That is what counts.</li>
    <li> I wore this on my wedding day.  It was exactly what I wanted.  If you look really close you can see that it&#x27;s not super high quality, but it looked gorgeous.  Definitely happy with my purchase and I would recommend this to any other bride who doesn&#x27;t want to pay the outrageous price for a tiara from a bridal shop.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this tiara. bought for my wedding and it looked amazing. i would buy this product for my daughter as well</li>
    <li> Very dainty and very beautiful. Perfect for a flower girl.</li>
    <li> Perfect for any lady that wants to feel like a princess on her wedding,or any other special occasion. It&#x27;s not over the top either, its very subtle, I wore at my wedding with my hair down and curled, my stylist pinned it in my hair and I was worried it would fall out by the end of the night but it stayed in place!!Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Very good for the price, thanks</li>
    <li> Very pretty but broke on one side after being worn several hours. I actually bought this for my 8 year old daughter to wear during her birthday party. So, she was playing and such with it on, although she&#x27;s not a very rough child.</li>
    <li> my wife like it  very nice stuff</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous for the price! Better than I was expecting!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my neice she loves it. It is of good quality . It to her 10 year old head perfectly. Very happy.</li>
    <li> We bought this for a princess tea party. It is really sturdy and not at all like the ones you&#x27;d find at a big box store. But if you are wanting to use it on a small child&#x27;s head note that it may crack if bent too far. Our daughter was 2 and we did crack the decorative wire part trying to adjust it to fit her small head. It isn&#x27;t noticeable unless you know where to look for it. I had assumed it would be as flexible (read thin) as the ones in the stores, it isn&#x27;t. This is really a great tiara. My older daughters have even requested similar ones for their birthdays.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a fun ovine special 85 year old for her birthday. She loved it and so did everyone else!</li>
    <li> The tiara is very pretty but it&#x27;s small height wise and it gets lost in my curly hair.  This would be perfect for a child or someone who has very straight hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried it on and it is so pretty. It will look perfect with my elbow length veil hanging down in the back. I can&#x27;t wait to see people&#x27;s faces when I walk down the aisle.</li>
    <li> I cannot wait to wear this at my wedding. It is beautiful, shines, and is the perfect accessory to add a little highlight without taking attention away from my dress.</li>
    <li> Initially seemed to be much higher quality than it really was. They need to have stronger glue attaching the crystals. With 2 days of wearing it for a pretty low key bachelorette, 3 stones had fallen off.</li>
    <li> I bought the tiara as a birthday present for a friend, and she adores it. The decorated tiara is very small, maybe smaller than expected, but gives a very dainty and elegant look. The metal is very sturdy, but flexible enough to adjust, and the crystals sparkle wonderfully. The tiara is overall excellent with a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Wore for my 25th Bday! Adorable. Not to heavy and well made</li>
    <li> My 6 yr old wanted a new tiara since her cheaper one kept breaking(and I had to keep glueing).  This one is fantastic.  Very sturdy metal and the sparkles are beautiful.  She&#x27;s a rough and tumble girl but the tiara is holding up great.  2 weeks now and she wears it every day.  Almost everyone comments on how nice it is. Metal bends a little so you can size it a bit.</li>
    <li> Beautiful crown for our beautiful princess</li>
    <li> I planned my best friend&#x27;s bachelorette party, and this was more than amazing!!  The quality was phenomenal, and the price was great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Tiara first for my grand-niece from SPARKLY CRYSTAL - it is a beautiful inexpensive piece and she was in love with it!  This topped off a formal dress, gloves and shoes to make her a princess this Christmas!  Great product.  If you are purchasing this or another style for a little girl, be aware that some of these come with hair combs (not this one) that would hold a tiara on for someone with &amp;#34;big hair&amp;#34;.  I got another style from Sparkly Crystal for another niece and the hair combs hurt her head.  It&#x27;s no problem just to take some wire snips and remove the combs, but might be better not to buy the combs for those with tender heads.</li>
    <li> This little tiara made me a believer. I never thought I would wear the whole gown and veil setup for my wedding, but I did, and this tiara was absolutely perfect for me! I have very straight hair, and wore a simple updo, so I did not have &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; hair (take note, as those who have bigger hairdos might feel this little tiara does not make enough of a statement, as it is on the small side). This was worn with an elbow length, beaded edge veil. It was beautiful and my hairdresser had no issues working it into my hairdo on my wedding day. I will pass this down to my daughters for their weddings someday, along with my veil and dress. It was absolutely lovely, just what I needed to complete the look, and priced right.</li>
    <li> very nice and a good price. Pretty, pretty, pretty.</li>
    <li> can be adjusted to your head but do it carefully, there is limited enough flexiblity .</li>
    <li> Beautiful!!! My 5 yr old wore it for our wedding and it was stunning on her.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that was going to look elegant for my wedding. This is perfect! It is not big and I got a matching one for my daughter. It looks great and was in great shape when it was shipped! Definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> This tiara was fantastic. Bought this for my grandmother, for her birthday in September... She hasn&#x27;t taken it off since! It&#x27;s very durable (I dropped it on accident) and beautiful. I highly recommend it. Also, very fairly priced.</li>
    <li> For the price, excellent product. I expected it to be cheap and plastic, but actual metal and substantial in weight, stayed attached very nicely, looked fabulous for my daughters prom.</li>
    <li> My girl loves playing princess with this. Be careful--she snapped it easily, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable. Will order this again!</li>
    <li> Got it for my wedding and it looks beautiful , resembles the one at Davids Bridal that cost $200. You&#x27;ll love  it. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and when I came up to the estimated date I should recieve it I got excited. The date went and passed and never received it. It&#x27;s almost a week past the date and when I tracked it I found it&#x27;s across the US. It left Sacramento (3 hrs away from me) and no here close to recieving !!! I&#x27;m so angry I will never buy from them again.</li>
    <li> bought it for my daughters wedding, she loved it, said it is well made.  They eloped in Vegas, haven&#x27;t seen it in person yet.</li>
    <li> This was really beautiful - I would seriously wear this to my wedding (not what I purchased it for).  It is that nice.  Great price/value and really good quality!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Looks great, good quality and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. perfect gift for girlfriend</li>
    <li> This Tiara was just as beautiful as I wanted it to be, and the shipping was so fast!! I am in love with my new tiara- its the first one I&#x27;ve ever owned and it truly does make me feel like a princess! Its so perfect. I even wear it to school sometimes just for fun.</li>
    <li> After lots of searching and careful contemplation, I chose this and another tiara for my friend and I to wear to celebrate our birthday. The product&#x27;s quality does not match its inexpensive price tag. The shipping packaging protected the item well (in a box instead of padded envelope). The tiara stayed put as well...my friend and I wore them while running the sideline chain crew at a high school football game. The tiaras didn&#x27;t budge. Perfect item for someone wanting to feel a little special for a day!</li>
    <li> just like advertised.  used it for a wedding combined with 1T 1 Tier Ribbon Edge Center Cascade Bridal Wedding Veil and it was an excelent combo.  wife looked great.  it had a nice expensive look to it.  would work for any type of Tiara event! Good Luck</li>
    <li> Really pretty. It might be a bit small for some, but I like it. It doesn&#x27;t protrude far above the head, so if you want something more conspicuous, you should probably look for something else. The holes at the ends are convenient for using hair clips with.</li>
    <li> I looked great in the wedding and stayed in my hair without any problems.  It was very functional as well as cute.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter to wear as a flower girl in a wedding and I must say it is very shiny and beautiful! And you can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price!!!</li>
    <li> Well made:  great quality for the price.  Here are review words eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two and one</li>
    <li> My friend was turning 50 something and confided in me that she had always wanted a sparkly tiara.  This one it the bill perfectly and she squealed when she opened it!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my niece and the quality of this tiara is great. I was afriad it was going to becheap looking and it wasnt at all</li>
    <li> My. GF loved it! I bought  a velvet lined box for it to go in since the &amp;#34;display case&amp;#34; is just a clear plastic package. great quality feels good, sits well to her taller head</li>
    <li> Fits well. Purchased for my wedding couldnt see spending alot on an item i would wear once but also wanted it to look great. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> We were looking for a crown/tiara to go with my teen-age daughter&#x27;s Irish Step dress.She was so excited when she saw it! It is beautiful and fits well. It is not bulky and is elegant. My daughter likes the way it uses bobby pins instead of hair combs so it is easier to put up in her hair. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this tiara for my grandma&#x27;s Diamond Anniversary. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect a high quality for the price BUT I was so wrong. When I unpacked it and held it in my hand to take a closer look, I was super excited that I got such a beautiful and high quality tiara for such a unbeatable price.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a few in stores for way more money and horrible quality. I&#x27;m so excited to surprise my grandma with it on her big day.&lt;br /&gt;So whoever gets married should get this one, because it&#x27;s stunning and simply beautiful!</li>
