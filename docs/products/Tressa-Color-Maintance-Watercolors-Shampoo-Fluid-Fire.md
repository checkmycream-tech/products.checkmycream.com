      <li>Thanks for a good product!!!</li>
      <li>So far it seems to be working great!</li>
      <li>Tressa Watercolors Shampoo in Warm Spice is better than Clairol Shimmer Lights (Gold).  </li>
      <li>This shampoo was one of the best i&#x27;ve ever used, as far as color depositing shampoos go.</li>
      <li>Love love love!</li>
      <li>Amazing color, bright and intense,</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>my stylist used (and believe me we&#x27;ve tried most of them).</li>
      <li>so the shipping could have been better.</li>
      <li>I am sure with repeated use</li>
      <li>In addition, no nasty smell!</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>but once I was able to add my smoothing  products and blowdry I was able to get rid of the dryness.</li>
      <li>It was noticeably softer and more manageable.</li>
      <li>I waited three or more days to wash my hair, and I used this product.</li>
      <li>I switched to the copper fire for a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look.</li>
      <li>and I love how it works.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job as a conditioner but doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot for enhancing the color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it will wash out eventually</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this shade but the shampoo itself is ok.</li>
      <li>Love Love Love this Shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I use John Frieda Riveting Reds conditioner when I wash.</li>
      <li>Best red enhancing shampoo I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried just about all of them!</li>
      <li>I do use Watercolors Molten Bronze for more of a coppery color sometimes too</li>
      <li>This is okay.</li>
      <li>I love Tressa products.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo</li>
      <li>Leave on for 15-20mins, rinse, condition for 5 and enjoy bright, rich results for almost a month.</li>
      <li>Great product, keeps my hair color vibrant.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be great for natural reds as well.</li>
      <li>Luckily she liked them.</li>
      <li>I purchased this shampoo along with Daviness conditioner for red hair but it works great on its own.</li>
      <li>Kept my red hair on for a while just wish it didn&#x27;t stained my bath tub so much good product though!</li>
      <li>I have used other brands, but this one performs best for me.</li>
      <li>Because of this, my color washes out very quickly, about two weeks after getting it done</li>
      <li>You could easily wear gloves while applying the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is not greasy or sticky - and can be easily cleaned off of clothing.</li>
      <li>Brilliant red color keeps my hair looking fresh out the salon!</li>
      <li>- Yes, this shampoo did a fine job cleaning my hair.  </li>
      <li>This product is great for maintaining hair color - especially reds and brighter colors.</li>
      <li>The tressa Watercolors shampoos are fantastic.</li>
      <li>but then I saw that is was available with Prime</li>
      <li>This product is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately it does wash out in 1-2 washes.</li>
      <li>Works great on my hair, which is brunette with a red undertone.</li>
      <li>so use it lightly.  </li>
      <li>So it will stain light colored towels and showers.</li>
      <li>My hair gets soft, shiny and otherwise gorgeous with this product.</li>
      <li>In fact, if my hair didn&#x27;t grow so fast I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d be able to go months without needed a color touch up.</li>
      <li>My stylist is wowed that my hair has kept its beautiful magenta color for so long!</li>
      <li>I then added the shampoo which gave me a great lather because my hair was clean, i left it in for 5 minutes, I repeated the shampoo</li>
      <li>Just normal stuff with this kind of shampoo.</li>
      <li>(doesn&#x27;t clean well, make it shiny, etc), so I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
      <li>I just ran out of (also purchased from Amazon), so I ended up having to use another shampoo after this one just for my hair to feel clean.</li>
      <li>This is definitely more magenta than warm red!</li>
      <li>It works well as a shampoo, my hair feels perfectly clean.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love my brassy, fire engine red hair, so I am not looking for natural color. I love this shampoo.  Red is so hard to maintain. Using this regularly, I was able to put off coloring, while maintaining my deep, vibrant red much longer.  I typically use London Luxe Runway Red, because I love that &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34; red. I get compliments on that color more than any other I have used.  The Tressa Watercolors Fluid Fire helped me maintain my red for weeks longer.  It is very. very red and is likely to stain lighter colored towels.  Over time, it would probably stain grout.  One bottle lasted from June until September, so it was definitely worth the small investment. I did not find it to be drying.  It won&#x27;t change your color, but it deposits enough red to keep the color vibrant.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  My natural hair color is light brown but I dye it red.  Before discovering this shampoo I used to have to go back to the salon about every 5 weeks to maintain the red  because the color would wash out.  When I use this shampoo it adds color to my hair so I am able to go months without going back to the salon and dying my hair again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a new color-depositing shampoo since the Artek line (purchased by l&#x27;Oreal) was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For (fake) red hair, a color maintenance is mandatory if you do not want to go back to the salon every 3-4 weeks. So yes, this shampooo can seem a expensive for 8.5 oz but it&#x27;s really worth it: the color is bright and I feel like more is left behind after rinsing than with the Artek. In addition, no nasty smell! It&#x27;s actually quite inodore. With this shampoo, I only make it back to the salon due to roots regrowth, about every 7-8 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of the Tressa Fluid Fire goes a long way: it is bright red and clear and you only need about the size of an almond for long hair to get a nice thick lather. It also actually washes the hair better than Artek did (I had to pre-shampoo with something else before; not with the Tressa).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shade is recommended for light to medium red hair and a different color is available for darker shades of red: [[ASIN:B004LGWRC8 Tressa WaterColors Crimson Splash Shampoo - 8.5 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one thing to be careful about: the package says that it can stain acrylic nails. I have natural nails but my palms aree a bit red after using the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am recommending this shampoo and I will buy it again (same price here as I paid at my beauty store: anyone knows where to find it on sale?)</li>
    <li> Really puts the color back my dyed red locks</li>
    <li> I have color treated dark red hair, the undertone is true red, no violet base. My hair is also naturally curly and was previously highlighted, so pretty porous. I used this one time undiluted and it turned my natural-looking auburn hair an un-natural looking magenta tinged mess. It did not disperse evenly and gave my hair a purple-pink glow, especially in the light. I was pretty upset with the results and ended up having to do a &amp;#34;shampoo train&amp;#34; to get the pinky tone to wash out. Not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until after I read the ingredients that I realized that this has a blue coloring agent in it which is why it turned my hair from a copper base to a pink-violet base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be good for redheads with a violet/blue undertone, but not for those of us who like a more copper, natural red look.</li>
    <li> Works really well, actually deposits red into your hair, love it</li>
    <li> I have dyed red before but always felt cautious about it since it fades out so fast (esp. on my hair, since it has been bleached before).  I have used other \\&quot;color-care\\&quot; shampoo&#x27;s and products and this is the ONLY one that has maintained my red between salon visits.    I have very \\&quot;hot\\&quot; red highlights and deep red hair and this shampoo keeps my color vivid and fresh for at least 6-8 weeks, if not more.  In fact, when I went to see my stylist again after using for about 10 weeks, she said my hair was in better condition than last time, really shiny and soft -- and because I had bleached my hair before,the shampoo had \\&quot;filled in\\&quot; the hair to the point that my color actually took to my hair BETTER than the last time we processed.      One word of caution, it does indeed DEPOSIT color, so beware for your acrylic nails (even certain nail colors I&#x27;ve noticed soak in the red) as well, your bathtub grout can tend to take on a pink hue ;)    Those things aside, I would recommend this shampoo to anyone with mid to deep reds that need some color love &#x3D;) It&#x27;s A.M.A.zing!</li>
    <li> Good product and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> It is a hot pink! Do not expect red! Changed my golden blonde highlights within 5 minutes. I did put it on dry hair.</li>
    <li> Addicted to this stuff!  It is hard to find in the stores as they sell out so quickly.  I&#x27;m going to experiment with the other colors as well such as copper.  I use this over my [...] red hair.  I get complements on the color, even when I&#x27;m overdue for a touchup.</li>
    <li> Simply AMAZING! The orange color in my hair would not last for more than 2-3 washes no matter what hair dye product my stylist used (and believe me we&#x27;ve tried most of them). I tried this and it redyes my hair just enough every time I shampoo to maintain my hair color. I actually let my hair (which is over processed)-fade back to blonde and used this shampoo alone and it brought my hair color back to it original vibrancy in just a few washes!! I usually use the liquid copper for orange. This one was too red for me so I stopped using it but Tressa Watercolors shampoo is amazing!! This is a MUST HAVE if you want your color to last!!!</li>
    <li> Keeps hair so so vibrant and people constantly ask me how I keep my color from fading. This is the secret.</li>
    <li> I have faux red, red, red hair. This is the only shampoo that keeps it shiny and new.  As all redheads by choice know, it&#x27;s one hard color to keep up with. Definitely use this product. I would team up with a deep conditioner, to keep the hair healthy.</li>
    <li> Best color depositing system there is. I have natural ginger hair and it&#x27;s been fading as of late (going grey at 22...lucky me huh?). This shampoo gives me a vibrant color boost as well as tints my greys so you don&#x27;t notice them. My hair gets soft, shiny and otherwise gorgeous with this product. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> If you liked Artek you will not be disappointed. Fluid Fire is a bit more violet and intense red than Artek&#x27;s cherry bark. I love it and highly recommend it if you want some edge to your red.</li>
    <li> I am a natural redhead and also have some dyed red coloring in my hair. This is okay. I&#x27;ve used it several times, and I don&#x27;t really notice a &amp;#34;redder&amp;#34; or more vibrant difference. Scent isn&#x27;t anything amazing and it doesn&#x27;t do my hair any favors (doesn&#x27;t clean well, make it shiny, etc), so I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo. I pay a lot of money to keep my hair red.  Far far too much money.  This bottle of shampoo is a miracle product.  it is like getting a mini color in every shampoo. It makes my color last weeks and weeks and looks as fresh as when it was first colored.  It has discolored my grout a little, but nothing bleach doesn&#x27;t fix.  I let it sit on my hair for about 5 minutes every time I wash and that color lasts for days.  I ran out once and before I got a new bottle, it still kept my hair \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; for 2 more washes with regular shampoo    The seller I got this from on amazon sucks.  They finally shipped the item on the day it was supposed to arrive.  A week later it had still not arrived so I contacted them and was told it was sent to the wrong place?? They did send another which arrived priority mail in 2 days. They took forever and $5 to ship what I paid $8+ for expedited shipping.</li>
    <li> I have recently took the plunge and colored my dark brown hair a bright vibrant red and have had a love/hate relationship with it. Love the color, hate how fast it faded. This shampoo was recommended to me by my daughter and as long as I keep my hair red I&#x27;ll continue to use this. The consistency is a little weird, like a gel (think fake blood...eww) and it does leave my hair a bit tangled (but I have coarse curly hair) but it keeps my hair color vibrant. I used to have to color my entire head of hair when it was time for a retouch because it faded so much, but since using this shampoo I&#x27;ve only had to color the new growth. In fact, if my hair didn&#x27;t grow so fast I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d be able to go months without needed a color touch up. Wish they had an accompanying red tinted conditioner, but nevertheless, I&#x27;m a big fan of WaterColors!</li>
    <li> I have dyed red hair and I purchased this product to help keep my red hair red and vibrant.  I&#x27;m at the point where I need to redye my hair again but using this shampoo I can delay redying by few week. This shampoo really does help keep your red hair from dying. I purchased this shampoo along with Daviness conditioner for red hair but it works great on its own. The texture of the shampoo is more liquidy than any shampoo I had and the color is blood red, literally. I like the smell too but its not so strong so you can barely smell anything. I have been using this product for about a week and do not have any dislikes about it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with red hair&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE* after a month of use I definitely see my red hair more vibrant and brighter than it ever was, but... I hate the bottle it doesn&#x27;t close tightly and leaks little by little since its so liquidy.  That is the only downside to is so that is the reason  I starred down from 5 star to 4</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this Shampoo.  My Friend got me a bottle and if you have red hair it brightens the color and keeps it from fadeing out.  I get complements all the time about my hair and I will keep useing it.</li>
    <li> I have bright firey red hair, it borders between natural and unnatural red. Because of this, my color washes out very quickly, about two weeks after getting it done it&#x27;s already pretty faded. I don&#x27;t really mind, watching my hair change colors between salon visits is kinda fun and keeps me on my toes. I&#x27;m moving to a new city and I assume it will take me a while to find a good stylist so I asked my current one what I could do to keep my color bright. She recommended a color depositing shampoo and I found this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little expensive, the bottle is what I would call average size. The product is the color and consistency of fake blood. It is very slippery. I found it easiest to squirt a little in my hands and rub them together so none of the product would slip off my hand and be wasted down the drain. I started off with a quarter sized amount and added another quarter sized amount later. I have medium length hair, a few inches past my shoulders. I lathered for three minutes as the bottle suggested and then left it on for the rest of my shower before washing it out. I could definitely tell my hair absorbed the color, not much was left on my hands and there wasn&#x27;t much lather. Once I washed it out my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean so I used a bit of my normal shampoo to clean my roots (I never wash the tips of my hair, just the roots) then applied my normal conditioner. I have natural nails and it did stain the protein clear coat I had on, it would also probably stain lighter colored nail polishes so beware of that. You could easily wear gloves while applying the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was slightly enhanced, I probably washed a bit of it out when I shampooed afterwards. Next time I&#x27;m going to try shampooing my roots first then shampooing with Watercolors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is subtle but I&#x27;m sure over time it will extend the life of my color. The best part was how healthy my hair felt. It was noticeably softer and more manageable. Usually my hair tangles a bit when I dry it but it was very manageable, shiny and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall worth the money.</li>
    <li> I originally bought the Liquid Copper shade as I recently dyed my hair more of a copper red color. I was very happy with it, but I though my hair was turning a little too orange, so I thought I would try adding Fluid Fire to my regimen. I wear gloves when I apply this because it definitely stains my hands and nails. It does wash off hands pretty quickly, not nails so much. It also stains my tub and grout, but if I later clean the tub it comes right off, so that appears to be temporary, obviously it helps if you rinse off any excess right away.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely makes my hair a brighter red color, which is what I was looking for. I also use this in conjunction with Davines Alchemic Copper conditioner, and the combination seems to be keeping my hair nice and red.</li>
    <li> I use to order this from my hair dresser but then I saw that is was available with Prime so I ordered it here on Amazon.  Absolutely love this shampoo!  It keeps my red hair color lasting a lot longer between salon visits!  I use it about 2-3 times per week while using a different color safe shampoo on other days.  Be careful though as it will stain your towels.  I usually use a white towel and then bleach it.</li>
    <li> I was initially dying my hair red and using Crimson Splash, which I loved! Then my color seemed to be a little too pink and I wanted more of an orangy-red / fiery red. I ordered the Fluid Fire, but received Fluid Copper by mistake. As Fall is approaching, I changed my color to medium brown. Around the same time, I informed the seller of the mistake, and they IMMEDIATELY wanted to remedy the situation.  Not only did they send me a return bag and label for the Fluid Copper, but they also sent me another Tressa Watercolors Shampoo in Cocoa, to replace the one I ordered.  I couldn&#x27;t believe they did that ~ that, to me, is superb customer service and I am telling everyone about my wonderful experience!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tough because there isn&#x27;t a big range of choices for color-depositing shampoo / conditioner -- with Redkin&#x27;s and Artec&#x27;s lines cancelled, this is the only brand left that I could find.    With that, I have a few negative comments for this shampoo:  - The color did not distribute evenly in my hair. Though my whole head is equally color-processed, there were chunks, mainly in the front, that definitely absorbed more color than other parts of my hair, creating an uneven result. I dutifully massaged the shampoo into my scalp for a few minutes, and this still happened.  - This particular color, Fluid Fire was definitely the wrong shade for me. From reading the product summary and looking on their website, I had thought that this color would be a good bet for my dark auburn hair. (Think Isla Fisher&#x27;s hair color here: [...].) However, this shampoo turned sections of my hair almost magenta. I looked a little too punk rock for a conservative office environment.  - Finally, I was confused when I received this item from the vendor -- there was no receipt in my package, and definitely no way for me to return the product. Perhaps the latter is a part of the merchant&#x27;s policy, but I did not see that spelled out on the product page (could be my fault.)    On the plus side:  - Yes, this shampoo did deposit color, which if the color wasn&#x27;t so pink would have fulfilled my biggest need.  - Yes, this shampoo did a fine job cleaning my hair.  - I did not have an allergic reaction to this shampoo, which has happened to me in the past when dealing with red hair dyes.</li>
    <li> Like it! arrived fast and it helps keeping my hair red red red!&lt;br /&gt;it feels clean too.</li>
    <li> if you have dyed your hair red you know that its can wash out in two washes, especially if you use hot water. I can finally wash my hair every day in hot water and keep the red in, granted it works better in warm to cold water.</li>
    <li> I use this a couple of time a week and it keeps my color looking fresh between salon color treatments.  I have used other brands, but this one performs best for me.</li>
    <li> This is definitely more magenta than warm red! It also barely lathers, unlike the bottle of Molten Bronze I just ran out of (also purchased from Amazon), so I ended up having to use another shampoo after this one just for my hair to feel clean. I think I will try the Liquid Copper next time.</li>
    <li> The color was too fakey for me. I switched to the copper fire for a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is great!  I have been using it for years.  As for the shipping, it came in a timely manner.  My only suggestion is to make sure the kids are tightened.  My box had one bottle that had a loose lid.  Therefore made a mess in my box.  It wasn&#x27;t pretty considering it was red shampoo.  Other than that all good reviews.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> LIKE THE SHAMPPO ITSELF BUT CANT TELL ANY DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR... WONT BE BUYING AGAIN</li>
    <li> Amazing color, bright and intense, just like I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to refresh natural looking reds, this might not be the color for you. It&#x27;s called fluid fire for a reason! Those of us looking to brighten our already wonderfully unnaturally bright reds will be more than pleased with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear gloves when I use it to keep my hands and nails from staining. I haven&#x27;t had any problem with this product specifically, but my other color depositing shampoo and conditioners do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they made a fluid fire conditioner!</li>
    <li> Colors well, but dries out hair.</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair red each time you use it and enhances the color. I&#x27;ve had my hair dyed for over a month now and the color is still set because of the product. My coworkers keep asking if I&#x27;ve re-dyed it but it&#x27;s just the shampoo. Worth the money. Definitely recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> makes my hair turn an odd pink tone. :/</li>
    <li> This product delivers.  Keeps my red hair bright between salon visits.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who has had issues with red color staying.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  Helps my color last longer between touch ups.</li>
    <li> I went to the salon and had my hair professionally done. I waited three or more days to wash my hair, and I used this product. Awful! Not only did it strip the color out of my hair, but it left purple streaks in it. I shook it up very well before using it, and it didn&#x27;t help. Save your money and invest in the Riveting Red line. Those products actually WORK.</li>
    <li> This stuff is super red - it almost looks like dye too. It kept the red in my hair for WEEKS. You can see it add color to your hair as you use it. It did stain my tub tho, so keep that in consideration. I would NOT leave it opened. When i received it some of it leaked in the bag so the shipping could have been better. It can stain your skin as well, so be careful when using it. Its not too bad and will wash out - but towels that stain is a little more obvious but washes out.  over all i&#x27;ll be repurchasing, keeps the color longer than anything else.</li>
    <li> I have color-treated hair and am using this to extend the life of my color. It definitely brightens up my red after a use, but just be warned, it does turn towels and hands pink!</li>
    <li> Not as red as I had hoped but it does dye your hair well adding color with each wash</li>
    <li> Not seeing any improvement on the longevity of my red hair dye using this along with conditioner. It appears as though my hair is fading at the same rate as it always does. Bummer</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It&#x27;s great for &amp;#34;true red&amp;#34; hair color- not for orange reds, bluish reds, etc.</li>
    <li> I bought this for when I went red! I&#x27;m currently back to my natural color, a light brown, but I bought some of this stuff for when I wanted a boost for that hard to keep red color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it I left it in for a longer period of time than it recommends, about 10 mins, but the color boost was crazy. It definitely was red! If you are up in the higher levels on hair color, (probably about a 6 or higher maybe?) then the color might turn out more pink. But for dark hair, it truly does enhance the red tones. Great product.</li>
    <li> Color is surprisingly effective, considering it&#x27;s just built in to shampoo, but the red can turn out pink on light gray or blond hair, possibly depending on the amount of product used. If buying again, I would try a different shade of red... but I probably won&#x27;t re-purchase the product.</li>
    <li> Item as Described! Fast Shipping! thanks!</li>
    <li> Been looking for a good shampoo thats not too harsh for my scalp and will also keep my red hair nice and fresh and cover those nasty grey roots.  this really does the job.  my color is a red with copper highlights so i mixed the Fluid Fire with the copper and it was perfect.</li>
    <li> As in my previous review, I love this product!  I mix it with MoroccoOil products and my hair looks great.  And in the humid sauna bath weather we call N&#x27;Awlins, that is truly something!!</li>
    <li> This product a REALLY works! I have the full gambit...I&#x27;m a natural auburn, I use henna for my roots to cover the grey, but most importantly, I have red high n low lights. The highlights especially had faded to a brassy color and I used this shampoo that I had just bought for the first time and I only used it once (you can wash, rinse, repeat, but I didn&#x27;t this time), but I did leave it in for at least 2 minutes per the instructions. When I dried my hair, my highlights looked perfectly red again! I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I am an elective red head. I adore that fresh from the salon color. With Tressa’s Fluid Fire, I get to keep my bold red longer. I still get some fading by the time that my next visit comes up. But that visit is now 8 to 10 weeks rather than the six weeks that I previously had to stick to. My roots show up long before my hair has faded too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluid Fire is for crimson and brick red shades. I would recommend avoiding Fluid Fire if you have blonde highlights as too much can result in pink tones. My daughter has ombr&amp;eacute; blonde to brick red hair. When she washed her entire head, she was left with some pink streaks. They faded out within a few days. Luckily she liked them. Now she washes just the ends on occasion to keep the brightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any drying or damage to my hair or my daughter’s hair. I subscribe to the wash hair less camp. Hair washing day comes 3 times a week. I use John Frieda Riveting Reds conditioner when I wash. The daughter washes her hair every day and uses Pantene Pro-V Beautiful Lengths Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo. Works as described!</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a month now and haven&#x27;t really noticed it making any sort of difference. I guess my hair is fading less quickly- but I probably won&#x27;t waste money on it again. I have even tried leaving it on for 20 minutes or using it twice in a row...but nothin&#x27;. I kind of like how it looks when you squirt it on your hands in the shower, though. Probably could be used for a really good prank! Ha!</li>
    <li> My stylist is wowed that my hair has kept its beautiful magenta color for so long! I highly recommend this product for anyone with colored hair!</li>
    <li> Great product from a great seller</li>
    <li> Works wondefully! Really keeps my red, well...red!! Only downside it is dyed a spot pink in the shower, so I would maybe keep it in a tuberware container or something.</li>
    <li> Does help maintain color between salon trips, but it seems to also dry my hair out.  Need extra conditioner.</li>
    <li> It works well as a shampoo, my hair feels perfectly clean. I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference as far as color goes. I think it gives a slight brighteness to the red color but nothing super noticeable. I use it every other time I shampoo to help keep by red brighter, but like I said the difference is minimal. My hair is pretty dark red so that may have to do with it.</li>
    <li> Great product, keeps my hair color vibrant. Just be careful, the red shampoo can dye your grout or dye white surface kind of pink (like my sink, shower floor, etc) if you let it sit on the surface without rinsing off the surfaces quickly. So it works but be careful :)</li>
    <li> I just received this shampoo a few days ago. So far it seems to be working great! Yes, it comes out a shocking blood red. Yes, it leaves behind a pink stain on your hands and shower. Yes, it makes your hair have a &#x27;tiny&#x27;. None of this is as bad as some of these reviews portray through. The dye states that IT IS FOR MEDIUM TO DARK RED HAIR. If you use it on lighter it will appear pink obviously. I haven&#x27;t noticed link personally, it&#x27;s just made the color pop a little more. Kept it where it started right after I died it. Just use common sense with this shampoo. It&#x27;s color depositing... So it will stain light colored towels and showers. I just rinse the shower walls when I am done and wash my hands with soap and it all vanishes. I highly recommend this product for deep redheads. I think if you know what a color depositing shampoo is none of the &#x27;horror stories&#x27; that people are posting will be horror stories at all. Just normal stuff with this kind of shampoo. I&#x27;m really liking the vibrancy in the sunshine this shampoo is giving me and would certainly buy this again.</li>
    <li> Fake! I bought this from a Salon at first, kept my hair red for weeks and I LOVED it. But not this crap from Amazon, it looks the same but it isnt, it did not help keep my hair red at all, even right after being colored.</li>
    <li> I bought this after bleaching and dying my hair with Manic Panic&#x27;s Vampire Red. Now, they&#x27;re in two different color families - Manic Panic being cool-tones, and this having way warmer tones. However, it definitely worked in upkeeping my hair and keeping the red vibrant. I will say, this isn&#x27;t the most through in cleaning your hair, so I only used it once or twice every two weeks to \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; my hair. Also, be cautious if you have a white or clear shower curtain/sheet - it will stain it! I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it staining my actual tub or fingernails, though.</li>
    <li> I was sold on product due to the myriad of recommendations...and I&#x27;m ecstatic to report it has delivered! I just went from blue black to bright red (professionally)1 week ago, tried shampoo in Fluid Fire last night for the first time. Leave on for 15-20mins, rinse, condition for 5 and enjoy bright, rich results for almost a month. Yes, your tile will get a bit red and your hands are pink during your shower, but that&#x27;s nothing compared to the great results you get. Fantastic price, for maintaining a difficult color like bright red. They have a lifelong client in me--in fact, I&#x27;m stocking up next week with a few more bottles.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Keeps my red color vivid until the next time I color.  I do shampoo with it every day, use it unmixed with anything else, and leave on about 5 minute.  I follow up with my normal conditioner for colored hair.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, this shampoo left my hair extremely dry afterwards. Even with extra conditioning, it still felt hard. With that said, I didn&#x27;t find this to extend my color any more than when I use my normal hair products ( Mastey color care line) would k repurchase? No.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely pleased with this product!  A few months back, I decided that I wanted to go red.  I paid big bucks to have my hair dyed professionally, but after about 2 weeks most of the red would fade out.  This does produce a pretty bright red.  If you&#x27;re looking for a coppery or auburn red, I would recommend another one of their colors. I do use Watercolors Molten Bronze for more of a coppery color sometimes too and I love it just as much as Fluid Fire.  I have not had problems with the shampoo staining as some have mentioned.</li>
    <li> I love Tressa products. This shampoo has a visible change to your hair after using it. I love having red hair, but I hate having to dye it so often. Two pieces of advice: don&#x27;t let it sit in your shower wash away any drips, it will lightly stain and don&#x27;t use a light colored towel to dry your hair!</li>
    <li> This product is great for maintaining hair color - especially reds and brighter colors. It is not greasy or sticky - and can be easily cleaned off of clothing. You have to use it regularly to maintain it&#x27;s effectiveness, but I highly reccommend it for keeping your color bright and shiny.</li>
    <li> Dried my hair out and was streaky &amp; just wasn&#x27;t uniform which could be from user error.</li>
    <li> I read that it can turn your hair pink but I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have a problem. My hair is naturally red but last summer it was ombre. My ends had lifted color a little so I figured the shampoo would bring the color back to match my natural. WRONG. My hair is three different tones of red. I don&#x27;t recommend this shade but the shampoo itself is ok. This is not what I had hoped for or wanted but I was aware of the pink hair issue.</li>
    <li> I used this with the Crimson Red shampoo and it made my dull medium brown hair a beautiful, natural auburn. It would definitely freshen up someone&#x27;s red hair, but it stains the shower. Doesn&#x27;t stain the skin, but the shower will look all red. This shampoo and the Crimson Red one both look like thick blood, but they don&#x27;t damage your hair, they soften your hair, and doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue. I will rebuy when I go red again! (:</li>
    <li> Kept my red hair on for a while just wish it didn&#x27;t stained my bath tub so much good product though!</li>
    <li> I tried this in fluid fire and it dried out my hair and also turned it more of a pink than red. I have medium auburn hair. It&#x27;s not really what i expected. Maye i will leave it on for less time other than 10 minutes. Less could be more i suppose.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for a total of four months. I shampooed with it every other or every third shampoo. I have professionally color treated long hair. The first thing I noticed, and I did not put two and two together that the shampoo was the problem, was that within thirty days of my hair cut -which is also when I started using the product in the mocha - about two inches of the length of my hair became extremely porous and dry. I rarely blow dry or heat style, I use sulfate free products, and I deep condition once a week. My hair can usually go up to six months without needling a trim if I wanted to because of how well I take care of it. When I went in, after only two months, I had to have an inch and a half cut off from damage...fast forward two months later, using the Crimson Splash color, and my hair is falling out by the handfuls from the ears down (because that is specifically where I put it because of fading). For three weeks straight handfuls of hair fall from my head whether it is dry or wet. I saw my hair dresser today and she had to cut two and a half inches off and baby my hair for fear of pulling more out. I have used a few different color depositing shampoos and have never had this issue before. PLEASE be careful if you decide to use it, but my advice would be to avoid it completely.</li>
    <li> Love the new bottle design! Adds that oomph to my hair that I need between coloring.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well if you want to add a little &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; to your hair and bring a little more dramatic red to it. This color Fluid Fire is much more intense than the copper so use it lightly.  I use it with my regular shampoo; adding a little of the watercolor shampoo during washing.  It addings brilliance and shine.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have seen some reviewers state they didn&#x27;t see any difference in their hair color...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally brunette, probably around a 5, Ash Brown. I recently dyed it red, and wanted to preserve my color since I paid about 200 for it at a salon. A lot of color quality comes from the source and type of color, as well as your basic hair type anyways...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, naturally curly hair... It is somewhat porous, and this leads to leaching of color and products normally, which is why I bought this shampoo. From my understanding, after my single process hair color at the salon, this would help to maintain my ORIGINAL color (the red dye I paid 200 for)... and it has! It&#x27;s been a few months and the red stayed! My roots have grown out to about an inch now (it grows so fast...) and I can definitely see where I stopped using this because of that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this worked wonderfully!&lt;br /&gt;Some tips though:&lt;br /&gt;It looks like blood coming out of the bottle. I played a really mean prank on my brother... and stained my bathtub. Do try and be careful where you get this, some surfaces, like porcelain, might be susceptible to staining. I noticed if I rinsed it off right after my shower and made sure my tub didn&#x27;t have any left to sit on it, it didn&#x27;t stain. Just be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try and use this like a hair dye, ESPECIALLY if you have darker hair. My hair takes it pretty well, but again I have fine, porous hair... If you have hair that is less porous, you might want to just buck up and go pay for a real dye job and use this as maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO use this to help keep color over a period of time. I do plan to go ahead and go back to my natural brown, maybe buy this shampoo a shade darker and see if it does anything for me... But again, I got lucky and have the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; hair type for this product. It works if you are careful and know what you are doing!!!</li>
    <li> Great product hair looked as if I have had a touch up every time. Brilliant red color keeps my hair looking fresh out the salon!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is an all time lifesaver for red hair.  By the time I received it in the mail my hair had already faded all the red out.  After one wash I noticed a difference so I started using it everytime.  Brings your hair back to the red you originally have.  NO more constant touch ups before your roots are even bad.  Only down fall is when your hair is wet it will still drip a pinkish color.  So don&#x27;t wear white if your hair is wet, made this mistake.</li>
    <li> As a long time \\&quot;red head\\&quot; I&#x27;ve struggled with the dreaded color fade for years. In all of that time I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every product invented to keep red hair red, with varying degrees of success. I can honestly say for the first time ever, that I have found the HG of red hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used Artek, Quantum and Hask Stay Red to keep my locks bright, I was expecting more of the same - so so results, a little dab of deposited color and a shampoo that really didn&#x27;t leave my hair clean. Boy am I surprised. This stuff really adds the color. The fist time I used it I applied about a nickle sized dallop (I have chin length hair) and got loads of lather. I left it on throughout my shower (about 5 minutes) and could tell the difference immediately. I did the same thing the next day and my color looked as though I had just left the salon. In fact, my husband thought I had had it colored again. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, Fluid Fire is a bit on the pink side, so if you&#x27;re going for natural I&#x27;d recommend the Copper, or a mix of the two, which is what I do. Also, this does leave my hair somewhat tangly (I have pretty fine hair) so a good conditioner is a must. Believe me though, your hair will be clean and shiny and red! And best of all, you won&#x27;t have to re-color every 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> It claims to add fiery red-orange tones, but on my hair (which is a light-medium reddish-brown with some blonde) it is more pink than anything. It doesn&#x27;t color evenly, no matter how much effort I put into distributing it and after my next shampoo it has all but washed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was dissapointed with my results. I have had good luck with other red shampoos in the past, and was optimistic because this is a well rated product, but I will not try this brand again.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot - it&#x27;s been a staple for me since I started dying my hair... I use it about 1-2 times a week. Getting my hair done professionally is expensive - especially when I have to go back so frequently, as I&#x27;m sure many faux-redheads do! This helps me get an extra couple weeks between hair appointments. The color is so bright that I&#x27;m always a little terrified it will dye my hands/skin, but it doesn&#x27;t. The smell isn&#x27;t so great, but I can get over that by using a better smelling conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue I have is that it&#x27;s not very clarifying... and I definitely feel like I have some serious product build-up the day that I use it. I just make sure to use a more extreme cleansing shampoo my next shower, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. My hair typically isn&#x27;t too oily - it&#x27;s pretty normal, and looks a little greasy if I go more than 2 days without washing. So, if you do have more oily hair, this probably isn&#x27;t the best shampoo to use.</li>
    <li> Definitely turned my hair pink! I bought the same brand with liquid copper, and I didn&#x27;t have that problem. I&#x27;m not a real read head but this is for people who want pink - not red hair.</li>
    <li> The tressa Watercolors shampoos are fantastic. They definately leave behind enough color to notice and to brighten up a persons color. I dye my hair a bright strawberry blonde. And any type of red color is hard to maintain due to fading. I use a mix of fluid fire and liquid copper and it allows my color to look fresh and bright even weeks after I dyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would say about fluid fire is that it is a little dark and has a pinkish undertone to it. So for my hair color I had to mix it with the liquid coppr to get the perfect tone.</li>
    <li> The color is vivid for sure. Unfortunately it&#x27;s too pink on my hair. My daughter likes it. Fortunately it does wash out in 1-2 washes.</li>
    <li> Just want I wanted, as described ...  Very happy with purchase. A+</li>
    <li> i wanted to boost my auburn hair color so i purchased this, the color is more of a magenta than a natural looking red and after i used it i had pinkish streaks throughout for about a week. if you&#x27;re looking for a color depositing shampoo i would still use this but not in this color unless your hair is hot pink</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product based on reviews, but for my hair it turned it pink in places and I didn&#x27;t realize it until I was at work. Needless to say since I work in a corporate environment I was embarrassed. I thought maybe it was a fluke. Nope! It happened again. It also stains your hands and it left my hair feeling grimey. I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Definitely refreshes my color! I dyed my hair an intense copper red and was looking to keep it vibrant so purchased this shampoo. I have been using it 2 times a week or so and it has seemed to keep my color brighter and not faded so far. The bad reviews on here seem to be coming from people with hair that isn&#x27;t naturally fiery red or dyed fiery red that expected the shampoo to dye it. Not how it is supposed to work, it is supposed to deposit a small amount of color each shampoo to hair that is already a fiery red shade to keep it looking fresh. The lather is quite pinkish so it is no surprise it would turn blonde hair magenta, as that was not the aim of color depositing shampoo. However on already copper red hair it just enhances the shade without changing it at all. Most likely because while it looks pinkish, those are the color molecules already dyed hair loses which makes coppery red hair turn into that faded pumpkin hue red hair can fade to. So obviously the pink, magenta molecules are what FIERY RED (read the bottle people) hair needs to STAY fiery red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did take off one star for one reason, this shampoo makes my scalp itch. So far nothing too unbearable, but while it is on and lathered it is hard to not scratch my scalp and it feels SO good to rinse it off. Sometimes the itch remains for a while too, but that may just be me and not a fault of the product. Still odd since neither hair dye or shampoo normally does that to my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo it gets my already red hair from turning pink. Planning on reordering in the future. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Red/Auburn is one of the most difficult hair colors to maintain over time, Tressa Watercolors gives your hair color a boost, adding to the longevity of your hair color, making trips to the salon less frequent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twice a week, I mix it with L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Shampoo (a sulfate free shampoo/conditioner is key) and Tressa Watercolors adds a slight, but noticeable, hue to my hair. If I ever feel my hair needs a bigger boost, I just use Tressa Watercolors alone (maybe twice a month). Works great on my hair, which is brunette with a red undertone.</li>
    <li> This shampoo turned large sections of my red hair into gorgeous, glowing... magenta. Not quite the look I was going for. Pink happens to be my favorite color, so I&#x27;ll let it slide this time (right into the trash can).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an &amp;#34;enhanced&amp;#34; redhead. My natural color is a strawberry blonde that darkened over the years into a muddy looking brownish red. I prefer my hair to be true red, so I color it. I&#x27;m somewhat of a product snob and only use salon quality products on my hair. I was a bit skeptical about this product, having never heard of it, but I am so glad that I tried it. I am nearing 5 weeks since my last color and my red is vibrant and rich, thanks to Tressa Watercolors Shampoo. I purchased both Fluid Fire and Liquid Copper and mixed them together because I felt that would be the best for my particular color (my colorist customizes my color by using a &amp;#34;true red&amp;#34; with a copper). I will continue to use Tressa Watercolors instead of my more expensive Pureology Ravishing Red line products. Pureology has a color depositing conditioner that is way more pricey for only 4 small vials of product. It does a great job as a conditioner but doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot for enhancing the color. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and will tell my colorist about it so that she can share with her other redheads! I&#x27;m sure it would be great for natural reds as well.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was one of the best i&#x27;ve ever used, as far as color depositing shampoos go. It left my hair extremely vibrant and lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> Turned my beautiful red hair a funky pink koolaid color ... Just pay the extra money for a glaze at the salon. But shipping was great!</li>
    <li> I have been searching and searching for a color depositing shampoo since Artec discountinued their line.  Tressa Watercolors Shampoo in Warm Spice is better than Clairol Shimmer Lights (Gold).  The Clairol Shimmer lights deposited only gold and made me look washed out.  My strawberry blonde hair looks bright and almost like when I first color it. In addition I noticed you did not have to use a lot of it - it lathers well.  I put on a shower cap after the shampoo (leaving it in my hair) and went about taking my shower.  It was in my hair approx 2 min...took the shower cap off and rinsed out...and all I can say is WOW! It really makes a difference! Will save me from coloring too often as well.  I am sold...will be buying this again and again...Just hope they do not discontinue it!  Thanks for a good product!!!</li>
    <li> Omg not good save your money</li>
    <li> MY review for crimson sPlash and fluid fire are exactly the same. this is a great product to boost your natural colour and leave your hair soft and shining. I use  a suave  conditioner after shampooing. i am 66 years old and everyone says my hair looks like a 20 year olds.. Certainly staying out of the sun ( i am a redhead) might have something to do with it!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. My blonde highlights were showing through only 1 week after being colored at my salon back to a medium brunette with red/copper. I looked silly. I searched the internet high and low, and this seemed to be the answer to my problem. After only washing one time, my hair is now red again like it should be...no more gold/copper/blonde showing through, and that is only with one wash. I am sure with repeated use my color will only intensify. I am interested to see how long this will keep me out of the salon chair. The performance of this product along with the bargain of a price is excellent, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Prior to having auburn hair, I was platinum blonde.  I always used purple shampoo to keep my platinum hair from turning too yellow.  I am a hairstylist and prefer Davines products and ALWAYS use their conditioners, however their colored shampoo&#x27;s from their alchemy line just do not deposit enough color.  When I was blonde I used shimmerlights and my hair was always left clean and had the right amount of purple deposited to keep my hair platinum.  I expected this product to do the same for my auburn hair.  I want a shampoo to deposit enough color to keep the red from fading quickly, and I also want the traditional benefit shampoo&#x27;s offer, CLEAN HAIR.  I gave this product 3 tries.  Every time my hair felt extremely greasy afterward.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be using this line again.</li>
    <li> I thought this would add some red tone to my dark brown hair with natural highlights. I saw that others reviewed it magenta on blond hair but mine is brown so I thought no problem. Despite combing it through very carefully and letting it set 20 min I got a streaky magenta tinge all over with severely magenta tips. And it would be a huge mess (think Psycho) if you were trying to use it in the shower everyday.</li>
    <li> I like the deep red color that this product gives to my hair. I do wish it were a little more pigmented though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous red shampoos/conditioners/enhancers and they either didn&#x27;t work or maybe worked a little, but not enough to be worth how they made my hair super frizzy and gross.  But with this my hair was very noticeably redder from the first use and it didn&#x27;t make it frizzy.  It also seemed to make my roots less noticeable after a couple uses (my natural hair color is dark blonde, so it might not help darker colors).  It&#x27;s also more reasonably priced than some other products I&#x27;ve tried.  Finally a good red shampoo!</li>
    <li> Love love love! Definitely adds a hint of red every wash.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair that is colored in Loreal magenta, I used the crimson colors. The product worked well and it did highlight my haircolor which was great, however it made my hair really dry but once I was able to add my smoothing  products and blowdry I was able to get rid of the dryness. Here is how I used the product. I washed with my regular shampoo, then deep conditioned my hair under the dryer. I then added the shampoo which gave me a great lather because my hair was clean, i left it in for 5 minutes, I repeated the shampoo but I will not advice a second washing, I feel like that caused the extra dryness and my hair did not get any redder. I then added my regular conditioner to soften my hair, which it did partially. I then added my other styling products, I had no problem with frizz, if you do not add the moisture back into your hair then you will have a problem with dryness. I would recommend this product it just has to be tailored to work well and deliver the desired effect.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I recently went red from being blond most of my life and my salon hair color would wash out within 3 weeks as reds tend to do.  My hair dresser recommended this color for me but it turned my hair a weird magenta color which probably would have looked great on Katy Perry :)  I&#x27;m 48 years young and don&#x27;t want to look like a I used kool-aid on my hair.  Definitely will not be using ever again...seems like a great type of product but I went wrong in the color selection...now hoping washes out before I got to work on Monday.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous.  It deposits a tremendous amount of color, cleanses effectively (yet gently), lathers very well, and has an inoffensive smell (actually, it smells quite nice).  I have super dark, natural brown hair (level 2.5 or so) that is dyed (professionally) to a level 7 or so copper orange-red (I have porcelain skin naturally, so red actually looks better on me than the color I was born with).  Like other reviewers have stated, if used alone, this product will leave a pinkish-magenta cast to the hair.  This is not surprising, however, because upon examination of the product&#x27;s ingredients, \\&quot;Basic Blue 99\\&quot; is one of the coloring ingredients used.  Hardly a color that I would consider to be used in a product that claims to be \\&quot;warm\\&quot; red.  Anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review, however, is not about using this product alone.  I used [[ASIN:B004LGX7XG Tressa Watercolors Shampoo - Fluid Fire 8.5 oz]] in combination with [[ASIN:B0054Y0FAW Tressa Watercolors Shampoo Liquid Copper 8.5oz.]] and [[ASIN:B003JCHL4Y Aveda Madder Root Conditioner 8.45oz]].  (Also, I should mention to not buy the Aveda conditioner from Amazon unless the price is $18 or lower because you can get it for a much better price at other sites and locations.)  I used a ratio of about 4:1 Liquid Copper and Fluid Fire, repeated with Liquid Copper only, and conditioned with Aveda&#x27;s Madder Root Conditioner.  I would not recommend using Fluid Fire on its own to maintain any Copper/Orange/Warm red hair or auburn.  I use Fluid Fire to deepen the red tones of Liquid Copper, but that is it.  For this purpose, it works wonderfully.  I do notice that if I increase the amount of Fluid Fire compared to the amount of Liquid Copper that my ends (the most porous part) tend to have a slight pinkish-magenta cast, so using less of it is prudent to keeping my hair natural looking.  I was unable to find any reviews that used this combination of products, so I hope this helps someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I should mention, although, Tressa Watercolors claim to be conditioning, I found them to be quite drying and had to use a conditioner after cleansing.  In addition, I have very oily hair and did not find the shampoo to worsen this condition for me at all.</li>
    <li> This product is great to keep the color between hair coloring. It can stain the skin while applying but always washes away. Keep my hair smooth and smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> I was using this to help keep the red in my hair and keep my from having to go to the salon so frequently for refresher.  It deposits red into your hair.  I believe this is the wrong color for me, but otherwise it does as required.  You use this instead of your shampoo and leave it in your hair for a minute or so before rinsing.  (wash hands well as this will dye them). I believe I needed a cooler color of red, this is quite a bright red.</li>
    <li> Use sparingly, expected it to punch up my color, But it colored all my hair including highlights to a bright pinkish red!  Calmed down after washing with Dawn detergent, but still very prevalent.  Will keep you posted as I continue to wash out.  I don&#x27;t freak out about my hair, but Hubby was a little freaked out. I&#x27;m sure it will wash out eventually &amp; I&#x27;ve actually gotten lots of compliments.  The pros are it gives great coverage.  I&#x27;ll try using a little mixed in with my shampoo next time.</li>
    <li> Best red enhancing shampoo I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried just about all of them! Instead of the typical bright fresh red turning into a dull coppery fade out that I usually deal with, this product didn&#x27;t just keep my color it actually made it a bit brighter than it was originally dyed to (I like my reds very bright/unnatural looking so I had no problem with this whatsoever).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, medium length hair and I noticed that the first time I used fluid fire it seemed to take really well to the top layers of my hair but that I didn&#x27;t get enough on the under layers. The next time I decided to wash my hair in two sections which made the tint coverage even and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. If you have dyed red hair, this product line is a MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 2 weeks and I love how it works.  Thanks to the reviewer that recommended mixing this shampoo with a sulfate-free shampoo (I used L&#x27;oreal) to get a better lather.  I am almost 4 weeks since I had my hair colored and it is looking great.</li>
    <li> So here is the deal with this particular color....It does work BUT the color that you get is very &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; looking and does not look natural at all. I would say if you have dark hair and want to add red/purple tones to it, this would work but as fair as highlighting natural red tones.....this is not it :(</li>
