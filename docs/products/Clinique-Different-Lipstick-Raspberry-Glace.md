      <li>I just love this color.</li>
      <li>This is better than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>Love the color.  </li>
      <li>Clinique has served me well for many years.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I love the color of this lipstick and it stays for hours.</li>
      <li>The color is neutral and can be used by mostly all skin tones.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, Very Nice Color,</li>
      <li>As described, very smooth, easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I know it must be just fine :-)</li>
      <li>Although for my skin tone it&#x27;s a bit light it makes my lips instantaneously smooth!</li>
      <li>Clinique always has a good product and price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>This lipstick goes on smooth and lasts for hours</li>
      <li>and it goes on smooth and works for all skin tones.great product</li>
      <li>A While, Smooth and kept my lips Moist..</li>
      <li>another really nice lipstick, liked the color, a new shade for me, again, one of the first lipsticks to buy online.</li>
      <li>The Raspberry Glace color is very rich looking and is just right for the office or out on the town.</li>
      <li>fit looks just like the original they charge you as if it were the original but</li>
      <li>My wife ordered this, and was already familiar with the product.  </li>
      <li>First purchased from Clinique and I was so pleased.</li>
      <li>The texture and color is just right!  </li>
      <li>, I just didn&#x27;t remember exactly why I liked it, and these days prefer more lip gloss and sheer color.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased and would definitely order from this company again!</li>
      <li>The color seemed more for an older woman, and I was watching 20/20 and it made a very interesting claim about the products we purchase on-line thru Amazon and other on line store that we do business with China</li>
      <li>Your lips receive just the right amount of color.</li>
      <li>It is just as I expected it to be since I am already using this color and absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>Very creamy!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Have bought this lip product many times in the past and have always been pleased.  </li>
      <li>The product was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>To be honest I was a little disapointed</li>
      <li>It really stays on and lasts.</li>
      <li>Goes with so much of my wardrobe.  </li>
      <li>Color is much lighter than what I remembered it to be when I wore it 20 years ago.</li>
      <li>Has a decent staying time, but it&#x27;s not a stain</li>
      <li>The trick is that they know the products are in high demand and everyone wahts to save a penny</li>
      <li>Right now, am looking for different color to buy!</li>
      <li>Just right...not too dark or too light  </li>
      <li>Soft color..may be too light for dark tone lips.</li>
      <li>Very pretty color, not much staying power.</li>
      <li>So soft and plump.</li>
      <li>Such a savings for the exact same product!</li>
      <li>but I feel that they need to really screen the vendors, because it is not far for us Americans to go on Amamzon</li>
      <li>and you can go light or go darker depending on how hard you press into your lips.</li>
      <li>to dark for me but still really pretty</li>

<li> it was completely differentn clothing being sold as the real desinger or popular store brands but they not authentic:(.</li>
<li> This is far an away my favorite lipstick, but I was a bit disappointed that it was in the green plastic giveaway tube rather than the normal tube.</li>
<li> A little lighter on my natural lip color than I thought, but still a flattering color.</li>
<li> I have been using this color for a long time.  </li>
<li> Too sheer and no lasting power,don&#x27;t waste your money,gave it to my little 10 year old friend.</li>
<li> we trust them and end up with Dry mascara becasue</li>
<li> This is a full-sized Clinique Different lipstick--it comes in a Clinique green tube rather than the silver-tone one, but in all other respects it is the same product you can purchase from Clinique or clinique.com.  </li>
<li> I like the soft, subtle color of this lipstick and the texture of the lipstick.  </li>
<li> Why buy this lipstick I have used for years any other way?.</li>
<li> it was either old or a fake, Perfume that the scent does not last lomg at all</li>
<li> She hasn&#x27;t complained so</li>
<li> Clinique..can&#x27;t go wrong!  </li>
<li> its not:( as a consumer I am disgusted to hear this.</li>

    <li> My favorie color for years!</li>
    <li> It is just as I expected it to be since I am already using this color and absolutely love it!</li>

    <li> This is a full-sized Clinique Different lipstick--it comes in a Clinique green tube rather than the silver-tone one, but in all other respects it is the same product you can purchase from Clinique or clinique.com.  By the time you pay the shipping cost, this lipstick costs about the same too (it retails from Clinique at $15), but you do save a bit as you don&#x27;t have to pay Clinique&#x27;s shipping price.  It&#x27;s a nice, moderate-coverage lipstick and it&#x27;s a beautiful color.</li>
    <li> Perfect color! I am fair skinned and this color is perfect in bringing some color to my face !&lt;br /&gt;Love it !</li>

    <li> The color seemed more for an older woman, and I was watching 20/20 and it made a very interesting claim about the products we purchase on-line thru Amazon and other on line store that we do business with China, they state that the items are counterfit and carry poisoness amounts of lead iin the products that we purchase in Nordstrom, Macy etc. The trick is that they know the products are in high demand and everyone wahts to save a penny so they go to Amazon or Ebay hoping to get a deal and what they&#x27;re getting is counter fit looks just like the original they charge you as if it were the original but its not:( as a consumer I am disgusted to hear this. I have purchase a substantial amount of itmes from Amazon I LOVE Amazon but I feel that they need to really screen the vendors, because it is not far for us Americans to go on Amamzon becasue we trust them and end up with Dry mascara becasue it was either old or a fake, Perfume that the scent does not last lomg at all but if was purchased at the mall it was completely differentn clothing being sold as the real desinger or popular store brands but they not authentic:(.</li>
    <li> This is far an away my favorite lipstick, but I was a bit disappointed that it was in the green plastic giveaway tube rather than the normal tube.</li>

    <li> Love the color.  Goes with so much of my wardrobe.  Very creamy!</li>
    <li> This used to be my favorite lipstick years ago, I was so thrilled to find it still being sold here, I even bought 2 . To be honest I was a little disapointed the color is not as &amp;#34; awesome&amp;#34; as I had thought 10 years ago, and the lip stick itself is not as moist or glossy as I prefer. I think it is my fault , I just didn&#x27;t remember exactly why I liked it, and these days prefer more lip gloss and sheer color. I guess I could sum it up by stating this is a &amp;#34;dated&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a bit darker...but its fine I am using it....!</li>
    <li> Great buy.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> this liostick is very nice. i have it and it goes on smooth and works for all skin tones.great product</li>
    <li> the perfect natural color</li>
    <li> I HAD BEEN ORDERING A MULBERRY SHIMMER LIPSTICK FROM ANOTHER VENDOR FOR YEARS WHICH THEY HAVE SINCE DISCONTINUED.  THIS IS THE CLOSEST COLOR I COULD GET TO THE ONE WHICH I HAVE WORN FOR YEARS.</li>
    <li> Great price &amp; quick delivery. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Too sheer and no lasting power,don&#x27;t waste your money,gave it to my little 10 year old friend.</li>
    <li> another really nice lipstick, liked the color, a new shade for me, again, one of the first lipsticks to buy online.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  I love it</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth and is not too bright  Just right...not too dark or too light  I am not allergic to it either.</li>
    <li> This was such. Good buy.  I have been using this color for a long time.  Clinique has served me well for many years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;s Clinique. You expect it to be awesome and it is.</li>
    <li> Great service and product!</li>
    <li> Raspberry glacé is a wonderful color with my skin tone, not too bright. Clinique always has a good product and price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> This is better than I thought it would be. It glides on nice and is moisturizing and you can go light or go darker depending on how hard you press into your lips. Has a decent staying time, but it&#x27;s not a stain so it won&#x27;t last all day.</li>
