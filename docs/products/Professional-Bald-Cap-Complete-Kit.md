      <li>Pretty awesome!</li>
      <li>I did this for my husband and it was amazing.  </li>
      <li>so it didn&#x27;t look amazing</li>
      <li>I am not a makeup artist or any kind of expert</li>
      <li>but everything else came in handy.</li>
      <li>My own mother thought I shaved my head :)</li>

      <li>It is good for someone inexperienced as me; and it brought my Bane costume together perfectly.</li>

      <li>After 2 hours in the mirror and some help from my girlfriend, I achieved a convincingly bald look and got a bunch of laughs from my friends at the Halloween party.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;3 more words required&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>didn’t need the makeup and may have been able to get away with ordering the cheaper kit that doesn’t have it</li>
      <li>If I had known what I was doing, it would have been even better.  </li>
      <li>Remember, this is a bald cap &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; with grease makeup, so you don&#x27;t just put it on and look convincingly bald.</li>
      <li>I would sincerely suggest against this product at all costs.</li>
      <li>As a perfectionist with my Halloween costumes I would&#x27;ve preferred a better result</li>
      <li>For the money, I wish it would have been better quality.  </li>
      <li>Used this in conjunction with a how-to from you tube and it came out fantastic!</li>
      <li>Everyone love it my bald look.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it did take some time but was outstanding.</li>
      <li>But if I had to then ok...</li>
      <li>If not it looks ok.  </li>
      <li>Overall I was very impressed with the look.</li>
      <li>My husband wore this most of the day. :)</li>
      <li>Have someone skilled in makeup application with you for sure; you&#x27;ll need the help.</li>
      <li>Make sure you have someone helping you out though.</li>
      <li>and it was still a bit wrinkled but from a distance I must admit it looked pretty good.  </li>
      <li>It works very nicely but if you are new to doing this.</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions precisely and trimmed the cap as instructed, fitting it over my head and trimming around the ears.  </li>
      <li>This was semi easy, very good step by step guide , photos included were a big help.</li>
      <li>This is a hint if u haven&#x27;t worked with liquid latex before it dries very quickly</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know, in my experience I tried it on myself and it rips so easily.</li>
      <li>easy to apply, works well with my cosplays</li>
      <li>Easy for beginners, a life saver for someone without their equipment.  </li>
      <li>If you read all steps follow everything to a T you will be fine and it will look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The supplied spirit gum and latex worked just fine.</li>
      <li>it fooled everyone looked smooth and people thought I shaved my head</li>
      <li>Great quality on all products that was given in the kit &amp;#34;I took my time taking it off and saved the cap for next time&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>Worked great but be careful when pulling the rubber hood onto your head (it rips easily).</li>
      <li>The seam of where the cap met my skin was pretty visible and blending the color of the cap to my skin tone proved challenging with the included makeup kit.</li>
      <li>For the price of this bald cap kit, and with the help of a friend, it is well worth!</li>
      <li>We were going for Lex Luthor for Halloween 2014 and was a pretty convincing bald head.</li>
      <li>and I was really excited to put it on as part of my halloween costume.</li>
      <li>This kit really did a great job of making me look completely bald for my Halloween costume</li>
      <li>I loved the different colors that could be used to blend it in.</li>
      <li>The bald cap, when it arrived, came with the full kit</li>
      <li>fooled many people at the part who thought I either shaved my head or was really bald.  </li>
      <li>, from afar it looked really convincing, but when you got really close up to it and in good lighting it became pretty apparent that it was a bald cap.</li>
      <li>9 months pregnant which I thanked her</li>
      <li>Super comprehensive bald cap kit.</li>
      <li>Because of that, my amateur application still ended up looking very good.</li>
      <li>Very convincing even up close and personal.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to cut too much and to rip.  </li>
      <li>And expect to take up to 2 hours your first time!</li>
      <li>It took three of us to get it right, but luckily I have some makeup artists in the house.</li>
      <li>But an hour of time, it produced something that made friends and family laugh.</li>
      <li>Never have done latex before and it was soo much fun.</li>
      <li>Worth the cost.</li>
      <li>They seem to be written from the perspective that whoever&#x27;s doing the makeup and application of the cap is a professional artist and will understand how everything works, which is probably not the case for most people buying a kit like this, myself included.</li>
      <li>this is not a quick easy-on easy-off kind of deal!</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>It does take quite a while to get the right shading and color matched but the included makeup kit worked well.  </li>
      <li>The biggest tip I can give is spend the time to color right.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the bald cap works exactly as described. easy to apply, works well with my cosplays</li>
    <li> I have to say that I didn&#x27;t realize how hard it was to do make-up before, but this kit has everything you need as a starter. It is good for someone inexperienced as me; and it brought my Bane costume together perfectly.</li>
    <li> I am not a makeup artist or any kind of expert and I managed to get this to look so realistic that at Halloween my friends thought I had shaved my head. I have short hair to begin with, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about hiding a ponytail, but for basic use I thought this was great. I was worried that it would be too big, since I have a fairly small head, but it fit (without really stretching much) and was comfortable.</li>
    <li> I loved this item. It was a great buy. Definitely worth the money I spent on it. I will be getting this again for next years Halloween. Everyone love it my bald look.</li>
    <li> Great kit. With a little make up and a good eye you make this look pretty realistic.</li>
    <li> Pretty awesome! We were going for Lex Luthor for Halloween 2014 and was a pretty convincing bald head. Friends and family thought he actually shaved his head for the costume. A few weeks prior to Halloween I watched a bunch of youtube tutorials and the &amp;#34;tips and tricks&amp;#34; part really helped. Give yourself about 2 hours for the entire process. I recommend putting your &amp;#34;model&amp;#34; in front of a tv/ipad so they don&#x27;t get too antsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s pretty expensive BUT they did give you everything you need.</li>
    <li> The bald cap was very difficult to use and the instructions that came with it were virtually useless. I  bought this for my Halloween costume to be Heisenberg from Breaking Bad. My girlfriend is an amateur makeup artist and couldn&#x27;t figure this out. The instructions were just basic pictures that offered no help, the glue was messy, and the makeup that came with it did nothing to blend it to my skin tone. There was literally no good things that came of this purchase and Halloween night I had to quickly come up with a new costume, which wasn&#x27;t fun. I would sincerely suggest against this product at all costs.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to go temporarily bald. The kit includes everything you&#x27;d need, the instructions are clear and straightforward, and the end effect freaks people out--people standing two feet from me were convinced I had shaved my head (like I&#x27;d be that committed to a Halloween costume). Definitely the right product if you&#x27;re looking to go chrome dome.</li>
    <li> This is listed as a toy but it is not a toy.  It is a professional bald cap for actors and performers.  The instructions were great and it came with everything you need.  I did not use the cap itself but used the instructions and material for another latex cap I had and it worked great.  I would like to see bigger or more sponges in the kit.  Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Worked great but be careful when pulling the rubber hood onto your head (it rips easily). If you remove it slowly and delicately enough after use, you can use it again (I would clean it first though, it gets warm under there!)</li>
    <li> You will find it is very hard to clean your head after using this thing... also, the color is not natural looking...</li>
    <li> I came into this with low expectations, and even with sharp, fabric-cutting scissors, this latex was not very easy to cut. Honestly, the makeup that this came with was pretty nice--worked well with the other latex prosthetics that I was wearing with my costume. Unfortunately, none of it wanted to stick onto this cap. Using the provided &amp;#34;liquid latex&amp;#34; and powder was not very helpful, and my head ended up looking like a rubber glove had been stretched over my hair, which was still totally visible--and I have pretty short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem was the color of the cap--in all the pictures, it looks like a little pink piece of rubber (note: I&#x27;m not talking about the photos of it applied, but of it loose and not treated yet). This is not accurate. It&#x27;s definitely yellow, and very yellow at that. I got a passing remark that someone thought it looked like a condom was stretched over my head, and, to be totally honest, that&#x27;s what it looked like. Bit of a misrepresentation in the photos here.</li>
    <li> This worked great at Halloween. It took three of us to get it right, but luckily I have some makeup artists in the house. It is very thin and you need to be careful with trimming it. It feels like it could split if you used any force. The supplied spirit gum and latex worked just fine. The pictures in the directions are helpful but, overall, they could be improved. At the end of the process, though, a lot of people at the party thought I had shaved my head. For someone with time and help, I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a very convincing bald cap that I used for my Halloween costume. My only real complaint about it is that the directions were not always easy to follow, especially for someone like myself who has never used something like this before. But this kit has everything you should need to apply a bald cap for whatever purposes you may have for it.</li>
    <li> I was never able to wear it because it ripped almost immediately.  So instead of Heisenberg my Halloween costume had to channel early Walter white</li>
    <li> Bought this bald cap to dress up like Howie Mandel. It looks awesome from the front, also was able to cover my side burns. Close up it looks a bit transparent, so not wetting your hair before I would say. From 5-10 feet away it is very convincing. Had people coming up to me to see if I had actually shaved my head or not. From the back I would recommend gluing it close to the hair line, I had glued it further down which produced some wrinkles and eventually it started to peel off the neck, so that was the only way people knew it was fake was by seeing the back. For the first time putting it on and making sure to follow directions carefully, it took about 2 hours total time. Overall I was very impressed with the look. Next time dry hair and gluing closer to the neck hair line. I will definitely be Howie Mandel again. DEAL!</li>
    <li> Please take into consideration I had two people who did practically all the makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how anyone would be able to make this &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; by themselves. But I was very happy with my result.</li>
    <li> I used the Graftobian Bald Cap for a Halloween party I was forced to go to with my fiance. This product does what you expect but it does take some help to get it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You first have to make sure you slick your hair back with some product or else you will have bumps on your bald head.&lt;br /&gt;Once you have your hair in place have a friend or carefully place the peice on you head.&lt;br /&gt;You will have some overhang (alot) but that is what you need.  Have a friend cut the crap off that is not needed but leave enough to blend with your natural skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Next use the liquid Latex that comes with the kit and randomly apply with a sponge all over the head and a little thicker around the edges to blend in.  (This smells kinda bad but nothing to gut wrenching.)&lt;br /&gt;Let it DRY!!!&lt;br /&gt;Now comes the part where having a friend who is and artist or a good eye with color comes in handy.  Pick your color and cover.  I actually did a combination of all the colors except the blue.  I used a liner brush to pain on blood veins with the blue color and then covered them with the other colors.&lt;br /&gt;If you did it right It looks great.  If not it looks ok.  Mine looked great.&lt;br /&gt;I fooled many people at the part who thought I either shaved my head or was really bald.  The biggest tip I can give is spend the time to color right. If you don&#x27;t spend the time then it will look like your wearing a bald cap.&lt;br /&gt;Buy the end of the night I was sweating and it started to peel around my ears and I finally pulled it off.  Much to the shock of the people at the party who thought i was really bald.&lt;br /&gt;However the next day I had an allergic reaction that lasted about a week to either the product or the product to remove the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it served its purpose.  Will I do it again.. Probably not. But if I had to then ok...</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for Halloween - went as Howie Mandel for \\&quot;Deal or No Deal\\&quot;! I have a very long and thick head of hair and this bald wig completely hid my hair. With makeup applied on the wig, people had to come up close to see that it was actually a wig. Very, very realistic!</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions, work carefully, blend the edges, and you&#x27;ll look freshly shaved. Very convincing even up close and personal.</li>
    <li> I have super long hair and was scared to try the bald cap after weaving my hair around this bald cap worked PERFECT  it fooled everyone looked smooth and people thought I shaved my head the instructions were clear and everything you needed was there I highly recommend this</li>
    <li> The bald cap, when it arrived, came with the full kit and I was really excited to put it on as part of my halloween costume. I followed the instructions precisely and trimmed the cap as instructed, fitting it over my head and trimming around the ears.  The cap was taut and covered my hair completely, but when I finished the trimming, the thing suddenly splits on both sides. Being latex pulled tight, it is beyond repair (and the kit only provides one). I ended up putting duct tape over the exposed areas and concealing it with the provided liquid latex. Trying to apply the provided grease makeup is like trying to put on foundation with a q-tip, so I just used a large stick of cream foundation I had instead.  The effect wasn&#x27;t great, but I added fake hair to the rough patches and it did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but for future buyers, be very very gentle with the cap itself until it&#x27;s glued down.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is WOW!! I bought this bald cap for a halloween party for my work I went as Walter White from the show Breaking Bad. The kicker of all this is I have a huge head of hair very thick! This cap took care of it my wife 9 months pregnant which I thanked her all day/week long took the job of putting it on. If you read all steps follow everything to a T you will be fine and it will look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE SEE PICTURES OF BEFORE AND AFTER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;1. Great quality on all products that was given in the kit &amp;#34;I took my time taking it off and saved the cap for next time&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;2. Very easy instructions on putting it on any amature can do it and have great results&lt;br /&gt;3. Real like! Everyone at work thought I was a new employee that was bald from a distance didn&#x27;t even know it was me</li>
    <li> Everything you need to do a very convincing bald cap!  I did this for my husband and it was amazing.  If I had known what I was doing, it would have been even better.  So, here&#x27;s my advice:  leave yourself at least 2 hours.  Letting each layer dry is critical.  YouTube has a video tutorial, called bald cap in a snap.</li>
    <li> only used it once so far for halloween,  but i can use it again if i wanted to.  worked out great</li>
    <li> Was not able to use it.  It ripped as I was attempting to put it on.  I was even trying to be careful, but to no avail.  Would not attempt again.</li>
    <li> Great bald cap! The small products that it comes with are nice  too!</li>
    <li> It took about an hour to apply the first time. But if I were applying it again, it would go quicker. It looked pretty real. I loved the different colors that could be used to blend it in.</li>
    <li> Take your time when fitting this and applying it, it&#x27;s a great piece but it takes some time to get it done right.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to be Gru from Despicable Me for my son&#x27;s 1 st b day and it looked great!  It will take you an hour to 1.5 hours to do it though, trust me.  There are some videos on YouTube from the same company that makes this cap and I&#x27;d recommend watching before trying to put it on.  I did mine in a rush and took about an hour and had a little bit of help and looked pretty damn good. Make sure you have someone helping you out though.</li>
    <li> If you have a second person to put this on I would say it is okay.  You have to cut and trim this cap.  It is I imagine what professional quality is, and you should probably have a professional put it on for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I managed and it looked like I was actually bald (which was a sad look into my future) but still cool.  Lasted a few hours (just long enough to win 3rd in a costume contest) before the glue gave way and I took it off.</li>
    <li> Worked out really well.  I was in a jam and had to have the bald with skin creams and this kit saved me for Halloween.  Easy for beginners, a life saver for someone without their equipment.  Be careful with the cutting of the latex and stretching it out - it&#x27;s easy to cut too much and to rip.  Coloring the tones requires good lighting.  The kit itself is flawless, everything else is up to you to use and create.</li>
    <li> Worked well and really spiffed up my &amp;#34;Breaking Bad&amp;#34; Halloween costume.  It does take quite a while to get the right shading and color matched but the included makeup kit worked well.  Works better if you have someone to help because it is quite difficult to apply makup effectively to the back of your own head.</li>
    <li> Looked great - took an hour plus to put on.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is....this is the one youre looking for! Used this in conjunction with a how-to from you tube and it came out fantastic!</li>
    <li> I was Bane for Halloween, this kit worked perfect. I have no make up skills whatsoever.</li>
    <li> For someone with I experience this worked out well. If I had a makeup background it would be perfect. But an hour of time, it produced something that made friends and family laugh.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist , first time ever putting a bald cap on someone. This was semi easy, very good step by step guide , photos included were a big help. I would highly recommend this item. This is a hint if u haven&#x27;t worked with liquid latex before it dries very quickly and i found it was easier to paint it on with the brush rather than to sponge it on , when they say sharp scissors they mean it.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply put together, I was able to make it work</li>
    <li> This kit helped me pull off a really kick ass Walter White / Heisenberg for Halloween! I took a chance buying this sight unseen but it paid off. Some of the cheaper ones I saw in the store were a lot thicker and not very skin toned in color. This one was just about spot on, after applying the skin colored latex over the edges I didn’t even need makeup to make it look real! My own mother thought I shaved my head :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. TAKE YOUR TIME &amp; BE PATIENT when applying it. I fooled with it for a couple days putting it on and being careful with my marks before trimming it to fit just right.&lt;br /&gt;2. Don’t let the spirit gum get on your fingers or let sections of the cap fold over once it’s applied, this can cause big problems for you. Once you’re past the spirit gum application and smoothing of the cap the rest is just details.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use the skin colored latex for blending and  covering the cap line. Do it in layers and don’t try to do it all at once being careful not to let dried or tacky latex build up too much on the sponge causing what you’ve applied to pull off and look patchy. Apply the powder to the latex and cap when done so it sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t need the makeup and may have been able to get away with ordering the cheaper kit that doesn’t have it but everything else came in handy.</li>
    <li> Worked out great. You definitely need assistance applying the cap.</li>
    <li> It was a bit of a process to put on and I had someone helping me, I can&#x27;t imagine trying to do that by myself. Once all the prep was done and we got the cap on it was sturdy. This was our first attempt at applying a bald cap (I bought it as a trial run) so it didn&#x27;t look amazing but I think we could improve on future attempts. The seam of where the cap met my skin was pretty visible and blending the color of the cap to my skin tone proved challenging with the included makeup kit. The actual cap is a very light color and a LOT of makeup had to be applied to get it to a skin tone color, and we even had to turn to day-to-day foundation makeup to help achieve this. The end result was decent though, from afar it looked really convincing, but when you got really close up to it and in good lighting it became pretty apparent that it was a bald cap. I will try other caps for testing, but if none of them are better, I will buy this again for my final costume.</li>
    <li> first time to use it and the directions were to the tee.&lt;br /&gt;awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;it did take some time but was outstanding.</li>
    <li> By far the best bald cap made.  I tried 4 brands - this one is realistic, relatively comfortable and doesn&#x27;t wrinkle or tear.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Great kit - produces a very suitable result.  The only complaint is in the liquid latex, which doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly with a brush, or a sponge.  Overall, your results will please you, I&#x27;m sure.  Use a lot of glue on the back of your head, by the way, as that&#x27;s first to peel off.</li>
    <li> Great kit! Used it with my bane mask, and it was very sturdy and look very real!  &amp;#34;3 more words required&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This kit came with everything needed to do a perfect job. Because of that, my amateur application still ended up looking very good. My husband used it as a practical joke on my 8 year-old son, then proceeded to wear it all day runnung errands. It started peeling up in the neck area after 4-5 hours, but he was very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Took forever to put on and looked horrible (may have been my fault). Taking it off is very painful.</li>
    <li> No one could believe how realistic the results looked.  I give it an A+ for quality results, but patience is essential. Applying is a very tedious task, so leave yourself plenty of time. Took me over an hour!  Great results though.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, in my experience I tried it on myself and it rips so easily. Its hard to put on if you don&#x27;t have short enough hair, and mine is past my ears a little bit yet I still had trouble with it. The instructions is just a picture booklet and nothing else. So there aren&#x27;t any step by step instructions. I had to look it up online. Though everything you need is in the package. Just need to learn how to do it properly or else you are wasting your money.</li>
    <li> This worked out really well for my husband&#x27;s Walter White halloween costume.  Looked surprisingly realistic.  I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> You must purchase the kit if you want to achieve the &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; look.  It was difficult to properly adjust the size of the skull cap, and I supplemented the make up provided with my own liquid make-up.  It won&#x27;t give you a professional look, but it will pass - if it is dark, and at night - at a party.  A lot of $ for a one night event.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Halloween. Never have done latex before and it was soo much fun. I also ordered and extra big bottle of latex to add in more gore to this. Directions were simple enough and it does take about and hour to apply. My husband wore this most of the day. :)</li>
    <li> Used this when I dressed up as heisenberg. It works very nicely but if you are new to doing this. It could take some time to get this on and learn how to do it.</li>
    <li> This kit really did a great job of making me look completely bald for my Halloween costume (I went as Jean-Luc Picard). The only reason I&#x27;m giving it a 4-star review instead of 5-stars is because the instructions are not as clear as I would like. They seem to be written from the perspective that whoever&#x27;s doing the makeup and application of the cap is a professional artist and will understand how everything works, which is probably not the case for most people buying a kit like this, myself included. However, with some trial and error we got the cap on and looking great for my Halloween festivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE: Give yourself at least 2 hours to do the whole application process...this is not a quick easy-on easy-off kind of deal!</li>
    <li> Little difficult to apply but worth the effort.  Bought this for a costume that my husband was wearing.  You really need someone to help you put this on. We worked a while to get it on and it was still a bit wrinkled but from a distance I must admit it looked pretty good.  People did think that he had shaved his head and that was the look we were going for.  We took it off carefully but really could not be used a second time- more of a one time use.</li>
    <li> For the money, I wish it would have been better quality.  The wig broke on Halloween as I was putting it on for the first time (ripped right up the center)  I had to alter my costume to make it work.  Not cool.</li>
    <li> Much too thin to cover darker hair.  You really need two to make it work right and the price is WAY too much for the quality.</li>
    <li> My first experience with a bald cap. And it came out very well, for a first attempt and funny costume. As a perfectionist with my Halloween costumes I would&#x27;ve preferred a better result BUT I can only blame my limited skill with liquid latex and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap itself was well made and the instructions were clear. Be careful cutting the cap as it can tear, use SHARP scissors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest searching YouTube for various tutorials, several good ones are easily found. They&#x27;re are slightly different techniques for application... I cannot stress this enough: this is an art that takes practice and patience!! If you have the time and money do it a few times for practice. Liquid latex is not easy to work with for a novice. You should probably buy bulk liquid latex and practice practice practice without a cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot do this by yourself. You must have another person do everything for you. And expect to take up to 2 hours your first time! And remember, patience!!!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended.  And was able to get multiple uses</li>
    <li> This bald cap kit is exactly how I expected it to be when I decided to buy it. I used it for my Halloween costume in which I was Professor X from X-Men. Before you buy this kit, expect to put some work into making it look realistic. Remember, this is a bald cap &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; with grease makeup, so you don&#x27;t just put it on and look convincingly bald. I have a full head of dark brown hair with about 4 inches of hair length on top and 1 inch length around the sides and back. Before putting on the cap I lightly gelled my hair back and flat because if you don&#x27;t, the cap is thin enough to take the shape of any bulges in your hair. While putting on the cap you can still see the dark color of my hair through the thin latex cap, but that&#x27;s what the makeup is for. At first I thought there wasn&#x27;t going to be enough makeup in the kit to cover my whole head but there was actually more than enough once I was through. I blended two of the brown shades to achieve my skin color and all of my friends thought it matched perfectly. As this was my first time playing around with theater type makeup, the most difficult part of this kit was hiding the seam line of the latex cap using the liquid latex. After 2 hours in the mirror and some help from my girlfriend, I achieved a convincingly bald look and got a bunch of laughs from my friends at the Halloween party. This is a really great kit, but remember you have to put some time into it! The kit comes with an instruction sheet that has both pictures and written steps on how to apply the bald cap. In addition to the instructions I found a couple bald cap instructional videos online (not associated with Graftobian) that helped a lot. If you do decide to buy the cap, just be careful when first putting the cap on your head because longer fingernails do run the risk of tearing the latex cap if they get caught when the cap is being stretched. For the price of this bald cap kit, and with the help of a friend, it is well worth!</li>
    <li> Make up did not blend at all, could not hide the seem</li>
    <li> Super comprehensive bald cap kit. It will definitely take some time to cut and color but the result is worth it. Have someone skilled in makeup application with you for sure; you&#x27;ll need the help.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for Halloween to become a bald man. It worked great it covered my hair up great and I looked really bald. I was freaking people out haha. Looks great in pictures!</li>
