      <li>good news is that as a result of this, I tried Clinique&#x27;s Redness Solutions Cream.  </li>
      <li>but it still doesn&#x27;t make you feel as good as the Clairasonic</li>
      <li>I wanted to give this product a good trial before posting a review.</li>
      <li>face felt good after using it.</li>
      <li>a good cleansing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and my skin started looking good .Back</li>

      <li>But I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting as good as a cleaning as my face needed.</li>
      <li>The treatments are soothing and feel good.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product if used as directed.  </li>
      <li>Your skin glows after using (I used this before going to a party and in the photos my skin looked really good)  </li>
      <li>This a good product and works as advertised.</li>
      <li>I really loved this product.  </li>
      <li>Eucerin has a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>With a fragrance-free soap pad, treatment would be improved because the massaging effects and vibration are exhilarating.</li>
      <li>I have good skin</li>
      <li>I have always good experience with amzon.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely loved it and look forward to using it again.  </li>

      <li>and amazing this has done a good job on the skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.  </li>
      <li>I have found an exfolient that is great and does a better job without having to buy a \\&quot;tool\\&quot; to apply it.  </li>
      <li>My skin is softer, yet firmer and looks very healthy.</li>
      <li>in all, very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>and I am very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a bit frugal, so I&#x27;ll get a couple more uses out of them, but my skin is looking so great.  </li>
      <li>This product I am sure would be great...</li>
      <li>But for those whose price is never an option when it comes to the best skin products, you will get your money&#x27;s worth here.</li>
      <li>so this is the best cost saving alternative if done rightly.</li>
      <li>It felt good after a week too, especially right</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nothing can compare to professional scrubbing and microdermabrasion, but this thing works great for in-between to get excellent results from an at-home kit.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> BEWARE! I bought one on sale, because it looked cool and it was cheap. I used it a couple of times and my face really did look and feel much smoother. BUT, afterwards I started to research it and read there was a reason that the product was discontinued. It causes cancer. Really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I left it alone in my cupboard and forgot about it. I am so cheap, I didn&#x27;t throw it away, as it was still new and in its box.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward... I got squamous cell skin CANCER on the right side of the bridge of my nose!  Right where I was focusing the scrubber, near to my eyes because I didn&#x27;t want wrinkles. SCC has the ability to metastasize. I&#x27;ve since had MOHS surgery and lived through having a hideous scar across my face. I would rather have wrinkles gals. The price of my vanity, could have been, or may still be, my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throw it away! It is the chemical s in the puffs. In fact, now that my life has been changed, I learn that all sorts of cancer causing additives are in cosmetics. We absorb so much through our skin, the largest organ of our bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be well. Make wise choices. Learn from my error and don&#x27;t let it happen to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(FYI  Most Sun screens also contain bad chemicals. Opt for zinc or coconut oil, better yet, wear a hat and keep exposure to 30 mins. Sun shouldn&#x27;t be avoided altogether, you need to for your Vit.D.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Namaste.</li>
    <li> I love this little gadget! It&#x27;s so easy to use!!! My face is as soft as a \\&quot;baby&#x27;s behind.\\&quot; My skin feels clean and looks polished!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it is cleaning my face as it says, however it made me dizzy after use. Any &#x27;boney&#x27; area of your face will allow for the unit to shake your skull...in turn making you very dizzy when you turn it off. I&#x27;m afraid it might be killing my brain cells or something!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product 2-3 times a week for a little over a year now and love it. I divide my face into sections (one cheek, other cheek, chin, nose, forehead) and use it one minute each section.  Then I scrub my neck and chest for a few minutes more.  The results have been great.  Nobody had ever told me my skin \\&quot;simply glows\\&quot; until I started using this.  When I&#x27;m finished, I take a big ol glob of Cetaphil [[ASIN:B001ET76EE Cetaphil Fragrance Free Moisturizing Cream, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]], rub it on my face, and go to bed!  In the morning my skin looks great.  I really considered buying once of those expensive facial cleaners (you know, with the brush) but I&#x27;m so satisfied with the Neutrogena system I can&#x27;t see spending the money.</li>
    <li> I was reading Real Simple magazine and saw an add for this product. It was on the same page as the Clarisonic cleansing brush and the article was explaining the difference between the two. The Clarisonic brush deeply cleanses the skin removing all impurities and the Neutrogena brush is meant to resurface and buff the skin. I was definitely intrigued so I went to the local drugstore and bought a Skin Rej. the very next day and used it the same night. I was kind of disappointed because the device is not nearly as great as Clarisonic. The extreme vibration of the device made my teeth shake. The good news is that I believe you can get the same buffing action by simply buying the refill pads and buffing your face manually. So.. save your money.</li>
    <li> I would have to say I love using this product. I use it every 4 days since I don&#x27;t want to use it to much.  My skin stays red for about a day but this little thing has smoothed out my acne scars and my skin looks and feels soft.  A friend of mine even complimented my skin saying \\&quot;your face is looking good\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Neutrogena has a very unique product. For the price I paid (under $20), it is really nice. As such, it is a vibrating machine with a small pad attachment on its head. Its very nice, I like it a lot. First experience was very impressive. I have not been very diligent in using it regularly, but the couple of times I used it in past 2 months, I only have good things to say about it.</li>
    <li> I used this three times a week for four weeks.  After the first use my skin felt like porcelain.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin felt.  After each use, that super soft feel lasted longer and longer.  My skin became very dry.  I reapplied lotion 15 minutes after the first application because my skin just drank it in.  After the first use I found I needed to stay away from powder to set my make-up otherwise my make-up would flake.  The lines from my nose and mouth became very red and sensitive, so I stopped using it on those areas.    After I finished the first treatment of 12 pads that come in the initial kit, I decided to wait one month then have a professional microdermabrasion in order to compare the two.  I was not happy with the professional job.  My skin did not feel soft or smooth afterwards.  The woman who gave me the treatment insisted I needed to use a lot of very expensive products on my face and come back in one month for another treatment before I would see results.  The fact is the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator did a better job for less than half the price of a professional treatment.  The replacement pads are far less expensive than all the expensive products I would have had to purchase and use just to get the same results.    This product is a keeper.</li>
    <li> After noticing over the past several months that my skin was looking dull (old) and my freckles (age spots) were starting to form an unauthorized gathering, I decided to give this product a try. This was a last resort before I scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist or fancy/schmancy spa.     The Pros:  -My skin is very smooth, both in look and feel.  -Freckles are less noticeable.  -Acne scars are diminishing.  -The soap in the pad does not irritate my sensitive skin.    The Cons:  -The vibrations can feel downright weird around the eyes, lips and on the neck.  -My skin is very fair. After using this product it is very pink, like a light sunburn, for about 24 hours after use. There is no irritation or damage on the surface of my skin, but it is unnatural looking since it is only on my face and neck. To minimize this effect, I&#x27;ve modified the routine to a maximum of only 2 times per week, 45 seconds per facial area and only on the low setting, letting the device rest lightly against my skin.     The Result:  With the modified routine to minimize the redness, I am extremely happy with this product. Overall, I find it very enjoyable to use and will continue to purchase and recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since I bought it at Christmas as a gift to myself, I have to say this is one cool product.  I really am a big Neutrogena fan.  I don&#x27;t follow the directions to discard the pad after every use, there is enough \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in these to go at least 2-3 times, plus there aren&#x27;t that many pads in the initial kit(only 12).  I&#x27;m a bit frugal, so I&#x27;ll get a couple more uses out of them, but my skin is looking so great.  I use almost all Neutrogena skin care products, and I have only good things to say about them.  I just started using their Healthy Skin Night lotion and it is wonderful, I also use their Healthy Defense SPF 30 light tint and love that.  I would also recommend their 3 in 1 concealer,eye cream, and spf 20, that stuff can make a new mom look like she&#x27;s had a full nights rest.  I really do like this product and think it&#x27;s great for refining texture of the skin, I did find it a little abrasive the first time I used it, but now I don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s a great product and cheaper than a facial.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;the cleansing pads smell wonderful&lt;br /&gt;it cleans and exfoliates my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t improve my skin&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s time-consuming&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s expensive&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s pretty loud&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not particularly comfortable, especially around the eyes and nose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this religiously for the past two weeks to no avail. I had high hopes for this, but it tanked- it has been no better for my skin than a regular exfoliating face wash.</li>
    <li> I love this.  When I want to look fresh and glowy, I use this and even if I only use it very quickly, it makes me look better and makes my skin a smooth pallet for my make-up. In fact, although I am addicted to make-up, I can actually go without it after I use this skin rejuvenator. Twice I got a bit too enthusiastic and overdid it. It kind of skinned my face in a couple of places. Not nice. So I&#x27;ve become more conscious using it. I had a few discolored spots and they were gone after just one use. I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a while. This is my 2nd, maybe even 3rd purchase of it. I&#x27;d hate to be without it in my arsenal.</li>
    <li> If I could give this ten stars I would.  I&#x27;ve spent countless amounts of money on spa facials.  They can be anywhere from $80-$200 each.  If I had this back then I would never have gone to the spa for a facial!  After the very first use I immediately felt like I had new skin.  My skin can be very dry and dull, so much that even makeup looks horrible on it.  After using this product I feel like I don&#x27;t even need all that makeup.  It really works and for the price that it is, you cannot beat it!    PROS: Easy to put together, disposable cleansing pads make this a convenient way to have a facial anytime, not too soapy as other products can be, vibration feels great and really makes you feel like you have new skin after rinsing.    CONS: I only wish I had this before I spent gobs in the salon for professional facials!</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 months as directed and saw no visible improvement in fine lines and wrinkles, age spots or skin firmness.  Using the device and pads was a pleasant experience and did not irritate my skin at all, but I was very disappointed with the lack of results on my 64 year old skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this system about two months ago and I am very pleased with it. I bought it not really for anti-aging but to try to smooth and fade some old cystic acne scars. I do believe the skin rejuvenator has helped fade my discoloration from my old acne scars. My skin feels much smoother after a treatment and I have not had any irritation, which is unusual for my skin. Overall I am extremely comfortable recommending the product to anyone who wants smoother skin and to fade discoloration. It is easy to use too!</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this product, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and silky my face felt when I rinsed it off. I use it nearly every evening after I remove my makeup from the day.  The replacement pads, however, are ridiculously expensive.  I reuse my pads several times, adding my own cleanser to it.  Often, after rinsing the pad, I place a moisturizer on it and do my face with it again.  The softness of my face is felt directly after using the product, but not noticeable during the day or even later in the evening.  Try the product; it&#x27;s more reasonably priced compared to the expensive ones like Clarisonic and probably is just as good. I think it may be beneficial as it probably increases blood flow to the face. I&#x27;m 55 with fair to medium complexion and some age spots as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used!! I noticed one of the reviewers were complaining that this product was too expensive. What I say is try going to a dermatologist to see what they will charge you for treatments with the same results!!   I was going monthly for a a while to get microdermabrasion treatments at my dermatologist&#x27;s office and was being charged $150 each treatment. I also had to pay for the TNS cream at $150 for a months worth, the Retinol cream as well at $80 and it lasts about 3 months and as the C &amp; E cream at $60 a pop lasting up to 3 months. I have suffered with acne my whole life and I&#x27;m left with some scaring as well as sun damage from living in Florida my so my skin looked worn and rough. I could not afford the treatments anymore and looked for some kind of alternative. After using the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator a few times, I was getting better results for a lot less than what I was paying at the dr&#x27;s office. The oil free mosturizer with sunblock is great too and I use it after the micorderm treatments 3 days a week. I wish I had found this product before spending hundreds of dollars on treatments at the dr&#x27;s office! I feel great and my husband and kids compliment me and tell me I&#x27;m glowing. Something that means so much to me because I have never had compliments on my skin.   Thank you Neutrogena and please continue to sell this product. Everyone considering Microderm treatments must try this healthy skin rejuvenator!!</li>
    <li> I got this at Target for full price, which was over $40 by the time I paid sales tax. I should have ordered it on amazon but, wanted to see it in person first in case it looked like a piece of junk. Anyway it didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a good product and easy to use -- fits in the hand nicely, the cleansing agent in the pad feels great and the scent is nice. I found it preferable to have the vibrator off at the start, while I massaged the different areas of my face, then afterwards I turned it on, going over every area again with the low speed vibration on. The soap rinses off easily and leaves your skin feeling very good. I enjoyed using it and will have no problem making it a routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on a regular basis for a few months, and how nice it is to hear my daughters say, \\&quot;I want to look as good as Mom when I&#x27;m her age (70)\\&quot;.  Thank you for offering this product at such a reasonable price.  Even the refills are reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from acne since i was 15 and it has taken a toll on my face therefore when i was planning my wedding i knew i had to do something to improve the appearance of my skin and provide me with a glow. I couldn&#x27;t afford a facial and so after a lot of researching and reading reviews on this product i decided to try it out and i saw a difference in my skin texture just after a week. Am VERY impressed with this product, it does exactly what the makers say it does and i would recommend this product to anyone who can&#x27;t afford a facial but wants smooth glowing skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product!   I would give it more stars if I could.  I had dark sundamaged spots on my forehead and cheekbone areas that were getting larger and darker each year.  I tried exfoliating and using hydroquinone based skin lighteners with very little success.  I noticed a difference the first time I used this product.  I have been using it for about 3 or 4 weeks and the dark spots are smaller and lighter.  They are probably about 60% lighter and half as large.  I am not noticing as large a difference as in the first 2 weeks but they are definitely still getting smaller and lighter.    My skin is also really soft.  It feels like it did in high school.  I think I look about 5 years younger now too.    To save money, I use the puffs more than once because there is plenty of cleanser in it.      One caution I have is to do an area under your eyes before an area above your eyes because if the puff is too wet it will drip in your eyes and it burns a lot.     I have sensitive skin, dry skin so the first time I used it I was cautious and didn&#x27;t use it too long.  My face burned a little when I applied moisturizer and was peeling a little.  The next time I used it, I used it normally.  After I used it a couple of times I noticed the dead skin was gone off my face and there is no peeling at all.  In fact my face is less dry now.    I highly recommend this product and even convinced my sister to buy one.</li>
    <li> This is a great exfoliator and skin treatment.  I can tell a difference when I used the \\&quot;Rejuvenator.\\&quot;  My skin is softer, smoother and when I use it consistently, I can tell my skin has more of glow.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I already use a scrubbie cloth in the shower. I have a less abrasive but still effective one to use for my face&#x27; separately. I thought this product might be better but it is essentially the same thing in electronic form. It is less convenient because you use it out of the shower and for a longer period of time which really only made my face more raw. Making your skin raw isn&#x27;t anti-aging. In comparing the effectiveness, convenience and overall use (as well as skin friendliness) I would very much recommend getting the Exfoliating Hydro Towel Towel By Earth Therapeutics instead. As I said I have been using this for quite some time and find it to be a much better product. ( I do recommend using a separate towel for your face and body or simply cutting this one down.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing this product for a while, but wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to pay the price.  I finally broke down and purchased it, and am so glad I did!  The vibrating sensation feels really good on my face, and after using it, my face feels so smooth and silky, with a nice healthy glow to it.  The air is very dry where I live, so I do put a moisturizer on afterwards.  I don&#x27;t have many crow&#x27;s feet lines yet, but it does seem to slightly improve the appearance of them.  The only negative is that the rejuvenating puffs are one-time use only (or, supposed to be).  I am pretty frugal and actually push it and get 2 to 3 uses out of each pad.    I would recommend this Neutrogena product!      March 2011 - Okay, so I&#x27;ve had this product for awhile, and I still LOVE it.... however, it is very, very difficult to find the puffs!  Walmart, Walgreens, and KMart all used to carry them, but no longer, as far as I can tell.  I finally was able to find them on eBay, where they ranged anywhere from about a buck a piece (for a pack of 24) up to way over two dollars each... just for the puffs!!!  Ridiculous!  I guess they know they can no longer be found commercially, so some of the sellers on eBay are taking advantage of the consumers!  Neutrogena needs to take note and make the rejuvenating puffs available commercially, and at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I purchased this a while ago and just got to using it. I&#x27;ve only used it once and only once. I have oily, 40+ year old skin and I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne since I was 14 and devoted Neutrogena customer. Generally, due to my genetic never-ending supply of oil -- wrinkling of my skin isn&#x27;t a major issue (occasional breakouts, yes). Recently, I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with rosacea. Aging is so nifty... As a former Retinol user (from waaaaay back), I failed to consistently use my newly prescibed rosacea retinol (metrogel) so I thought -- hmmmmm let me clear the facial decks and exfoliate, then get with my metrogel program. Well, once and I&#x27;m done. Always trust your gut people -- even if you&#x27;re working on your face. I immediately thought - whoa nellie - this vibration is way too harsh and I rotated that sucker around being careful not to use it prolongingly in one spot. I used it about 1 minute, no more. While my face felt wonderful, my husband noticed a brightness to my skin and I felt marvelous. However, I question the product as I was using it. My skull vibrated! And, here&#x27;s the a*&amp;-kicker and deal breaker, the NEXT DAY while brushing my teeth, I had broken \\&quot;spider\\&quot; veins on my nose and chin. They WERE NOT there the day before I used this thing. And I&#x27;m quite sure executives at Neutrogena -- wherever they reside -- could hear me screaming profanities in their direction. Shame, because I loved the way it made my skin feel. And I dutifully checked all the information - not one mention of potential damage to blood vessels. It is NOT like any scrub or mask - it is beyond those products. Yes, my skin felt smoother, tighter and definitely looked brighter but the price I paid using this thing &#x3D; broken blood vessels. If my dermatolgist were alive (world-renown doctor) he&#x27;d slap himself in the forehead and plead me to \\&quot;Be gentle, honey, gentle. Don&#x27;t do anything harsh to your skin.\\&quot; I loved that guy and more than 2 decades after his death, all his medical advice remains 100% correct. Gave it 2 stars because this is how my skin reacted. Yours may not. Buyer beware and be forewarned. As Clint Eastwood once said \\&quot;You&#x27;ve got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky today?\\&quot; Tomorrow you might not feel lucky at all.t. Gave it 2 stars because this is how my skin reacted. Yours may not. Buyer beware and be forewarned. As Clint Eastwood once said \\&quot;You&#x27;ve got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky today?\\&quot; Tomorrow you might not feel lucky at all.</li>
    <li> The refills are not available, but the individual buf-puf brand has individual puffs for around 6 buck that fits on fine and will do the same thing. Just trim and attach.  Works almost the same for $6 for 40 puffs.</li>
    <li> The instructions for this power tool weren&#x27;t idiot proof. I have a PhD but that didn&#x27;t help me realize there are different settings. I apparently used the industry-standard lobotomy setting, because it made my whole skull vibrate, making me wonder what brain damage would result. Especially entertaining was moving the rejuvenator over my nose. What a sensation! It tickled painfully! How do other people love this product? I am returning this puppy asap.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and really do like it.  But as the others have stated there are no refills to be found anywhere.  I was told by Neutrogena that [...] would have them available on Dec. 10. Well obviously they are not.  I cannot understand why a company would market a product and not have all the components ready for customers.  I would NOT recommend anyone buy this until refills are available. Oh, also Neutrogena stated that refills are available at Target, Walgreen&#x27;s, Wal-Mart and CVS.  Not in the Apex, NC area are they available at these stores.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I purchased this instead of the $200.00 Clarisonic, believing the hype on the box even though the make-up artist where I bought it said it was for dermabrasion of dry skin and that I would be better off with an anti-aging cream for lines and discolorations. Should have listened to her and I guess you get what you pay for. I found the vibration noise and feel to be annoying. The pads are small, so taking the time to leave it on each area of my face for 2 minutes 3x a week is also time consuming. I felt I had to rotate it myself in each area rather than just letting the pad sit there as I doubt the vibrations are doing anything measurable. The pad is akin to the Buff Puff that used to be popular, with a rough weave that has pre-applied soap which is activated when you wet the pad. Which brings up another problem; soapiness dripping down my arm as I hold the pad to my face. My face did feel smoother hence the 2 stars, but this is something I could have accomplished with a facial scrub and moisturizer. Don&#x27;t waste your money as it isn&#x27;t cheap for what you get, and you will have to keep buying the pads for it.</li>
    <li> I really recommend this product to anyone who really wants smoother skin.  I bought this product as a christmas gift for my mother in law which she put on her christmas wish list.  After using it about a week, I have noticed such a difference in her face.  Her face is smoother and soft.  From what she said to me she can tell some of her wrinkles are fading.  So, Im really glad this product is helping her and making her feel good about her self.</li>
    <li> Although I have pretty good skin already, as I approach my forties, I am ever more conscious of preventive measures regarding skin care and health in general.  Because of this, for the last year or so, I&#x27;ve been interested in trying a home microdermabrasion kit, but had not yet taken the time to do so.  Then Amazon Vine posted the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator for review, and I jumped at the chance.  Having long trusted the Neutrogena brand, I felt comfortable trying their latest skin care gadget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena didn&#x27;t let me down.  From the very first use, I could tell a difference.  My skin felt softer, looked a little brighter.  Now, after several weeks of use, I would even venture the expression &#x60;soft as a baby&#x27;s butt&#x27; in regards to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rejuvenator is easy to use, with disposable pads that simply stick sort of Velcro-like onto the device.  The pads have some kind of cleanser in them, and they create very mild suds as you apply them to your face with the tool.  The cleanser has a very light aroma that is simply clean and fresh, as you may expect from Neutrogena.  At the time I wrote this review, I was able to easily find refill pads in several local retail stores and online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool itself fits comfortably in the hand, without excess weight.  However, once you turn it on, the vibration is very strong in the hand, to the point I can feel it all the way into my wrist.  While not painful, it is a bit weird and I still haven&#x27;t become quite used to it after several weeks of use.  Still, requiring only a few minutes of use three times a week, I can live with this, especially after seeing the effect it has on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the vibration feels a bit strong in the hand, it does not feel so on the face, which is good.  It is very comfortable as it works the skin, not at all abrasive as I feared it might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I have to rate this unit with five stars.  I am very pleased with the effects it has had so far and have already purchased refill pads with the intent of continuing using it indefinitely.ll pads with the intent of continuing using it indefinitely.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  Since I began using it about one month ago, I have seen improvement in my skin.  The most noticeable difference thus far has been in the appearance of age spots, which have lightened considerably.  Wrinkles seem to be reduced also.  I use the product faithfully every other day, and buff approximately 5-6 minutes each time.  I am so impressed that I plan on giving this product as a Christmas gift to each of my three sisters.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!!! I have friends who bought a very expenisive face rejuvenator from a doctor&#x27;s office and I am not kidding this one is BETTER and tons cheaper! BUY IT***********</li>
    <li> The first time I used this item my skin felt so soft!  I was shocked.  I expected the pads to be more abrasive and feared they may irritate my sensitive skin but I haven&#x27;t experienced any redness or discomfort.  I&#x27;ve never had any treatments at a spa or doctor&#x27;s office so I can&#x27;t make a comparison but I definitely think these are great for an at-home solution.</li>
    <li> I bought this at CVS when it was on sale about 5 months ago. They had the refill packs right next to it, and they came with a discount when you bought them with the device.    I&#x27;ll have to say I was skeptical, until I used it. I have a cosmetology background and, although I didn&#x27;t do skin work, I&#x27;ve had plenty of professional skin work done in the salons I worked at. My fears soon diminished after use. Not only was the texture of my skin much cleaner and softer, but my fine lines and wrinkles were less, too. I did notice a little of a burning sensation from the cleanser on the velcro pads, but it didn&#x27;t give me a chemical burn or leave marks.    One thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the vibration was so strong that it made me feel nauseated. But I discovered that if I sat in a chair and used it, that feeling went away.(I stood up in front of a bath mirror initially.)    And here&#x27;s the TIP: If you remove the scrub attachment, and apply some sort of skin serum (I used Oil of Olay Daily Regenerating Serum...what I had on hand at the time. And I used the Olay Derma Pods for my eyes...makes them work even better.), and then use the smooth part of the device over trouble spots and \\&quot;lift\\&quot; your eyebrow areas (like in the demonstration of Derma Wand on TV), you can actually use it to temporarily give yourself a manual face lift. If you concentrate it in circular motions over puffs beneath the eyes, over forehead creases and neck creases, and use a sweeping motion from mid-face to hairline...you can diminish sagging and reduce wrinkles. It also helps your skin to absorb the serum so, if your skin gets dry before you&#x27;re done, just apply more serum. I just got creative and tried it to see if it worked, and it does. The effects will last 2-4 days before having to do it again.     When using the device both ways, it is invaluable as a beauty treatment.  You should use the same circular motions (sweeping up and out) as when you used the scrub attachment, and for about the same amount of time over trouble spots. Just make sure you&#x27;re not creating a crease in your skin when you use it like this, or you can make a wrinkle worse by intensifying it.</li>
    <li> This product is even better than I imagined. After reading all the reviews, I just had to see for myself if it worked. I have never experienced this type of thorough exfoliation and cleansing of my face. I used to have stubborn clogged pores that would not be cleared by any other method, but this really helped. My skin used to feel bumpy (although it looked smooth)to the touch, but it&#x27;s pure silk now. This product also significantly cleared old red acne scar marks. I refer to it as my \\&quot;little sander.\\&quot;    Neutrogena recommends using the product 3 times per week, which seems really excessive for my particular skin type. I have very fair delicate skin with pink undertones and using this more than once per week is simply too much. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything left to exfoliate, since this product basically \\&quot;sands off\\&quot; the top layer of your face. Although it does this very gently, I wouldn&#x27;t do it more than once per week, or at the very most twice per week. When I tried doing it three times a week, my usually combination skin became very dry and flaky. Moisturizing is extremely important after each treatment and I make sure to slather on a rich, non-pore clogging cream for at least two days afterward.     After I finish doing my face, I also use it on my neck and chest. I always add plenty of extra water so that the product glides more gently on this delicate skin. My neck and chest have never felt so soft or looked so supple! Finally, I use the product on my elbows and hands, concentrating on any rough spots, and even my fingernails. I&#x27;m still looking for new things to scrub each time I use it!    This product is great for acne, although not when you&#x27;re having an actual breakout. I used this after a breakout, and it make the marks disappear faster and my skin has remained quite clear ever since. Also, my skin care products are far more effective now since all dead skin is removed and no longer preventing deep absorption. This product has been good to my sensitive skinand believe it is safe for most sensitive types. There are two settings on the machine, so anyone with delicate skin can try the lowest setting at first.    I also wanted to mention that others have been noticing how soft my face is looking and my mother is also using my rejuvenator. My boyfriend can&#x27;t keep his hands off skin. He is particularly fascinated with my super smooth nose and chin and constantly wants to touch them! This is great, as long as it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out!     Although I&#x27;m 35, I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles, but I can imagine that this product could be helpful with this issue as well. I highly recommend this product and I will continue to use this indefinately.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because i&#x27;ve been dealing with uneven, poorly toned skin my entire life and I was hoping it would do something about it. And it did.    Personally, I love this product, it didn&#x27;t get rid of the uneven tones but my face is so smooth that I don&#x27;t even care. I&#x27;ve never found a product that could \\&quot;buff out\\&quot; all the bumps around my jawline but this started working on the first use. I don&#x27;t know how well it works for anti-aging... i&#x27;m only 23. But if you want ridiculously smooth skin, I would definately recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on sale here at Amazon.com.  What this product does is gently exfoliate the skin.  A puff that has some sort of cleanser in it attaches to the end of the unit and pulsates.  You move it around your face and allow it to pulsate for 1-2 minutes on your problem areas.  After the very first use, my skin felt smoother.  Some people have complained that this product irritated their skin, but I did not suffer any irritation. I should also note that the product features 2 different speeds.  I use the slower speed.  I used to use St. Ives scrub, but find that my skin feels a lot smoother after using this product.  You do have to purchase replacement puffs, but the price here on amazon.com is very reasonable.  My skin loves this!</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted. It&#x27;s super easy to use, no mess at all, I do it in no time (it says 2 min/area), it has 2 power levels and in my opinion the higher level is gentle enough to be comfortable, and best of all it leaves my skin with a really awesome feeling (clean and smooth)Oh, and the price is great for this fantastic product. I highly recommend it.  [[ASIN:B000V2J3ZA Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator Puffs Refills, 24-Count Puffs]].</li>
    <li> As someone who&#x27;s paid for spa treatments (peels, microdermabrasion, etc.) I find the results from this really comparable -- and much cheaper. I admit to probably using it more often than they recommend (albeit for shorter amounts of time), but so far I&#x27;ve been really pleased with both the glow and the firming effect.  Obviously, it&#x27;s only temporary, but so are the spa treatments.</li>
    <li> My wife was the main user for this product, and liked the feeling, but doesn&#x27;t think it lives up entirely to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the packaging was nice, and it was a nice touch that they decided to include batteries.  The cleaning puffs work very well and leave skin feeling fresh.  It is nice that there are different vibration levels, as the highest level felt a bit too much for my wife, but when I tried it was just right for me.  It is a very nice to have this treatment available on a daily basis, which does feel like it cleanses pores and cleans off dry skin.  The only concern my wife raised about the design is that the circular base works well enough but is not easily adaptable to the chin and the upper lips and other curvy areas of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it really remove wrinkles and age spots?  It may be too soon to tell but after a few weeks it doesn&#x27;t seem to be making much of a difference.  While it&#x27;s not magic, the skin rejuvenator does leave skin feeling, well, rejuvenated and fresh.  If nothing else, that&#x27;s not a bad way to start the day.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this product a good trial before posting a review. I used up all the pads that came with it and overall am fairly satisfied. The first use is probably the most dramatic. My skin was so much smoother and had a nice shine, it was clear the product did its magic. It has a fairly strong vibration so you want to be gentle with it as it can be a bit unpleasant otherwise. The directions are a bit sparse and not very clear, telling me to use it 1-2 minutes \\&quot;per area\\&quot;. Well, depending on how big an area  is, that can be a lot of time! I just basically move it around my whole face for about 3 minutes or so before my skin starts feeling sore and that seems about right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the big question was whether this would improve wrinkles and other aging damage. I would have to say so far it&#x27;s not done this for me. I do have a lot of wrinkles and skin damage on my face, but there&#x27;s not been any noticeable difference so far. It may just take a much long-term use to see any real changes, but even if it slows the process down, that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The throw-away pads are a nice convenience but that comes at a price. The refills are not very cheap and hard to find. My local store sells the rejuvenator kit, but not the refills! Hopefully they will start showing up but at least you can get them on Amazon and with free shipping if you get 2 packs at a time. Still, it feels like the old printer-ink cartridge deal...they sell you the product fairly cheap so that you keep getting the refills. I tried seeing if I could get a second day of use out of the pads like someone else mentioned, but there simply is not enough soap left for that. Next I am going to try using one of the other Healthy Skin moisturizer products and see if that gets me a second day of use out of the pads. I&#x27;m all for stretching my dollar if I can get close to the same results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the basic question is whether I am happy with this and will continue to use it, that would be yes, and I&#x27;m going off to buy my refills now!refills now!</li>
    <li> Contained within the box is a vibrating handle with a circle on one end, upon which a cleansing pad is secured (it&#x27;s velcro).  There is one month&#x27;s worth of pads in the box (12).  There&#x27;s also a pair of AA batteries, which is convenient and will get you started right out of the box.    But I haven&#x27;t seen any particular benefit in using the product, which claims to provide luminous smoother skin and an overall younger appearance.  It takes kind of a long time - you&#x27;re supposed to rub the vibrating pad into each area of your face for a couple minutes at a time.  The vibration is quite vigorous and while not painful, it&#x27;s not what I would call especially pleasant.  Plus it causes my eyes to vibrate - actually causing a \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; to my vision when I am holding the thing anywhere below my forehead.  Speaking of forehead, the pad foams up a bit and cleansing fluid starts to drip down and can get in your eyes.    I am not a particularly \\&quot;metro\\&quot; kind of guy, though there&#x27;s no reason any guy shouldn&#x27;t try this if they want their skin rejuvenated.  The reason I mention not being really \\&quot;into\\&quot; this kind of thing, is that I can&#x27;t recommend an alternative - all I can say is that I haven&#x27;t seen the results this thing was supposed to provide.  I had my wife use it for a week, but she stopped because each time it left her with very red - somewhat irritated - skin for hours afterward.  Not recommended for people with sensitive skin, that seemed clear from her experience.    The amount of pads to start with is pretty paltry - a dozen pads?  They&#x27;re gone in a month&#x27;s time and you have to reorder.  They could&#x27;ve at least put in three months worth to get started with.</li>
    <li> Like many of the other reviewers here, I tried this product out as part of the Amazon Vine program.  As a result of the program, I&#x27;ve discovered many great products, this is no exception!    As the product name implies, it does seem to rejuvenate your skin.  I have yet to receive any wrinkles, but my skin isn&#x27;t as soft, and healthy as it could be.  After using this product, I have seen noticeable improvements.    What it comes with:  The applicator, 12 puffs (pads), attachment head, and 2 AA batteries.    Setup is a cinch!  Attach the pad to the attachment head, wet it, and then attach the attachment head to the applicator.  Turn the applicator on, and massage away!  No need to push it hard into your face.  Just let it gently glide and do its work.  The instructions says 1-2 minutes per facial area.    Though this may work for most people, I found certain areas more sensitive than others, so use your own judgment.    I would recommend this product to my friends and family.  It surely beats the more expensive spa treatments and whatnot.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00115GYCQ Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti Aging Power Treatment Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;Wow, the massage action felt tingly &amp; wonderful at first, but by the third treatment my family commented on my face feeling \\&quot;like sandpaper\\&quot;. Followed the instructions to the letter, but found this product too harsh/drying for my combination skin.</li>
    <li> This product I am sure would be great...I was excited about it UNTIL I read that it had Sodium Laurel Sulphate (spelling may be wrong).  This is a chemical that is used widely in the cosmetic business but is like a poison for you body...not just your skin but for your entire immune system.  I returned the product.</li>
    <li> I have already had 3 of my friends purchase this item and they too, love it!!!  After the first use, you will definitely notice a difference!!!  You will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical, but could tell my skin needed SOMETHING. I got this with a discount from Neutrogena and another coupon, so I felt like it was worth a try.  After the first use my skin looked better - better color, smoother, softer.  After a couple weeks it really looked fantastic.  Despite impeccable skin hygiene I tend to break out with at least one or two HUGE, unsightly cystic nodules monthly.  This has put a stop to that, finally!  With regular use my pores look smaller, the lines around my eyes that get especially bad in winter look better, and when I do break out it&#x27;s less significant and heals much more quickly.  After a couple months of regular use I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in the acne scarring I have on one cheek.    I have sensitive skin, and if I use this on the high setting I find that my skin is a bit red for a few hours.  I usually use it just before bed, rinse the soap off thoroughly, and slather my skin with moisturizer before I go to sleep.  If I have to use it in the morning the redness is easily covered by sheer makeup.  I&#x27;ve found myself going without makeup more often - or just brushing on some powder instead of putting on foundation.      I&#x27;d happily pay twice the price for this, given what it saves me on facials.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products. I&#x27;m mostly a water and soap kind of gal, but I&#x27;ve trusted the Neutrogena products for some time and was willing to give this a try. It is easy to use - the instructions are virtually fool-proof. I like the soft feel of my skin after using this, but I have noticed that my skin is even more sensitive than normal the day after using this product. I would advise reducing the number of times per week you use this if your skin is sensitive (I ended up with something close to a sunburn sensation on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I like this product, I don&#x27;t know if I would use it for the long term. A 24-count refill pack is about $17, and that seems rather pricey to me for what amounts to about a month&#x27;s worth of use. Over the course of a year you could spend over $200 to keep this gadget in use. I know other reviewers have raved about the spa-at-home benefit of this, and $200 is definitely cheaper than visiting a spa a couple of times a year. Still, to essentially wash and moisturize my face, I would probably stick to my old routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few years now and I love it. I originally bought it to clean my pores and I must admit it does not do that as efficiently as I hoped for but it makes my skin feel amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am originally from Argentina and after moving to the USA my skin didn&#x27;t seem to agre, with the water here. My skin started feeling rough and dry and even a little itchy. The first time I tried this product I was in love. My skin felt so good I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it, it was soft and silky, my break outs stopped along with the roughness and itching. I do understand tho that this might be too much for very delicate skin. The exfoliating pads can easily irritate you if your skin is delicate. However, for my skin they are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for someone looking for something to exfoliate and soften your skin. It did make my skin feel firmer, but I&#x27;m 28 and I know that that result is not always obteined, so I wont recommend it for that.</li>
    <li> Like many 40+ women I&#x27;ve tried it all.  This is the best mechanical form of exfoliation I have found.  I have sensitive skin and thus can not use this device more than a few times a week as it DOES exfoliate.  The other types of mechanical exfoliation with various pastes which include fine particles are just too messy for my tastes.  They throw bits of paste all over the bathroom mirror and are difficult to remove all those tiny particles from your face. There is \\&quot;grit\\&quot; every where on your face and hairline.  This little machine is easy, efficient and does an outstanding job in one to two minutes.  The blue replaceable discs are a bit pricey but those micro dermabration creams are usually much more expensive.  Although the blue discs are designed to be replaced and discarded every time I don&#x27;t do that.  I use mine many times and just put some cleanser on the pad when the slightly foaming cleaners incorporated into the disc stops foaming.  I actually like the disc when it becomes more worn down and it isn&#x27;t as abrasive/effective just out of the box.  The other device Neutrogena makes, I think it is called the Wave or something similar, it completely useless as it barely vibrates.  I threw mine away.  One could do better with a rough wash cloth.  If you have conditions like inflammatory acne either discard the discs after each use or lightly soak the disc and head of the device in about 1/4 inch alcohol for 15 to 20 minutes to sanitize the disc.  For the purposes of exfoliation only, this device is superior to the Clarisonic.  I love the Clarisonic for cleaning my face, but it does not exfoliate.</li>
    <li> This is good for a deep cleaning, but it isn&#x27;t worth the cost if you are hoping for a good microdermabrasion treatment.</li>
    <li> This has been a wonderful product for me. After using the product my skin has a very clean and smooth look. The system is very easy to use. I like the fact that you just throw away the pad after use. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting a cleaner more youthful look to their face.</li>
    <li> My wife and I tried this product and came to the same conclusion:  it seems to work (our skin feels softer, smoother and more taut), but we have no idea as to its long-term effects (whether beneficial, adverse or non-existent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels noticeably softer and smoother up to 48 hours after each use.&lt;br /&gt;Two settings (low and high).&lt;br /&gt;Scented (some people may like it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Scented (some people may not like it).&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;dripping down the face\\&quot; problem (which can be solved by not wetting the pad thoroughly, even though the directions tell you to do so).&lt;br /&gt;The high setting may be too rough for some users, but the low setting should be fine for everyone (except those with extremly sensitive skin, who should probably not be using this product anyway).&lt;br /&gt;No directions on how to install the batteries (but once you figure out how to open the battery compartment the first time, it&#x27;s no problem after that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the cons are minor or have been resolved, so I&#x27;ll continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00115GYCQ Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti Aging Power Treatment Kit]]  This Neutrogena product is easy to use, gentle on my skin and I saw great results quickly. My dry facial skin is gone and moisturizing products seem to work better.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> First of all many reviewers complain the refill pads aren&#x27;t sold on Amazon-THEY ARE NOW. I happily use several Neutrogena products and think they are GREAT. I thought the skin rejuvenator was too intense even on the low speed although I have become somewhat used to it. I could not get it close enough to the sides of my nose to scrub away blackheads. The cleaning pads themselves worked very well as my skin felt clean and soft. I now have used them 3 times a week for a few weeks and honestly cannot tell any change in my facial tone or texture. None of my friends apparently noticed either, so for some of us it may just take longer to work. I do plan on ordering one refill to give it a fair chance to see a change.</li>
    <li> I love beauty products; creams, lotions, scrubs, exfoliators, masks, you name it I love it.   When I saw this Neutrogena product up for grabs I jumped at the chance.  The product makes certain claims, and I have only been using it for about 3 weeks, so I haven&#x27;t been able to see if it lives up to all the clinical study results, but this is my experience so far.    Dermatologist Clinical Study Proves: (as stated on the back of the box)   instantly:   91% had smoother, more luminous skin  1 Week:    88% had visible improvement in fine lines  4 Weeks:   88% had significantly reduced appearance of wrinkles or age spots    8 Weeks:   72% had substantial improvement in firmness    The directions are easy, apply the little puff to the attachment head, press down firmly, wet, and then snap onto the system applicator.  Massage face 1 to 2 minutes.  Rinse face, dry.  Discard puff.     With my first use, I confess to not enjoying it.  The vibration made me a little woozy and I felt cross eyed.  It was really rather uncomfortable.  The results however were well worth it.  My face felt so soft and my skin looked fantastic.  So I kept on with the treatments, and after awhile the vibration didn&#x27;t make me feel sea sick or cross eyed.      I have really sensitive skin and a touch of rosacea, so I was afraid it might irritate my skin or make it overly red.  I was pleased that after about 5 minutes the redness caused by the puff went away.    In the 3 short weeks I have noticed a big difference with the appearance of my skin, I think it looks healthier, and my pores look fantastic.  My skin has never felt so soft and with that result alone I will keep using the product.  So far I have been impressed and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> No more pricey Beta-Liftx peels, Fraxel laser (burning pain, horrible pain!), CO2 laser (3rd degree burn, horrible pain, and 10 days off work to recover), microdermabrasion (useless, doesn&#x27;t give results like this), my skin looks way better using this rejuvenator than any of these procedures - I still can&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And people, stop complaining about where to get refills - they&#x27;re everywhere and they&#x27;re inexpensive compared to the above procedures.  Who buys something like this before they research where to get refills???  And the dripping in the eyes - c&#x27;mon already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that works immediately.  I&#x27;ve just had 3 sessions with this and my face sparkles like it did in my &#x27;20&#x27;s.  Oh, I&#x27;m almost 56.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I have sensitive skin so I have been using it once a week, but I do think it is gentle enough to use more frequently for people with normal skin. In just one month my skin has improved noticeably. I have good skin but it had lost radiance. I tried other products before this one and they were also good but they were not as gentle. This product works wonderful, it&#x27;s quick and you can feel the change in your skin right away. You don&#x27;t get any redness or itchiness afterward like you do with some other microdermabrasion kits. It&#x27;s also great that you can use it in the shower, that makes it really convenient. I recommend this product to anyone who has a good skin care regimen but wants to give it a boost.</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator came out at the same time as the [[ASIN:B0013FTO8K Neutrogena Wave - Deep Clean Power Cleanser with 14 Foaming Pads - Battery Included - Plus Refill Pack of 14 Foaming Pads - 28 Pads Total]]. The HSR is a bit more expensive, and comes in a blue box. I&#x27;ve tried both and I have to say that this one is my favorite of the two. It provides gentle exfoliation without overly drying my skin and leaves no hint of redness or irritation. The vibrations are a bit more hardcore than with the Wave, but since this is considered a microdermabrasion kit, I think that&#x27;s to be expected. Another difference is that this one isn&#x27;t water resistent, whereas the Wave cleanser is. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that you can use in the shower, you might want to go with the Wave instead. However, if you&#x27;re sick of shelling out $150 for professional microdermabrasion, the HSR will save you some money and produce nearly perfect results. It leaves my skin shiny and smooth even when used only twice a week.</li>
    <li> If my camera were hooked up, I would make a video review to show you what my skin still looks like several days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s either the pads themselves, or something they are putting in the cleanser but it destroyed my face.  Seriously, I have sensitive, dry skin.  I also have Rosacea which was totally under control.  I bought this because I couldn&#x27;t find a microdermabrasion kit that had the paste/sponge applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for about 60 seconds and it started to feel a bit uncomfortable so I stopped.  I know enough not to overdo it.  The morning after I used it, my face was covered with little red welts and tiny bumps.  It took a week to settle down.  In fairness to the product, I decided to use it again, this time for only 20-30 seconds over the entire face.  Same result so I think it is something in the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, immediately after using it, my face started to itch.  Both times.&lt;br /&gt;That would also point to cleanser ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that as a result of this, I tried Clinique&#x27;s Redness Solutions Cream.  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it helped soothe my skin.  But for the remaining redness and bumps, I am going to have to go to the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this 35.00 purchase got pretty expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used exfoliators with the sponge/paste combination and they are wonderful.  Neutrogena, I have discovered, has one.  If you have sensitive skin or tend to react to cosmetic ingredients, I would stay away from this one.  The pads are harsh too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I can see that if you did have normal/more durable skin, that you might really like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of us with sensitive skin need to be REALLY careful about what we use.  This one was on me.  I was stupid to think that simply because it was a Neutrogena product that it would be hypoallergenic/non-irritating.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped in allotted time.  Item is small enough to travel with and easy to hold and use.  My skin did immeditaly feel cleaner and looked more luminous after the 1st time.  My skin continues to show overall improvement.  Small lines are fading and sun spots / freckles seem to be lightening.  Try to avoid heavey creams just after using this product.  I have sensitive skin so I tend have a slight red tone after using the Rejuvenator.  I found using a cold wet cloth for a minute or so works great.  Calms the redness down and then I use a light daily cream afterwards.  Definately would recommend this product espically if you are in the 35 to 45 range when you seem to start noticing these aging changes in your skin.  I have even started using it on the Tops of my hands and am seeing results there as well.  I have some light freckles / age spots that have just recently appeared in the last year and this product has been working to help lighten them to where they are now almost my own skin color now.</li>
    <li> I used it twice &amp; liked the results but had to stop because the pads contain fragrance which bothered my skin. Which surprised me because usually neutrogena products are fragrance free. I am hoping they come out with new pads for it &amp; then I will use it again.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m a guy and went with my lady to buy this after seeing a commercial.  We got home, she put on her makeup, and I snuck into the bathroom to use this thing.. and holy crapola!  I&#x27;m like a little baby -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product - watch out world, here I come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just realized that this is going to post with my lady&#x27;s account - so no, Kelly is not a guy! ;)</li>
    <li> I have a Clairasonic.  NOTHING can beat it!!!  My face never feels as good as each time I use my Clairasonic!  And there are no puffs or anything to buy.  Well, every few months you should replace the brush head but that&#x27;s cheap enough.  I&#x27;ve found the Wave to be a cheap knockoff of the Clairasonic.  The Wave is a LOT less expensive but it still doesn&#x27;t make you feel as good as the Clairasonic and it just doesn&#x27;t make your skin look as good as the Clairasonic!  The Clairasonic really lasts!!  I&#x27;ve had mine for years.  I have to wonder how long the Wave will last.  Time will tell ...    I&#x27;ll stick with my Clairasonic.  I gave the Wave 5 stars only because I do think it&#x27;s a good option for anyone who can&#x27;t afford a Clairasonic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about two weeks.  I use it 3 times a week.  I&#x27;ve already started to notice my skin looking brighter and feeling softer/smoother.  It got rid of my blackheads and my whiteheads are starting to go away too. I was afraid to try it because I read that others had red, raw skin afterwards.  I had none. I&#x27;m very happy with the product so far.  The only reason why I gave 4 stars is because it&#x27;s a bit pricey for me.  I think I&#x27;m going to switch to 2 times a week so the pads will last a bit longer and will have to keep an eye out for coupons/sales and stock up.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit 3 months back and amazing this has done a good job on the skin. My wife uses this weekly once or twice and her skin looks great. Recently we had been for skiing and forgot to apply sunscreen. We started noticing that we had sunburns and our skin had started peeling off. So though I never used this, we both used this. And within the same day after we got the massage done could notice that skin was glowing. Next day onwards dint see any skin peel offs and my skin started looking good .Back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;Really this is an amazing kit to take care of ur skin in a better and more easiest way.</li>
    <li> Pros: It&#x27;s relaxing, smells good, helps slightly exfoliate, rosy hue on cheeks for a couple of days  Cons: Your face immediately drys up if you don&#x27;t put on face cream right after you dry off your face (I could feel my face tighten up with dryness)    I didn&#x27;t buy this product for wrinkles since I&#x27;m only 25 and an avid sunscreen wearer. I bought it for exfoliation purposes.    My advice: Right after using, get a wash cloth, dampen it and wipe off your face, then pat dry, and apply face cream immediately. Probably put on sunscreen when you go outside to keep your skin supple.     Could be a great gift for your mom or mother in law, but make sure to tell them it&#x27;s relaxing and feels good and you didn&#x27;t buy it because they look old! Try it yourself first so you can give an honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This is one of my facial must-haves.  I really shouldn&#x27;t keep touching my clean skin after using this product but I can&#x27;t help it sometimes- it&#x27;s an unconscious thing as my skin is so absolutely smooth and soft that I keep feeling it (with the back of my hand, of course, since that&#x27;s much cleaner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken care of my skin for years so I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles in general.  I&#x27;ll be 31 in a few months, but the three wrinkles that I have are quite fine.  The worst one I have is the one in-between my brows as I tend to furrow my eyes, but after using Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, this wrinkle is noticeably not as deep anymore.  My freckles have lightened and my skin color looks so much more even.  I would get these annoying little white heads near my mouth area (probably because of constant phone use or something), but with this machine those white heads are no longer an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product for over three years.  I use it off and on because I get lazy or I&#x27;ll run out of refills, and each time I have a long pause in-between uses, I can really tell.  The white heads will come back, the silky smooth skin and even complexion are not quite there, that one wrinkle gets deeper, etc.  I use it for about 4 minutes all over my face on high.  There are only two settings, high and low.  I used to use it on low in the beginning but after a while my face got used to the vibrations so I turned it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product, though I think it&#x27;s been discontinued unfortunately.  Maybe it was considered too pricey for an OTC handheld battery powered exfoliator?  I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;m worried that I will no longer find the refills on Amazon anymore, where I purchase them for so much cheaper than places like CVS Pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a routine with how I use it.  Since all the pads are pretty dry, you have to wet them before use.  I start with washing the lower portion of my face first (anything below my eyes) because the water needs a little time to foam up.  If you start on your brow first, then the water containing the cleaning chemical rolls down into your eyes and sting.  If you close your eyes to avoid that, then you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing, which is okay for some people but personally it drives me bonkers.  I want to see what I&#x27;m doing.  I don&#x27;t like that the cleaning product gets all over the machine and my hand too, but nothing much to do about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is that I feel like I have to wash my face a lot to get the cleaning chemical off.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my home uses soft water (because it didn&#x27;t seem to feel like this a couple years ago when I first got this product when we didn&#x27;t have a soft water filter yet).  The soap almost seems to stick to my face; if I don&#x27;t wash really thoroughly and then wipe the water off immediately, so that even the tiniest bit of residue gets into my eyes, it stings.  I really want to say it&#x27;s the soft water, so I&#x27;m wondering if other people have the same problem.ds a little time to foam up.  If you start on your brow first, then the water containing the cleaning chemical rolls down into your eyes and sting.  If you close your eyes to avoid that, then you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing, which is okay for some people but personally it drives me bonkers.  I want to see what I&#x27;m doing.

    <li> I&#x27;m 33...  but have been dealing with lines around my mouth since college.  Back then I tried Oil of Olay - just the lotion, nothing hard core - and it didn&#x27;t do much.  Nothing like being 21 and going to a club and feeling like everyone is staring at your old lady lines!   I think it&#x27;s partly genetics, I just happen to have the kind of cheek fat that migrates downwards young.      Since then I have tried this and that, thought I saw some progress, don&#x27;t know if I really did.  Lately I have started to really be bothered by lines on my forehead.  I feel like it makes me look old and manly.  And very recently I saw a picture of myself holding one of my girls and I about screamed.  Yes I can blame bad lighting (I was in shadow) but still.  I looked way too old and wrinkly for 33!!!      So I caved and bought this thing.  I hemmed and hawed over getting the machine vs. trying the pads alone.  I hemmed and hawed over getting THIS machine vs. the wave which is cheaper and seems like it will take the same refills.  But the Wave only uses one battery whereas this takes 2 so I can only assume this is more powerful - and I need power.      After one use, I thought I saw a difference.  After two, I KNOW I am seeing a difference.  My forehead lines are now more in line with what other people my age have - I stare at facial lines when I talk to people, I try not to, but I can&#x27;t help it!  My smile lines seem a little better but it&#x27;s hard to tell...  I&#x27;ve gained some weight recently which I think might be plumping them up.      I was a little surprised that this thing just vibrates intensely, I thought it spun like a Crest toothbrush.  Seems to work well though!      I know NOTHING is going to get rid of all the lines and I am OK with that.  I would just like to look my age and not feel 10 years older.      I can&#x27;t wait for the 3rd use to see how this goes.  I really think it&#x27;s made a huge difference.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but nothing compared to more drastic measures like restalyne or botox.      One thing I have learned is to start at the bottom of your face and do the forehead last - as it does tend to slowly drip into the eyes.  Doing the forehead last, you don&#x27;t have to stop and mop up before moving on.</li>
    <li> This is a great little product - Neutrogena took the vibrating rejuvenator unit that it used for its Microdermabrasion kit and added a velcro piece that allows you to attach the rejuvenator puffs.   Instructions tell you to use it for 2-3 minutes per facial area - I use it for 5-6 minutes on my entire face just before jumping in the shower in the morning.   It replaces my scrub a few times a week.   So far I&#x27;ve noticed drastically smoother skin - and at 27 I am looking for something to really scrub away dead skin cells and maybe even out my skin a bit.   This feels like it is doing both.  The puff foams up with water, and is definitely a bit scratchy.   There is a pleasant smell when you are using it.    I had to take off two stars for the following:  price.  It&#x27;s overpriced.   The unit comes with batteries, but you&#x27;re still paying $35-39 for a low-tech electronic vibrating device and 12 puffs.   Twelve.   That will last you 3 or 4 weeks at the most.    The second star is lost by the puffs themselves.   They can&#x27;t be found anywhere.  I&#x27;ve looked online and in the store.   I&#x27;m yet to find them - so I am hoping I do so before I run out of the ones that came with the unit.     UPDATE 1/4/08 - refill puffs are now available on both Amazon and major retail stores.  There was quite a delay there, though, so I know the early adopters were really sweating it out.   Whew!</li>
    <li> I love this product and the refills are now available. My skin looks and feels softer? healthier? younger? smoother?-ALL OF THE ABOVE! I have sensitive skin but I have had no issues with it. I am using it every second day and though it does not recommend it, I was using the puff over two applications and I got plently of suds and benefits from the second use compared to the first. Now, that the puffs are available (finally-I was beginning to get concerned!)-I may continue to still get two uses out of one puff-why waste? In the past I have tried Mary Kay, Clinique and Dove exfoliation systems, but I found this one easier use to and with much better benefits- I even use it on my husband!</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews, I thought I would give it a try. I&#x27;ve never went to a spa to have any type of microdermabrassion done, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was in for. Although, I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, and I have noticed that my face is much softer and brighter. I used the system on my face an neck for about 3 minutes (on low setting) and found after using it, my skin felt a little irritated and dry (had to moisturize after). Maybe I was using a little more pressure than I should have, and did it for longer than I should have. The next day my face still had a tingly tight feeling (not sure if I should be feeling this). I will try it again in a few days. If I still feel irritated, I will be using it 1 or twice a week maximum. I will post an update in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy. So ladies, you can move on to another review of this product...because though we all have skin, the genders approach taking care of it in different ways, have different goals, and have different limits to what they&#x27;ll put up with.    Using this product for 1 to 2 minutes on each facial area is time consuming. It just doesn&#x27;t fit into my morning or evening toilette. I chose to do it in the morning &amp; was nearly late for work each time. The first time I used it, I thought my skin felt like it was a canvass ready for make-up. (So ladies, if you are still reading &amp; that&#x27;s what you want: buy!)    After using it as instructed, I have to say I&#x27;m not impressed. I don&#x27;t think my skin is rejuvenated or more radiant. Using it on my face was reminiscent of a ride on a wooden roller-coaster. It leaves you kind of dizzy &amp; light headed (so two stars for the nice head-trip). It really just vibrates the little pad. So I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the perfect machine for anyone with a broken wrist or those with carpal tunnel syndrome so bad they can&#x27;t rub a pad across their face.     Katherine Helmond&#x27;s character in the movie \\&quot;Brazil\\&quot; would probably use this and like it.</li>
    <li> For those that like to pamper themselves, this is the product for you.  There is a noticeable difference right away that won&#x27;t go unnoticed by your friends.  The treatments are soothing and feel good.  The one problem is the price and that the refills are and extra twenty dollars every other month on top of that when you run out (this comes with a one month supply).  But for those whose price is never an option when it comes to the best skin products, you will get your money&#x27;s worth here.</li>
    <li> My wife has been extremely satisfied with this product. The product offers gentle massaging micro-vibrations that apparently increase blood circulation and as a result build collagen for a firmer, younger looking skin. She has been using it for nearly a month and has noticed considerable improvement to her skin, which make me very happy. The only complaint is that it is difficult to find refills apparently they are expensive. Overall 5 start rating.</li>
    <li> From the first treatment, my skin felt smooth and soft. The rejuvenating crystals in the buffs aren&#x27;t harsh and are very gentle on the skin. The treatment feels more like a facial massage and is relaxing. In other words, this is one product I look forwarding to using. The only problem I had was opening the battery compartment. Other than that, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this product.  I definately could tell a difference in the texture of my face after once use.  After a few weeks, I noticed a difference in my pore size too!  It definately made them smaller and more clear.  The buffing pads didn&#x27;t make my face irritated or anything..  Usually I&#x27;d buff in the morning before my shower, and that&#x27;s worked out great for me.  I do it every 3-4 days (when I can remember)...  But I would recommend this product to my friends, of course!</li>
    <li> -PROS-  *Skin feels extremely soft after each use.   *A noticeable reduction in pores after 2 months  *Your skin glows after using (I used this before going to a party and in the photos my skin looked really good)  *I had some acne around my the bottom of the nose and on my upper lip and those have disappeared completely    -CONS-  *Have to buy refill pads every two months  *Battery operated  *Face will get really oily for a few hours after use (depending on skin)    Although the product says its anti-aging, I honestly don&#x27;t think its going to do that. The massaging tool does do a good job of scrubbing so maybe it will help in the long run.  I&#x27;ve used this before parties and going out mostly because it gets rid of all the pores and makes your skin super smooth.    I&#x27;m not the typical girl who is constantly putting creams and lotions on  my face but for some reason I use this product at least 2 - 3 times a week considering how long it takes to complete your face.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I know i will not go without it from now on.  I use it once or twice a week.  After the first two times of using it, my face radiates, it feels smooth, and makes my pores appear smaller.</li>
    <li> Received the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator only yesterday. I was a little worried how it would affect my sensitive skin but I used the lowest speed setting and it worked great. I didn&#x27;t have any irritation at all. I may try the high speed next time. My skin looks and feels smoother after just the one use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.  However, I would like to suggest that Neutrogena offer unscented buffing pads for those of us who have sensitive skin that does not react well to fragrance.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0012ZDY3W Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator Kit]]    All you do is turn it on, and it does the work for you!! How much money will you save from facials alone???  Highly recommend the Neutrogena moisturizing products as well!!</li>
    <li> So one cannot expect any product to work wonders (believe me, I&#x27;ve tried everything out there!) but with this kit my skin definitely feels smoother, and has a more youthful glow.  I&#x27;m 51 years young (yikes!) and have my share of wrinkles, which this does nothing to reduce, but then I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to.  I did want to help enhance my skin, and reduce the dullness of age, which is exactly what this product has done for me.  I do recommend it, as long as you go in with the proper expectations.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this until you can find refill pads.  I can&#x27;t find them ANYWHERE!  Even looked online.</li>
    <li> Used the older version of this with the creams for over a year. Thought the pads would be less messy and that is why I tried the new version. Was not expecting anything but maintaining what was achieved thus far. Surprised that even more improvement has been seen in just a week of using the pads.     I do have sensitive skin so use it for a maximum of 5 minutes a day. My skin is softer, yet firmer and looks very healthy. I had a small brown spot on my chin that nothing seemed to fade it. After one week using this every two days it has faded alot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks, and I plan to get more of the blue power puffs when these run out.  This kit is really easy to use, and leaves my face feeling significantly younger and firmer.  My skin is smoother to the touch.    Now, all that being said--I don&#x27;t think that this little device is any better than a regular facial scrub.  If you regularly use one of those, you&#x27;ll probably not see a lot of benefits from using this instead.  However, if you are like me--and relatively lazy in the morning--you find that you skip the scrub for months on end.  That&#x27;s where I think the real beauty of this device comes in.  It&#x27;s much easier to clean up than one of those abrasive scrubs, and it&#x27;s fun.  (It vibrates.  Need I say more?)    If you are one of those people (like me) who love brushing with an electric toothbrush much more than you like using a boring old manual, you&#x27;ll probably find this kit entrancing, and find you&#x27;re taking better care of your face because it&#x27;s much more fun.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is so strong in the soap pad that it caused an allergic reaction. Though I did not bring the solution close to my eyes, the fragrance caused my eyes to burn, itch, swell and water; an unpleasant experience that lasted almost a week. With a fragrance-free soap pad, treatment would be improved because the massaging effects and vibration are exhilarating.</li>
    <li> This product really works!  My 80 year old mother has wrinkles and I bought this to give her a weekly facial but I liked her results so much after just the first time that I use it now on myself!  After a hard day at work it is nice to come home and soak in the tub then do some facial work on myself with this nifty little gadget.  I am really glad that more companies are starting to offer products similar to what the professional&#x27;s use in their clinics. Plus my mother has never looked so good! I love my tight skin result that it gives and continues to tingle long after the treatment is over. I don&#x27;t like not being able to put some antibacterial soap on the pads and re-use them because that could get a little addicting and pricey if I am not too careful at $16 per box of refill pads but it is worth the effort as far as I am concerned!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion kit that uses this same wand. I ended up rarely using it, and by the time I needed a new container of the dermabrasion cream the company had stopped producing it. I figured I would give these a shot since I already had the wand, and I was very happy that I did.     I found the puffs much easier to use than the cream. The puff attaches to the wand via some pseudo-velcro, which works well, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it coming loose or detached during use. I&#x27;ve found that you can either wet your face, or wet the puff prior to use; each method works equally well for me.     The puff feels good on my face, and the cleanser is non irritating. I have mildly sensitive skin that tends to be oily, and some cleansers end up making my skin even more oily. I haven&#x27;t had this problem with this system at all, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts or rashes. My face does tend to be a little red after use, but it fades pretty quickly.     The best thing about this system is that my skin feels absolutely amazing after using it. It immediately feels softer and smoother and the feeling lasts for at least 24 hours. My skin tone does appear more even, and my pores smaller. Since I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles so I&#x27;m really not sure how it does in that respect.     One thing I also like about this system is that I can use the puff without the vibrating wand. This makes it easier to scrub around my eyes and along the sides of my nose. I haven&#x27;t tried it out yet, but I bet it would also work well on rough knees, elbows, and feet.      I would definitely recommend this product to anyone (male or female) who is looking for a good facial scrubbing system.</li>
    <li> This is quite a nice little product for anyone who&#x27;d like some exfoliation and a smoother skin. Is it \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot;? I&#x27;m not so sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a little \\&quot;wand\\&quot; and 12 puffs (with cleanser built in). Just stick one of the puffs onto the wand, wet it, turn on the wand (it vibrates) and rub it gently in circles on your face. Afterward, rinse well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, I couldn&#x27;t believe how incredibly smooth the skin on my face felt. (It did leave my very fair skin slightly reddened, though, so I would recommend using this at night, rather than as part of your morning routine.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully three times a week, as directed, and my skin definitely looks smoother and \\&quot;glowier.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t feel like I look particularly younger, but I&#x27;m only 31 and thankfully don&#x27;t have much in the way of wrinkles, so I may not be the product&#x27;s target audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I do think this product is rather pricy, and the replacement puffs seem overly expensive as well. I may stick to a baking-soda scrub after my current supply of puffs runs out. It doesn&#x27;t work as well, but it&#x27;s SO much cheaper!</li>
    <li> To be fair this is the first time I have used anything like this, so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  I am also only 28, so I don&#x27;t really have too many skin problems, but I thought why not.  So both my wife and I read the directions and tried it out.  First off it was nice that it actually came with the batteries and the directions were easy to follow.  So we put on one of the pads and tried it out, it felt a little strange and after it was done both of us agreed that our skin was burning a little.  But it was really clean feeling and actually squeaked when we rinsed it.  Neither of us really noticed our skin looking significantly better, but as I said before it is not all that bad to begin with.  So, I guess if you are looking for a unique way to clean your face or if you have skin blemishes that you want to try to lessen this is an option, but for me it really didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
    <li> I bought it from walmart.  I read all the reviews from amazon before buying.I have always good experience with amzon.  Here are few points you should consider before buying:-  1. THE PADS ARE VERY HARSH LIKE SCOTCH BRITE, YOU CAN WASH YOUR DISHES WITH IT.  2.THE PADS DOESNT HAVE EVEN ADEQAUTE SOAP(GEL/MEDIUM) SO ITS LIKE SANDING YOUR FACE WITHOUT ANY LUBRICATION.  3. \\&quot;\\&quot; THE CIRCLE HEAD MASSAGER DOES NOT I REPEAT DOES NOT ROTATE OR DOES NOT MOVE IN CIRCLES\\&quot;\\&quot;.IT JUST VIBTARES.    I have a medium skin type I found it too harsh. I wounder about how much damage it could do to a sensitive skin. I can not use it more than once a week or once every 10 day for more tha 3 minute. More than 3 minutes and it gives bumps and scars afterwards.Here is how you can make best use of it.   Turn the pad the other side blue side down.The cotton side is much softer to skin. Wet throughly both the pad &amp; your face. Apply this product to your face and a bit to the pad   http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Clear-Oil-Free-Action-Cleanser/dp/B000SKYB84/ref&#x3D;sr_1_8?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;beauty&amp;qid&#x3D;1229977643&amp;sr&#x3D;8-8  This will lubricate &amp; cleans as well without scrubbing &amp; being harsh.Gently massage your face in circular motion for 3 minutes max. you can give an extra 10 secs  to the side of your nose &amp; under your lips ( the chin curve).Wash your face with warm water. Then massage your face  for 7 to 10 minutes with a mixute of any body lotion and some warm water.wash you face agin with cold water and apply moisturizer generously.   Just to remind you ladies after using this machine pores open ( &amp; they really open) its very necessary to massage the open pore skin to hydrate it. Them wash with cold water in the end to close the pores. then apply moisturizer to seal it.You are done.     The cream on the pad will make it messy but I dont find any other way to work with this machine now that I have invested some $ 30      I cant just throw it. You cant simply run it over your face and walk away. My skin got dried even after applying moisturizer. It dried and looked scarred light pink. Then few days later it got flaky ( dry spots)and I felt like exfoliating again.    What it does: If used this way it gives a result. skin looked more cared, clean, soft (not very soft baby like),and glow. If done routinley skin will look young. If done as directed on the packet, skin will not only dry with big pores but in a longer run it will looked aged.    I use to get my facial spa done regularly so this is the best cost saving alternative if done rightly.It does not equal the result, but I would say that I have achieved 75-80% of the result that I use to get with a manual professional facial.  If you feel that you have the patience to deal &amp; work with this machine go ahead &amp; buy. If you feel it doesnt fit your busy schedule, you are well with spending over a nutrogena wave or even dove skin vitalizer. But I guess they have much softer pad. And to achieve a good result you will still have to follow the same process, but in this case you ae spending under $ 10-12 etc.</li>
    <li> I too am very disappointed with this system, furthermore they replaced my old Neutrogena system with this one and it&#x27;s simply awful.    I finally found a good replacement, it is the ROC product line, microderm cleansing pads.  Very gentle exfoliation and a conditioning pad on the reverse side.  They come in a nice golden plastic container, VERY CONVENIENT, priced at $10!    I WAS a diehard Neutrogena user, but when they replace my usual $10/mo system, with a $35/mo system, and then compound it with how much the replacement sucks, well, I give up on Neutrogena!    Try the ROC product, it&#x27;s MUCH better in the quality of product and the convenience of use!  Beth~</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s still early, but I think it works well. My skin feels great after a treatment.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now. I try to use it 2-3 times per week and found the best way to remember to use it is to use while in the shower. Be careful of not getting the soap in your eyes because it stings terribly and if you use contacts, you&#x27;ll find you will have to use your glasses that day. Otherwise, I love this exfoliater. Its a great way to scrub deep in order to expose the problems under the skin such as acne and finally get rid of them. If you use it in the shower, wait until your pores are nice and open from the hot steam, and then use the device for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry your face well afterwards and never use the same puff twice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next use an astringent. I prefer to use a salicylic based one by Clean and Clear but any will do (if you have an aspirin allergy, do not use salicylic based products)- Sea Breeze, witchhazel, Neutrogena, etc.  It stings and reddens the face for a few minutes but its worth it for clear skin. Use one thats best for your type of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, if using at night, continue with your benzoil peroxide choice.&lt;br /&gt;During the day after cleansing and toning the skin, you will want to use a moisturizer for faces preferably with spf 15 or higher. Eucerin has a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other ideas: Once you are finished with your face, use the same puff on other parts of your body where dry skin may occur. Its a great way to exfoliate those problem areas (such as knees/ashy elbows) more quickly.</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Health Skin Rejuvenator did a great job in smoothing out my skin.  However, the vibrations from the device are so strong against my face that it honestly made me motion sick!  Gave me a nauseous feeling.  Because I won&#x27;t be using it everyday, I hope I can deal with it.</li>
    <li> This is my second rejuvenator, and I nearly didn&#x27;t try it because of my reaction to the first one.  That one got thrown away within days because it relied on a cr&amp;egrave;me containing aluminum oxide, a product I definitely don&#x27;t want on my skin but couldn&#x27;t get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is different. Rather than a sticky cr&amp;egrave;me, the puffs that do the work are filled with a gentle soap that easily washes away. Even after the first use, the rejuvenator leaves skin feeling smooth and much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now - will it actually leave skin firmer after a couple of months&#x27; use? That remains to be seen. And to be absolutely certain, I think you&#x27;d need to compare before and after photos. However, the Neutrogena site has a page about the clinical results from using this machine that are very promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product that will exfoliate and leave your skin feeling good! I&#x27;ll add more after 8 weeks to let you know if my skin is actually firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I had no trouble finding replacement pads at my local Wal-Mart. Of course, you can also order them from Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: July 21, 2008&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been conducting an experiment the last two months, using the Rejuvenator on one forearm every other day and not on the other.  Then I compare the two to see what, if any differences there may be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  There is a major difference in sagging and wrinkling between the two arms.  The Rejuvenator definitely works to improve skin and rebuild collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  There is a clear difference in skin tone.  Freckles on the treated arm are somewhat less noticeable than on the untreated arm. Color is much more even on the treated arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  There is a clear difference in the smoothness of skin with the treated arm being much silkier and smoother than the untreated arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have proved to myself that the Rejuvenator works, and works better than any of the hugely expensive potions and lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  Do your own experiment.  You may be as impressed as I am.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 3 weeks and I think it does seem to clean out pores, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference in wrinkles, pore size, age spots or firmness. I am also unable to find replacement puffs.</li>
    <li> The Healthy Skin Rejuvenator is described as an Anti Aging kit.  It is similar to another product, also made by Neutrogena called Advanced Solutions.  More on that later.  For now, I&#x27;ll tell you about my experiences with this product.  The premise behind it is that exfoliation will remove dead skin cells and promote cell growth, thereby revealing younger looking skin and reducing \\&quot;the appearance\\&quot; of fine lines.  Skin will look rejuvenated!  There is also some thought that by using microdermabrasion, collagen production will increase.   So far, after 3 weeks use, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed:  Skin color:   years of ignoring sunscreen, plus 5 years in the outback made my naturally fair skin freckly and uneven-toned and now that the tan has faded, its not a good look!  So far, 3 stars for tone evening. The freckles and uneven tone do look better.   Smoothing:  can&#x27;t argue with this.  After 3 weeks, the feel of my skin is amazing.  It feels great after the first use!  I&#x27;m sure removing all those pesky dead skin cells has to make skin smoother on the surface. 5 stars for smoothing.  Wrinkles:  Its hard for most people, myself included, to assess the appearance of their wrinkles.  I&#x27;m sure if I could get my skin to look perfect, except for the wrinkles, it might be easier to tell.  While the overall appearance of my skin has improved, I cannot honestly say that the appearance of my fine lines is diminished.  3 stars for de-wrinkling.  The NHSR kit is easy to use, feels great, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin burning or red.   After using it, I believe my skin looks smoother, and after 3 weeks, think my skin tone might be evening a bit.    Why only 4 stars?  Scientifically, I&#x27;m still not convinced.  The advertising uses a lot of words like softer and smoother \\&quot;looking\\&quot; and \\&quot;increased luminosity\\&quot;.  This particular kit does not emphasize microdermabrasion, which dermatologists use to improve skin and has been scientifically proven to increase collagen production.  The pads do contain microcrystals, which would actually perform microdermabrasion, and not just exfoliation, but the advertising doesn&#x27;t really promote that.  The other Neutrogena kit, Advanced Solutions, emphasizes microdermabrasion as its method of improving skin.  The Rejuvenator is simpler to use with no gooey creams, no rinsing out of the little pad (Advanced Solutions has you reusing a pad), no expensive replacement cream.  A simple little pad, easily tossed in the bin when you&#x27;re done.   Is this better than a $2.50 tube of exfoliating cream with bits of ground up apricot pits?  Yes, I believe it is.  Its made by Neutrogena, a company you can trust to take care of your skin.  The crystals contained in the pad are very fine, and won&#x27;t overscrub your skin.  The microvibrations feel good, and your skin will actually look better when you&#x27;re done.    Not tremendously expensive, and even though the cynic in me has not been convinced by the advertising, I think it might actually work!</li>
    <li> I have rather large pores and keeping my skin clean is always a challenge. So when the Amazon Vine program offered this product to try (for free!) I figured, why not? The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, but my skin felt very much softer. By the second time, the difference was visual as well -- the few laugh lines I have became less pronounced and, amazingly, my cheeks got a very healthy and attractive glow that has remained for days after my last use. This is a very nice product, easy to use, which gives you great results. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product.  I am in my early 40s, and have been trying different skin care products for a few years now, trying, I admit it, to stave off the effects of aging on my skin.  It took me a couple of weeks to notice differences in my skin with other products, but literally, the first time I used this product my skin was incredibly soft and smooth.  Even the next day, my make-up went on very smoothly and evenly on my skin, another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now regarding improving the \\&quot;brightness\\&quot; of my skin, well, it&#x27;s only been three weeks and I can&#x27;t really tell, but I know that to the touch there is a tremendous improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was very easy to use, and I really appreciate that it came with batteries, which are always in short supply in my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this 3 times a week, and really likes it.  The results are as advertised, and she&#x27;s had no problems finding refills.  I bit pricy, but it&#x27;s a quality product.</li>
    <li> This is a good product if used as directed.  My face seems more brighter.  It takes a little getting used to; the sound and movement makes you feel alittle funny...it&#x27;s difficult to explain exactly.  However,  overall I like the product and the results I get are noticeable.</li>
    <li> I bought this item on [...] because it was $[...] less than at my local drug store. I also purchased the 24 ct refill pads and with the Free Super Saver Shipping, I saved even more. If the product works as well as the previous comments indicate, I should be very happy with it. As I am in my 40&#x27;s and dealing with hormones and 40 year old acne with scarring, the gentle microdermabrasion treatment part of the facial cleansing will be a great benefit to me and women like me who want to look a little younger than we actually are.</li>
    <li> For the most part, this product does what it claims to, providing you follow the directions.  I found it very effective around fine lines of the eyes and on the forehead.  however to see the promised effects you need to use it at least 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> I tried it a couple of times. My skin felt better, but I broke out. I have sensitive skin and am prone to acne... so that&#x27;s really no surprise, and certainly not the product&#x27;s fault!</li>
    <li> I am going to say this, trying to NOT sound like a freak fanatic, but I AM IN LOVE with this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently quit smoking after 14 years at nearly 2 packs a day. My skin was looking so horrible... undereye darkness and bags, clogged up dark pores, grey overtones, it was disgusting, and I&#x27;m only 31 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I&#x27;d quit, I bought this and tried it out. After the FIRST USE, my skin was much more radiant and pink, and oh my gosh how SOFT and SMOOTH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m serious. Anyone... anyone with ANY kind of unhappiness about their skin should try this out. Every 3-4 days is the recommended usage, and I agree with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it one day before going out on a date with a guy I hadn&#x27;t seen in a couple months and he remarked at how great my skin looked. He said it looked more even toned, clear, and glowing! :) I love it. I really just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I&#x27;d read a review somewhere (not sure if it was here) about someone who used it on her elbows, too. I laughed, but after using it on my face, I rinse off the pad a little and hit the old elbows. You wouldn&#x27;t believe how much dead skin this little pad can take off! Word of caution: Use it on your elbows only AFTER you&#x27;ve done your face... it&#x27;s kind of gross how much dirt and dead skin hides on the elbows.</li>
    <li> I was one of the skeptics about this product until I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did it for the first time last night, and this morning when I woke up, my skin indeed looked fabulously glowy and smooth, even better than a lot of the high-end exfoliation products I&#x27;d used!  I could not say enough good things about it, but here is the summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Very easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Facial massage:&lt;br /&gt;  Despite the instruction that recommends three minutes of use, I did it for 10 minutes because it just feels so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Safe for sensitive and thin skin.&lt;br /&gt;  Mine is sensitive/thin/dry skin.  With 10 minutes of use, my skin actually took it very well, no redness or peeling at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Multi-function:&lt;br /&gt;  Yes, I also used it on my neck.  Then, I applied a thick layer of Vaseline lotion onto my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Amazingly effective:&lt;br /&gt;  My face/neck visibly and feel smoother, bouncier, more even, less patchy, less red after only one application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot stop touching my skin!!!  It feels so soft and looks so radiant!  I also notice that it absorbs my moisturizer better, which helps a lot with the skin improvement.  I personally use a lot of anti-oxidant products on my face on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good. It leaves your skin feeling so soft. I think that it is best to use it at night time because it dries up the skin or at least it does for mine but when I wake up my face feels so clean and soft. I don&#x27;t use it every night because it says not to. It is suppose to be used 2 - 3 times a week. Well I like this product and it should not be used as a daily cleanser. It is to be used in addition to a daily cleanser.</li>
    <li> Wife says it works very well and is glad she got it. She uses it regularly in her routine. It shipped pretty fast and bought extra pads for it.</li>
    <li> I chose this item because my once perfect complexion has changed drastically at age 75. It still looks fantastic for a person my age, but because my skin was so extraordinary for most of my adult life, I am somewhat traumatized by quite sudden physical aging. This item does what it claims. I have used it to exfoliate and resurface and my face reflects a definite change in a short period of time. In accompaniment applied daily I have also used after treatment the Neutrogena Anti-Aging Retinol Daily Moisturizer SPF15 (morning application), and the combination seems to be working. My problem is that I am lazy! If one does not properly take the time to secure a routine, possible good rewards will not come. I do recommend this item for the price. I have experienced no cons. On the other hand, the eventual purchase of refills run into money. To avoid this one can purchase more expensive hand-held items that have different variable heads of all kinds, but are in the neighborhood of $200. So, for those who cannot afford the more expensive, this one will definitely benefit your complexion.</li>
    <li> Works fine, its a nice little machine, but I am not sure it did anything for my skin...</li>
    <li> I see the potential in this product, and my skin is less flaky and much more smooth immediately after using it, but it does nothing for my age spots as I had hoped.  Its just a good way to clean your face.  Its kind of annoyoing over bony areas, especially the forehead and nose.  It makes your whole head vibrate and makes me sneeze.</li>
    <li> This overpriced gadget is totally unnecessary.  I get comparable results at a far cheaper price with a buff pad, facial scrub, or an exfoliant.  It&#x27;s time consuming to use, is noisy, and the pads don&#x27;t always stay on.  If you don&#x27;t apply them to the unit in the exact and precise manner as described, they&#x27;ll slip off.  You only get a small supply of pads in the kit, so the customer must make additional purchases.  The pads are quite expensive, and there are no generic pads available.  I paid $34.95 for the gadget and $20 more for the pads.  Far too expensive for what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a quick process when you consider the time it takes to get the pad on and then applying the device in a circular motion to different sections of the face for minutes at a time.  My arm got tired.  And the noisy battery-operated unit was annoying.  Instructions on the box make it sound like it&#x27;s easy to use and affordable.  You have to buy the item and get more complete instructions inside the box to know how it works.  After you try it, you will ask yourself \\&quot;why?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return it to the store, but they wouldn&#x27;t take it back because it had been used.</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;m working on my second set of puffs, I thought I&#x27;d share my results. Just to give you an idea of my starting point- I get very little sleep as a result of grad school, sometimes I go on stretches of two weeks with less than 5 hours a sleep per night. This does not bode well for my skin, I break out under stress, I have blackheads the size of Russia, and my complexion is dull, rough, and discolored. I recently started freaking out, because I have what they call transition skin- I am noticing aging in my skin, but pimples keep appearing like fruit flies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give the rejuvenator a try because I remember going for peels at one point a while back and how they helped clear my skin. Patience is key! At first my skin seemed like it would break out more than usual, but I know it is typical for your first few peels, so I figured I would have to suck it up. The first person to notice change was my boyfriend. He kept repeating, \\&quot;Your skin is so nice! It is so clear!\\&quot; Score!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second batch of puffs and will continue to use this religiously. I rejuvenate every other day of the week (Mon, Wed, Fri), letting my skin rest over the weekend. I&#x27;ve been pairing it with the Neutrogena Tone Correcting Peel, but I have a feeling that wasn&#x27;t doing anything for me. I also use the 2-in-1 fight and fade gel to zap those pesky breakouts I had in the very beginning. Now I do very little maintenance on my skin! It looks clear, tight, and good! This gives me confidence ++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. I&#x27;m lazy and a minimalist, so I do not apply makeup... ever. This is a great product if you don&#x27;t like hiding under makeup.</li>
    <li> When I bought this I assumed the head would spin but it only vibrates.  My skin did feel better.  For the money I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  I have found an exfolient that is great and does a better job without having to buy a \\&quot;tool\\&quot; to apply it.  Try Dermalogic Multivitamin Thermafoliant.  It&#x27;s a little expensive but you use very little and just scrub like any exfoliant.  You can really tell the difference and I think a tube would last a year if you used it twice a week.</li>
    <li> The only facial scrub cleaner that I&#x27;ve found more effective than this is the sonic at Sephora - and that costs something like [...]  This little bargain honestly smooths out my face to be a soft as a ... well you know what!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first you may notice some blemishes you never had before; although that was never the case with me, my daughter complained at first that she had \\&quot;new zits.\\&quot;  Stick with it.  What you will notice within the first ten days for sure is that you have none of those little ugly blackheads, whiteheads, or hard as rock \\&quot;fatty\\&quot; bumps.  I also find (at 51) that it makes my fine lines and wrinkles appear more smooth.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase, and have given it as a gift to both of my twenty-something daughters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, the price on Amazon was FAR LESS than at Target or Walmart.  I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> For the price, it definitely does something.  It is not as effective as a salon microdermabrasion, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be. It is supposed to take the place of a scrub, and it is better than a scrub.  It&#x27;s easy to use, but don&#x27;t use a lot of pressure when you are massaging your face with it, because the first time it left my face burning and stinging.  Just use a gentle massaging motion at the same time the wand vibrates against your face.  I can see some difference for a day or two after I use it in my face being smoother and softer.  Maybe over time it will make a bigger difference.  I bought it as something to use in between getting a salon microdermabrasion, because that is a bit expensive most places.</li>
    <li> I have to say I never review products.  Never.  But after using this I feel the absolute need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this item at Wal-mart mid last year.  I looked at it for a few minutes, and decided that it was not worth the $20 price tag it carried at the time.  A few weeks later, I was back in the same area, getting more face wash, and I decided to just go for it.  What could it really hurt, I figured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised at how good my face felt after using this product though.  If for no other reason than because it feels like a massage, it is worth the money.  I do love that it makes my skin feel much more soft and smooth after use.  I have slacked off using it as much as I used to (and I should use it more often with as much as I like it), but that&#x27;s not due to the fact that the product is not what it claims to be; it&#x27;s more a laziness thing with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used or tried a Clarisonic facial system, but I can&#x27;t imagine that you can beat this product for under $30.  If you are looking for a cheap way to have a mini-spa moment, this is definitely the best route for you.</li>
    <li> Handy, convenient to use. Love the feel of my face after using the rejuvenar. Waiting in refill pads to arrive,</li>
    <li> All this thing does is vibrate in your hand.  If you have always wanted a vibrator and are too shy to buy one in a sex shop, this is the thing to get.  I thought I wanted to upgrade from the &#x27;wave&#x27; version of this product, but as soon as I turned it on, I immediately wanted to return it.  It&#x27;s kind of awkward holding a vibrator to your face and having your hand vibrate along with it.  I think I will stick to the &#x27;wave&#x27; version of this product.  The refills to this thing work with the &#x27;wave&#x27; product very nicely, so I can still go to my local drugstore and buy refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up, try to avoid getting the soap in your eyes at all costs.  It burns so much.  So much pain.  Ouch.</li>
    <li> This product delivers what it claims.  I had dry patches and dull looking skin as i approach 40 and this product really made a difference in my skin.  It got rid of the dry patches and deminished the size of my pores.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Did you know the Earth Therapeutics foam applicators fit AND their micro-exfoliation cream works well with this device? [[ASIN:B000K9Z3Y4 Foam Applicators- Dual Replenishment Pack]]  [[ASIN:B000K6KARM Green Tea Cellular Renewal Micro-Exfoliation Cream]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do I use them and the results are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one of these, love it but refuse to buy the ridiculously priced discontinued refills. I&#x27;ve been finding ways to get more life out of the device since the line has been discontinued and replacements/refills are scarce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 9/7/2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena recently started selling a [[ASIN:B004ZD2M6I Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System]] that&#x27;s a newer version of this item for TWENTY BUCKS or less AND [[ASIN:B004Z67NSM Neutrogena System Refill Puffs - 24 Count]] for EIGHTEEN BUCKS or less! The best thing is the new pads fit this Rejuvenator, older Microdermabrasion Systems and the Wave systems too!!!</li>
    <li> I have found that using your own fingers to massage the crystals into your skin is a lot more effective than using the vibrating puff applicator. All that stupid puff applicator does is absorb the product and make you use more of it. You can get better results, using much less product, without it. I apply the crystals with a little bit of water to massage my skin with it and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> As a man who does not use facial cleansers or beauty products of any kind, I can recommend this as fun and workable.  The batteries went in, and the treatment started, and I felt trepidation.  Machines touching my face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was easy to use, the discs felt pleasant on my skin, and the results are good.  My skin felt alive, as I was using the device, and after.  My wife claims my skin looks tighter and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she used it, I think it had a pleasant effect.  She has good skin, youthful, and this tightened it a bit, and enhanced the glow of her visage...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a thumbs up product, then, for a neophyte non-user guy and for a lovely woman who spends 20 minutes a day on her face... we both liked it!</li>
    <li> I think this is a pretty good product, but the refill pads I think are a bit pricey, and you have to order them online since they are impossible to find in any drugstore.  I think that the pads are on the harsh side, and you have to be careful that the pads are not too abrasive on your skin..  I have been using them for about a month now, and really dont see any particular difference in my sun spots yet, but I will keep it up.  All in all, This product is good, but no miracle.</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, Anti-Aging Power Treatment Kit consists of a hand held battery operated device which vibrates at either  low or high speed, with an attached single use cleansing pad.  The pad reminds me of a [[ASIN:B000FKJOJ8 Buf-Puf Single-Use Facial Sponges with Cleanser]] - if the Buf-Puf was attached to a power sander.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the instructions the treatment should be used for 1-2 minutes on each area of the skin, and can be used up to three times a week.  Honestly it&#x27;s hard for me to imagine the kind of facial skin that would benefit from this much exfoliation.  After one treatment, at considerably less than the recommended time, my face felt raw.  The vibration of the unit, which is supposed to increase circulation and promote collagen production, just felt uncomfortable and made my teeth ache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One recurring criticism of the kit has been the unavailability of replacement cleansing pads.  I can report that boxes of replacement pads are available at both Walgreens and CVS.  They are sold next to the packages with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this might be a fine product for occasional use, or for someone with very dry, flaky skin.  The concept is fun - however, the recommended regime seems excessive and just short of painful.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> The major differences I found between using this product and getting microdermabrasion at a spa were (1) price and (2) pampering. Additionally, this treatment was a bit gentler than the spa microdermabrasion; however, I like that it can be done at home a few times a week to maintain the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the drawbacks of spa treatment is that you end up spending a lot of money every few weeks or so if you want to keep the effects. Using this product as part of your regular personal care routine saves time and money while getting results that are almost as good as the professional treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will notice some effects instantly. From the first time I used the product my skin felt smoother and tighter. I have been using the Skin Rejuvenator for just over two weeks, and my skin is smoother. I have not noticed a reduction in small wrinkles, but it is really too soon to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are good instructions for using the product, but you should adjust them based on your skin. For example, if you skin is very sensitive, you will probably want to use it for a shorter time than the 1 - 2 minutes per area recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this better than many of the facial scrubs I have tried because the pads are not as messy and do a better job of smoothing away dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For just a little more than the cost of one spa treatment, you can use the Skin Rejuvenator for more than a year. That seems like a bargain to me!</li>
    <li> I got this skin treatment kit for my wife and she has used it off and on for about a month now.  It does do a lot of what it says it will do - the buffing/cleansing pads do remove dead skin and smooth facial skin nicely.  Her only complaint has been that the device itself is too rough.  The vibrations emanating from this battery powered unit are fierce!  There are two settings, and the high setting rattles your brains if you touch your face with it!  Even the lower setting borders on intolerable at times.  Maybe it was just us (yes I tried it too!) but it could have been just as effective if they toned down the vibrations a bit.  Anyway, I give it a 3.5 stars as a great idea that was not perfectly carried through into a great product.</li>
    <li> This a good product and works as advertised. I am careful about what I apply to my skin and try not to abuse my face with too many chemicals. I take care of it by just cleaning my face every night with water or gentle cleansers and moisturize it regularly. This is a product that I can adopt as it is convenient to use, fast, not at all messy and gives great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple to use, the abrasive pad sticks on to a head that goes onto the massager wand. Then you turn it on, to the low or high speed setting, and gently massage your face while the abrasive pad does the work to slough dead cells off your face. I found that not pressing too hard is better while moving the hand in circular motion in an upward direction. When you gently massage your face you&#x27;ll feel a tingling sensation as it gets \\&quot;rejuvenated\\&quot; .  I have good skin but it took on a luminous glow after using this product and also felt a little firmer right after the first try. It felt good after a week too, especially right after I use this massager on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying a good moisturizer right after just adds to the effect. I use [[ASIN:B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Concentrated Amino-Peptide Complex, Fragrance Free - 1.7 fl oz]]which is a fabulous, fabulous product. Light, non greasy and makes my skin very smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the Nuetrogena Rejuvenator as it is less messier than the other products like the microdermabrasion cream. It also seems to be gentler yet more effective than some other products out there. I&#x27;ll not be using this wand more than the recommended 2-3 times a week as I&#x27;ve found with previous experience that less is more to maintain  my skin. Due to the abrasive nature of the pads - despite their gentleness - I&#x27;ll also caution you from using it if you have very sensitive skin or acne prone skin. I do recommend this product if you have healthy skin and want a product which will take care of fine lines that start appearing post 35. I will post an update here after I&#x27;ve used it for a few more weeks.an update here after I&#x27;ve used it for a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> I watched Oprah&#x27;s favorite things this past holiday and really wanted to buy the massaging skin care system that she gave out to her audience - however at nearly $[...], I just couldn&#x27;t afford to spend that much.    Thank goodness for Nuetrogena!!  The rejuvenator does exactly what I thought it would and for a price that I was thrilled with...  Immediately after I used it, my skin felt the softest it had ever felt before and my face really did feel refreshed.  I loved the massage that it gave my face and the scrubbing pads weren&#x27;t too harsh at all.  When I was done, I put an oil-fee moisturizer on my face and went to bed.  I absolutely loved it and look forward to using it again.  I am hooked!!</li>
    <li> I hate to use anything to wash my face other than my hands. But I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting as good as a cleaning as my face needed. With so many face cleaning products on the market and most not living up to expectations, I figured I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal to sensitive skin. When my skin was feeling more sensitive, I didn&#x27;t use the product. I had no issues using the treatment. I liked the smell and the gentle pressure. The soap is just right -- neither too bubbly nor too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pad doesn&#x27;t feel soft or like a massage -- more running a rough shower sponge over your face. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or get uncomfortable -- I imagine the roughness will bother people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face felt good after using it. I&#x27;m fortunate I have soft skin on my face, so it was already soft. I have some brown spots on my cheek (I am not 40 yet!) and the cleanser didn&#x27;t lighten those. My face looked the same the next day. So the effects are temporary -- like having given your face a good cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low and high settings felt fine on me. Although they might be too harsh for some. I adjusted the setting to low when going around the eyes and sensitive areas. Then back on high for regular areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Thorough cleansing&lt;br /&gt;* Nice scent&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;* Just buy replacement pads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Rough&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t decrease pore size, wrinkles, and age spots as promised.&lt;br /&gt;* Lack of various types of pads (sensitive, oily, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t decided if I will buy replacement pads yet as I haven&#x27;t found them in the store to check the price. But if the price is reasonable, it&#x27;s a nice product for a good cleansing that I use twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Score: 3.5</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now. I really love it. I&#x27;m a 47 year old reforming sun lover. I have sun spots and freckles galore. This treatment is lightening my sun spots and freckles, but what surprised me was what it did for my crows feet! After the first use I was amazed at how my crows feet were much less noticable.     Easy to use, the battery powered system applicator was easy to hold. I use it for about 5 min. on my entire face. The directions say to use it for \\&quot;1 to 2 minutes per facial area.\\&quot; Velcro holds the thin puff to the applicator head. The puff has a pre-measured amount of crystals and purifiers on it already. All you do is wet it. I must warn you not to soak it, or you will have water dripping down your face.     The applicator head vibrates, to me it feels like a gentle massage on your face. I really enjoyed the feeling. When you are finished just remove the puff from the velcro and toss it. Easy! I also received a $3 rebate for the puff refill in my kit.</li>
    <li> This product may be great for older people, but it made me break out worse than I ever have.  I used it for a few weeks to see if anything would happen, and it didn&#x27;t.  Yes my skin was softer, but I didn&#x27;t start to see any results that were worth the continuation of use.  I don&#x27;t not recommend the product, it just did not work for my skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love, love, love this thing.  I&#x27;ll admit, scrubbing my face with this has become an absolute addiction, but my skin looks so glowing and everyone notices how fresh-faced I am after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing can compare to professional scrubbing and microdermabrasion, but this thing works great for in-between to get excellent results from an at-home kit.  I find that this scrubber gives me better results than the at-home microdermabrasion kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how soft and silky smooth the \\&quot;soap\\&quot; on these pads leaves my skin and it smells wonderful, too.  I have sensitive skin and this has reduced my breakouts, significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, NEVER discontinue this item.  It is my favorite beauty product on the market and I adore it.  Every woman should give this a try.  (My husband loves it, too)</li>
    <li> The pads are rough and not very foamy.  My face was red after using.  I would never use 3 times a week as recommended.  Maybe once a week for half the time recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She loves it, but I have been looking for the pads at all of our local stores that sell Neutrogena. I can&#x27;t find them anywhere! I e-mailed Neutrogena, and they told me that I can find Neutrogena products at most drug stores, Target and WalMart. Of course, but where do I find THIS product? I asked that question in another e-mail, and never heard back. I would not buy this product unless you want to buy the pads online, or actually see the pads at a store near you. There are several other products on the marked that probably work as well.</li>
    <li> Oh this is fantastic! I also own the other face exfoliator from Neutrogena that requires the purchase of a sponge and the exfoliating cream, totaling about $35 for refills of both and while it was a bit messy and it worked okay, it doesn&#x27;t compare to this! This stuff is truly great, the pods are easy to use, they Velcro in and once wet, massage the face in a seamless manner, I enjoyed the ease and comfort while my face felt like glass. After first use my skin looked like it was air brushed, which is before I even applied makeup.    In fact, okay this sounds crazy, but my boyfriend asked me if I need to take a pregnancy test because I had this ethereal glow on my face. I had to break it to him that it was a face scrub! Sounds ridiculous but it made me laugh, this is one product where I feel for once will not disappoint me. This really produced results, I haven&#x27;t seen my face this clear ever. Another thing is how often this can be used, I no longer have to wait days to have this smooth skin, not to mention my face serum and cream sinks in like a dream, waking up with clear and smooth skin with a glow is so easy now.    - Kasia S.</li>
    <li> I outsourced this review to my mother. Although a brilliant woman, she is sometimes baffled by devices and technology. I didn&#x27;t hear from her for some time and finally she confessed that she couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get the pads on the vibrating doohickey. So I repossessed the device and tested it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, apologies to my dear mama, its not terribly complicated to get the pad on the doohickey. You simply attach the velcro thingy to the doohickey and then attach the velcroey side of the pad to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thereafter the major challenge is in avoiding the dripping from the pad landing in your eyes. After use, the pores on my forehead felt noticeable cleaner and tighter. Visually, it left my skin pinkish for a while, so you may not want to use this product right before stepping out on the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads can be used two, maybe three times before being replaced depending on how long you clean each time. I can&#x27;t say that some of the more extravagant claims for this product or for facials generally were readily evident, but it does seem like a very good exfoliating product. It is certainly stimulating having the massaging action on your face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to confess that I have never had a spa facial, so I have no idea whether the cost justifies itself. But if it is comparable, then the cost seems very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!    As an active mom, my skincare regime was limited to washing my face at night before bed, and once in a while using a mask to help purify pores and tighten skin.  Then I bought the Neutrogena Skin Rejuvenator and it&#x27;s really made a difference in how my skin looks and feels. I still just wash my face before bedtime, but then I use the applicator with a scrubbing pad and give my face the once-over. It takes only a few minutes and my face feels cleaner and --get this-- RELAXED-- by the massaging power of the vibrating applicator.  I used to have dark circles under my eyes, but the massaging action coupled with the exfoliation pads improved the skin under my eyes remarkably! It improved circulation and skin tone within a matter of two weeks of recommended use (3x a week with the pads-- every other day) I actually took 10 years off my appearance (so says my husband). I wish I could show you a &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; photo! It didn&#x27;t actually remove my wrinkles, but it did smooth them out a little as circulation improved in my skin and collagen was able to rebuild itself there. My friends have noticed the difference too and at least one of them has gone out and bought the product for herself!    While the pads might seem rough on your skin at first, usually this is because your skin is not used to being scrubbed. But the pads really aren&#x27;t harsh at all and you adjust the pressure and length of time that you use the applicator. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the micro-dermabraision cream and pad that can be used with the applicator though-- the fine crystals actually caused my pores to clog and if you get any of the cream in your eyes when rinsing, you can scratch your corneas.     Overall, I would recommend the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator to everyone.</li>
    <li> This exfoliator leaves you with smoother softer skin in just one treatment!  I love this!</li>
    <li> My wife swears by the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System.  If these keep her looking beautiful and young, then I&#x27;m all in!  She has had one now for several years now, and loves it.  When it turned up missing, we had to get a new one.  (Turned out daughter loves it as well!)</li>
    <li> do not believe what they promise you. A complete waste of money so do not buy. Get so,mething musch less expensive from your local pharmacy</li>
    <li> I have this device (actually, the original one that came with a jar of microdermabrasion crystal cream).  I started seeing raves about the foreo luna; especially how it&#x27;s silicone &amp;#34;touch points&amp;#34; do not require replacement like Clarsonic etc.  Rather than invest $$$ in yet another cleaning system, I decided to adapt this one.  The Neutrogena head uses Velcro, so I devised a silicone head to attach.  You need: Velcro (opposit side loop/hook) from that on the unit head, a silicone scrubber (sephora, loreal 360, various Amazon), Loctite 2 part epoxy.  Trace a circle as template to cut your Velcro and scrubber, use one of the disposable Neutrogena pads for size.  Silicone is REALLY hard to bond, good surface prep and the adhesive you choose are key.  I cleaned silicone with acetone, mixed epoxy per instructions, spread a thin layer of epoxy on the back of the scrubber and the Velcro, held together, then pressed under a heavy book for 2 days. AWSOME, gentle, reuseable solution... Loving it!</li>
