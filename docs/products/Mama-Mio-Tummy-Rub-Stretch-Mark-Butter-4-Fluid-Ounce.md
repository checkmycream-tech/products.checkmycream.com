    <li> This product is fabulous. Highly recommend. It helps to keep skin soft and comfortable during your entire pregnancy. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love the Mama Mio products- truly the best products I have found during pregnancy and after. I have incredibly sensitive skin that is really easily irritated. I&#x27;m allergic to sulfates and that allergy is exaggerated during pregnancy. My skin becomes itchy, bumpy, and eventually breaks out in hives. Mama Mio&#x27;s products are the only thing I can use.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that stretch marks are completely preventable but this is a great tummy butter that certainly helps with the stretching and makes your skin look amazing! i used Mama Mio products through out my first pregnancy religiously and still got a few stretch marks. Still I love this tummy butter and like I said- it definitely helps. I highly recommend this to anyone- pregnant or not.</li>
    <li> Bought this 3 times to try and prevent stretch marks, ladies don&#x27;t stress it!</li>
    <li> Both my mother And grandmother had stretch marks. I use this the whole pregnancy and did not get stretch marks so I&#x27;m a happy girl!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tummy butter and I use it all over my body!  I have some light marks on my legs but zero on my stomach!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get as many stretch marks as I probably should have, thanks to this product!</li>
    <li> I used this product religiously. I had my baby in early May and I have stretch marks on my waist and my belly. I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure that if I would&#x27;ve not use this product I might&#x27;ve had more stretch marks. However, I&#x27;m starting to think that the cheaper and older alternative would&#x27;ve probably worked as well. Good old fashion generic cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> Found this product on a trip to NY and loved the fact it&#x27;s not sticky or oily which I found so many were.</li>
    <li> The Mama Mio products are exceptional, they are nice and smooth, smell great, and keep my skin feeling hydrated not itchy.  It was recommended to me by a friend and now I am so happy I purchased it.  I am using the Stretch Mark Butter in combination with the oil in my last tri-mester for the big stretch.  So far looks good, no new stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I have used the Tummy Rub and the oil for my belly since finding out I was pregnant and have ZERO stretch marks! I have two weeks to go and I just bought more for after pregnancy so it will help get my belly back to being tone. I will use this again and again. Great product!</li>
    <li> Works and feels great!  No stretch marks and super hydrating.  Definitely recommend for pregnancy and 4 months postpartum.  Will purchase for gifts.</li>
    <li> Used this daily while I was pregnant! After having the baby I am stretch mark free!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. So moisturizing .  This isu first pregnancy , 5-1/2 months so far. No stretch marks yet.  And my second bottle.  I&#x27;ll prob buy more</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE this product. I have been using this lotion twice a day for my entire pregnancy. I am now 7 1/2 months along and have no stretch marks. Some say its genetics, some say its lotion, I don&#x27;t care -- I am not going to risk it and stray from this product. Plus it smells wonderful! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve hear wonderful reviews on this product. I bought several as a gift for friends. So I can&#x27;t remark on the actual quality. But the box was scrunched up by time it reached me. So if you want to send it as a gift, maybe not the way to buy it.</li>
    <li> For me this worked fabulously! I have used the butter every night before bed together with the oil every morning after shower since about 4-5 months of pregnancy. I did not get a single stretch-mark. Of course we will never know how much this products really contributed... but it is of great quality and also helped with itching a lot. I feel like it definitely did great things for my skin.</li>
    <li> Currently no stretch marks to be seen on belly or hips. Thought I would have some by now as I usually get them on thighs etc.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I don&#x27;t like it after using the cream it makes me feel very uncomfortable within. Very unusual.</li>
    <li> I used this twice a day since five weeks  pregnant.  I am 34 weeks pregnant and got stretch marks.  This did not help and was very expensive.  I&#x27;m bummed.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product. It&#x27;s a little pricey but well worth the price. Everyone In my family has stretch marks. i am very small and got very large during my pregnancy was very worried about stretch marks. I used this religiously from about 12 weeks combined with vitamin e oils. I would apply 3 -4 times a day. I did not end up with Any stretch marks. : )</li>
    <li> I love this product.  A friend of mine gave me the travel size when I was first starting to show.  I quickly learned with wearing pregnancy full band pants all day my old lotion would cause my tummy to itch by the end of the day.  This product keeps my tummy feeling hydrated and very soft all day long.  I recommend this product to everyone who is expecting.  Another plus, I&#x27;m almost 7 months pregnant and no stretch marks!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite preggers butter. Love the smell and consistency. It really stays on and works well.</li>
    <li> I have two friends that used this product religiously and still got stretch marks. I purchased before I saw their bellies, bc they raved about it at the beginning. Diet, nutrition, genetics, steady weight gain will work the best. Moisturizing will definitely help. I feel this product is over rated and those who don&#x27;t get the best results don&#x27;t come back and give feedback. Pleasant smell. Thick. Will need a lot to cover belly, hips, thighs, and breast.</li>
    <li> I used this along with the Mamma Mio oil during my first pregnancy and loved it!! No stretch marks and my stomach, sides and legs look great! Smells awesome and leaves your skin feeling smooth! Would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> No stretch marks! Awesome. Apply 2 times a day 😊</li>
