    <li> This is my first time trying this shampoo.  I must say its wonderful.  I received several compliments about my hair the day that I used it.  I didn&#x27;t purchase the conditioner that pairs with it, instead I purchased another recommended leave in conditioner that works perfectly with it.  5 starts from me!</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo product out there.</li>

    <li> I love this product. But I paid the same for just this shampoo as I did for the duo. Next time I will just get the Duo.</li>
    <li> this product delivers, honestly haven&#x27;t had any shampoo that i really liked other then neutrogena, pantenne that i thought delivered.

    <li> Shampoo reeked of plastic to the extent that we wound up not even being able to use it. Smelled as if it had been stored for a while in a non temperature moderated environment and then shipped</li>
    <li> I have been using Matrix for years now and it&#x27;s the best&lt;br /&gt;for the price.  Leaves hair clean, soft and smooth looking</li>

    <li> I like the smell of this shampoo. It&#x27;s is a big bottle so I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying it more often.</li>
    <li> There are more expensive shampoos out there, and we do like the quality of this brand and item, but it is a bit pricey.</li>
