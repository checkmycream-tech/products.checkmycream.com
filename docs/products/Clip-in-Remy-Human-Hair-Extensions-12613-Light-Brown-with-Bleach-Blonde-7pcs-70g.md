      <li>This one is much more hair for the money.</li>
      <li>I would say maybe 8 weeks or more .  </li>

      <li>You absolutely need 2 packs fora while head, but they&#x27;re great.</li>
      <li>It might be good for adding some thickness, but hardly worth the hassle.  </li>
      <li>now n love them every time I get them</li>
      <li>I love these-</li>
      <li>was very excited to receive these and after spending all the time putting them in, I tried to curl them and they wouldn&#x27;t hold a curl at all, and began to melt to the curling iron.</li>
      <li>The quality and look is good, but the clips didn&#x27;t work at first with my thinning hair.</li>
      <li>My friend is so excited to wear them to a wedding this weekend!</li>
      <li>it is gorgeous and a good quantity especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>They are very soft and they blend great.</li>
      <li>As you have read they are made for someone with more fine hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> For everyone who thought this hair was real for $14 you are wrong. Real human hair typically ranges from $50 to $300. I have got real human hair extensions because I go through one every week before it gets knotted and it is cheaper for someone who wants to wear extensions typically without it getting knotted.</li>
    <li> Love these for the price I paid... color matched,length was great and curled really well. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> They are super thin but they due great, I just dyed mine yesterday and it took the color in really well, but what people don&#x27;t know there is a way you have to dye them😊</li>
    <li> The color of the light brown/bleach blonde blends much better than the picture shows.  Some reviewers said it wasn&#x27;t real hair, but I believe it is. It looks good clipped in but I&#x27;d rather have something more permanent, so I am taking the clips out and ordered some toupee tape after reading a DIY tape-in extension video on you tube that did the same. I have thin hair and thought I could get away with one package. You will be happier with two packages even if your hair is thin. I also ordered a package of the $69 tape-in extensions. This one is much more hair for the money. The other hair may be a little healthier, but it would cost 8x as much because it is more expensive and you&#x27;d need to buy 4 packs to get a decent volume. I think the hair quality of these extensions is very good for the money.</li>
    <li> A little tough to keep from tangling</li>
    <li> I have purchased many clip in extension sets in the past spending between $90-300 for each set. These by far have been the best quality of clip in extensions I&#x27;ve ever bought. The only reason I convinced my self to purchase these was so I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money if my hair was still too short to wear extensions and have them not blend. After reading reviews I purchased two sets which I highly recommend if you have a medium thickness of hair.  They blended I&#x27;m perfectly with my hair and yes the other reviews are correct they are not a solid brown and solid blonde. There are several shades of blonde going on with a hue of light brown and strawberry blonde. They do not &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; as I&#x27;ve also read, they smell like hair color. They feel like human hair and compared to my hair were a tad shiny but that&#x27;s because my hair has been majorly processed, remy is Virgin hair. I&#x27;ve washed conditioned and styled these with a straightening and curling iron on high heat with no melting whatsoever. Just like your hair you should use a heat glide on them and repairing conditioner if using heat. They came with extra clips incase one were to fall out or be damaged and I had no issues with any &amp;#34;stray&amp;#34; hairs falling out.</li>
    <li> Love love love these!!!! Been buying these for about 9 months now n love them every time I get them :) feel soft n silky and might be a little longer than 15inches, more like 16/17 inches..</li>
    <li> The color was so much lighter than I anticipated. I tried to color them, but the color didn&#x27;t take on the blonde high-lights. They are rather thin, but buildable. I wish I would have ordered a darker color, but they appeared my color in the description.</li>
    <li> They are not light brown with bleach. They are red with bleach.</li>
    <li> perfect amount of hair. Product exactly as described. A complete steal. Match perfect with my highlighted hair, looks so natural.</li>
    <li> Gross looking then when I went to return it I had to pay shipping</li>
    <li> Alot thinner then I expected. But ok.</li>
    <li> Product it&amp;#34;s exactly as promissed. It is very soft and it does feel just like my own hair. It does not have a particular smell as some reviewers wrote. It is about 30 inches wide and 15 in  long. Clips feel very sturdy. I just bought them because I am losing a lot of hair and wanted to get a head full of hair. Only one pack was more than enough. I just wished it had came with care and how to put them on instructions.</li>
    <li> Color is way off. Hsir wasc all kinked and wrinkled</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Could not style at all, too straight , looked fake, and too slippery to handle.</li>
    <li> This is not human hair, and I ordered two but only received one. Wtf.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a friend that wanted them. They are amazing! I have had 3 different sets of extensions that all cost around the same price. These are by far the best quality I have seen.  We both have fine hair,  which makes them blend perfectly. My friend is so excited to wear them to a wedding this weekend! I will be buying some for myself!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
    <li> Una estrella por no poder dar cero</li>
    <li> hair was dyeable cut to my liking and wear them everyday...</li>
    <li> My hair was too thin for these clips and I also had to put between a towel to iron out the folds from packaging.cannot flat iron hair will melt</li>
    <li> Its lighter and thinner than the pic</li>
    <li> I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE I HALF TO GIVE THEM EVEN ONE STAR.THEY SENT ME HAIR THAT IS SO FAKE IT LOOKS PLASTIC.MY GIRS DOLLS HAIR IS MORE REAL.I HAVE BEEN DOIND HAIR FOR YEATS AND I CAN TELL FAKE HAIR.WELL U DON&#x27;T HALF TO KNOW ANYTHING TO SEE THIS. HAIR.I CANT BELIVE THEY WOULD SEND THIS TO ME.I SAW SOME PIC OF PEOPLES THAT. HAVE THEM 3 STARS THE HAIR DIDN&#x27;T LOOK HALF AS BAD.IM GOING BACK TO WHO I ALWAYS ORDER FROM.THEY JUST DIDN&#x27;T HAVE 15 &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love them my only complaint is how the ends where cut they just didn&#x27;t look like they were professionally done other then that loved them</li>
    <li> Buyer beware NOT HUMAN HAIR AS ADVERTISED DO NOT BUY ITS CHEAP PLASTIC</li>
    <li> I have expensive ones and these look just as good!!!</li>
    <li> Best hair extensions. I love them so much. They are so soft and look real. I will be purchasing lotssss more!!</li>
    <li> I have really, really thick hair and these just added enough to make my hair more voluptuous. Some people say that they would buy two, but really I couldn&#x27;t imagine another set of these quality clip-ins on my head. I have curled, washed, and straightened my set and they look just as good as when I took them out of the package! I keep mine in just a ziploc baggie, which I&#x27;m not sure helps them, but its easy storage. The color match my hair perfect, it was even kinda creepy how perfect the match was! These were my first set of extensions, ever! Best buy and even better deal!</li>
    <li> i absolutely LOVE these extensions!!&lt;br /&gt;a little more blonde than the picture but other than that the clips are amazing and it blends really good :D</li>
    <li> 100% NOT human hair. Even though I followed directions, I&#x27;m still having a difficult time trying to curl these extensions.</li>
    <li> Liked.just did not blend well.</li>
    <li> Not real hair!! It doesn&#x27;t curl  ..very thick  and the color was way lighter than the picture</li>
    <li> love love love. my first set of extension so I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for them since I wasn&#x27;t sure. These came in perfect if my hair was still full of blonde highlights but not so much. However I dyed them myself when I did my natural hair. Match perfectly now.</li>
    <li> These were amazing I love them so much I have heard a lot of reviews saying they are a little thin but for me they were perfect and my hair is pretty thick but they still seemed to work perfectly fine I really recommend buying these I personally think the only problem was how big the clips were maybe it was just my hair but the clips were very thick and it took a while to cover them up with my hair but overall I deffinetly would but this product again.</li>
    <li> This is not all real hair. The slightest bit of heat from a blow dryer and it cinched right up like plastic, which I&#x27;m sure it is :(</li>
    <li> If your reading this- don&#x27;t do it! There&#x27;s nothing worse than disappointing hair extensions. I figured for the money they would be OK. I read a lot of reviews before buying these and I thought they would be decent. First off- they are NOT real hair. They are advertised as real virgin hair. They literally look like Barbie hair. They are plasticy and really difficult to cut. Second- they say you can use heat on them and you cannot. After spending 2 hours cutting them I tried curling them. What an epic failure! These barely crease when on a hot iron for 30 seconds. They send them so stick straight they don&#x27;t blend with your hair, and then you can&#x27;t do anything about it. The ONLY plus side to these is the price and amount you get. They are garbage and didn&#x27;t even make it to 1 use for me.</li>
    <li> The extensions are very thin at the ends,</li>
    <li> bad quality its no real hair!!</li>
    <li> My wife ordered two of this &amp;#34;human hair extension&amp;#34; only to find out that it is cheap plastic extensions. They look so ugly and fake that she threw them in the garbage. Huge waste of money and deceiving listing and product title!</li>
    <li> No no no don&#x27;t waste your money please</li>
    <li> The product I received was not even close to human hair. I thought it felt funny but took them to my stylist anyways because I don&#x27;t have time to get new ones as I&#x27;m getting married in 3 days, as soon as she put heat to them to curl them, they melted, immediately. Even fake hair these days are high quality enough to curl most of the time. In the trash these go and now I am rushing to find new REAL extensions.</li>
    <li> Best extensions I&#x27;ve ever gotten for the price!  My hair is thin, and these gave me just the right amount of fullness without looking over exaggerated.  Color blended perfect with my highlighted hair.  They wash well and curl beautifully.  I will order more as soon as I can, just to keep them on hand.  They are sincerely the best ones I have ever ordered.</li>
    <li> NOT HUMAN HAIR!!!!! It&#x27;s synthetic... Looks like Barbie doll hair and you can not put heat to it!</li>
    <li> Very silky and doesn&#x27;t shed (yet). But it is very very thin... So yes like others said may want to buy two. For thin hair one set it good but sewing an additional set over would be better.</li>
    <li> I bought these just to try it out. 70g is thin but my natural hair is thin so it looked natural and matched my hair perfectly. I&#x27;ve washed and reused them several times with no problem. I even dyed them recently to match my new hair color and they took the color well and still look great.</li>
    <li> Was the wrong length and not real human hair. Color was great though</li>
    <li> was very excited to receive these and after spending all the time putting them in, I tried to curl them and they wouldn&#x27;t hold a curl at all, and began to melt to the curling iron. NOT REAL HAIR. Very disappointed in the false advertising.</li>
    <li> I love the color and texture of it ...matches my hair perfectly! Will order another one soon, maybe longer or in another color.</li>
    <li> These were not as authentic as I thought.  But pretty anyway.</li>
    <li> Extensions would not color!</li>
    <li> Very displeased with the color. Looks like blonde and brown in picture but what I received was white and blonde</li>
    <li> Ehhhh might be good for a fun Halloween add on.</li>
    <li> This took forever to get to my address ... I would say maybe 8 weeks or more .  The hair was nice but it was not enough to put in my hair I really needed more extensions then what I got . I would recommend buying these in person so you know what your getting .</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get these it&#x27;s a complete waist of money</li>
    <li> As you&#x27;ve read, the hair is thin, but I have somewhat fine hair so it was a perfect balance! My \\&quot;hair\\&quot; looked thick and beautiful! They will be great for my wedding day. Of course I&#x27;ll have to dye them to match my hair color, but other than that, I am very pleased! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try this because I have very, very short hair and I was hoping these would be helpful to me. I don&#x27;t believe the other reviews on here are real due to how bad the outcome was of these, and honestly, I&#x27;ve NEVER been the type to critic so harshly but these really were bad. It&#x27;s like barbie hair. So disappointed. To good to be true.</li>
    <li> The hair quality is good, but the was color too light for my hair color.  The price is very reasonable though.</li>
    <li> The color was lighter than expected but it worked. The hair was decent quality for the price. Happy with delivery.</li>
    <li> These are NOT what are described. They are NOT human hair, I also ordered 15&amp;#34; and got 22&amp;#34;. When I tried to curl them they melted. They might be okay for someone that wants to leave them straight. But these are NOT a Remy Brand extensions and they are not human hair. The description for this product need to be changed.</li>
    <li> NOT HUMAN HAIR. Do not straighten. Do not wear out in 90 degree heat. Do not wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality except for if you plan on actually using them.</li>
    <li> Really thin,need two packages. Hair and color look good though.</li>
    <li> This are very nice extensions. Can curl, straighten but cannot be dyed. I have black hair and heard so many good reviews. Someone said it can be dyed but I actually tried. It didn&#x27;t dye at all. was disappointed about that. But other then that these extensions are fantastic. Just wish it could be dyed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased hair extensions and thought these would be great for starting out. However, they do not curl. I turned the heat higher on my curling iron and tried again.... Now one section is fried! They must not be real hair or they&#x27;d curl!</li>
    <li> perfect color for my own hair, true picture...</li>
    <li> These extensions are absolutely beautiful!! I was slightly worried when I saw some sour reviews, but when I got my hair in the mail I was beyond pleased. They are a steal at this price- absolutely beautiful and amazing quality! My only note is that they are more ash blonde with highlights then brown... I am a blonde so it&#x27;s not a problem! Also mine don&#x27;t curl but maybe it&#x27;s my curling iron. My hair is straight so it&#x27;s okay!</li>
    <li> Horrible, looked like plastic &amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34; hair!  The &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; highlights were gray! Threw the purchase in trash. Not even a one star rating.</li>
    <li> Very nice, a little lighter than pictured but still matched my hair enough. They are thin if you are using them for full head extensions. I bought mine to add to my hair for volume and a little length when I put my hair in those cool pinterest braids, they work great for that!</li>
    <li> There is no way that these are human hair.&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it an extra star because they blended with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I straightened them once and they are like straw. You also can&#x27;t dye them.&lt;br /&gt;And they don&#x27;t curl either.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed with them. Don&#x27;t say they are human hair when they are equal to a barbies hair.</li>
    <li> I love them you can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s not my real hair(:</li>
    <li> a bit intimidating to put in on my own!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked them to...</li>
    <li> They were brown instead of light brown with highlights</li>
    <li> I ordered the light brown with blonde highlights. What arrived is all one color..more of a dark strawberry blonde. Also, this is NOT real hair. It&#x27;s shiny doll hair. You get what you pay for...try using some dry shampoo or baby powder to lesson the fake shine.</li>
    <li> Ok. Hair is nice, no issue with melting like I read on some reviews. Unfortunately, they are completely resistant to dye and the highlights are really dang light. I have light brown hair and I bought a box of loreal dye to color my hair and the extensions, but yeah, the extensions didn&#x27;t take the dye at all and I left the dye in for almost an hour. Pretty bummed about that. So now I either need to put highlights in my hair to match or buy darker extensions. Also I received 22&amp;#34; not 15&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s okay since I planned to cut them regardless. Cut them and put them in with my hair and curled it all together, I used my curling iron on the low setting and didn&#x27;t have any issues getting them to take a slight curl which is what I was going for. If you&#x27;re hair is highlighted or blonde these are a good buy, but if you plan to dye them to match, don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a waste of time. I bought two sets, if you&#x27;re going for a long style and you have short hair two sets may be necessary, as they are fairly thin. If you are going for added volume, one is probably sufficient.</li>
    <li> This is definitely real hair. It&#x27;s very light colored which worked for me because my beautician was able to color-highlight it a little darker. They are very thin, not much hair in each extension, but the clips work well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light, easy to use, and works perfectly with my thin hair. I also dyed it a couple shades darker to match my hair, and it worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> You absolutely need 2 packs fora while head, but they&#x27;re great. I colored mine blue to match my hair and they took way better than any brand I&#x27;ve ever tried,  and are cheap. Cosmetologist approved.</li>
    <li> Great color... Received very quickly.  I did order 15&amp;#34; and the plastic covering it said 15&amp;#34;.  But the inside said 22&amp;#34;.  Not a big deal.  Just had to cut it down.  Very pleased</li>
    <li> I order a lot of items through Amazon so I hope it counts when I say, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.  That being said I have thin hair and this is thin thin. Also I got the wrong color reddish brown no blonde highlights and the it ships from China!</li>
    <li> I bought these at this highlighted color because it&#x27;s what color my hair was at the time. Since I was under the impression this was &amp;#34;real human hair&amp;#34;  and the description says they can be dyed, I dyed them the reddish brown color my hair is and none of the dye stuck... not one bit. Don&#x27;t advertise real hair if it&#x27;s fake.!!!</li>
    <li> Very good ! 100% human hair.</li>
    <li> These are awful. They&#x27;re not real human hair. At all. I tried to dye then and it didn&#x27;t work because synthetic hair won&#x27;t take the dye. It&#x27;s synthetic hair no not buy.</li>
    <li> the extentions are thin and i have thick hair. so after i ordered this set i tried it and it looked thin so i ordered another set. now it&#x27;s thick and amazing! :) so if you have thick hair..go for 2 sets!</li>
    <li> They are very soft and they blend great. Perfect color but I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 70grams its thin. I just purchased my second set just to have it just in case:) I was doubting on buying these just because I wanted to purchase ones that were 200 dollars but I needed to experience hair extensions first and I truly did loved them, great price for a great product:)</li>
    <li> Second time receiving wrong item, ridiculous. 22in clips with two different labels.</li>
    <li> They are not real human hair.  I bought these to thicken up my hair for my wedding day.  I will have to buy new ones since these are fake and melt I&#x27;m the curling iron and cannot be dyed.  Gave two stars b/c they are good for being half plastic.  I&#x27;m very disappointed that the description of the product is false</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s blonde and thin. I ordered brown! They can&#x27;t even get the colors right....Don&#x27;t even cover my whole head... wtf!</li>
    <li> These were pretty thin.  If you have medium to thick hair, you&#x27;ll need probably 3 sets.</li>
    <li> Too thin to wear unless your hair is already that length.  It might be good for adding some thickness, but hardly worth the hassle.  The color was much lighter than I expected, more blonde than dark brown.</li>
    <li> My order came within the time frame Amazon estimated.  Wasn&#x27;t tangled or anything and was the correct length and pretty much the same thickness all the way to the bottom.  The brown is a little redder than I expected and the blonde isn&#x27;t as light, but other than that the color is pretty close.  I was able to use a hair straightener and curling iron on low heat without damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is thin, but it clearly says it&#x27;s 70g, which isn&#x27;t enough for a full head.  If you&#x27;re just looking to add a little volume and not much length, or if you&#x27;re looking to add highlights to your hair, this is the perfect amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to mention that I&#x27;m not entirely sure if this is human hair or not because it seems a little shiny.  It&#x27;s not like barbie hair or anything, though, it&#x27;s a decent quality heat resistant synthetic if it is synthetic.  If you&#x27;re looking for human hair with no exceptions or you&#x27;re planning on dying it, I might buy something else.</li>
    <li> I love these- the color in them is a little lighter than pictured- especially the blond. It is nearly platinum. Overall, very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered light brown. I received light blonde.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I wanted. The quality seems to be good except one of the clips is broken. (Which isn&#x27;t a big deal because I can fix it)  But the problem is the wrong color was sent to me. I ordered brown with blonde highlights and got strawberry blond with no highlights so they really look funky in my hair. I was so excited to get them. I&#x27;m kinda disappointed.</li>
    <li> These extensions are an excellent product that are just as described.  It is a generous quantity of hair, particularly considering the price.  The hair arrived in 8 days, weeks ahead of the scheduled delivery date.  The China vendor must have a distributor in California for the blond hair.  The color is a perfect blend of medium brown and blond and all of excellent quality.  There are 7 pieces with plenty of high quality hair on each one.  I have fine thin hair and there is almost as much hair in this package as I have on my entire head.  The reviewers that say it is a small amount must have really thick full hair and don&#x27;t really need extensions to begin with....  Just four pieces on my head, the four smallest pieces, make a Hugh amount of difference for my hair and makes it seem twice as thick and blends in perfectly with my hair.  There is no way I can even put the four clip and three clip pieces in my hair, they are too heavy and too large for my hair and head to hold.  I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews, they must be from a competitor or ladies with thick gorgeous hair to begin with, this is a great deal.  It was, in fact, a bad review with the picture of the larger piece that needed combing that convinced me to buy this package of hair.  Mine came in great shape and not the least bit tangled and it combs very nicely and curls as well.  It is a fantastic deal and doesn&#x27;t look anything like \\&quot;barbie hair\\&quot; as another reviewer said, if it is not real hair it is a darn good imitation.  I believe it IS real hair as it feels just like my own and has split ends and all...it is gorgeous and a good quantity especially for the price.  Some vendors charge this much for just one small piece with only one clip.  This is a fantastic deal.</li>
    <li> Recieved in just a few weeks although timeline was 6 weeks. Lighter in color than pic, but that is a good thing. Petfect match! Good quality and great price. Extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> This hair color is great &amp; matches perfectly although the hair kind of looks stringy &amp; doesn&#x27;t have enough hair per clip section. I have thin fine hair &amp; it adds length &amp; volume well.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;The color was lighter than the picture, but super easy to dye at your local hair salon. Will order again</li>
    <li> If you read the other reviews, you already know: These are very thin.  I wanted to add some OOMPH to my hair for photoshoots without investing in $200 extensions (like my last ones which some B stole--who does that!?).  The color on these is GREAT and will mix in nicely with many shades of dirty blonde.  As mentioned, they are VERY thin.  If you want really full hair, I&#x27;d recommend getting two sets and sewing them together.  While I only have the one set, I did this with my 2-clip and 3-clip pieces--removed the clips on one of each and sewed it on top of the other piece.  While a tiny bit on the bulky side what with 2 cloth strips where the hair attaches, if placed in the hair well, these look great and require fewer clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want thick, lush extensions and you want to put no effort into re-sewing clips, just save up another month or two and buy more expensive ones from the store where you can match your hair just right and have it ready to go.</li>
    <li> Not human hair.  It&#x27;s fake.  I tried to curl it, and it burned and messed up the hair.</li>
    <li> I usually buy my extensions at beauty supply stores and end up paying over $100 for them. I was hesitant to get these since they are very cheap in price but I am very pleased with what I got. They are perfect for me since I do have thinner hair than most people. They are a bit lighter in color than the picture though but I love them ! Especially for the price! Besides, you can always dye the hair!</li>
    <li> Nice product. But the delivery date is very deceiving. It said within 3 days, but when I placed my order, my delivery date was a more than a month away from the day I placed my order. Wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
    <li> Great but clips really big n heavy</li>
    <li> Nice quality, great price but they did take a long time to get ..</li>
    <li> These are so fun. I love them! I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t purchase some sooner.  A purchase you won&#x27;t regret.  Matched my hair color perfectly.</li>
    <li> These arrived 3 weeks early! They look great in my daughters hair. Most ppl say they need 2 packages but she only needed one for her thin hair.</li>
    <li> 1 star for Fast shipping and that is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super thin, fits kids (3yr0ld) (just turned 3yr old) lol... not for adult. looks weird on my head and my hair is not even that thick.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service sucks. and way too expensive! Found a $7 one wayyyy better not a real hair but that one I can wear and looks good on me.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Lo barato sale caro! these are long, barbie doll looking like hair.  Somewhat disappointed, also they are thin and too blonde. Def. not for me.&lt;br /&gt;Cabello de muneca falso, delgado y guero. yikes.</li>
    <li> As you have read they are made for someone with more fine hair. If you have thicker Hair buy 2 sets. I love them! Great price for the quality. Stay in well and easy to put in. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought these for a Zelda cosplay I was doing and I was VERY lucky because they match my hair color perfectly. I have no idea if they are human hair or not, but when I curled them they did not melt. I would say if you are planning on curling them put heat protectant on them and only have them in the iron for a VERY short period of time. Spray again after.</li>
    <li> Shipped and deliver way faster than expected! High quality for the price! Don&#x27;t know how I lived without these!</li>
    <li> They are thin but i pretty. Color is perfect. I would buy them again. Recommend them.  Length is as described</li>
    <li> I received extension in 5 days and they are awesome!</li>
    <li> The quality and look is good, but the clips didn&#x27;t work at first with my thinning hair. If you already have a good base set of hair you are in luck, if not you will need to do something to bolster your hair back to life, then they will work better. After getting my hair in better condition, then these worked beautifully. I would recommend ordering more than one.</li>
    <li> Do not get these at all!! They sent me clips that had red hair. From the picture it shows highlights..horrible horrible! Guess that&#x27;s why they are so cheap..</li>
    <li> There wasn&#x27;t any brown in the ones I received.  It&#x27;s blonde and an orangey-coppery color.  Can&#x27;t use them.  The hair is soft and shiny though, if the color would have been as pictured, I would have liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> they suck they weren&#x27;t the color I order. They don&#x27;t even change color when I tried to dye them. Their horrible I want a refund!!!!</li>
    <li> awful, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friends birthday because she loved mine so much.  She is thrilled with it and it matched perfect!!</li>
    <li> These are thin so I sewed two set together.  Still excellent price!  I love these for a fun night out</li>
    <li> Color matches perfectly. Can&#x27;t tell the difference from my real hair to the extensions!!</li>
    <li> This is not human  hair. This is synthetic  hair that&#x27;s  why if you iron them they melt and they don&#x27;t take color it&#x27;s  synthetic  hair. Do not buy this. The seller  is lying. This is a rip off!</li>
