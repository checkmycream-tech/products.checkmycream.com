      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a good lather from it, but the bar itself doesn&#x27;t just melt away after being used how some bar soaps can do-</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this soap if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s not harsh on your skin but very effective!</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and it was moisturized and bright after I washed the soap off.</li>
      <li>The scent holds on your skin, and I often get compliments on how good I smell when wearing no other perfumed products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ordered this soap a little over a month ago and the first thing I noticed was how wonderful it smelled.</li>
      <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll like those as much as this one  :-)</li>
      <li>I love this soap, it&#x27;s just so gentle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a mild cleanser to wash my face in the mornings &amp;</li>
      <li>soap is amazing for sensitive skin and is highly moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I still have to moisturize the rest of my body because I like to take pretty hot showers</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time today &amp; can say I feel a difference already.</li>
      <li>but I definitely felt it didnt irritate or cause any more acne.</li>
      <li>This soap kinda left my skin feeling a bit tacky while I was in the shower, but i wanted to give it a fair shot and after drying off, my skin feels soft and smooth and is no longer dry and itchy.  </li>
      <li>I also bought black seed face cream which is also amazing.</li>
      <li>I was noticing a lot of blackheads on my cheeks and large pores around my nose.  </li>
      <li>Really helping my skin clear up quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-For around $5, this soap is priced very well.</li>
      <li>I filed claims(4 as of now) and the seller never return me not as much as an answer, which is really upsetting.</li>
      <li>Cleans very well with no residue.  </li>
      <li>my face was really feeling irritated</li>
      <li>but it helps keep those sensitive areas acne free and not dried out.</li>
      <li>Absolutely my favorite soap to use hands down.</li>
      <li>and I recently was able to go back to this one.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The prices on here are too high in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I did have to wash my face more than once to get every bit of makeup completely off, but to me it was so worth it because it left my face feeling soft and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>I did notice that at first my skin felt just a tiny tiny bit dry but very quickly with continued use my skin adjusted to it and felt just right...</li>
      <li>I use it in tandem with a toner and gentle face lotion every day, and my skin is almost totally clear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really not a traditional bar soap person, I have pretty much always preferred body washes and gels.</li>
      <li>I go to pick it up and the top layers of the soap just squish between my fingers and rinse away which wastes a lot of soap.</li>
      <li>While the smell is subtle on your skin it leaves my bathroom smelling amazing.</li>
      <li>At first I did not like it, as i am used to using Dove bar soap and facial cleansers on my face.  </li>
      <li>Go to your local beauty supply store first.  </li>
      <li>I have pretty dry skin on my body but prone to acne on my chest and on my back which is aggravated by soaps that dry out my skin more AND like 90% of moisturizers.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t completely abolish my acne</li>
      <li>My skin is clear and soft.</li>
      <li>My skin is soft and smooth without the scaling that has occurred in the past.</li>
      <li>I bought this soap from my local flea market as I&#x27;ve been searching for more natural products lately.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been able to cut down on moisturizing even in thE harsh winter climate where I live.</li>
      <li>Helps keep my skin soft and does not dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>The bar can get very creamy after being wet</li>
      <li>but they have both left my skin soft and not dry in any way.</li>
      <li>I like the smell of the African Black Soap one a little better</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: Dec 2014, I still love this soap, although a few months back I started breaking out again but switching to the black soap helped that</li>
      <li>so I tried this soap instead of the African Black soap as the honey &amp; black seed seemed like it would be a little more gentle for facial use.  </li>
      <li>We bought the African Black soap for my husband&#x27;s back acne as well, but I opened this box first and used on my face because my complexion was looking rather raggedy.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Someone advice me on this product for a better skin. I cannot wait to see the result. But my problem is that I order 5 of this and only received 4. I filed claims(4 as of now) and the seller never return me not as much as an answer, which is really upsetting. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the product, but the seller.</li>
    <li> Between this one and [[ASIN:B000XLWZGI African Black Soap Bar 5 Ounces]] my skin feels like it is getting the royal treatment. Both are outstanding. I like the smell of the African Black Soap one a little better but they have both left my skin soft and not dry in any way. We&#x27;re trying it on my daughters acne which is moderate to severe so I&#x27;ll update once we&#x27;ve used it longer for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is cruelty free and full of ingredients that are good for you. Give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My daughter uses the African Black Soap I linked above for her acne and it is working well. This one worked o.k. but that one was really good on it.</li>
    <li> This one bar of Honey and Black Seed soap has lasted me 9 months of daily use! I use it in tandem with a toner and gentle face lotion every day, and my skin is almost totally clear. I&#x27;m so happy with its mild scent and great effects.</li>
    <li> I ordered this soap a little over a month ago and the first thing I noticed was how wonderful it smelled. While the smell is subtle on your skin it leaves my bathroom smelling amazing.

My skin feels soft and it was moisturized and bright after I washed the soap off. I highly recommend this soap if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s not harsh on your skin but very effective!</li>
    <li> A co-worker told me about this soap &amp; I just had to try it! I bought this one &amp; thier Indian Hemp &amp; Hatitian Vetiver. I&#x27;ve been searching for a mild cleanser to wash my face in the mornings &amp; I think I&#x27;ve found a winner! I used it for the first time today &amp; can say I feel a difference already. This one is made specifically for blemishes so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing my skin in a week or two. My only advice is, don&#x27;t order it here online. Go to your local beauty supply store first.  I purchased mine for $2.49 for the same 5 oz. size bar.  The prices on here are too high in my opinion. Sorry Amazon, I love ya, but for $2, I&#x27;ll stick with getting it from the store.</li>
    <li> I love the smell.  Cleans very well with no residue.  My kids and husband love it as well.  Great soap.</li>
    <li> it is good but not the best.</li>
    <li> I just finished this bar of soap yesterday after purchasing it almost 3 months ago. It lasted so long because I would cut it into pieces instead of using it whole everyday. (And I wash my face a lot). I really liked this soap. My skin is acne prone and oily (t-zone especially) and I found that this soap worked great with the chemistry of my skin. I used it every morning and night to remove makeup. I did have to wash my face more than once to get every bit of makeup completely off, but to me it was so worth it because it left my face feeling soft and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I did notice that at first my skin felt just a tiny tiny bit dry but very quickly with continued use my skin adjusted to it and felt just right...I didn&#x27;t need to use any moisturizer at night, only a tinted spf moisturizer in the mornings. It didn&#x27;t completely abolish my acne I still breakout a bit (hormonal acne) but I definitely felt it didnt irritate or cause any more acne. Overall, a great smelling and wonderful natural soap. I went out to repurchase it today but my local vitamin shoppe didn&#x27;t have it, but they do carry other nubian heritage soaps so I bought a couple different ones. Hopefully I&#x27;ll like those as much as this one  :-)</li>
    <li> This soap works better than expensive, chemical laden washes.  As a beauty product addict , I&#x27;ve used everything from Chanel, obaji, expensive Derm brands.  Use on my face and body , love the fragrance.  My skin is clear and soft.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this soap in a little shop in Queens, NY.  We bought the African Black soap for my husband&#x27;s back acne as well, but I opened this box first and used on my face because my complexion was looking rather raggedy.  I was noticing a lot of blackheads on my cheeks and large pores around my nose.  Overall my complexion looked dull and uneven.  Last Sat. my face was really feeling irritated so I tried this soap instead of the African Black soap as the honey &amp; black seed seemed like it would be a little more gentle for facial use.  OMG!!  I noticed a difference in ONE DAY!  I&#x27;m serious.  I commented to my husband how my skin felt smoother and looked brighter.  I&#x27;ve continued to use it every morning since and every day my skin is looking better and better.  The blackheads are disappearing and my pores are smaller.  My complexion looks more even toned and is so smooth!!  I was just telling a co-worker about it yesterday and telling her I was bummed that I had not purchased more because it was working so great and she suggested I get online and try to find it so I checked Amazon this morning and VOILA!  It was only $1.99 in NY, but I&#x27;d pay whatever because it works that well.  I was previously using Oil of Olay Daily Facial Wash.  Kickin&#x27; that to the curb!!!  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite soap to use hands down. I&#x27;ve been using the Honey &amp; Black Seed Soap for about 4 years now and can list nothing but positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It has a pleasant scent, not too strong, not too light. The scent holds on your skin, and I often get compliments on how good I smell when wearing no other perfumed products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-This soap is amazing for sensitive skin and is highly moisturizing. I&#x27;ve never had soap residue issues with this brand, nor have I ever had it irritate my skin. My skin is softer since using this soap and I have less acne (I am a 20 year old with oily skin that is prone to acne). I have less dry skin issues during winter time as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-For around $5, this soap is priced very well. I shower daily (sometimes twice a day depending on my activities) and one bar of this soap lasts me around 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-They have a liquid version too which works just as well, though has a heavier scent than the bar version. The bottle version lasted me over 3 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for over  month now. Immediately after using my pours seemed smaller and refined. After using for a few weeks white heads and black heads are gradually reducing. Amazing product. Buy it! I also bought black seed face cream which is also amazing. My skin tone seems to be more even now. It keeps my skin moisturised without being greasy or shiny. And I believe my skin is a little farer now.</li>
    <li> This is great soap. This is the only one my kid can use because of her skin issues. I will buy again</li>
    <li> I love, Love, LOVE this soap. I&#x27;m really not a traditional bar soap person, I have pretty much always preferred body washes and gels. But this soap is amazing. Smells fresh and bright, and seems to have a calming effect. Helps keep my skin soft and does not dry out my skin. The bar can get very creamy after being wet so it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a good lather from it, but the bar itself doesn&#x27;t just melt away after being used how some bar soaps can do- though I will mention I keep it in a plastic soap box that hinges and latches open and closed. great product, great price. item arrived on time as scheduled.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0011DN7Y6 Honey and Black Seed Soap Bar 5 Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;I was having a problem with very dry skin that was not being relieved by medication from the doctor. I came across Nubian Heritage Honey &amp; Black Seed Soap and decided to give it a try. Within a couple of days I noticed that the redness was subsiding and the dry patches were shrinking. It has been about three months now and my skin is vastly improved with very minimal dry patches and no redness. My skin is soft and smooth without the scaling that has occurred in the past. A great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading reviews, and am happy that it really is amazing as others have claimed.  My skin cleared up after just a week of using it and I did not even get my stardard &#x27;monthly breakouts&#x27; since using this.  At first I did not like it, as i am used to using Dove bar soap and facial cleansers on my face.  This soap kinda left my skin feeling a bit tacky while I was in the shower, but i wanted to give it a fair shot and after drying off, my skin feels soft and smooth and is no longer dry and itchy.  I also bought the black soap, but have not even tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Dec 2014, I still love this soap, although a few months back I started breaking out again but switching to the black soap helped that and I recently was able to go back to this one.  I&#x27;m not sure if my skin just got used to it, but I am back to using it and having clear skin.</li>
    <li> This caused my face to burn and turn red. I threw it out after a couple of uses. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Great smell, Real AUTHENTIC, I&#x27;d buy it again</li>
    <li> Really helping my skin clear up quickly. Will be ordering again</li>
    <li> I love this soap, it&#x27;s just so gentle. I have pretty dry skin on my body but prone to acne on my chest and on my back which is aggravated by soaps that dry out my skin more AND like 90% of moisturizers. It&#x27;s a challenge to find a soap that cleanses well but is moisturizing enough that I don&#x27;t need to put any lotion on my chest or back. This is one of them, it&#x27;s cleansing but when I rinse it off I can still feel the acid mantle on my skin which is great. I still have to moisturize the rest of my body because I like to take pretty hot showers but it helps keep those sensitive areas acne free and not dried out. It smells really good too by the way, sweet but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it needs to be kept out of the shower. If I forget and leave it in the shower after I&#x27;m done using it the water vapor turns this soap to MUSH. I go to pick it up and the top layers of the soap just squish between my fingers and rinse away which wastes a lot of soap. Just remember to keep it in a dry area and out of your shower after you&#x27;re done.</li>
