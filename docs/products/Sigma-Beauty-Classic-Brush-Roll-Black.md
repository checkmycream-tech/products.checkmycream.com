      <li>good but kind of too big</li>

      <li>WOULDN&#x27;T FIT</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic makeup brush holder.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean as well.</li>
      <li>I used it for the Sigma HD brushes and then another set of brushes and they all fit.</li>
      <li>THEY ALL FIT</li>
      <li>AND I AM HAPPY BECAUSE NOW I DONT HAVE AN EXTRA SET OF BRUSHES THAT</li>
      <li>It also looks really sleek and nice.</li>
      <li>This is such a good roll that I bought 2 more.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping as well!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never posted a review on Amazon, but this product has proven so useful that I figured it was time!</li>
      <li>It worth the price!</li>
      <li>(M**), that I also love, has one for twice the price</li>
      <li>I love how the product is really well made.</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this product is the material, it&#x27;s like a pseudo-soft leather material that is soft to the touch and super easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>Very well made, holds the right amount of brushes, great quality material, folds easily, clasps easily, holds well when closed.</li>
      <li>am very satisfied with my purchase &amp; will definitely recommend it to my friends!</li>
      <li>Even tightly packed, it snaps shut and stays that way thanks to a very good closing mechanism.  </li>
      <li>Its easy to wipe down, smells like leather, and can fit into my makeup train case very easily.  </li>
      <li>I really can’t say enough good things about this case.  </li>
      <li>The shipping was super fast!</li>
      <li>I have  cases and rolls from Trish, Bobbi, Gorgeous Cos., Mac &amp; Aucoin  at far, far higher prices, but none come even close to this one.</li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>If you double up the skinnier  brush  handles, you could fit more than double that many.  </li>
      <li>I found, however, that for larger powder and face brushes it doesn&#x27;t fit them well, or rather the brushes don&#x27;t fit well.</li>
      <li>SO I WAS ABLE TO DOUBLE UP IN THE SLOTS OVER TO THE RIGHT.</li>
      <li>Soft leather(don’t know if it’s real but feels it) and, more importantly, very well thought out and constructed.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>and this was exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>This is the first brush roll i&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Love the sigma logo on the outside.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s get real, $20.00 for something that will keep your brushes more organized, cleaner, and easily portable...for at least 10 years...is completely worth it.</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean and looks sharp.  </li>
      <li>Macs’ are super expensive but not that great.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good quality, my brushes fit perfectly (long enough) and there are enough space.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s not real leather, it&#x27;s much more like leather than plastic.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product for anybody who wants to keep their brushes organized.</li>
      <li>some of my smaller brushes (like eyeliners) and fit 2 brushes in one slot.</li>
      <li>but once again, I have so much makeup and brushes that I need to get another pouch.</li>
      <li>I leave it in my car n make up between the red light traffic.</li>
      <li>Well it is also slim and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in a suitcase,</li>
      <li>It would&#x27;ve been really helpful if the dimensions were included in the product description.  </li>
      <li>Thx so much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The shipping was super fast! I love how the product is really well made. I pack everything in this brush roll. You won&#x27;t regret buying this product!</li>
    <li> The brush roll arrived within a week of the date I ordered it which was fantastic (considering I ordered 3 other items not related to makeup on the same day from locations that were geographically closer to me). You&#x27;ll have no more need to keep your beloved makeup brushes in random vases, caddies, and cups anymore! No more dust on your brushes and no more damage to the bristles of your fine brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for that \\&quot;staple makeup brush roll,\\&quot; this is it. Let&#x27;s get real, $20.00 for something that will keep your brushes more organized, cleaner, and easily portable...for at least 10 years...is completely worth it. $20.00 divided by the presumable 10 years you use it&#x3D;$2.00 per year for a brush roll that&#x27;s SUPERB!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order it for yourself, and see what all the makeup artists are talking about :)</li>
    <li> I love sigma product .. They are Really great quality!! i have recommended to everyone that i know!! if you are starting out with makeup i would suggest getting sigma brushes and ths brush roll.. you wont regret it!!</li>
    <li> This brush roll holds lots of brushes.  The quality of the holder is very good.  It isn&#x27;t ugly or bulky, and folds out very nicely.  I am going to buy myself another one because it is a great brush roll at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in need for a brush roll for a while, accumulating make-up and brushes... I&#x27;m really happy about this roll: it&#x27;s good quality, my brushes fit perfectly (long enough) and there are enough space.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that I didn&#x27;t think it would be so big once rolled/folded... but oh well, I&#x27;m still happy!</li>
    <li> This is just the perfect piece I needed for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I have a \\&quot;lot\\&quot;  of brushes and this will help me&lt;br /&gt;pare down for travel...or I just may order another!!!&lt;br /&gt;Problem solved...Thank you and the great price...</li>
    <li> I purchased this roll and didn&#x27;t expect it had such a high quality. The packaging is nice and the roll itself is so nice and durable. I just love it. If I ever need a new brush roll, I would go with this one. It worth the price!</li>
    <li> The quality is great and the shipping was super fast.  However, the product is bigger than I expected. It would&#x27;ve been really helpful if the dimensions were included in the product description.  When closed and placed vertically, it&#x27;s 10.5\\&quot;tall x 6\\&quot;wide.&lt;br /&gt;When opened (as it&#x27;s shown in the posted picture), it&#x27;s 10.5\\&quot; tall by 17.75\\&quot;wide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pictured it to be narrower than 6\\&quot; wide when it&#x27;s closed, so when I saw it, I felt a little disappointed.  Other than that, it&#x27;s nice and I&#x27;ll keep it as it&#x27;s hard to find makeup brush rolls without the brushes at the stores.</li>
    <li> Received the brush case in the mail and it was beyond expectations!  I was expecting pleather and the case is actually made of pebble grain leather with the Sigma logo embossed.  This is definitely a great value product and will be a needed addition to all of my wife&#x27;s make-up brushes!  I would highly recommend this, especially for the price!  Fast shipping as well!!!</li>
    <li> I received my Sigma Beauty Classic Brush Roll in no time.  My make up brushes fit perfectly.  The material is soft and pliable.  Even though it&#x27;s not real leather, it&#x27;s much more like leather than plastic.  It has holders for 15 brushes.  If your brushes are skinny, you can easily fit two in the slots made for eye shadow brushes.  It has a nice magnatic closure that makes it stay neat for home or travel.  I would reccommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush roll.  It holds a full set of brushes very securely and it folds beautifully and the magnetic closure is so much better than the ties the other brush rolls use.  My favorite thing about this product is the material, it&#x27;s like a pseudo-soft leather material that is soft to the touch and super easy to clean.  This brush roll will not get stained like other rolls because you can wipe off any excess make up (dry or wet) with a wet paper towel or gentle baby wipe (I use baby wipes to clean it).</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my wife who uses it store all her make up brushes, specifically for travel. She manages to fit all her brushes in this and is very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I bought this brush roll specifically for travel because I wanted to keep my brushes safe and organized. It&#x27;s great quality, holds all my brushes, and fits compactly into a suitcase. Can&#x27;t beat the price, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*edit* I saw the price here on Amazon of almost $50 and was kind of shocked...go to the Sigma website, I only paid $20 for mine there.</li>
    <li> Works well, does the job..pretty easy if you want to the clean makeup off, and fits most makeup brushes! I used it for the Sigma HD brushes and then another set of brushes and they all fit.</li>
    <li> This pouch is perfect for traveling or even storing your brushes at home.  The material is very soft yet sturdy, good quality..  There are 15 slots that could hold various sized brushes.  Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> WAS HAPPY TO FIND THAT THEY OFFERED ONE W/O THE BRUSHES WHICH IS EXTREMLY HARD TO FIND. THIS ONE IS OF GOOD QUALITY. I WAS AFRAID THAT ALL MY BRUSHES WOULDN&#x27;T FIT BECAUSE I HAVE MORE THAN THE SPACES THAT ARE ALLOTED. BUT LUCKILY, SOME ARE ONLY A CENTIMETER WIDE SO I WAS ABLE TO DOUBLE UP IN THE SLOTS OVER TO THE RIGHT. EITHER WAY THEY ALL FIT AND I AM HAPPY BECAUSE NOW I DONT HAVE AN EXTRA SET OF BRUSHES THAT I DIDN&#x27;T WANT.</li>
    <li> I have a brush fetish and am usually disappointed when I order brush rolls.  Macs’ are super expensive but not that great.  Others’ are very cheap feeling and not made well.  I was not expecting much for this price, but was so  pleasantly surprised.  This is such a good roll that I bought 2 more.  Soft leather(don’t know if it’s real but feels it) and, more importantly, very well thought out and constructed.  This fits at least 15 good sized brushes, from fat kabuki’s to the longest handles(old BB’s) and then has a double thick leather cover that comes down over to protect them.  If you double up the skinnier  brush  handles, you could fit more than double that many.  That said, it rolls up well with plenty of room to close.  Even tightly packed, it snaps shut and stays that way thanks to a very good closing mechanism.  I really can’t say enough good things about this case.  Now, I just hope they don’t stop making it.  I have  cases and rolls from Trish, Bobbi, Gorgeous Cos., Mac &amp; Aucoin  at far, far higher prices, but none come even close to this one.</li>
    <li> The quality of construction, design, and material is unparalleled at this price.  Consider that a department store makeup artistry brand (M**), that I also love, has one for twice the price and it pales in comparison on all factors mentioned above.  It is easy to clean and looks sharp.  I feel like a professional MUA, although I am not.  :)  The ONLY change I would make would be to have just a little more storage capacity.  I couple-up some of my smaller brushes (like eyeliners) and fit 2 brushes in one slot.</li>
    <li> I love this case to keep my sigma brush set. I leave it in my car n make up between the red light traffic. Thx so much.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Organizes all my brushes, easy to transport all the essentials for my weekend trips. Good quality case</li>
    <li> This is the first brush roll i&#x27;ve ever owned.  It&#x27;s ok - holds the brushes, wish it was a little smaller.</li>
    <li> but once again, I have so much makeup and brushes that I need to get another pouch. But this is a great product, I love the details and the snap button.</li>
    <li> I placed my order for the Sigma brush roll last week. I just received it today &amp; I love it!  The material is very soft &amp; supple, which makes it feel very expensive. The product holds its shape well, which I like. I am able to fit about 15 brushes, which fits all of the brushes that I have. I like that there is a self fastening closure, which allows the roll to stay closed.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very affordable. It is definitely worth it considering that it will protect all of my expensive brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with my purchase &amp; will definitely recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never posted a review on Amazon, but this product has proven so useful that I figured it was time! It is a high quality brush roll, and quite a steal at the current price. The leather material is soft yet durable, and a magnetic closure keeps everything under wraps. With room for 15 brushes, it more than suits my current needs, but I plan to buy another of the same once my brush collection grows. Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> good but kind of too big</li>
    <li> This brush roll is great and the material is easy to clean. I found, however, that for larger powder and face brushes it doesn&#x27;t fit them well, or rather the brushes don&#x27;t fit well. They slide into the slots just fine, but the flap to cover the bristles is not high enough to cover big, puffy brushes, even with their guards on. Nevertheless, long brushes fit well and don&#x27;t move, which is a concern when traveling--what&#x27;s the use of a brush roll if the brushes all fall out, right? Well it is also slim and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in a suitcase, already tried that out! Totally recommend this brush roll for anyone who intends to travel with all their brushes.</li>
    <li> I needed a brush roll that was good quality and compact.  I have a collection of brushes from various vendors (Eco styles, sigma, sonia Kashuk) and this was exactly what I needed.  Its easy to wipe down, smells like leather, and can fit into my makeup train case very easily.  The best part is the magnetic snap so I don&#x27;t have to tie it together. I recommend this product for anybody who wants to keep their brushes organized.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! It fits all my brushes nice n snug so I don&#x27;t lose them no Matter which way I hold this beautiful brush purse...</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy, attractive case which protects my make up brushes and keeps them clean and organized.  As others have said, I don&#x27;t just use it for travel, but keep my brushes in it all the time.  My only issue is the snap that closes the strap - it could be a bit better designed and easier to solidly snap.  But it&#x27;s truly not that difficult and all works just as it should.  Easy to clean as well.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush roll.  I previously had been storing in my makeup bag and was tired of digging around for the brushes I want.  So this is a time saver for me.  BUT the price here is high.  These are $20 on the sigma beauty website plus $5 shipping.  Plus I found a 10% off code online.  So I paid $23 for this brush roll.  Don&#x27;t pay more than $25 shipped.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic makeup brush holder. Great quality at a very affordable price. I&#x27;m going to buy a second!</li>
    <li> Holds many brushes.  Good for storage at home but for travel not so much.  I like to bring just essential brushes for travel but this is GREAT for storage at home.</li>
    <li> this is a great brush roll. if you are looking for one def. get this one bc it fits all brush sizes!!!</li>
    <li> Very well made, holds the right amount of brushes, great quality material, folds easily, clasps easily, holds well when closed. Love the sigma logo on the outside.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great brush roll. I&#x27;m currently using it to house my growing Sigma collection. It&#x27;s great for travel and does it&#x27;s job, nothing crazy special.</li>
    <li> Quality brush roll.  Great for protecting makeup brushes. Just purchased a good set of Sigma brushes and wanted to make sure they stay in good shape and protected!</li>
    <li> I could not be more happy with this brush roll. It fits my largest &amp; longest brushes and it is also made of great material and is very durable. It also looks really sleek and nice. For 23$  on prime, it&#x27;s super worthwhile if you&#x27;re looking for a way to keep your brushes in order.</li>
