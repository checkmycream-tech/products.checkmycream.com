<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These will do the trick.  FYI though...that are very tall (around 15-16&amp;#34;) and would not fit in the top of my closet.  Fortunately, my resourceful husband was able to cut the legs off and now they fit perfectly.  They are extremely easy to put together and take apart for traveling.</li>
    <li> like the wig stands.  They stand up great</li>
    <li> Fast and easy assembly, Cheap alternative product if you cant afford a real mannequin head.&lt;br /&gt;i gave 4 stars because they fall apart easily.</li>
    <li> Great for the price!!</li>
    <li> They came quickly, and do the job nicely.</li>
    <li> gift for a friend. Exactly what she wanted</li>
    <li> Pretty sturdy, cheap and do the trick...using them as hat holders.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for price. Not strong and short if you need for long hair wig wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Works for my needs though</li>
    <li> Gets the job done..not for the long wigs but i make it work.</li>
    <li> Am using these for mask stands and they are working out very well!</li>
    <li> Bought for my sister-in-law. She is using them a lot!</li>
    <li> These are really pretty good for the price.  I have a lot of wigs and these work fine for me.</li>
    <li> The stands are great for storing and drying wigs after shampooing.  They seem fairly sturdy.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a very timely manner.  They were excellently wrapped.  My wigs fit on the stands with no problem.  They sit nicely on the shelves, they don&#x27;t tip.  Easy to assemble.  Great product!  My husband may not want to read this part--I&#x27;ll order more--stands for more wigs!</li>
    <li> Great no problem, great price!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, easy to put together. They don&#x27;t break with taking apart and putting together often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to wearing wigs and was clueless on what to buy. I was in search of styrofoam heads for some wigs I just got and came across these. What a buy! I purchase these for half the cost of the same number of styrofoam heads. Plus, I needed these for drying my wigs after washing them. These are also great for traveling. I was able to bring one styrofoam head styling and four of these for four wigs.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy glad i got these</li>
    <li> I ordered this through Amazon Prime and it came fast and in perfect condition. I think they are terrific stands, Easy to put together or take apart,. so no wasted space if you aren&#x27;t using them all at the same time. My wigs fit great and I wont hesitate to order more if I need them.</li>
    <li> As an avid cosplayer, this is a must and is the best purchase I think I&#x27;ve had to date. Awesome quality, easy to set up, dismantle, and keeps everything so nice,&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!! I would recommend it for sure!!!</li>
    <li> They fall over pretty easily when trying to comb or style the wig. However, they&#x27;re  plastic and light, so what are you going to do? Other than that, the stands are easily stored away when not in use.  Not to mention they&#x27;re not made of styrofoam. So for that alone, they get 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Good for placing units on but not for styling purposes.  Easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> Use these to display horror masks and they work perfect and look fantastic.  They really make the masks look like they are museum quality displayed.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really do anything with them. They are constantly falling over and you can&#x27;t brush your wigs on them.</li>
    <li> These do the job and are great for the price.  Not the same as if you&#x27;d have a full head to put your wigs on. Easy to assembe</li>
    <li> Great stands - light - easy to assemble - does the job</li>
    <li> These are great for storing wigs and for taking wigs to conventions. They are easy to take apart and put together. Plus being flat makes it easy to fit them into your bag for travel. I keep my wigs on them after I have styled them on a styrofoam head. These are not good for styling because they topple over very easily and there is no way to keep the wigs attached except for gravity. These come nicely packaged and individually wrapped. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> A cheaper alternative to wig heads....they aren&#x27;t perfect but do the pinch backstage.</li>
    <li> These ARE GREAT even gave some to my coworker that loves wig like me these are awesome when traveling they pack flat...love drying wigs on this after washing!!! I will be buying some more as gifts.</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery.  Product as described.</li>
    <li> These wig stands consist of three pieces of plastic. At first I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t hold my wig but I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;These wig stands can hold really heavy wig but you will have to position the wig just right on them . I think for the price they are a great investment. I will be buying more in the future as I get more wigs.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy even with a long, wet wig. Great for drying and holding my wigs.</li>
    <li> Much better than the hard plastic ones. Nice shape.</li>
    <li> These are sturdy and nice little stands I bought several of them for Cosplay wigs which are pretty heavy and they hold up nicely.</li>
    <li> Great for air drying wigs after shampoo. Perfect for travel, take apart, packs flat in luggage.</li>
    <li> I purchased these not knowing if they would be sturdy enough to hold hats that I had decorated. I was so pleased...they were absolutely perfect!!! Holds the largest to the smallest. No tipping over. Just the right height.</li>
    <li> Sere the purpose they were intended for. They snap together easily and hold most short to medium length wigs well.</li>
    <li> Works as it is supposed to and holds my wigs perfectly. Love it!  This purchase was a great value.</li>
    <li> Im not totally in love with how they hold the wig when tryig to cut and style it(will get a foam stand for that i guess) but theybare well made and look nice when you just want to ahow off or air out your wigs</li>
    <li> Good if you have several wigs and need to be economical.  It is hard to keep the circle that goes on top connected with linger wigs and it will not stay snapped in. I used super glue to keep it together and problem solved. However, no longer collapsible, but that is not important to me.</li>
    <li> very good very fast thank you</li>
    <li> I looked at the pictures of the directions and couldn&#x27;t understand it so I just started guessing by how I&#x27;ve seen the set u pics in the main photo and I managed to put it together. It does it&#x27;s job but if the item is heavy make sure it&#x27;s equally balanced so it won&#x27;t fall over.</li>
    <li> They are exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Product was as it showed online</li>
    <li> I have a big walk in closet and a lot of wigs. I wanted something that I could put on the top shelves of my closet without having those foam heads all over the place. These did the job perfectly. It holds all of my wigs in shape (long hair) and they don&#x27;t take up a lot of space when not in use. They would be perfect to travel with too. Out of all of the devices I have purchased to hold my wigs, these are my favorite and at the price I can buy a couple dozen without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> These are great and easy to use. I was just putting my wigs in hair nets and then into resealable baggies. These work much better. Now I can see what I have and keep the hair from getting tangled.</li>
    <li> With luggage restrictions, number and weight, these stands are on time. They are malleable! Thank you. Now, I need to find a good clothing steamer with rack to handle my dislike of ironing.</li>
    <li> Great price and work great !</li>
    <li> they came on time. i was quite pleased. they are sturdy if your not jumping on them. they came in a way that you had to put them together which proved a little difficult to me. but this is a good product.</li>
    <li> These wig stands are great!  Inexpensive, easy to put together, and sturdy enough. However if you don&#x27;t put them together right (don&#x27;t secure the pieces, et cetera) they WILL topple easily.</li>
    <li> Great value. Used them as hat stands for a craft show and they worked perfectly. Sturdy when put together.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to assemble. Good price.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! Perfect for drying your wigs and for storage without tangling. Easy to put to together and take apart for traveling.</li>
    <li> Really happy with how much these costed and they were shipped just in time for what I needed them for</li>
    <li> Luv these stands great for drying my wigs.</li>
    <li> nice and compact when not in use.</li>
    <li> At first I was hesitant for getting this type of wig stand and not the Styrofoam head one, but after buying both types of wig stands, I definitely like this one better because my wig is the &#x27;mugatu&#x27; type from Arda wigs that comes with 2 pony tail wig clips in the sides.  the clips wouldn&#x27;t stay on the Styrofoam head but they clipped on this wig stand and stayed secure (no slipping).  It worked great and I was able to tie the base around a floor lamp with the lamp shade removed to style my wig with. I really only needed 1 but 6 is fine in case one breaks or my friends want to borrow it.</li>
    <li> Bought it twice, love them</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price...Good value...</li>
    <li> These are wonderful! I&#x27;ve never owned wigs before and I&#x27;ve started collecting them for my cosplay costumes. These are great for keeping my wigs up and tangle free. A little assembly is required but they are simple to put together. They are also light weight so they are easy to carry around. However they do sometimes fall over due to their light weight. Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> Love them. Great for travel.</li>
    <li> Holds my new wigs well!</li>
    <li> sturdy and tall enough for up to medium length wig as the longest ends will touch the surface</li>
    <li> Did not support the wigs weight.</li>
    <li> AWESOME PURCHASE ! I was very pleased with the speed and quality of my stands. I&#x27;m happy they are as tall as they are. I will be ordering more!!</li>
    <li> These things are awesome, now I have a place to put my wigs and they are easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> Works great. Outstanding!</li>
    <li> These work great for holding all of my wigs.  Keeps them up so that they don&#x27;t get messy.</li>
    <li> Very easy to assemble without even referring to instructions.  Intuitive after remembering the picture when purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;Appears sturdy, and wigs fit well.  Even the mesh cap fits well on one (which will make it easier for me to never misplace the cap again.  Stand is harder to misplace than tiny package the cap was in before.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I labored in deciding which stands from multiple sources would be right for long and short wigs.  As it turns out, these provided everything I needed with an extra stand to spare for anything I want later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value-wise, this was quite the bargain, which is what makes it possible for me to make these purchases given my fixed income.  Without the pricing options and free shipping, it would be impossible for me to buy the things I need or desire.  I am very pleased on that level, too.</li>
    <li> These are great! Good value and they fold up flat when you aren&#x27;t using them, which is great if you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t have a lot of space. They are sturdy enough for all but 1 of my wigs. 5 star product.</li>
    <li> They work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Really wonderful easy wig stands. The round piece that clips on the top doesn&#x27;t stay put but really it&#x27;s unnecessary.</li>
    <li> I received my Wig Stand early  which usually happens with Amazon, amazing service.  It was packaged beautifully and the stands are easy to assemble but instructions are in Chinese.  That wasn&#x27;t really a problem for me but I feel there should be instructions in English also.  The problem I did have is that it&#x27;s not near heavy enough for my wig, not sturdy enough just keeps falling down.  I may tie it to a lamp but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do this so they&#x27;re probably going back.  If your wig is very light it will be ok for you.</li>
    <li> Very nice and sturdy, they do come apart for easy storage.</li>
    <li> These wig stands arrived exactly as expected, on time, and in perfect condition. I truly do not have a complaint about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To touch on a few PROs of why I love these wig stands (and folding wig stands in general)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- As the title says, they are portable. Which makes them great for taking my wigs on plans, to conventions, etc. Easy to set up and style in a hotel room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The perfect wig drying stand! Reduce your drying time after washing/restyling drastically by having air flow throughout the wig. A long, thick wig dries in about a day for me with this method vs 2-3 days on a typical stand or hanging over a shower rail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- SIX for essentially price of ONE of these suckers. A great deal on your wig stands means you can buy more wigs *wink wink*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to rig up for styling. This sounds silly but I use masking tape to tape the legs of the stand to my coffee table to help me brush out and style a wig. However, before setting a style, I always try it on my actual head to make sure I like the shape as its stretched out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy wig styling!</li>
    <li> i didnt get what i paid for</li>
    <li> Product met expectations. It was very easy to assemble and my wigs fit perfectly. It also arrived at the time it was expected to be delivered.</li>
    <li> The stands were purchased for cosplay wigs, and they support those well. The only directions for putting them together are pictures on the package; however, the shape of the pieces makes it fairly obvious how the three pieces hook together.</li>
    <li> Thought these were the same type that I had ordered before--they aren&#x27;t. Two snapped in half as I was putting them together making them a complete waste.</li>
    <li> Very handy to put your wigs on! Delivery in no time!</li>
    <li> Perfect for folding flat and setting up at the shows that I vend my headwear at.  I am forever opening them up and taking them apart, and they haven&#x27;t cracked yet.</li>
    <li> great buy!  perfect stands for my wigs and hats during chemo!</li>
    <li> I hate these. They fall at the slightest nudge and they FALL APART all the time - I have had to glue them and they still come undone!</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE DESGIN BUT ONE OF THEM HAD THE SAME SLITS AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO PUT IT TOGETHER</li>
    <li> these are great!! they do fall if you bump them but they are plastic!! i wouldn&#x27;t recommend brushing your wigs on them unless you hold them because they will fall...however they are a thicker plastic and pretty strong and for the price you pay along with how much you&#x27;re getting you can&#x27;t e mad!</li>
    <li> They are light weight, store easily and do what they are supposed to do.  Thoughtful innovative design.  We are very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Omg!!! Really useful and looks great!! Good to buy!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Great for my wig collection and easy to put together.</li>
    <li> PERFECT! REASONABLE! EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED!!</li>
    <li> Well made.  I have two I had purchased that were more expensive and not as well made.  I can recommend.</li>
    <li> I love these wig stands!. These are more for every day use and not for styling wigs on. I like to keep my wigs on a shelf with these stands so they don&#x27;t get flattened in bags, can breathe, and don&#x27;t get destroyed by my cat. They are super easy to assemble and are awesome to pack for conventions as they collapse and don&#x27;t take up much space. I will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> Simple and effective construction</li>
    <li> These have been very useful in my costume shop. I use them for both wigs and hats. They&#x27;re good for display, storage, and drying wigs. And they fold flat when not in ise. They are much cheaper than other alternatives, and reasonably sturdy for the price.</li>
    <li> These stands are great and priced wonderfully. I shared with my mom. They are sturdy and a great product</li>
    <li> Love these!!! Perfect for my new colorful wig collection :) They look much nicer than those styrofoam heads. They work well with short and long hair. They stay sitting upright, no problems with them tipping over like I saw some people mentioning.. and I do have one with that&#x27;s really long. Would highly recommend! Great price too!</li>
    <li> Affordable. Extremely convenient for travel. Easy to put together and take apart.  Great purchase especially if you don&#x27;t need something super fancy.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  I love that they fold up for storage.</li>
    <li> Have been knitting and felting hats and  just love these wig stands.  They are sturdy enough to put a wet wool hat on to dry.  And they work well for the hats after they are dry and in my closet.  Easy to assemble and take apart to store.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only set one up and the small ring broke already (not large enough to fit in the slot without breaking) but it still seems to work. Honestly for the price you still can&#x27;t beat this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Just opened 3 more and they all were fine, I think the first one was just defective.</li>
