      <li>So good luck.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>pre-bleached my son&#x27;s hair with 40 vol to a nice platinum.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First time user with great results, read the maintenance instructions to keep from getting color everywhere</li>
      <li>Special Effects Pimpin Purple is the most gorgeous, red-purple shade.</li>
      <li>I did like the color, just make sure your hair is very light when you put the dye on.</li>
      <li>It will be more of an Eggplant color on</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>but you will love it.</li>
      <li>It looks way better than going to a salon.</li>
      <li>Beyond pleased.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a liquid, it&#x27;s more of a jelly substance, so it&#x27;s easier to handle.</li>
      <li>The product is great  in that it will last for a good 6 weeks.</li>
      <li>This is more like a  orchid/lavender.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shade + lighter, a bit more ..</li>
      <li>Bottle was not sealed and product was 1/4&amp;#34; from top.</li>
      <li>Pleased with this product</li>
      <li>Pimpin purple has to be one of my favorite purple dyes.</li>
      <li>great smelling leaves hair shinny and soft and lasts for ever!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use because there is no mixing involved.</li>
      <li>Pimpin purple is also my favorite color by special effects.</li>
      <li>I love Special Effects&#x27; hair dyes.</li>
      <li>It lasts for months and fades to a really awesome hot pink after a while.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, stays vibrant and easy to remove from hair.</li>
      <li>product is a great one, but maybe purple is harder for the hair to absorb??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but there was enough to still use it over all i loved it and will buy again</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly too btw</li>
      <li>Effects color chart is pretty darn accurate.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Special Effects for many years, before professional brands came out with &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34; colors.  </li>
      <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;fish-bowl blue&#x27; holds really well, and is BRIGHT along with Nuclear Red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It takes about a month for it to get to a light purple that i don&#x27;t really care for and then I will re-dye.</li>
      <li>I recommend washing it out in a stainless steal sink if you have one available.</li>
      <li>but I like the nice darkness of Deep Purple.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite shade of purple from SE.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the purple on my hair and my younger sister&#x27;s hair (she washes her hair eeeevery day in warm water and her fading</li>
      <li>still nice and rich color, Stays pretty long.</li>
      <li>so you can see it on different people and read other reviews to make the best choice for yourself.</li>
      <li>the company isn&#x27;t stocked right now, and I may have to find another color to dye my hair...  &#x3D;\</li>
      <li>The dye is also extremely safe to leave in your hair, I generally leave it in for about 2 hours at a time before washing out and applying conditioner and the color will stay for months!</li>
      <li>I would always recommend  special effects brand because I&#x27;ve never had a whole lot of fading from them</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is really dark unless in the sun (but fades after a week to a bright purple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What more can I say except she is very very picky and that makes this product a hit for her vacation last summer.  </li>
      <li>If you keep up with regular dying and don&#x27;t wash it, stands in a lot better.</li>
      <li>Long lasting, not a lot of bleeding afterwards (pillows and towels will be happy).  </li>
      <li>your hair will look monotone at first, you have to wait for it</li>
      <li>I got Pimpin Purple because the mfr was all out of Deep Purple, which is my favorite and what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Great color, long lasting.</li>
      <li>I think the color looks far better over, say, medium or light brown hair, or a dark blonde: then it becomes a vibrant, bright plum that glows in the sunlight.</li>
      <li>A month is pretty good for semi-permanents as some only last a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They last an extremely long time and are very very pigmented, they&#x27;re amazing unnatural hair dyes if you don&#x27;t want to change your color often.</li>
      <li>You also don&#x27;t need to use the whole bottle.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely adore the color.</li>
      <li>and it is a deep rich purple...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t remember Special Effects fading as fast as this last order seemed to, but the color is spot on.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this color for a few months, and I love it.</li>
      <li>Over hair that&#x27;s been bleached platinum, it is almost fuchsia--though personally I don&#x27;t like it very much that way.</li>
      <li>Had used Manic panic ultra violet first because I found it locally and was convienient.</li>
      <li>love special effects hair dyes so much, they come in little tubes (the dye is hard to get out of the tube, lots of shaking required)</li>
      <li>As a listened cosmetologist I love this product and it is hard to find.</li>
      <li>So far i like it.</li>
      <li>You can simply just use it straight from the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I rebleached first and had a bit of pastels blue left.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that even with my hair being bleached out pretty severely, I do need to reapply the color every couple weeks to maintain a rich even purple.</li>
      <li>I love to mix a some of the purple into about a spoonful of blue and then add that to about a 1/2 cup of THICK conditioner to get a really soft pastel color.  </li>
      <li>, he is a natural dark blonde, and it took to his natural color areas really well, so if you dont plan on bleaching your hair and you are a natural mousy blonde, this will work for you!  </li>
      <li>to the left is pimpin purple diluted in conditioner (way too pink to be a lavender) and to the right is deep purple diluted.</li>
      <li>They last a long time, and the colors are vibrant.</li>
      <li>But the only thing is that i feel like unless you have bleached/very light hair, it&#x27;s too hard to tell if you missed any spots.</li>
      <li>It fades to a vibrant pink.</li>
      <li>If I want a really rich lasting color I will comb the color into my hair, blow dry it in, and then leave it in for a day or two (Usually done over the weekend).</li>

<li> i was amazed how long it lasted the only thing with getting it off Amazon</li>
<li> My only issue with this product (as well as any other unnatural hair products) is the staining of virtually everything.</li>
<li> Also, does not seem to dry out hair.  </li>
<li> I recommend only keeping it in your hair for 15 or 20 minutes; any longer, and it may get too dark.</li>
<li> i had close to silver hair too so kind of disappointed.</li>
<li> Wear all black when you apply the dye and try to rinse it out as close to the shower drain as possible and keep it in a contained</li>
<li> but it fades away over a short period of time or I just scrub it a little</li>
<li> And 2, YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL, THEY STAIN EVERYTHING THEY TOUCH.</li>
<li> I really wanted purple but ended up with blue/greenish instead that was washing out even worse.</li>
<li> son sweats pink at basketball practice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> hella pink.</li>
<li> but I usually empty mine into a bowl and then kinda pick up chunks at a time with my  gloves on to apply it to my hair.</li>
<li> you have black low-lights, this is not the color to use for contrast, it is TOO dark...</li>
<li> I find that it stays longer than pravana or a few others that I have used.</li>
<li> not a huge fan of this color at all.&lt;br</li>
<li> This is absolutely my go-to brand and color for my hair (the base is black and I have purple panels in it)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;m so happy it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued and hope it never is.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember Special Effects fading as fast as this last order seemed to, but the color is spot on.  If you keep up with regular dying and don&#x27;t wash it, stands in a lot better.</li>
    <li> For those that are looking for a lavender purple color. I was torn on whether or not I should try pimpin purple or deep purple. I bought both and diluted each with a white conditioner (I used Suave Keratin Infusion Color Care Conditioner for color treated &amp; frizzy hair) and heres the result: to the left is pimpin purple diluted in conditioner (way too pink to be a lavender) and to the right is deep purple diluted. Once I get my blonde to a gray/white color I will definitely try deep purple diluted</li>
    <li> could be a bit darker</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, stays vibrant and easy to remove from hair.</li>
    <li> I mixed pippin purple and deep purple and it was the best purple i have ever had and over been every color under the sun for the last 3 years I&#x27;ve tried about 10 purples and I&#x27;m telling ya this 2 are the best it stayed in for about 3 months and then it started to fade to purple/pink i was amazed how long it lasted the only thing with getting it off Amazon was that deep purple was leaked out and was all over the place when i opened the package but there was enough to still use it over all i loved it and will buy again</li>
    <li> hella pink. i had close to silver hair too so kind of disappointed. still nice and rich color, Stays pretty long.</li>
    <li> She loved it!  What more can I say except she is very very picky and that makes this product a hit for her vacation last summer.  5 stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color for a few months, and I love it. It fades to a vibrant pink. My only issue with this product (as well as any other unnatural hair products) is the staining of virtually everything. But, it comes with the territory. This is by far my favorite shade of purple from SE.</li>
    <li> Great color, long lasting. First time user with great results, read the maintenance instructions to keep from getting color everywhere</li>
    <li> As a listened cosmetologist I love this product and it is hard to find. I am grateful to get it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know if what I thought I purchased is what I actually got. Bottle was not sealed and product was 1/4&amp;#34; from top. No way am I even going to use it.</li>
    <li> Pimpin purple has to be one of my favorite purple dyes. I love to mix a some of the purple into about a spoonful of blue and then add that to about a 1/2 cup of THICK conditioner to get a really soft pastel color.  I would always recommend  special effects brand because I&#x27;ve never had a whole lot of fading from them (everyone&#x27;s hair is different though). If I want a really rich lasting color I will comb the color into my hair, blow dry it in, and then leave it in for a day or two (Usually done over the weekend). I&#x27;ve used the purple on my hair and my younger sister&#x27;s hair (she washes her hair eeeevery day in warm water and her fading still wasn&#x27;t too bad)</li>
    <li> This Pimpin&#x27; purple just bleeds like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son sweats pink at basketball practice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, he is a natural dark blonde, and it took to his natural color areas really well, so if you dont plan on bleaching your hair and you are a natural mousy blonde, this will work for you!  It will be more of an Eggplant color on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;fish-bowl blue&#x27; holds really well, and is BRIGHT along with Nuclear Red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a great one, but maybe purple is harder for the hair to absorb??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pre-bleached my son&#x27;s hair with 40 vol to a nice platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really dark unless in the sun (but fades after a week to a bright purple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have black low-lights, this is not the color to use for contrast, it is TOO dark...your hair will look monotone at first, you have to wait for it to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im not a huge fan of this color at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pigment is tricky to work with....I am a Cosmetologist, not a novice btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, all comments aside, my son likes it, he&#x27;s 9 and gets compliments everywhere he goes.</li>
    <li> This dye is GREAT! It lasts for months and fades to a really awesome hot pink after a while. It looks way better than going to a salon. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely my go-to brand and color for my hair (the base is black and I have purple panels in it) and I absolutely adore the color. My only complaint is that even with my hair being bleached out pretty severely, I do need to reapply the color every couple weeks to maintain a rich even purple. But it&#x27;s great, it lasts longer than manic panic, it smells good and it conditions your hair. A+</li>
    <li> I love Special Effects&#x27; hair dyes. They last a long time, and the colors are vibrant. Special Effects Pimpin Purple is the most gorgeous, red-purple shade. Over hair that&#x27;s been bleached platinum, it is almost fuchsia--though personally I don&#x27;t like it very much that way. I think the color looks far better over, say, medium or light brown hair, or a dark blonde: then it becomes a vibrant, bright plum that glows in the sunlight. I used it over Herbatint plum dye, to excellent effect. I recommend only keeping it in your hair for 15 or 20 minutes; any longer, and it may get too dark.</li>
    <li> only hair color i will use now!!! great smelling leaves hair shinny and soft and lasts for ever! i did mine in march its faded to a pinkish/red color now of course (august) but it STILL has color! my daughters purple lasted almost a year!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the color the bleached parts of my hair turned, but i would have needed at least 2 bottles to cover my head because the bottles are so small. I really think it&#x27;s too expensive, and the shipping is outrageous. For me to dye my hair, i would have to buy 2 bottles, plus 2 shipping and handling, so it would be over 30 dollars for semi permanent dye. I suppose if i had lots of money, it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue. I did like the color, just make sure your hair is very light when you put the dye on.</li>
    <li> So far i like it. It&#x27;s not a liquid, it&#x27;s more of a jelly substance, so it&#x27;s easier to handle. You also don&#x27;t need to use the whole bottle. But the only thing is that i feel like unless you have bleached/very light hair, it&#x27;s too hard to tell if you missed any spots. So good luck.&lt;br /&gt;Also, place a towel in front of you and one under you, because this stuff will stain anything it touches, and is nearly impossible to get all of it out.</li>
    <li> Had used Manic panic ultra violet first because I found it locally and was convienient. I really wanted purple but ended up with blue/greenish instead that was washing out even worse. Anyways after extensive online research found this product. Decided to try it,couldn&#x27;t get any worse. This stuff came out beautiful! I rebleached first and had a bit of pastels blue left. Put this on for an hour and it is a deep rich purple...no blues in it at all. Stains like the Dickens so be cautious of that. Shipped quickly too btw&lt;br /&gt; Beyond pleased.</li>
    <li> My favorite brand of fashion colors! When I need a touch up I always come back to Amazon for a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately the company isn&#x27;t stocked right now, and I may have to find another color to dye my hair...  &#x3D;\</li>
    <li> Alright everyone, if you haven&#x27;t purchased a SFX hair dye before you should know two things: 1. They last an extremely long time and are very very pigmented, they&#x27;re amazing unnatural hair dyes if you don&#x27;t want to change your color often. And 2, YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL, THEY STAIN EVERYTHING THEY TOUCH. Your skin, your bathroom, your hair, your clothes, everything. Wear all black when you apply the dye and try to rinse it out as close to the shower drain as possible and keep it in a contained area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love special effects hair dyes so much, they come in little tubes (the dye is hard to get out of the tube, lots of shaking required) but I usually empty mine into a bowl and then kinda pick up chunks at a time with my  gloves on to apply it to my hair. The dye is also extremely safe to leave in your hair, I generally leave it in for about 2 hours at a time before washing out and applying conditioner and the color will stay for months!</li>
    <li> I got Pimpin Purple because the mfr was all out of Deep Purple, which is my favorite and what I wanted. It&#x27;s a shade + lighter, a bit more .. eh.. frosty maybe? Its okay but I like the nice darkness of Deep Purple. This is more like a  orchid/lavender. The product is great  in that it will last for a good 6 weeks. It doesnt hurt your hair, and be sure to use products for color treated hair to get the best preservation of that color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Effects color chart is pretty darn accurate. google images and videos of the colors so you can see it on different people and read other reviews to make the best choice for yourself. WEAR GLOVES and protect all surfaces, it will be everywhere.. but you will love it.</li>
    <li> Great hair product!  Long lasting, not a lot of bleeding afterwards (pillows and towels will be happy).  Pleased with this product</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair dye!  I&#x27;ve been using Special Effects for many years, before professional brands came out with &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34; colors.  However, I always come back to this brand.  I find that it stays longer than pravana or a few others that I have used. Pimpin purple is also my favorite color by special effects. It&#x27;s a really deep purple that lightens up over time which means I do not have to constantly touch it up. It takes about a month for it to get to a light purple that i don&#x27;t really care for and then I will re-dye. A month is pretty good for semi-permanents as some only last a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use because there is no mixing involved. You can simply just use it straight from the bottle.  It will stain your bath tub but it fades away over a short period of time or I just scrub it a little and it&#x27;s gone.  I recommend washing it out in a stainless steal sink if you have one available.</li>
    <li> Color looks great and it looks nice as it fades.  Also, does not seem to dry out hair.  Will definitely order again,</li>
