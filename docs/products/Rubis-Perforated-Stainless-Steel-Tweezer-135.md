      <li>They have the great grip, strong hold on hairs, without breaking them.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>I would recommend these to anyone who wants a top of the line tweezer!!!</li>
      <li>Best tweezers I have ever owned and I buy high quality</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to have a good quality tweezer in your home.</li>
      <li>These are by far the best brand for tweezers you can buy.  </li>
      <li>By far the best tweezer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Unsurpassed quality and easy to handle!</li>
      <li>the shortest hairs are held very secure.</li>
      <li>Very precise.</li>
      <li>you have come across many duds in your lifetime</li>
      <li>I thought if I paid more, I would have a better product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
      <li>It performs slightly better then</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t remember taking them in more than once.</li>
      <li>I had three for more years than I can remember.  </li>
      <li>so it slips through most tweezers.  </li>
      <li>And speaking of points, I see that they sell pointed ones, but these slanted ones HAVE a very nice point on the high end.  </li>
      <li>It looks very cool also.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m happy with these.  </li>
      <li>I could not believe how amazingly good these were after using drug-store ones for my whole life up until that point.</li>
      <li>Easy to hold</li>
      <li>They break so so easily.</li>
      <li>I have to hold them just so to get them to pull out something fine like a hair.</li>
      <li>you get what you pay for&#x27; but in this instance, it&#x27;s absolutely accurate.</li>
      <li>They are fantastic.</li>
      <li>I can effectively pull hairs in the very beginning stages of growth without leaving a mark.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a natural blond with a surprisingly hairy face.  </li>
      <li>Plus they offer a lifetime sharpening and warranty, which I have used and found very useful.</li>
      <li>These are beautifully made, and I really want to like them more, but they simply don&#x27;t have the leverage and the grip of some other tweezers that are not as beautiful and don&#x27;t feel as luxurious to use.</li>
      <li>but these Rubis tweezers are definitely worth the investment!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought a number of familiar name brands you see in the drugstore, but none of them compare.  </li>
      <li>If you really use tweezers (and I would say most women have)</li>
      <li>These seem to work perfectly for those little slivers I get when I work with wood or steel, they grab it and hang on to it with little pressure on the tweezers, Even the ground diamond tipped ones I have tried did not do near as well as these; very happy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and types of tweezers, including Tweezerman, but I&#x27;ve had excellent luck with Rubis and can&#x27;t imagine purchasing any other brand now.</li>
      <li>I had been loyal to Tweezerman tweezers for years.</li>
      <li>These new ones are not the precision tweezers I used to love.</li>
      <li>They are finely tuned instruments that require much care when you use them.</li>
      <li>I have bought Mehaz collection tweezers by Rubis my whole adult life and have always found them to be the most precise.  </li>
      <li>so you must be able to clearly see the hair and place the tweeze head in just the right spot.</li>
      <li>This style is superior to the other Rubis I purchased.  </li>
      <li>While these are good tweezers, I agree with other reviewers who say they are overpriced by about $10</li>
      <li>Granted, with cheaper tweezers, you may have to try three or four before you get a pair that&#x27;s made just right.</li>
      <li>She just wants to try something new every so often to see if its better</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve probably spent 3x that or more on cheap ones from the drug store.  </li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve collected a varied collection of tools from the early Revlons to Tweezermans and have found that the Rubis tweezer is far, FAR, FAR more a superior product.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not convinced they are that much better than my current Tweezerman tweezers, which I seem to keep reaching for rather than these.</li>
      <li>When I first got the Rubis #135, I would have given it 5 stars, however I have changed my mind.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I&#x27;ve bought more of these tweezers were for gifts and because I couldn&#x27;t find mine.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different brands of tweezers over the years.  </li>
      <li>I simply don&#x27;t think you can do better when it comes to a tweezer.</li>
      <li>Finally, after years of replacing and replacing tweezers, I have found a product that is fabulous!  </li>
      <li>Rubis tweezers are expensive but they are superb!</li>
      <li>These do work better than any others you buy anywhere in CVS, Walmart, Kmart, or any stores anywhere local.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these tweezers!!</li>
      <li>last longer than most.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend these, they are definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>Purchased them because reviews were so positive.</li>
      <li>I frequently have to pluck my eyebrows because I get a lot of regrowth quickly.  </li>
      <li>And they can even pluck the fine white eyebrow hairs.</li>
      <li>The hair is fine and white</li>
      <li>They do pull out fine, tiny hairs without breaking them.</li>
      <li>These are the hairs that you can&#x27;t really see but you can feel.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I invested in them as they find, grip, and can pull out even the toughest hairs without slipping or breakage.</li>
      <li>Packaging completely different from pair I own, the #135 is not engraved on item as pair I bought before and even the perforations are different on item.  </li>
      <li>but this is the second pair of these and just as good as the first pair they finally lose there edge but taking them back to the store</li>
      <li>but we came back to the original and is still liking them</li>
      <li>By the way, their pointed tweezer is just as effective, but I usually reach for this slanted one.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these tweezers, without reservation.</li>
      <li>Oh it works fine for the first few weeks</li>
      <li>These are extremely sharp and fine tipped with a slant, which means you can grab hold of even the finest of hairs with ease and pluck virtually painfree.</li>
      <li>The slant is at just the right angle, and they pull out short hairs.</li>
      <li>The Rubis tweezers are like a precise surgical instrument, so sharp, so well made.</li>
      <li>I was just speaking to my brother about buying some new tweezers, and I told him, \\&quot;Don&#x27;t</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a number of familiar name brands you see in the drugstore, but none of them compare.  It&#x27;s worth the extra money, this is a quality product that will no doubt last for years to come!</li>
    <li> A dragon fly&#x27;s life expectancy is 4 months. Three months and 7 days after purchase and this tweezers is completely useless. Oh it works fine for the first few weeks and then it goes into rapid decline. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different brands of tweezers over the years.  Found these to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;They last longer than most.  And they can even pluck the fine white eyebrow hairs.</li>
    <li> Finally, after years of replacing and replacing tweezers, I have found a product that is fabulous!  It is sharp, grabs the hairs the first time, and doesn&#x27;t allow the hair to slip through it&#x27;s grasp.  No more China made for me!  I&#x27;ll stick with German precision engineering and fabrication.  I highly recommend these tweezers, without reservation.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing Rubis for the last 10 years. I have only had to replace my old ones because I dropped them and bent the heads. These new ones are not the precision tweezers I used to love. I have to hold them just so to get them to pull out something fine like a hair. Not happy with these, should return them.</li>
    <li> I have bought Mehaz collection tweezers by Rubis my whole adult life and have always found them to be the most precise.  These are the worst. Thick metal. Cannot grab hairs. Not real Rubis from what I can tell. Comes in a knockoff box. Heavy, thick, not fined tuned and total waste of money.</li>
    <li> If your looking for the best tweezers EVER, it&#x27;s the best money spent.  They are razor sharp and you only have to pull the hair ONCE!!</li>
    <li> Have went through all the professional versions of both store and name brands that the drug stores sell and they just don&#x27;t last nor work well. These seem to work perfectly for those little slivers I get when I work with wood or steel, they grab it and hang on to it with little pressure on the tweezers, Even the ground diamond tipped ones I have tried did not do near as well as these; very happy.</li>
    <li> I lost my initial pair and couldn&#x27;t live without another pair.They are practical and tough, and needed by me on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Rubis tweezers are expensive but they are superb! I am glad that I invested in them as they find, grip, and can pull out even the toughest hairs without slipping or breakage. Not so with Tweezerman- save your money and invest in a pair of Rubis tweezers! I admit I initially hesitated in ordering them due to the price- but these Rubis tweezers are definitely worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I had been loyal to Tweezerman tweezers for years. Lately, the pairs that I would buy either just missed (meaning they didn&#x27;t seem to work consistently well) or became less effective over time. Yes, I know that I could package them up and return for fixing, but when you need them, you need them, and I would just buy a new pair. I read the reviews re: Rubis Perforated Steel Tweezers, compared them to the Tweezerman reviews, and made the decision to purchase the Rubis. Unbelievable difference! The Rubis tweezers are like a precise surgical instrument, so sharp, so well made. I can effectively pull hairs in the very beginning stages of growth without leaving a mark. I am sold. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> The tweezers are very good!  They have the great grip, strong hold on hairs, without breaking them.&lt;br /&gt;Even the shortest hairs are held very secure.</li>
    <li> Great pair of tweezers. Got a pair for home and travel.</li>
    <li> This style is superior to the other Rubis I purchased.  Regrettably, I dropped this one and, as a result, the point was damaged.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that the tweezers cannot be repaired, especially at the price it commands.  Some tweezer manufacturers have that option.</li>
    <li> When I first got the Rubis #135, I would have given it 5 stars, however I have changed my mind.  I&#x27;ve had these since Jan 20, 2015. Took them on vacation Feb 28.  Apparently, I should have put them in a metal crush proof box lined with cotton.  They were not dropped, crushed or damaged in any way.  Occasionally carried in my pocket.  Four days into vacation, they are useless!  When I returned home, I went to the Rubis website to see if I can have them repaired???  Only if I mail them at my expense with add&#x27;l charges for overseas shipping!!!  No way!  I guess I&#x27;m just SOL and $37 down the drain!</li>
    <li> By far the best tweezer I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve had them for several years and they still work as new. Easy to hold and they grab onto just about any length hair, even the tiny or stubborn ones. Plus they offer a lifetime sharpening and warranty, which I have used and found very useful. I simply don&#x27;t think you can do better when it comes to a tweezer. By the way, their pointed tweezer is just as effective, but I usually reach for this slanted one. Great product!</li>
    <li> If you really use tweezers (and I would say most women have) you have come across many duds in your lifetime I&#x27;m sure. Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve collected a varied collection of tools from the early Revlons to Tweezermans and have found that the Rubis tweezer is far, FAR, FAR more a superior product. They are finely tuned instruments that require much care when you use them. I&#x27;ve given myself mini anxiety attacks when I&#x27;ve accidentally dropped them - which does NOT happen often. I&#x27;ve even given these as gifts and have had everyone tell me they are the best tweezer they&#x27;ve ever used. They are not cheap and I&#x27;ve found it hard to contact their customer service for sharpening and tuning, etc. I&#x27;ve had them sharpened with the ones I sent to Tweezerman and they never came back the same. It made me go out and buy another new one to replace it with. They are expensive and I don&#x27;t normally buy in to &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27; but in this instance, it&#x27;s absolutely accurate. They are fantastic.</li>
    <li> the tweezers did not pull out difficult hairs like I had hoped.  I did not like the angle of the tweezers for pulling shorter hairs.</li>
    <li> Though it will pull any hair that you grasp, the head is small so you must be able to clearly see the hair and place the tweeze head in just the right spot.</li>
    <li> I had three for more years than I can remember.  One pair in the bathroom, one in my travel kit and one at work.  The one at work grew legs and walked away never to be seen again.  So I bought two pair.  One to replace the one that grew legs, and a spare if another pair decides to run away.</li>
    <li> These do work better than any others you buy anywhere in CVS, Walmart, Kmart, or any stores anywhere local. Don&#x27;t keep buying the cheap ones you will be putting up with cheap crap again if you do.</li>
    <li> Have bought several different tweezers trying to replace my 20 year old Tweezerman&#x27;s that got lost.  These seem to be the only ones that work as well.  So far, I&#x27;m happy with these.  The slant is at just the right angle, and they pull out short hairs.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned and I buy high quality</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;ve bought more of these tweezers were for gifts and because I couldn&#x27;t find mine.  I&#x27;ve been plucking my eyebrows for I hate to say how many years! And these are THE BEST!!  I&#x27;ve been using Rubis for about 15 years now. I could not believe how amazingly good these were after using drug-store ones for my whole life up until that point. And speaking of points, I see that they sell pointed ones, but these slanted ones HAVE a very nice point on the high end.  It takes a very very short hair to elude the grasp of my Rubis tweezers. And it&#x27;s usually the eyebrow hairs that are deeply rooted that have to be longer. But I just have to wait day or so for it to get long enough.  These are the hairs that you can&#x27;t really see but you can feel. I was just speaking to my brother about buying some new tweezers, and I told him, \\&quot;Don&#x27;t even bother to get any other brand of tweezers!! Do you want the BEST? Do you want them to last you the rest of your life?\\&quot; I just learned on here not to drop them.  I never have. So, as they say, what are you waiting for!!!</li>
    <li> I frequently have to pluck my eyebrows because I get a lot of regrowth quickly.  I, like others reviewers, used to primarily use Tweezerman tweezers and drugstore brand tweezers and used to get really frustrated when trying to pluck out thick, short hairs only to have the hairs &#x27;snap&#x27; half off and I&#x27;m left with an even shorter hair that was impossible to pluck.  These tweezers finally solved that problem!!  I finally can get at the shortest of hairs, thick or thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I think it&#x27;s only for design, I like the perforated side--it allows me to grip the tweezers well.  Another design feature that I believe adds to its performance is the thinness and sharpness of the point, probably the reason why I can pluck those little hairs so well whereas with the thick-pointed Tweezerman tweezers I couldn&#x27;t.  YAY!!  Another great product that makes my life easier...  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Finally, tweezers that remove the finest of hairs. Wish I had these years ago. Purchased them because reviews were so positive.</li>
    <li> Above and beyond my expectations!</li>
    <li> These are really fabulous, serious tweezers. Beautifully made. Very precise. They feel great in the hand and get even the tiniest hairs.</li>
    <li> The tweezer is well made and packaged. It looks very cool also. It performs slightly better then every other tweezer I have owned....just slightly. I like it, but don&#x27;t know if it was worth all the extra dollars for the slight bit of improved performance?</li>
    <li> I thought if I paid more, I would have a better product. Not! I dropped them the 3rd time I used them and the tweezing part chipped! It broke my heart.</li>
    <li> I have spent a lot of money and time trying to find tweezers that work for me!! These are them!!! Unsurpassed quality and easy to handle! They grab hairs with precision!!! I would recommend these to anyone who wants a top of the line tweezer!!! Look no further!!!</li>
    <li> These are excellent tweezers. They do pull out fine, tiny hairs without breaking them. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the price to value ratio. I think they are too costly by about $10.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend these, they are definitely worth the money. They can grab even the slightest tiniest little hairs that you can only see with a 10x mirror.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are the best I have ever used - and I have tried plenty.  They get short, stubborn hairs without hurting your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and types of tweezers, including Tweezerman, but I&#x27;ve had excellent luck with Rubis and can&#x27;t imagine purchasing any other brand now. These are extremely sharp and fine tipped with a slant, which means you can grab hold of even the finest of hairs with ease and pluck virtually painfree. Just be careful you don&#x27;t drop them; the tips are so well honed that the slighest impact can bend/tweak them to the point of uselessness.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s important to have a good quality tweezer in your home. Forget the cheap store bought tweezer, invest in a Rubis and you&#x27;ll never be sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural blond with a surprisingly hairy face.  The hair is fine and white so it slips through most tweezers.  Not these.  They are expensive but I&#x27;ve probably spent 3x that or more on cheap ones from the drug store.  I hide them from my two daughters.  I don&#x27;t want them to be dropped in the sink.  I leave the $15 ones out for their use.</li>
    <li> I know these are expensive but they really get eyebrow hairs that other tweezers won&#x27;t, so for me they are worth the price.</li>
    <li> My Tweezerman tweezers were just not getting finer hairs.  I purchased these tweezers after reading the excellent reviews.  While these are good tweezers, I agree with other reviewers who say they are overpriced by about $10 and I&#x27;m not convinced they are that much better than my current Tweezerman tweezers, which I seem to keep reaching for rather than these.</li>
    <li> Good looking and great working tweezers!  Well made happy not made in china! Good price! I highly recommend these tweezers!!</li>
    <li> This pair of tweezers misrepresented on Amazon site.  Packaging completely different from pair I own, the #135 is not engraved on item as pair I bought before and even the perforations are different on item.  Will not buy again from Amazon - I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used numerous tweezers of all shapes &amp; prices. These are the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. They are sharp enough to grab the tiny hairs. The best part though, is the fact they won&#x27;t slip out of your hand easily.</li>
    <li> Definately the best out of all I&#x27;ve used. Durability, however, is zero. This is my 5th. They break so so easily.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best brand for tweezers you can buy.  Just take care of them because I ruined a pair when I accidentally dropped them and bent the end a little.  Worth the extra money when compared to buying about 5 $10 sets from stores and hate them.</li>
    <li> would not buy any other brand</li>
    <li> one of the sharpest tweezers</li>
    <li> These are beautifully made, and I really want to like them more, but they simply don&#x27;t have the leverage and the grip of some other tweezers that are not as beautiful and don&#x27;t feel as luxurious to use. Granted, with cheaper tweezers, you may have to try three or four before you get a pair that&#x27;s made just right. For the price of these, however, they should be perfect from the start.</li>
    <li> The best pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. Just perfect</li>
    <li> best tweezers I ever used, very fine tip makes grabbing even the smallest hairs easy. Just don&#x27;t drop them, one fall and the tip is ruined.</li>
    <li> Excellent pair of tweezers !</li>
    <li> Ordered 2, one works perfectly, one not so good.</li>
    <li> my wife has had several rubis tweezers over the years but this is the second pair of these and just as good as the first pair they finally lose there edge but taking them back to the store is not to difficult and a little while later there as good as new. I don&#x27;t remember taking them in more than once. She just wants to try something new every so often to see if its better but we came back to the original and is still liking them thanks.she did discover there&#x27;s a lifetime warranty on them but hasn&#x27;t checked out how it works yet on the old pairs whether it is just against breakage or they do sharpening also.</li>
    <li> These stopped working after 1 month, I have no idea why. Waste of money. Be careful.</li>
