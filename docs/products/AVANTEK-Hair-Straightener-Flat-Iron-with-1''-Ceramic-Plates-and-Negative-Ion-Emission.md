      <li>I received the AVANTEK straightener very quickly, and it was packaged nicely, as most Amazon packages are.  </li>

      <li>Much better results than expected and a pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is a gap of around 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) between the heating plates and on-off switch which reduces the risk of accidentally touching the hot plates as the straighteners are switched off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have gotten many compliments from people who saw me after using it for the first time.  </li>
      <li>Dont heat up all too good ..and u have to keep turning it back on because it shuts off by itself</li>
      <li>As a first time reluctant user, I was happy to see that the flat iron provided optimum results even on a low heat setting.</li>
      <li>It gets hot very quickly.  </li>
      <li>found them light and easy to use, I appreciated the swivel cord so that there were no awkward twists of the flex, again not something always found on budget models.</li>
      <li>but heats up quick and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>have fine, normal hair</li>
      <li>her regular straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very good price, and does the job better than much more expensive brands.</li>
      <li>Item came exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>though I will say, the design and feel of the straightener is pretty sleek.</li>
      <li>My hair is so thick and wavy that I need a straightener that gets much warmer.&lt;br /&gt;Straightener heats up fast (because it doesn&#x27;t get that warm to begin with), but the plates to pull my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, this straightener isn&#x27;t any better than the Babyliss model I was using for over a year.</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>Perfect my hair thick and long Heathly for u to use</li>
      <li>like I do would have a much easier time with it,</li>
      <li>and it arrived on time thank you so much</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has state-of-the art floating plates made of tourmaline ceramic that heat up fast.</li>
      <li>Works like one that costs 5 times that much.</li>
      <li>heats up fast works</li>
      <li>The straightener is lightweight, and the cord is a really nice cord, it feels heavy</li>
      <li>A small red light indicated that the straighteners were switched on and heating up, this light turned green when the optimum temperature was reached.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>construction is solid and precise, but the overall weight is only 293 g or 10.3 oz., which is light enough to use for hours without strain.</li>
      <li>These are floating plates to adjust with ease to different hair thicknesses and give consistent contact.</li>
      <li>I only use a straightener once in a while, she uses one every day, and she said her hair is much softer than with</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are no high-tech press-button digital frills with these straighteners, but they do the job very well indeed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that people who don&#x27;t have a thick lion mane</li>
      <li>this flat iron works really really</li>
      <li>The swivel cord features a useful little loop for hanging the straighteners, as do salon products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

The dial goes up in 40 degree increments from 80-200 degrees, with a final setting of 220 degrees. In Fahrenheit this is 176 degrees to 427 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, normal hair so used the lower setting recommended of 120 degrees Celsius or 248 degrees Fahrenheit. A small red light indicated that the straighteners were switched on and heating up, this light turned green when the optimum temperature was reached. At 248 deg F., this was under 90 seconds, they are fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use the super-smooth ceramic straightening plates (measuring 3.5 x 1 inches) work beautifully.

    <li> This is a great buy.  It gets hot very quickly.  I like the thermostat control and the location of the on off switch.  You can&#x27;t turn it on or off accidentally.  The price was awesome.  I&#x27;m a happy gal with shiny straight hair!</li>

    <li> This is my 2nd hair straightener purchase via Amazon. My first straightener was a Babyliss product (horrible!), so I finally had to purchase something different.&lt;br /&gt;I must have overlooked the part that stated that this iron only heats up to 220 degrees. Whoops.

    <li> Works wonderfully! I love this flat iron. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy this years ago.  I just love it !  I guess I was always hesitant that it would ruin my hair since my hair is so thin &amp;  fine.  But with this product, you can adjust the temperature and my hair looks great!  I have gotten many compliments from people who saw me after using it for the first time.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Kind of cheap... but heats up quick and gets the job done.</li>
