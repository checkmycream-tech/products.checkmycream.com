      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>This mascara is great.  </li>
      <li>Great product and I shopped around.</li>
      <li>Great colour, but isn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the color is not as bright and noticeable as I would like</li>
      <li>This mascara is good for the color change while doing the job of lengthening my lashes.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a beautiful color and lasts many hours before reapplication is needed.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara!</li>
      <li>The more products I try from this brand, the more I love it!!</li>
      <li>It does wash off very easily and it does lengthen my eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>In love!!!!!!!!!!!! Arrived super fast too</li>
      <li>It is an okay mascara</li>
      <li>Really love it</li>
      <li>Its blue but not the best mascara I have ever used..</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>i love how when the sun hits my eye lashes</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>It has a good consistency, maybe a bit runny with the first application.</li>
      <li>and I look really soft and beautiful in the pictures.  </li>
      <li>Lasts all day and easy to wipe off before bed.</li>
      <li>It does fleck a bit under the eye, but brushes off easily.</li>
      <li>It covers and elongates your lashes without any clumps, and the beautiful blue hue gives my brown eyes an almost shimmering effect,  </li>
      <li>I plan to keep buying these mascara and would recommend it to any one willing to give up the &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; look for a more sophisticated one.</li>
      <li>instead they soften the eyes and bring attention to them instead of to the fine lines around them.  </li>
      <li>a day comment on how great my blue eyelashes are!  </li>
      <li>It is a bright blue.</li>
      <li>This mascara is COOL.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>It really coats my lashes and does not smudge easily once it dries.</li>
      <li>Some people stated the look was fresh, and that the mascara highlighted my eyes.</li>
      <li>To be honest I was surprised, not only is the color great for my dark brown eyes-it actually lengthens nicely and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Best for blonde lashes, herder to see if you have dark eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Not only was it affordable, it gives great color in only two coats.</li>
      <li>Love the blue.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>only tried this mascara because I&#x27;m finding that NYX cosmetics are truly fantastic.  </li>
      <li>you can really see the mascara color.</li>
      <li>I should have done more research concerning ingredients; it does contain several different parabens.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised to say the color of this product is very vibrant and shows up pretty well, especially at the tip of my lashes.</li>
      <li>I find myself rubbing my eyes more often with this mascara than others I have worn in the past.  </li>
      <li>however the brush bent a little but it still works just fine.</li>
      <li>Very royal blue.</li>
      <li>(I am 56 years old)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s vibrant cobalt blue.</li>
      <li>My eyes are brown and the blue lashes along with blue liner really makes them pop!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;order&amp;#34; my usual blue mascara, as it was only available as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34;---which makes no sense.  </li>

<li> I like to use black and then tip my eyelashes with blue.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m only disappointed that it smudges/comes off so much MORE than other colored mascaras I have tried.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like my eyes are back lit with a subtle blue light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t play well with other mascaras.</li>
<li> I wore it yesterday--tipped with black.</li>
<li> I have black lashes and was worried this color won&#x27;t show up.  </li>
<li> Contrary to what some of my friends thought, the blue eye lashes do not look fake, girly, too young, or crazy</li>
<li> I work as a cashier and at least 4 shoppers</li>
<li> But it is very irritating when it eventually gets into my eye throughout the day.</li>

    <li> I work as a cashier and at least 4 shoppers a day comment on how great my blue eyelashes are!  My eyes are brown and the blue lashes along with blue liner really makes them pop! I even keep a spare one! AND... It doesn&#x27;t run or smear....</li>

    <li> I should have done more research concerning ingredients; it does contain several different parabens.  I would  not have purchased it had I known.&lt;br /&gt;However, the color is not as bright and noticeable as I would like and it does burn if you get it in your eyes.  I find myself rubbing my eyes more often with this mascara than others I have worn in the past.  It does wash off very easily and it does lengthen my eyelashes.  It is an okay mascara but I will not purchase again.</li>

    <li> It really coats my lashes and does not smudge easily once it dries. Took a minute to get off, even with eye makeup remover. Great product for the price.</li>
