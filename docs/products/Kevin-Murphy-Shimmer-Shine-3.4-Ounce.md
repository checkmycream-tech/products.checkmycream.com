      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d read reviews from two camps, those who loved the \\&quot;musky\\&quot; scent, and those who thought it smelled more like \\&quot;Grandma.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>It always works, smells nice, and makes my hair routine easier.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While the bottle and liquid are beautiful, it does look VERY glittery when sprayed onto your hair.</li>
      <li>and I love the smell...</li>
      <li>Love this product for the shine and softness</li>
      <li>and I love it - worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I thought the scent would grow on me, but really it&#x27;s very distinct and not something</li>

      <li>Is a good thing it will last for a long time because I won&#x27;t be ordering anymore ( for the cost reason ).</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too soon to say if the repairing element is doing me any good, and at $10 an ounce, I&#x27;m hardly using it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>

    <li> I actually use this as a detangler and finish spray and I love it - worth every penny. It always works, smells nice, and makes my hair routine easier. My hair stylist introduced me to this product and I will always indulge from now on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty cool even though I feel silly for spending the $$.</li>
