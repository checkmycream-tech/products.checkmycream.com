### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I cannot tell you how AWESOME</li>
      <li>I also found that the best way to hold the strip in place while the adhesive dries is with the eraser end of a pencil.</li>
      <li>Hopefully I will get it perfect with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But the results are wonderful.  </li>
      <li>applied the product on Friday night, and by Monday morning the nails were PERFECTLY straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great idea!!</li>
      <li>The nails do not grow correctly, one of them being almost perfectly &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; shaped, pinching the area underneath the nail.</li>
      <li>Very impressed with the results.</li>
      <li>If there was an applicator and a variety of sizes this would be perfect.  </li>
      <li>I am going to send a letter letting my Dr know how wonderful this product is as an alternative to having the toe nail cut out.</li>
      <li>I think that this product would be excellent for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a severe curved toenail.  </li>

      <li>This is an amazing product!</li>
      <li>CurveCorrect is amazing!  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing product!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to wear socks again this winter, plus have a blanket on my feet without pain!  </li>
      <li>After talking with a representative of Curve Correct, I was successful at applying the brace.  </li>
      <li>This product is magic and the customer service is excellent.  </li>
      <li>This works remarkably well for what it is...</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t pleasant at all</li>
      <li>I searched on the internet and found this product with good reviews</li>
      <li>I initially loved the product.</li>
      <li>Good when it does.</li>
      <li>May be a good product</li>
      <li>I did use a good sized dab of glue on each side of the strip.</li>
      <li>I found this on Amazon and thought, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but the reveiws were good</li>
      <li>If you follow the directions...wipe off nail polish, file the nail with the nail file provided and use the cleaning solution, you should see good results.  </li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Hope this helps and good</li>
      <li>My conclusion is, if you can get the strips to stick, this might be a good product, I could not get them to stick.</li>
      <li>Their directions weren&#x27;t really good either.  </li>
      <li>Good luck everyone.</li>
      <li>USE the Primer (Solvent) for optimum results.  </li>
      <li>now im happy nice</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a good kit.</li>
      <li>Best results with application of two strips crossed over a really clean toenail.</li>
      <li>The strips have stayed on beautifully and after about 6 weeks of growth were changed over for better placement.</li>
      <li>it flattens out my toenails, I will be delighted - but right now, I&#x27;m very happy that my toes don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>I had never had a pedicure done before - but was fortunate to find a lady who was very good at working on ingrown nails.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>Anyway, once I got it on, I was very pleased.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased and relieved to have found a solution to my problem.  </li>
      <li>So, I quickly ran out of the braces without even having applied them successfully to the toes!</li>
      <li>So awesome and thankful that this is available instead of having to go to a podiatrist and paying way more money.</li>
      <li>I wish I had been able to use their product!</li>
      <li>\\&quot;I love this product!</li>
      <li>But the toenail looks better!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been seven months since I started using Curve Correct, and I love it!  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t recommend it more!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to try this before going for surgery!</li>
      <li>the strips were on perfectly for the first time, I could feel it working.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have great coordination or can&#x27;t reach your toes easily, you will need help to get them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t think it would work but with the alternative being surgery, I decided to give it a go, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
      <li>and now I am pain free and SO HAPPY that I tried this product.</li>
      <li>This is truly an amazing product.</li>
      <li>I suggest the creators of this amazing product make a tutorial video and let it slide on youtube about how to apply /</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product and gets 5 stars from me.  </li>
      <li>She is happy with the results and that is what is important.</li>
      <li>Used ASAP and couldn&#x27;t believe the amazing results...</li>
      <li>but the results have been amazing.</li>
      <li>It is so amazing</li>
      <li>It’s not the easiest thing to apply on your own.</li>
      <li>Thanks for this great product!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> While it helped a little bit, Curve Correct is NOT worth the $50 price tag. You get 10 tiny plastic strips, a nail file, a few wooden q-tips, a cleaning solvent (alcohol) and what is essentially super glue. You can buy all of these (sans the plastic strips, but you could easily get the right plastic and make them yourself) for well under $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the price tag isn&#x27;t even the main issue. The product itself is very hard to get working. I applied one side of the plastic brace with the glue as instructed, and even held it longer then the reccomended time given, and when I finally went to apply the other side, the previous side popped right off. This happened numerous times. Their FAQ states that it&#x27;s because I was using to much glue (just a drop on each end if the stick) But I used less and less each time, and it didn&#x27;t help the problem. I went through what is supposed to be a years worth of braces in less then 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I DID have the brace on properly, my toe did feel much better, but it didn&#x27;t stay on long enough to make any long term difference. It would constantly come off in my sock (most likely due to the extremely small amount of glue). I did find that applying a few coats of nail polish over the nail and brace helped keep it down a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all. I was disappointed with Curve Correct, and would of liked a refund.</li>
    <li> Works OK.Sometimes hard to stick on. Good when it does.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting a lot from the product, because I am already suffering from a ingrown and curved toenail for more than 15 years. I tried several other treatments, but nothing helped. But after only a few weeks with the CurveCorrect, I could clearly see and measure the difference. The curvature of the nail is diminishing and the first signs of a flat and healthy nail are already showing at the cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is easy to apply and if applied correctly, it can stay on there for many weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use CurveCorrect for at least another year and hopefully by then my toenail problems will be over once and for all.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed in this one.</li>
    <li> I have had what I call &amp;#34;a crap toenail&amp;#34; on my big toe since playing Lacrosse in collage (I have lost it entirely or partially at least 5 times) and recently moved to a place where you have to wear open toed shoes 6 months out of the year or risk a miserable day. So far in the last decade this has been the ONLY thing besides stuffing cotton in the side that has kept it from curling inward and in fact seems to be correcting the issue. I could not be more thrilled with the product. It took me two fumbling attempts to get it glued on right but once you get it, it stays on for weeks. Additionally you can salvage the strips you may have mucked up a bit by filing off the glue and reusing.</li>
    <li> I was really on the fence about ordering this- it seemed too simple and I wondered how could this possibly work?  After many years of doing &#x27;all the right things&#x27;- you know, cutting the nails straight across, not wearing tight shoes, and still hurting frequently with resistant big toenails on both feet; in desperation (wanting to avoid a Podiatrist visit!) I ordered the Curve Correct treatment system.  I followed instructions to the letter, and it is a bit tricky the first time you try it but it gets easier- really!  By the end of the second day I could see visible evidence that the nail itself had started to flatten out nicely and the corners that were digging into the sides of the nails had popped out above the surface!  The pain and redness is also gone.  This might sound like small potatoes, but for a lady who has had ingrown toenails for many years of my life, I feel like I&#x27;ve been given a reprieve!  I  plan on using these whenever I need them.  It is a great little system, and highly effective!  I can&#x27;t recommend it more!</li>
    <li> After suffering for years with ingrown toenails, I finally stumbled upon this product, and what a relief it was. After only a few days of having the braces on, I have noticed a significant improvement in both toenails and no more pain from the ingrown. I will continue using the braces until the toe nails have fully been corrected. I highly recommend this product. Its the only non surgery solution to ingrown toenails I have found that actually works and corrects the problem, not just temporarily!</li>
    <li> Amazing! The pain begins to disappear right away 💜</li>
    <li> I thought it was difficult to handle the strips and get a good fit</li>
    <li> I have had problems with ingrown toenails on both my big toes all my life. Had surgery when I was 11 years old and still had issues on and off. I experimented with many different cutting techniques and tried soaking in different things. But the curve correct is the only thing that ever really fixed the problem, which is the way my nails grow. They normally grow inward cutting into my skin and causing ingrown nails and lots of pain. But after a few days with the curve correct strips my toenails started shaping into a more flat/rounded growth and the pain was completely gone. One of my toes did hurt a good deal for the first 24-48 hours after the application. But I figured it was just my nail being redirected into proper growth and stuck it out. I was right. The pain went away and I have a brand new toe nail!! I used on both big toes and now I am pain free and SO HAPPY that I tried this product. I recommend paying more to get 10 strips instead of only buying a few. You will need extras incase you place it on incorrectly the first time. ( everyones nails will be different and placement is going to vary slightly) also if you have had problems for years, like me, you will want to continue use after the first set grows out. And you will want to have these incase the problem comes back and you need to reshape again.</li>
    <li> Bottom line -- this product works. I was skeptical but after a few tries to master the application there was immediate relief and the problem has been fixed. Expensive, but worth it given the alternatives. Application can be a little tricky, it took me a few trial attempts to get it right. Be patient, it does not take much adhesive, apply pressure for a few minutes and you should be good to go.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me which was a bummer! I followed the directions but eventually had to end up going to the doctor because this wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
    <li> This is my first Amazon review! I wish I would&#x27;ve tried this product before my first surgery on my big toe for ingrown toenail. The nail grew back and became ingrown again. So this time I looked for other solutions. I followed the directions carefully and over a period of a few weeks my toenail has lifted and flattened out. It works perfectly!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a severe curved toe nail, or an omega nail.  My big toe nail was curving into the sides of my toe.  It was hard to cut with normal nail trimmers and was very painful, waking me at night.  My nail was NOT infected or red.  After watching you tube to see how ingrown toenail are treated I looked for alternative treatments.  Within a day of putting it on the pain was greatly reduced and the curve reduced. After about a week it looked very much like the opposite normal nail.  I believe you really do need someone else to help you put it on, I did it myself but it was a little tricky.  As for value, well lets be brutally honest, its not $55 worth of product, but having my toenail removed at the podiatrist is $285, so I saved money that way, which is why they can charge this ridiculous price AND it worked.  Hopefully I can train my nail to grow correctly which I couldn&#x27;t do if my toenail was removed (and may grow back just as bad).  So far I&#x27;ve had the curve correct on for 2 weeks, it hasn&#x27;t fallen off and all the pain is gone.</li>
    <li> If you have tried multiple cures...this is the one that will give immediate relief and ultimately work.</li>
    <li> This product was not for me.  I have ingrown toenails a lot.  I tried using it, but I never could get the darn things to fit properly.  I did exactly as it stated and even went on Youtube.com to try to figure it out.  The price is really ridiculous for what is in the kit.  So for me, it was really a waste of money.  I ended up having to get another product.</li>
    <li> I did read reviews before I bought this product.  I found that the strip was hard to get down on both sides.  One side went really easy and the other would raise up.  So on that side I would have to put a bandaid as not to tear my nylons up.  I thought on a second attempt I would try to work the strip so it would curve, but I kept breaking the strips.  I did finally give up and sent it back.  Sorry I do wish the strips were already curved I think it would be a better product.</li>
    <li> I have had severe ingrown toenails for 45 years and was leary about spending the money but desperate for relief.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd application and can sleep with my feet under the cover, which my husband is grateful for :)</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. Took a life-long issue and made it disappear. It actually relieved pain within a day.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. It has helped. I am leaving a five star review because the products works, and toenails are straighter after about 2-3 months, but the nail glue doesn&#x27;t work that well. I followed the advice of another reviewer who kindly shared with others that you can buy nail glue at the store, and adding this if the edges get loose and also putting nail glue over the plastic helps keep them in place. Thanks for sharing that helpful suggestion. Good product.</li>
    <li> Used ASAP and couldn&#x27;t believe the amazing results...no more pain!</li>
    <li> I bought it from their website because it was little bit cheaper for me that way. I advise everyone to check their page out to see if you guys can save some money. Delivery was extremely fast. I paid like a dollar more for 2nd best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attaching part is not that hard, but it was hard to customize your stick to your toenail size. It was hard to measure how much you need to cut. Since it bends and stuff, if you are doing this alone, you might cut off more stick than you want to. Your hands are covering your view while you are measuring and since you do not have a lot of room for error, I cut too much on my first try... even though I tried to leave extra just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to be careful about is making sure the stick is parallel and not crooked on your crooked toenail. It is kind of hard to do that when you are trying to do that with a little stick. You have to put the stick in the right spot on your first try because you got super glue on the stick.  I had to throw 2 sticks away for my first try...which was kind of annoying because kit is very expensive. On my second try for both toes, it got on pretty good. It was not perfect, but pretty good. I did not want to throw another 2 sticks aways so I just decided to keep it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, my ingrown toenail (minor ingrown toenail) gets finally cured after 3months of suffering. Then this rating will become 5 stars. Hopefully, it does not go the other way around.</li>
    <li> One of the biggest wastes of time and money I have experienced in my adult life. It may work fine for some folks, but this type of work needs to be handled by a professional. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Seller is honest, dependable, reasonable and fast!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the worst purchase of my life.  You have to be a magician to get the stuff on.  Wouldn&#x27;t stick (and yes I followed the directions to a t).  The &amp;#34;brace&amp;#34; broke in half every time I tried to get it on.  A total, complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> I read the instructions through several times before trying to stick one on. In the instructions they warn using too much glue can make them not stick properly. So I was very careful the amount of glue I put on the strip (I put a dot of glue on and then used the wood stick wipe half off- only a thin layer remained). Still, I used 3 strips just trying to get them to stick. Lets says I was able to get the next one to stick, then another for the other big toe. So I would have used half the 10 strips just trying to get them on the first time? I spent about a half hour trying reading and re-reading the directions, roughing and cleaning the toenail, holding the strip to let the glue dry, etc..But the strip simply wouldn&#x27;t stay on. Whenever I put pressure on the strip to attach the other side to the nail it would come off. Lastly  I tried the modified attachment  (if you can&#x27;t get it on the normal way, they suggest a less pressure/less effective way by attach a shorter piece closer to the base of the nail). By then I was pretty frustrated, so I can&#x27;t really say if the modified application is helpful in correcting ingrown nails or not, seems like it would take an awfully long time for the base to grow out and become the tip of the nail-maybe a year? Either way, the strips did not want to stay attached to my nails so I sent it back. Now, that&#x27;s where I was frustrated a second time by this product/company. They have a \\&quot;110% guarantee\\&quot; on their website. When I buy an item I&#x27;m pretty happy if they offer free shipping and free returns, but an extra 10% back if you don&#x27;t like the product? (I mean I did file the top surface of my nails to roughen them for the glue maybe its their way of saying sorry this didn&#x27;t work for you?) So I returned the item and they issued a refund of the purchase price, no 10% extra, and no shipping either way. So I emailed them and asked them where the rest of the refund was...well, we went back and forth a bit, in the end they basically just covered theshipping, but, I had to argue with them for it.  My conclusion is, if you can get the strips to stick, this might be a good product, I could not get them to stick. But even so, the 10 strips provided in the package are not near enough. They should put in at least 20 strips so that if you use 5 of them the first time trying to get them to stick its not a big deal you still have 3/4 of the strips left. Finally, there is no reason I for a company to argue with customers. If the claim 0.3% return rate is true (as stated on their site) then really my return was not that big of a deal, why argue with me?  I bought these directly from the seller&#x27;s website.    BTW, I&#x27;m assuming that these actually will stick for someone, they just didn&#x27;t for me. I guess its possible a company would sell a product they know doesn&#x27;t work, I just don&#x27;t like to think that people deliberately deceitful.</li>
    <li> Truly a life-saver!  If you suffer with ingrown toenails, suffer no more!  CurveCorrect will save you unnecessary visits and painful procedures with their revolutionary product.  I will NEVER be without this kit.  Initially it may seem a bit pricey, but when you consider office co-pays, deductibles, pain, time off work, these are very reasonable and DON&#x27;T HURT!!!  Besides, they offer a 110% money back guarantee which &#x3D; no risk.  Thank you again CurveCorrect!</li>
    <li> I have a toenail that is severely curved, to the point where the sides almost touch and it pinches the skin. It is a pretty narrow nail bed, and so the curve is pretty dramatic. The Curve Correct strips included in the kit are too brittle to wrap around the whole nail, but even trying sections at a time I was not getting anywhere. So I had a little revelation. I also use BreatheRight strips at night to sleep better, and they have little plastic ribs inside that are more flexible than the plastic included with this kit. I went about removing the plastic from a breatheright strip and cleaning all of the adhesive residue off of it. Then I scuffed it up with the very aggressive nail file included with the curvecorrect kit. I trimmed it to size and used the superglue included in the kit to apply the strip, and it curves enough to go all the way around the nail without breaking. Better yet, it still has some springiness left in it because it is working! I applied the new plastic last night and this morning my nail edges are now 2mm apart (24 hours later). This has taken all the pressure off the skin that was getting pinched and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. When it flattens enough that I can apply the plastic strips that come with the kit I will, until then, it&#x27;s nice to have an option for severely curved nails.</li>
    <li> Useless!!! Initially failed numerous times to stick braces across the toe.  Contacted company who claimed the glue was a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34; and in fairness sent on more adhesive and some extra braces but with same result - they would not stick!!!</li>
    <li> Really helps correct the condition.</li>
    <li> Worked for me! I had ingrown toenails on both of my big toes and on the second toenail of my right foot from years of pounding my feet walking and hiking. Plus, I was not cutting the nail straight across and was making the ingrown toenails worse. Once I put the braces on, I could feel the nail pulling and it made my toes sore for a couple of days but I could see the nail flattening out right away. I kept the braces on for weeks and they stayed in place even after miles of walking and hiking. They do eventually come off but you can sometimes glue them back on if only one side comes loose. The nail sides are now pulled out flatter and I can slide my fingernail under the left and right side of the nail on my big toes. Haven&#x27;t been able to do this for many years and I&#x27;m so glad to get rid of the pain and discomfort cause by the ingrown nails. I&#x27;m very happy with the results and have recommended this kit to family members with the same problem.</li>
    <li> Ok, it has been a month and I think it is reshaping the growth pattern of my nail. I have not had any pain and all the swelling is gone! It was a little tough to apply, but I just followed the directions and it has not come off once! It was easy to order and came really fast. It has my &amp;#34;seal of approval&amp;#34;!!!!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from ingrown toenails for years and ever since I had surgery on my feet never having trouble before. I went back to the pediotrist doctor to cut my nail out on both big toes. I ended up going back a second time for both big toes. The doctor used phenol and my toenail still grew back but thin and warped so I still am suffering with one of my big toes. I was so frustrated not being able to wear shoes and socks and didn&#x27;t want to go through another winter with my toe problem so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Since my surgeries on both feet I can not maneuver my feet and toes like I used to so this was a little difficult for me and used a lighted magnified glass floor lamp so I could see it better. I do wish they sent more strips. I had to cut the strips a lot and glue to almost the center of my toe because the thin nail has broken way back so this may take a long time to tell if it helps or not. It is worth a try since the doctors haven&#x27;t helped me. After the surgery to correct bunions etc., it left me with some nerve damage and numbness and this is why I couldn&#x27;t tell my toes were getting ingrown toenails. I think that if I knew this product even existed that I would have tried this first before I even went back to the doctor. My experience with the foot doctor and surgeries have been a nightmare. This is definitely worth a try to everyone. It just might take me a lot longer than most to see results.</li>
    <li> Works slowly and is hard to apply. Best results with application of two strips crossed over a really clean toenail. My wife&#x27;s nail was almost tubular and it did the trick. We recommend it highly. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> My big toe nail was curved and starting to cause pain.  I let it grow out and wore sandals as I had read online, but it was still not straightening out (3 weeks).  I would soak in the hot tub and try and bend it out while the nail was soft with some needle nose pliers and that would actually help a little for a day or two.  This treatment cured it almost instantly, wish I had thought of this million dollar idea.  They are clear (not brown as pictured) and no one even notices it on my toe in sandals.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical like others here but I was at the end of the journey in my battle with an ingrown (from two bad pedicures)...  I was about to schedule surgery because the pain was so bad.  I&#x27;m so lucky to have found this product because I am now pain-free.  This product is magic and the customer service is excellent.  They were with me 100% of the way as my toenail started to heal.  The only frustrating part is you will likely need a partner to help adhere the strip to your nail.  That part was a bit tricky.  But once on - the pain miraculously disappears instantly!  I recommend this product to anyone!  Like I said - it is a little piece of magic that saved me from the pain and hundreds of dollars for disfiguring toenail surgery.  Unnecessary!  Thank you Curve Correct!</li>
    <li> It appears to be working. With curved nail, it can be difficult to apply the first time, but as my nail flattens out some, it&#x27;s not as difficult. It really only takes a drop of glue and splint stays on. I remove mine when they get to end of nail and then reapply.</li>
    <li> I have had ingrown toenail surgery 3 times!!!&lt;br /&gt;All times extremely painful and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I have had a toenail full removed to wait and grow back which resulted in another ingrown toenail which I later got a surgery which does something similar to this home treatment but much more painful. When I had surgery my Dr. had placed a metal brace that was laid across my nail like curvecorrect but instead of being just glued to the top of my nail the metal braces were tucked underneath my nail. so basically a piece of metal wrapped over my nail to stop my toenail from curving.&lt;br /&gt;After having this surgery twice when my ingrown nail returned I searched for alternative methods as I grew tired of surgery and bills. I found this and gave it a try. IT&#x27;S A MIRACLE! It worked!!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It isn&#x27;t an overnight miracle solution. It actually took as long as it did with the metal brace method but was less painful and not as obvious as curvecorrect is clear. I will say the first day of use I could instantly feel relief in my nail from pinching.&lt;br /&gt;I will look for photos of before, during and after and edit my post.</li>
    <li> I dread going to get my pedicure and having her painfully digging out that ingrown nail.  And in a week or so, the pain starts again as the nail once again digs in.  I tried so many things at the advice of others, including buying new shoes even though I loved my old ones and they were not even tight. I have had surgery in the past and the problem recurred about two or three years later and has persisted ever since.  When I saw this product, I was skeptical but willing to try anything.  I have used it over three applications now, as my big toe toenail is bent for some reason on one side.  It has not totally straightened the nail yet but I must admit that the pain between pedicures is pretty much gone, and the digging out is much much less if not totally solved.  There is no doubt that it has improved my condition. Great idea!!</li>
    <li> CurveCorrect is amazing!  I&#x27;ve been dealing with an ingrown nail for a very long time. I even had surgery on it to remove a portion along the outer edge.  My toenail had formed a severe curvature, which was causing me a lot of pain.  When looking for treatments online, I saw this product and thought what the heck.  If it works, great; if not, at least I gave it a try.  I&#x27;m telling you this is a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Once on my toe, the CurveCorrect began working almost immediately to flatten my toenail and relieve the pain.  It has been on my nail for three weeks and is still firmly attached. I marvel everyday at the change in my nail, and my pain is gone!  Truly amazing!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I ordered the Curve Correct treatment kit but I was tired of going to the doctors and having them cut or even laser my ingrown toenails and then having them grow back.  I used the kit on both big toes and after a week I got relief.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic braces strips are easy to use.  Just glue to one side of the nail and after it dries, bend the brace and glue it to the other side of the nail. Cut off any excess so it don&#x27;t catch on your socks.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like someone should have thought of this ingenious approach sooner, including the medical community.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for those having ingrown toenail problems.&lt;br /&gt;Rocco V</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the results. Turned my constantly painful, taco-shaped big toenail into normal looking nail in just a matter of weeks. Essentially you are super glueing an industrial strength Breath-Right strip onto your nail. I was really skeptical at first. I&#x27;ve been on a couple rounds of Lamisil pills, and constantly cutting the corners back with clippers, but nothing really helped. But since &amp;#34;installing&amp;#34; one of the nail braces, I&#x27;ve been going on two months without any pain and a dramatically flatter nail.</li>
    <li> Searched and searched over the years for a solution for a very curved nail on both sides of the nail, I think I tried it all, nothing worked. I was hesitant at such a &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34; solution, but took the risk of wasting money on more treatments that didn&#x27;t work. Well let me tell you these work as long as you follow directions closely. I even went a bit further than the directions and my strips stay on wonderfully for almost a full nail growth period. I started with the first one about 1/4 inch from the nail bed where it really started to curve, followed directions exactly to make the adhesive work properly. I then added a couple costs of a brush on nail glue over the entire nail to sort of seal it since I wear polish and didn&#x27;t want the polish remover to get to the actual adhesive. Every time I repaint my nails, I give it another coat on brush on nail glue as a base coat and the strip stayed on for 6 months until the ends did work up. I removed that strip and applied a new one the same way a touch higher up on the nail that I started the first one, (the curve was lessend back at the nail bed by now). This strip has now been on right at 3 months and is still helping more. It takes right at a year for a full nail growth on the big toes to grow completely out so yes, this is slow and you would need to wear the strips for at least one full nail growth out I think. Might even have to do it again if the nail starts curving back again, but the pain is gone within hours of putting the strip on or mine was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other big toe wasn&#x27;t near as bad as the first, the first strip is still on it from about 9 months ago when I got these and right now it is at a point when I trim or file my nails it is slowly being taken off, it is at the nail tip. The nail is back to normal and flat. I will not re apply a new one since the nail appears normal and feels normal. I might again in the future if it curves again, but it is cured. I think mine stayed on so good due to keeping it sealed from all moisture and not letting the adhesive come loose. I also made sure I got the ends down the sides of the nail good, yes it hurt to get them all the way down the sides of the nail at first but I did manage to get the strip end under the skin grown over the edge of the nail, by a good soak first so the skin was softer and i could separate the skin and nail. Used a blow dryer to dry good, the dehydrator in the package, your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these to anyone with ingrown nails, even if you think they are hopeless curved, give them a try, and give them time as mine did work. My really bad, bad nail is into treatment 9 months now and I believe it will take another 9 months or so for the nail to be fully flat as it should be, but it don&#x27;t hurt at all with the strips pulling the edges up 24/7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an edit from about 1 year later.......... I still love these strips. I would have liked it if the cement/glue would last longer and not dried up, but, yes I have had them for quite a while, and yes they do really work. They are a holy grail for me if I notice a nail turning under and starting to hurt again. I put strip back on about half way down nail bed, and can keep it on until the nail just grows out and I file strip off the grown out end. I now end up putting one on about every 6 months or so. This in grown toe nail thing I guess is going to be a lifelong battle but with these, it is so easy to treat, polish over them and no one can tell.rom all moisture and not letting the adhesive come loose.

    <li> It&#x27;s a little cumbersome &amp; I have a severely curved nail.  But, the pain went away after a few days.  With modifications (as described in the instructions), my toenail is slowly straightening out.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all! So upset</li>
    <li> Trying to put a sliver of super glue on a 1 mm thin piece a plastic is very difficult and it didn&#x27;t even stick to my toenail. Tried putting more glue on toenail and then holding the plastic thing on and it managed to stay on for about a week before coming off and leaving my toenail still curved and now with superglue caked on it. Had more luck at a real podiatrist to fix the immediate infection and also getting podiatrist scissors to cut the corners of my toenails so they don&#x27;t dig in and get infected again. The scissors I got were these: [[ASIN:B002WPZNRQ B002WPZNRQ]] If you feel like you need this product, save some money and get zip ties and super glue.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working...put the first one on and it is still there, almost completely straightened the curl in my toenail, saved me a lot of pain having it cut out! I still have nine more of them if I need them...what really amazes me is how that one has stayed on all this time through all the showers.  Anyone who is facing having to get surgery done for ingrown toenails should consider trying these things...it is not an overnight thing..takes several weeks but it is the best way to naturally and permanently get the toenail straightened back out and not curling into your toe causing pain and infection. You need to really prep everything per the instructions so it will hold, the time spent getting it ready is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Though I was skeptical about the claims of this product, I needed to do something to relieve the pain of my ingrown toenail.  Both the doctors I saw wanted to remove my toenails on my big toes.  Not acceptable since I have my daughter&#x27;s wedding in 2 months.  My toe was so painful that it was an ordeal just applying the CurveCorrect brace.  Now, after 3 weeks of wearing the brace, I&#x27;m nearly pain free.  I wrote the company to give positive feedback and they responded the same day, offering me even more options to assist in healing my severely ingrown toenail.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the curve correct product and the excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, these little strips work. I have been bothered by ingrown toenails for the past several years and finding no solution to stop the ingrown toenail process. I found these little gems, pricey but well worth the money. After carefully reading and following instructions I applied these strips to my toes just last night with no problem. Let me tell you that you will feel them lifting the toenail through the night and it is about as painful as a sore ingrown nail. My toes are slightly sore this morning but my toenails are already back to its natural curve, so I&#x27;ll deal with the current pain. I will leave these on as per the instructions; 3 to 6 weeks. With the way that these have already corrected the curve of my toenails I already know as my nails grow out it will have basically trained them to grow properly with out the curve.</li>
    <li> Once I got the brace glued on, the first 2-3 days I was feeling some pressure and discomfort and then on day 4 I looked down and the problem curved side of the big toe had straightened out.  My husband and I couldn&#x27;t believe our eyes.  It grew out and over the tissue in a couple of weeks. It looked a little wider but no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always had trouble doing certain postures in Piloga class(when we are on our tip toes) but no pain or discomfort now. I have had problems since I was a teenager with this toe.  I wish I knew about this product way back them. Thank you so much for selling it here.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me.  I tried over and over again but the strips just would not stay on my big toe.</li>
    <li> This product works!! A miracle product for me it relieved me from ingrown toenail pain pretty much immediately as soon as applied !! It is so amazing I tell anyone who suffers from ingrown toenails that this product will work. It is a life saver!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered ingrown toenails for years, did a lot of research how to grow them out, put up with a lot of pain and suffering. My husband even invented a clip for me, (made out of a silver earring). The clip was brilliant, managed to grow my nail enough to slip the clip on, which took the curved edges away from the skin. When I seen this product advertised, we worked out it did the same sort of job as the clip did. You do need someone to help you put this strip on, the pressure is relieved straight away, it does the job exactly what everyone is talking about. This is a very expensive item, I received a card from Royal Mail, when my parcel arrived, but they couldn&#x27;t deliver it as there wasn&#x27;t enough postage paid on the goods. I also had a hefty price to pay, Handling charges, £8.00, plus Tax as it was outside the EU which was an extra £5.65. All in all a total of £13.65. I paid £5.90 shipping and delivery when I ordered goods, so if you live in the UK, be aware. Good luck everyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this rather expensive package ($60) because several reviews raved about it. However, I cannot confirm that this product works because there are several problems: the so-called braces do not bent to fit the second or third toes, and measuring the braces to the size you need for the smaller toes is a pain and waste. So, I quickly ran out of the braces without even having applied them successfully to the toes! And all that for $60, which is a scam!</li>
    <li> I have had ingrown toenails for as long as I can remember. I normally did what all of us do. I soak them, I dig them out and I get relief for a few days and then do it all over again. Silly I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had a severely ingrown toenail that was extremely painful and infected and caused me to have cellulitis in my foot and I was worried that I was going to have to have surgery of some type.&lt;br /&gt;I went to a Dr. to get the infection under control and he talked to me about CurveCorrect as one option to prevent ingrown toenails.&lt;br /&gt;After years of ingrown toenails I decided to give it a shot. I admit it was pretty tough to get the splint on and not fall off but once I did get it to stick for more than a day the relief was instant. I could feel my toenail being corrected by the splint and the pain was replaced with a slight pressure.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to follow the instructions and do exactly as they say. If you can get the splint to stay on for a week or more you will get relief from the pain.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Definitely works. Basically it&#x27;s a kit with a file, q-tips, superglue, isopropyl alcohol (I think...), and these tiny little plastic strips.  Do read the directions a few times before applying the first time. Yes, they&#x27;re a little long, but if you do it wrong you won&#x27;t be happy. The process actually is very easy, and once you have some hands-on experience you won&#x27;t need the directions anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, just plan to mess up the first one -- my first fell off and got lost after a few days.  The second one has held on good for a couple weeks now and has already rotated the nail-edge of my big-toenail a good 45 degrees.  I&#x27;ll try to post an update in a year or 2 when the nail should be totally fixed (fingers crossed...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: don&#x27;t let the price deter you. If you&#x27;re thinking about a diy ingrown nail repair you really should try this.</li>
    <li> I initially loved the product. My pain was gone in a day. I kept using it, successfully, for a full growth cycle, 5 months, to fully correct my ingrown toenails. Why, you might ask, am I so dissatisfied? The braces are too thick for aging nails, generally the very nails that need correction. This eventually causes the nail to crack and break, in my case almost down to the quick. I have notified the company, and they claim I should have known my nails were too thin for the product. I did not. They did not break before. CurveCorrect also claims that this is fully explained on the website. It is not. It is not clear. They also claim that they have a thinner brace for fragile, older nails. Again, not an option mentioned on the website. Customer service&#x27;s &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; to my problem is just to let the nails grow out again. Of course, they will probably grow out ingrown, since they are so short. And I might add, so ugly. I am dreading a summer of cracked, uneven, hideous nails. I do not recommend this product unless you are young, with &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; toenails.</li>
    <li> i bought curve correct in early June. I had the brace on for less than 48 hours and now a month later my toenails are grown back evenly. I have had both big toes ingrown for about 3 years. I started cutting them diagonally and pulling the sharp pieces out which only made it worse in the long run. You can see in the photos that my toenail is cut all the way down the side and the skin is swollen. In the second photo I have the brace applied way down towards the bottom since I had cut the ingrown part to relieve the pain. I had to glue the braces on twice and both times they came off the next day at work. The braces were on my toes for less than 48 hours total but I could feel them working. It did make my toes a little sore. I was going on vacation and figured I would try to reglue the braces on again when I would be at home. I never had to reapply them. Over the last month my toenails grew correctly (last photo with the nail polish) and I am pain free for the first time in 3 years.</li>
    <li> Since using CurveCorrect, I am pain-free.  I was previously stuffing tissue under my nails.  This was a temporary solution at best and the tissue constantly would have to be changed.  With CurveCorrect, I never have pain and do not have to change it.  I haven&#x27;t reached the total grow-out point as yet and will be curious as to whether this product will permanently solve my problem.  I don&#x27;t quite understand if this is a cure-all product or whether treatments will be required in the future.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had been suffering with an ingrown toe nail for several months.  I was too lazy (always running late) to apply the bit of cotton at the corners every day.  I dreaded wearing certain shoes, even sleeping was uncomfortable, if I happened to rest that toe on the bed.  I found this on Amazon and thought, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but the reveiws were good and I was a my wits end.  I am so glad that I spent the money, after glueing the strip, I had instant relief, as the nail wasn&#x27;t digging into my skin.  Within days the sore skin was completely pain free.  Even though it looks like the nail growth direction has been corrected because I&#x27;ve had it on for 3 weeks now, I&#x27;m going to keep the strip on until the nail grows out.  So awesome and thankful that this is available instead of having to go to a podiatrist and paying way more money.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This has got to be the greatest seller in the world, especially when your nail is hurting. Way better then any surgery. WOW THIS SELLER DELIVERS THE BEST AND THEN SOME. Product works so good, and seller shipped so fast it really is a miracle product that works fast. Thank You sooooo much. From the big toe healed thanks to you guys&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Thisis what everyone that has trouble with ingrown toenails! It works just as described. The only mistake I made was overusing the high grit emery board provided in the kit. I nearly went right through the entire nail. All you need is to pass the board over your nail 5 or 6 times with slight pressure. But after I got over that,the Curve Correct pulled my ingrown nail up and I was able to clip it evenly to the rest of my toenail.A month later,my toenail was well on its way to a healthy nail!! Great product!!</li>
    <li> I suffered with ingrown toe nails for years. I tried every thing on the market. Surgery was not something I wanted. I found this product CurveCorrect. I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product as directed and within three or four days I had relief. This product does work. I will see if the problem comes back. If it does, I will use this again as needed.</li>
    <li> Glue wont hold for long. It would work if it held. Maybe if I used real super glue?</li>
    <li> Immediately feel the difference. Have only had on for 48 hours but so far it is living up to its claims. Noticed the difference almost immediately. I used to not be able to touch the corners of my big toe without pain, now there is no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application was fairly easy if you follow the instructions and as it says, read the instructions entirely before starting, so you now what&#x27;s coming next. I applied immediately after getting out of the shower and instructions do say that doing it after washing or soaking your feet is advisable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if this thing falls off tomorrow I think I would still give it at least a 3- or 4-star review because it works. Morning after application my toe did hurt when walking, it felt like it was pulling up on the nail (which I guess, it was). I used my fingernail to gently pry up one corner of one side of the strip and that reduced the pain by I suppose just reducing the level of pull very slightly. To be safe I would suggest applying it at a time where you won&#x27;t be doing a ton of walking the next day, but if you&#x27;re in tremendous pain from ingrown toenail anyway, then who cares?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See photos. First photo (with powder on toes) is immediately prior to application, around 3 pm. Second photo is about 8 am next morning. Photo was taken from in front of my toenail so you can see the amount of curve. It may not look like an extreme difference but remember - the strip is applied about halfway up the nail, not all the way at the tip. So the reduction of the curvature at the end of the nail should increase as my nail grows and the strip moves with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application suggestion - it is important not to put too much adhesive on the strip but it&#x27;s hard to make just a small dot come out so I ended up with a big dot which I blotted gently with cotton swab (Q-tip) to soak up some of the adhesive. It seems to have worked.</li>
    <li> I purchased in desperation as I had 3 toenail surgeries in six months and one year later I was still suffering.  I thought what can I lose with a 110 percent money back guarantee?  So I purchased the item.  Application was tricky and although not perfect, within 24 hours I was pain-free.  Within a week, all the swelling in my toe disappeared.  This is an outstanding product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Day 30- the strip is still in place.</li>
    <li> Was not worth the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to apply the tiny strips.  Hard to ascertain how/where to cut strips to size.  Difficult to know just where to place on toe.  Customer Service was really good.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, at the suggestion of a friend, I got acrylics on my toes for an instant improvement on the curvature of my toenails.  Much easier for me &amp; no more ingrown nail problems.</li>
    <li> So far I am encouraged by this product.  At first, I had a hard time applying the braces and getting them to stay on.  After talking with a representative of Curve Correct, I was successful at applying the brace.  My two big toenails were both ingrown and painful.  After only a week the pain relief was noticeable and welcome.  I have used the product now for six months and as long as I use it, I don&#x27;t seem to have a problem.  However, once I no longer had a brace on, I have noticed both big toenails are curving a little again.  Disappointed, I called Curve Correct and spoke with a representative again.  After discussing my concerns, I came away with a better understanding of how and when to apply the brace and learned that some people have to use the braces periodically to have continued success.  This is the first product of the many I have tried that has given me relief from pain of ingrown toenails.  I am encouraged by my somewhat success to continue using the product to hopefully achieve full success. I have to say with all the company representatives I have talked to about products, the representatives of Curve Correct are helpful and seem to want to assist their customers to achieve success.  I plan to continue using Curve Correct and I highly recommend it to others who suffer from ingrown toenails.</li>
    <li> It is working after being a struggle to apply, although at 89 years old I did apply it.  My toe nail is decidedly flattening.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t work for me; it kept popping off and when it didn&#x27;t pop off, it hurt. But the people who run the company are extremely nice and accommodating. I wish I had been able to use their product!</li>
    <li> The braces did not adhere to my toenails. I tried to apply them about 10 times. Once I applied too much adhesive and it did not cure. However, the other times it appeared to cure, and I certainly waited more than the recommended time period, but when I curved them over to the other side of the nail, they popped off. I followed all the instructions scrupulously, including the troubleshooting, still a huge fail. I do have fairly thick, stiff nails with a sharp curve at the edge, so perhaps they were just not meant for my type of nail problem. However, that would have been good to know before I spent $45 and wasted 2 hours.</li>
    <li> This did the job it said it would do.  However, for me, it was very painful.  My ingrown toenail was a bit infected and as soon as the other side of the was pressed down it felt as if the ingrown toenail was ripped out.  It wasn&#x27;t pleasant at all but it appeared to do the job just the same.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with an ingrown toenail of my son (12 years old) at least 6 months, I took him several times to an expensive podologist without a definitive solution (I even have to take him to a surgeon to take out the nail). Curve Correct Ingrown is simple and a great solution!</li>
    <li> My ingrown nail is gone as well as the curvy of my toe nail. But I got a dark bruise under my toe nail. Hopefully it will disappear.  19 March 2016- A little bit over a year my ingrown nail complete gone and the dark bruise healed. This is an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Helped to correct the curve in my toe, but its a bit expensive for what it is. Still, it comes neatly packaged with everything you need,</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it to stick. Ended up going to podiatrist for treatment.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.  After using it for a little over a month I sent the remainder of the product back and the company provided me with it&#x27;s money back guarantee plus 10% -- GREAT ON THE COMPANY!!!  I think that this product would be excellent for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a severe curved toenail.  I have a curved nail and deep skin pockets so after trying this I ended up having a double matrixectomy.</li>
    <li> This is extremely over-priced and it does not work!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had read the 1 star reviews, before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;They are spot-on!</li>
    <li> Used hestitantly at first but followed the directions. I find that using the enclosed cleaner on my nail and on the plastic strip will ensure that all the oil is off and the strip will stay in place for weeks. The ingrown nail pain was almost immediately relieved and when the plastic strip finally fell off after 21/2 weeks, I had a bruise on the nail but the ingrown nail had grown straight and I no longer have the painful problem. I&#x27;m also switching to a W width shoe from now on to ensure it doesn&#x27;t happen again.</li>
    <li> May be a good product but I never got to use it as the glue was dried out in the bottle.</li>
    <li> My Dr said all he could do was cut off my ingrown toenail and hope it grew back correctly.  That didn&#x27;t sit well with me so I decided to try this out.  Amazingly it worked perfect!  I had to use it twice because the 1st one fell off after about 5 weeks, but not a big deal.  So happy to have a normal toenail again!!</li>
    <li> Total waste of money, didn&#x27;t stick and the strips kept snapping. Extremely annoyed as this was not cheap.</li>
    <li> It works!  The nail on my big toe began to distort into an inverted V and the edges of the nail dug into the flesh.  I went to a podiatrist who told me to make and appointment to have the nail removed.  When I got home I searched on the web to see if there was something else I could do.  I discovered this product and ordered it based upon the reviews.  When it arrived I was amused to find that it consisted of some springy plastic strips, some Q-tips and some super glue.  All worth about $2 at the most.  The bottom line is that it works and I don&#x27;t regret spending the $50.  When you really see the difference it makes is after you take a shower and your nails get soft.  That&#x27;s when the springy strip really start to work straightening out the nail.  Thanks Inventor!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes it would work, however, they don&#x27;t stay on longer than 10 days. I actually put bandaids on to try to protect them.  Too expensive for what you get and how long they stay on. Would prefer if Amazon sold the spring clips for ingrown toenails.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of this, thinking a little strip like this wouldn&#x27;t really work. But it did. The worst part was getting it on. I&#x27;m glad I had more than one strip because I broke the first one. I also think using the wooden stick to help hold the strip on while waiting for the glue to dry is not the best instrument. I just couldn&#x27;t get it to push the strip down the side and hold. If it were tapered so it would fit better on the edge of the nail, it would probably work.  I finally used a metal cuticle pusher to hold the strip down in the side crevice. This worked very well. I also thought the directions were confusing. At first I thought I was supposed to use the nail file to smooth the nail. It wasn&#x27;t until I read under troubleshooting that I saw that the nail is supposed to be roughed up. And I figured out you don&#x27;t have to rough up the entire nail, only the part where you&#x27;ll be putting the strip.  I also didn&#x27;t use quite enough glue to begin with. The instructions say use just a wee bit of glue and I guess I made it too wee! Anyway, once I got it on, I was very pleased. It never came off. It never bothered my in any way, it just took away my pain. When my nail grew out and the strip was on the end of the nail, I finally removed it. That was about a week ago. So far, no pain. I highly recommend this, even if it is bothersome to put on. It takes away the pain. It was worth the money to get this one because of the extra strips.</li>
    <li> 1) the nail file/sand/paper included was way to coarse, i had to use a smoother sandpaper to make the surface smooth enough to make the plastic strap stick. 2) I tried 2 times to do this myself and failed, had to get the wife to help me position and stick these straps. 3) First time in the shower one of them popped, but it was easy to re glue. 4) they should include more strips in the packages,as they are the only thing that you need, you can buy Que tips and crazy glue anywhere. The concept is very good, i will report back to you in one month. The plastic straps fell off after 7 days.</li>
    <li> This was a great invention.  I had a doctor tell me I would keep getting ingrown toenails if I didn&#x27;t have surgery.  This is a slow process, but who cares. It is virtually invisible under my fingernail polish, and has already made a difference after just a couple weeks. In fact it pulled the nail straighter as soon as I applied it. I am going to continue to use it as the directions stated, so I will be able to train my nails to stay straight.&lt;br /&gt;When I first applied the glue to the 1st side, I did not put enough glue.  I had read that it is important not to put too much, so I really under glued it (a smear rather than a drop. It popped back up when I put down the 2nd end. Not a problem though, I just reset the 1st end again and it has stayed since.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to invest in this product but I am so glad I did. After suffering with a painful ingrown toenail for the past two years I am now pain free. I was amazed that almost immediately the pain diminished and that within a couple of days the nail appeared flatter and wider. I had forgotten what my toenail was suppose to look like until now. The instructions were easy to follow and I have had no problem with the product staying on. It has been a fast, effective and easy solution to what has been a painful long-term problem. The cost was well worth it given the quick results.</li>
    <li> I really didn’t think this would work when I ordered it, but after a few hours the pain was gone.  I don’t know if it will really flatten out the nail in the long run, but the toe nail pain is gone for now.&lt;br /&gt;I did get glue stuck to my fingers.  It’s not the easiest thing to apply on your own.</li>
    <li> Thank you Lee (my nail tech) for recommending this product. No more going back to the Podiatrist to have ingrown toenails removed.</li>
    <li> Did not work and upon reflection I don&#x27;t see this working for anyone else because the plastic strips don&#x27;t exert any significant pressure to fix the curve of a nail. What a colossal ripoff for some worthless plastic strips,  glue, alcohol,  and swabs. About 2$ worth of materials in the box.</li>
    <li> This product has helped tremendously. I used two or three strips that stayed on for 3 or 4 weeks each. The nail is significantly less curved and could probably do with one more treatment strip for full effect, but is so much improved I just haven&#x27;t taken the time yet. Thanks for this great product!</li>
    <li> It corrected my curved toenail on only one foot. It&#x27;s pretty good for someone that doesn&#x27;t wear shoes all day and doesn&#x27;t engage in much physical activity. I work construction and these strips kept coming off. I almost used the entire tube of strips just for my two big toes. I followed the instructions well, used very little glue, and still the strips came off. I guess if I didn&#x27;t move around a lot then these strips would be perfect.</li>
    <li> No surgery for me! This is an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Working quite good except too expensive for the little amount of strips. It comes off a few times and the whole set is now useless without the strips. Contacted the seller, they are charging $21.5 + shipping for the plastic strips.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how AWESOME this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was honestly at the end of my rope in terms of the pain and constant infections of my toe.  I took a chance on CurverCorrect and I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of hours of applying the CurveCorrect, my ingrown toenail was straighter.  I could see where it had been pulled up.  For a few days afterward, I could feel the CurveCorrect band on my toe pulling the nail up, but it was not uncomfortable.  If anything it was comforting knowing the pain was no longer there and the product was doing it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been four weeks and the first band I installed is still on doing its job.  I have not had any pain since!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so amazed with the product that I recommended it to a girlfriend who has been experiencing ingrown toenails as well.</li>
    <li> Do not buy,,, this does not work and is in fact damaging. I&#x27;m not sure who they have posting reviews but they are false. I purchased based on reviews and that was a mistake. First, they do not stay on as others have stated. Then, the glue ends up in your ingrown area causing more problems. Because any of you that do have ingrown nails know, you have to keep that area free of anything, even a speck of sand is painful. Now you have &amp;#34;crazy glue&amp;#34; stuck in there till it decides to wear off. I don&#x27;t have bad I frown nails, I wanted to resolve the problem early. This could not possibly work on someone with severe ingrown nails if they can&#x27;t even stay on mine!  Use the cotton method. Go on you tube and find out how to do it. It costs next to nothing and is working well for me.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Curve Correct kit maybe 18 months ago, and the product is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two strips applied one after the other have considerably flattened a toenail that had grown convoluted on one side following the nail&#x27;s removal for surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I live in a warm climate and wear sandals most of the time, the strips stayed in place for months, grew up the length of the nail, and finally have to be trimmed off with the nail overhang and new strip applied.</li>
    <li> I was not a believer but thought It was worth a try given the positive reviews.  On day two, my pain was a little worse as it was working to pull the ingrown nails up .  No more ingrown nails! No need for surgery.I am so pleased. Do not hesitate to buy this product!</li>
    <li> Once you get past the cost and the feeling that you already have everything in the kit except the strips. And once you learn how to correctly apply the strips. This actually works!</li>
    <li> I have been to the podiatrist twice for an ingrown toenail. The first time she cut away half of my nail, and the second time she killed a sliver of my nail so it wouldn&#x27;t grow back. She assured me that once she killed a part of my nail I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it coming back. Well, guess what...it came back. My ingrown toenail digs into my skin right below my cuticle, so I figured CurveCorrect wouldn&#x27;t work since my ingrown is so high up on my toenail. However, it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;m very surprised.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any issues applying the plastic strip. I followed the directions exactly. One side of the strip did pop off my nail after about 48 hours, but I was able to file the old glue off of my nail and the strip. I filed my nail again, and put new glue on the strip. Three weeks later the strip is still on my nail securely.&lt;br /&gt;My toe is no longer red and painful, and I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;m not going to have to deal with three needles sticks into my big toe to numb it up at the podiatrist any time soon. Honestly, the $45 price is only a little bit more than my copayment to see the podiatrist, so the price wasn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve had problems with both of my big toes for years.  After researching home remedies for weeks, I found this product.  As long as you follow the instructions to the letter, it works.  The pain was completely gone and I saw a significant difference in my toes after only 24 hours of wear.  I would recommend this for anyone with the same situation.</li>
    <li> I went to the podiatrist for my curved big toenail that had been hurting me for a couple years. I didn&#x27;t have an ingrown toenail but the curve was severe and the side of my toe by the nail was extremely tender and hurt. He didn&#x27;t help at all and said he could do surgery along the edge of the nail if I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Then I searched on the internet and found this product with good reviews so I tried it. Yes, it is expensive for this little thing, but it was well worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;The first day after putting it on my toe was sore, like I had stubbed my toe. This is because the product begins to straighten the nail out. But the tenderness and pain was gone within a day, and the &amp;#34;stubbed toe&amp;#34; feeling diminished after several days. My little plastic thing is still glued to my nail a few weeks later. I have had no pain!!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading about it on the Internet. The concept really made logical sense to me so I phoned the bus number on a Saturday no less, thinking I&#x27;d leave a message. To my amazement  a person answered and it was the owner of the company. Jason took the time to hear about my two lifelong ingrown toenails on my big toes and so traveling in hope I ordered the product.. This was in early April 2013. I brought the kit to my manicurist to apply, not wanting to waste any of the product by my efforts. Immediately I felt an ease and relief of pressure to both toes after this little strip was applied. Then I noticed both nails were becoming flatter. Within the next few days and weeks my nails changed shape and the pain subsided completely. The strips have stayed on beautifully and after about 6 weeks of growth were changed over for better placement. I&#x27;ve had one experience of the left toenail becoming too flat ( would you believe). So I phoned the company directly again and easily reached Jason , who promptly sent me some thinner strips for the nail which has become too flat. (At no charge). That&#x27;s the stage I&#x27;m at now. I&#x27;ve had more care And help and concern from this \\&quot;curve correct\\&quot; company than any of the podiatrists I&#x27;ve ever seen as a patient. All I have to say is a HUGE thank you and the message from me to all who read this ,is in this instance suburb customer service is still possible. All my best to you  Lynn in Rancho Mirage, Ca</li>
    <li> I am a natural skeptic. I sadly believe that most people WANT to believe something is working, even if it isn&#x27;t.  It explains all the wrinkle creams on the market.  However, this product is amazing!  In less than two weeks, a severely curved nail is 50% back to normal.  I keep looking at my before pictures and can&#x27;t believe the result so far.  I contacted the company with a question.  I received two prompt responses.  If all products worked this well, and all companies were this responsive, reviews wouldn&#x27;t be necessary.  It is worth every penny of the cost to stop the alarming curving of my toenails and return them to normal.  Update:  A picture is worth a thousand words. 1st picture is before, 2nd picture is 36 hours, third picture is 2 weeks.  Although I find these photos embarrassing, I think it&#x27;s important to share things that work.</li>
    <li> Could not believe how well it worked.</li>
    <li> ONLY FOR BIG TOE. Does not work on other smaller toes at all. I returned it.</li>
    <li> did not work at all .</li>
    <li> It really does cure ingrown toenails. Immediate relief as well as long term nail correction. The glue dispenser is not great.  I bought nail glue with a brush applicator for a couple of dollars from Walgreens and works tons better...</li>
    <li> Worker pretty well from the instant that I attached it.  However, as other reviews said, it took long to successfully mount the plastic on my nail, and I had to waste one.  I am a dancer, and I want to recommend this product to other dancers with a toenail issues, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price should be lower than this considering the material.　They can keep this price because it&#x27;s monopoly (if excluding podiatrists?) I have found more products cheaper in another country.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  A little tricky to apply yourself, but once it was on it was great and provided instant relief.</li>
    <li> Hard to complain about this product because it works.  Just a little upset with myself for not thinking of it.  Consists of emery board, cotton swabs, Super glue and 10 little plastic strips (I&#x27;m guessing that the case is the most expensive part of the product), so $49. is about $47 profit.  Is a little troublesome keeping the brace on for more than a couple of days and have to keep regluing (keep track of the little braces or you&#x27;ll run out).  Easiest way to get small amount of glue on brace is to use a needle.  If you use too much they don&#x27;t stick at all.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a lot of negatives, but within 48 hours most of the pain was gone.  Just waiting for toenail to grow out correctly, so I can quit using.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this works completely but it&#x27;s amazing! Pain gone in one day and can seey nail has flattened in 4 days. Be sure and read the reviews for hints to apply. Fantastic product! Highly recommend ... Pricey but hey it works!</li>
    <li> It works. I can&#x27;t do it on myself though as I can&#x27;t reach but my friend was able to do it.</li>
    <li> I was more than a little skeptical that this product would work, but I went ahead and ordered it. To my surprise it worked like a charm. I&#x27;ve been dealing with the pain and discomfort (not to mention the infection) of ingrown toe nails on both big toes for several years and was contemplating surgery. After researching the surgery option, I learned that it is very painful and that it does not work 75% of the time. I&#x27;ve also tried every product and technique to cure my ingrown toe nails with no success. At my doctor&#x27;s instruction, I let my toenails grow out to the end of my toes. Believe me, that was a very painful process. He said that once the nails grew out, I would not have the ingrown problem again. Well, my big toe nails are both curved and after they grew out the sides still dug into the skin and I still had the same pain and discomfort. I ran across this product when searching the Internet for a solution. I&#x27;m so glad I found it. After I ordered, it arrived very quickly. I put on the strips the very next day. Within a day, the pain and discomfort was gone. I currently have pain free toenails for the first time in two years. Contrary to some of the reviews here, the strips have stayed on my nails for over three weeks. One strip did come lose on one side, but I glued it back in place again. I did use a good sized dab of glue on each side of the strip. I also  followed the application instructions exactly and made sure that the surface of the nail was clean, scuffed and completely dry before applying the strip. The best part is that, over the past three weeks, the strips have taken out the curve in my nails so they no longer dig into the skin on the sides of my toes. I wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone suffering from ingrown toenails.</li>
    <li> This product gave my swollen painful toe, instant relief! Its been a week and I&#x27;m still in amazement every morning! The customer service was fast and super nice! I&#x27;m already a huge fan! 💗💗💗-Sandra</li>
    <li> arrived in a timely manner, and exactly as shown. Wish you could buy more strips only. Takes a little practice but if done as stated in directions works great.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product and gets 5 stars from me.  If you have just the start of an ingrown toenail it will correct it immediately and give amazingly fast relief from pain.  I couldn&#x27;t stand even the sheet touching my toe and I put this on and I fell in love. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> excellent product that did what it says it will do, little pain in the begging but now im happy nice</li>
    <li> Wow this really works.  It is difficult to put the splint on by yourself, I suggest unless you are extremely flexible and very co-ordinated you should get someone to help you.  Other than that, I felt the splint start to work within a few minutes of application, and have had no pain since then.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a last-ditch effort before going to the podiatrist for invasive surgery on my big toes, and I must say I am absolutely thrilled with it.  I didn&#x27;t really think it would work, because I have &#x27;pincer&#x27; nails that are quite curved, but I was willing to try anything versus having my toenails removed.  I was pain-free within 1 minute of applying CurveCorrect!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I will admit it was difficult applying them the first time, but I understand the process better now and know subsequent applications will be much easier.  I&#x27;ve had them on 2 weeks now, and only had one side pop off because I had applied too much glue.  Since my toenails are so curved, I couldn&#x27;t apply the strips end-to-end, but it still worked.  It&#x27;s a pricey product, but well worth it for me to be pain free for the first time in months.</li>
    <li> Very good. Fast delivery and it does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Be careful, lifted my big toenail too much...serious pain, visits to podiatrist $$$</li>
    <li> Arrived in the UK today 1st August I ordered on the 26th July paid the standard postage no scary customs vat prices etc added. Bit fiddly but have managed to secure the brace and am now experiencing some relief (heaven). But will try to give more updates as I progress I really need this to work as my only other option is surgery and I don&#x27;t really don&#x27;t to take that path.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I love this product! It has helped me sooooo much. I was going to have surgery on my toe nails, (because the pain was so great), but I was really scared and the surgery was very expensive. So I did some research, found CurveCorrect and tried it. It was like a miracle! Now no pain and no surgery....Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Best for thinner nails.</li>
    <li> Had problems using this product and wasn&#x27;t able to get results.  Seller was more than fair about returning product for refund.  It might be great for someone else but it didn&#x27;t help my particular situation.</li>
    <li> Cured my ingrown in less than two weeks and i haven&#x27;t had problems with that toe again. I felt relief in less than two days,  It took me two attempts to get the strip on correctly, but once I did it was on there until I pried the strip off. I was also able to apply nail polish to it and you could not tell I had it on my toe. The kit comes with many strips for future uses.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Worked like a charm. Corrected the ingrowth of my toenail on both sides. No more problems.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t stick.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Went to podiatrist about toe pain, ingrown toenail was the diagnosis. He trimmed the nail and the pain was relieved a little. He said the nail looked curved from trauma and that there is no way to straightened it out. Anyway order this kit put the little brace on and bam pain free! I even completed a spartan sprint chalked with mud,water 15 obstacles and 4.3 miles of running through the forest and little brace stayed bonded to my toenail. So far so good hopefully soon my nail will be straight again.</li>
    <li> Totally difficult to adhere.  Their directions weren&#x27;t really good either.  You have to cut the little strip before you glue it on or it&#x27;ll pop off when you try to cut it.  It did work once I got a strip attached but it took a long time and I ruined one strip in the process.  Stayed on for about two weeks and then popped off.  If you get it on, you definitely can get relief but it&#x27;s a delicate process and hard to do.</li>
    <li> I will have to wait a long time to see if this works.  I had to use the trouble-shooting instructions.  The strips would not stay glued to the severely curved end of my toenail where I first tried to use them.  I had to trim the strips and move much further back on my nail.  It will take months for that part to grow out to the end and I will know then if this helps to straighten the nail.  I think it should.  I think this approach is sound. I think it should work like the way braces straighten teeth over a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had trouble with the two part glue/activator.  I eventually gave up and used other super glue to make sure the strip stayed glued where I put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My doctor had recommended removing the nail completely and letting it regrow.  I decided not to do that because breaking the toenail completely off and waiting a year for it to fully regrow is how the nail became curved in the first place.</li>
    <li> I have to say , this do what suppose to do, my toenail was giving me  so much pain, get this curve correct and soon as a put it in place pain go away, will recommended to everyone</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this product, and bottom line, this product works. Application was easy, but she did practice the motion a few times before actually applying the glue, because the glue adheres better if you place the strip directly in the correct position and don&#x27;t have to fuss and adjust. Once in place, she rounded the edges of the strips and applied dark red nail polish. Looked fine. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have noticed the strips were there. In any event, it is temporary, and only an issue for a few months. She is happy with the results and that is what is important. The strips seem expensive, but cost much less than a doctor visit and are a good solution to the problem of painful, curved toenails.  Let me update this. I am now ordering my third kit. This is a great product! One strip reshapes your toenail quickly and the pain goes away. Now, I apply them at the first sign of inflammation. The strips remain attached for several weeks, and the nail remains flattened for some time after that. Eventually, the nail starts to curve again, so I apply another strip. The product hasn’t cured the problem completely, but it has made it manageable, and certainly better than surgery! At $50, it isn’t cheap, but again, better than surgery. Oh, and they are easy to attach, if you are flexible enough to work on your own toe, or you could ask a friend to apply the strips. Not hard to do. Also, I was afraid they would look goofy, but they don’t. I round off the edges a bit with the emery board provided in the kit, and polish right over them. They are more attractive than oddly shaped toenails. In fact, my toenails have never looked better. Now, if only they would offer discounted refills . . .</li>
    <li> If you are like me and many others, who have suffered from the pain of ingrown nails for years, read on.  You will not regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last, oh, I don&#x27;t remember how many years, the relief for my ingrown toe nails (the big toes) has been coming from my nail lady whom I visit once about every 4 weeks for a pedicure.  She would cut the sides of my big toe nails and I would feel the pain disappearing right away.  But that practice only \\&quot;solves\\&quot; the problem for about 4 weeks.  The reason being that when she cuts the sides of my big toe nail, a pointy notch always remains deep inside where the toe nail grows out.  It&#x27;s that pointy notch that causes me pain when it grows out to 1/2 to 2/3 of the big toe&#x27;s length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CurveCorrect Ingrown Toenail Home Treatment popped up when I searched for something else - gotta love amazon&#x27;s searches.  Reading the POSITIVE reviews didn&#x27;t convince me to buy it right away because it&#x27;s very expensive - $50.  I left this product in my cart for 2 months before I took the plunge and bought it. That was in August 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use this product until October 2013.  I have used only 2 sets (total 4 strips - 2 for each toe) following the instructions.  Now 6 months later in April 2014, I have no more ingrown nails, no more pain and no more CurveCorrect strips glued to my toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips from my experience that WORKED!&lt;br /&gt;1.  I bought a pedicure cuticle pusher -[[ASIN:B007BJ3KQ4 World Pride Pocket Nail Cuticle Nipper Pack Contains Nail Trimmer, Pack of 3]]&lt;br /&gt;2.  I bought a ingrown nail lifter -[[ASIN:B000VDFKLK Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail Lifter, 8.0 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;3.  I bought a ingrown nail clipper - [[ASIN:B002WPZNRQ Body Toolz Ingrown Toenail Clipper]]&lt;br /&gt;4.  I gave myself a pedicure to clean and soften the toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;5.  I use the ingrown nail lifter to lift up the ingrown nail in the inside so I could see the pointy notch I described above.  Then used the big toe nail clipper to cut off that pointy notch so it&#x27;s not pointy anymore. Mind you, it did hurt when I lifted up the ingrown nail but it&#x27;s necessary for me.&lt;br /&gt;6.  I follow the instructions of this product - one key thing to remember is the amount of glue to put on the strip.  You put a tiny bit - just barely touching the strip with the tip of the glue tube.  The drop of glue should NOT cover the entire width of the strip.  The thickness of the glue drop should only be as thick as the thickness of the strip.  Too much glue would not make the strip stay.&lt;br /&gt;7.  If the strip falls off, file away the glue then try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The $50 is well worth it. It relieves me from the year&#x27;s of pain suffering.  And in the long run, it saves me money from going to the nail lady.  By the way, the seller has a money back guarantee which I didn&#x27;t have to use at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND this product wholeheartedly!</li>
    <li> ASTOUNDING results!! I didn&#x27;t really think this product was going to work for me. I have very serious problems with both big toes. The nails do not grow correctly, one of them being almost perfectly &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; shaped, pinching the area underneath the nail. It&#x27;s very painful - to the point where I often cannot wear shoes, and sometimes can&#x27;t walk correctly. I was told twice that in order to correct this it would be extremely painful surgery and 6 weeks in a wheelchair for recovery. I was not willing to do that, so I&#x27;ve just lived with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my left big toe is so severe, I applied two strips to that one. I&#x27;m sure this is not the recommended method, but I needed relief immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product on Friday night, and by Monday morning the nails were PERFECTLY straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It *is* painful (and I have a very high tolerance for pain). There can be no doubt about that. But it was already very painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem getting the braces on, but I am extremely flexible. You really do only need a tiny bit of the adhesive. I found holding the bottle upright and applying just a bit of pressure squeezed out enough glue that if I just barely touched the strip to the adhesive that was the perfect amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be very careful when you&#x27;re roughing up the nail surface! I hit the edges of the skin surrounding and below my nail, and that ended up feeling like a bad burn. No bueno!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having the braces on and the nail straight after all the years I&#x27;ve dealt with this didn&#x27;t just change the shape of the nail, it changed the shape of my whole toe! I haven&#x27;t been walking correctly for a very long time, and I can now feel the difference in my feet, ankles, knees, and hips. What an incredible relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give this a 1 star rating as I never got a chance to see if it works as intended. So I will be giving it 2 stars because I could not ever get the strips to stay properly applied for more than half an hour without popping up. At first I tried applying a strip long enough for the entire nail, but when trying to get the second side applied, the 1st side would pop up. It would seem my nail was too curved (though I wouldn&#x27;t call it a big curve by any means) the instructions have an answer for this, and it&#x27;s to start smaller and cut the strip small and cover the middle of the nail so it&#x27;s not as bent. I tried that and it worked. I put on socks and went about my day. But about 30 minutes later, I took my sock off to inspect and it had popped up on one side. I took it off (it came off easily, even though the instructions say not to pull on it with force to remove), and tried again with another short strip. Same thing. 30 minutes pass and I feel it come undone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing I can say is that during the short periods it was applied, I felt discomfort, but that to me just meant it was most likely doing it&#x27;s job. I really wanted these to work, but now I&#x27;ll have to resort to old fashioned methods. At $50 dollars and only coming with 10 strips, this would be a great deal if they went on and stayed on as easily as implied by the site. But when you&#x27;re throwing away strip after strip because the bonding process is very difficult, it becomes worrisome and seems like less of a deal</li>
    <li> Like others, I was skeptical.  But I figured after years of trying to find a solution for my big toe ingrowns I had nothing to lose before seeing a doctor.  I had been packing dental floss under my nails and using toe spacers for some time.  This was effective at first, but barely kept the problem at bay and the condition was traveling down the nail closer to the base where I could not reach it, ugh!  I too came across this product while doing a search and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I did have some discomfort and one of the bands popped off and had to be re-attached.  If this happens to you all I can say is: Stay the course and allow it to work!  After the first day or two, the pain subsided as the instructions said it would.  I realize now that was product working.  It has been 2-3 weeks and I have noticed SUBSTANTIAL improvement.  I no longer have scads of ingrown skin to remove or under the side of the nail/nailbed (sorry if this is TMI).  Indeed, the nail does appear as if it is \\&quot;flattening out\\&quot; and no longer as curved.  Sweet relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased and relieved to have found a solution to my problem.  I hope this has corrected my condition and will continue to use it and update my review with longer term information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  $50 may seem a bit pricey, but consider the alternatives: Less expensive treatments that don&#x27;t really work, or a visit to the doctor which will cost a lot more.  Hope this helps and good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 months later:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some more info I can add to the original review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the long term results...WORKS! My big toe nails are flattening out, and though not 100% eliminated is MUCH improved over my previous condition.  I expect as I continue to use this, it will continue to get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions and take the time to apply the strips properly.  It is about a 20-30 minute process per foot so allot enough time (trim nails, excess skin, file, clean, then nail prep and application).  When I do this, the strips stay on for weeks and seldom come off.  When I am in a rush or do not follow the directions properly, the result is not as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming the bands can be a bit tricky, but I file the corners of each strip to eliminate the sharp edges.  This is more comfortable and lessens the chance of the strip snagging on a sock and getting torn off.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for those who have tried other products. I highly recommend it. It is easy to do and involves only a plastic strip and glue which is changed avery month or so until nail straighens. It took me 3 treatments, all in the original vial, approximately one month apart.  They have excellent customer service and stand  100% behind their product.</li>
    <li> This product works, which is the most important part.  Over time, it straigtens out your toenail and alleviates pain.  It seems that it would only work well on the big toe, which is what I used it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is difficult.  I&#x27;ve had plenty of experience with fake nails and nail glue, so I thought this would be so easy!  I was wrong.  The bottle of glue that comes with it is hard to use and slow to dry.  I now use superglue or fake nail glue instead.  The strips are small and hard to handle with glue on them.  If you don&#x27;t have great coordination or can&#x27;t reach your toes easily, you will need help to get them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the strips were on perfectly for the first time, I could feel it working.  It was bending my nail back to normal but for about 12 hours my big toe felt like I had gout.  Ouch!  I almost took the strip off, thinking I did something wrong to cause all the pain.  But I left it on and when I woke up the next day, my toe felt amazing, no more pain!  The strip stayed on for about 3 or 4 weeks like it was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nail is so much better and I&#x27;ve had no pain at all from the part that was ingrown.  It will take at least 6 months of continuous use to completely correct the nail, since toenails grow slowly.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll cut down right to the case,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a very bad case of an ingrown toenail in my left foot I researched online several solutions that all led to my toenail being operated on and believe me as many others are I am not a fan of the Doctors/Hospitals visits,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at this product although a little bit pricey but it had many good reviews and a couple of bad ones but not enough information on how it exactly worked online! I suggest the creators of this amazing product make a tutorial video and let it slide on youtube about how to apply / how it works it can be a lot helpful to potential buyers and to people who already purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this I had to let the swelling in my toenail become less in order for me to be able to apply \\&quot;CurveCorrect\\&quot; I also had to cut a little part of the ingrown toenail for the pain to be less while applying. (Note applying this product is not painful at all but in my case the ingrown toenail was infected already so touching the toe would hurt)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said I applied the product as instructed with the manual they sent and directly upon application i felt relief as you can actually feel the nails lifting off the sides of the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who can&#x27;t do the technique of placing a cotton bud underneath the toenails or other similar solutions this does the same if not better result because there is nothing to pressure your already traumatized toenail or the skin surrounding it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this being a life saver I purchased it blindly and on great risk of other reviewers not stating the obvious that it works 100% guaranteed unless you have a very bad and severe ingrown toenail! This also works if your nails are simply curved and you want to flatten them out, the reason this is getting a 3 star not a 4 or 5 from me are listed below&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) after a week of purchasing this and applying it the curvecorrect stick was detached because a mistake I did while removingmy socks not the product fault, but when it got removed I noticed that the stick itself was already used to the curve of my nail so even if I put it back on it would not have any effect so I put it back on upside down, I assumed the stick would be of stronger tougher material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) As mentioned before a tutorial video would be VERY helpful for already purchased customers and going to purchase customers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The price not to complain a lot about it but it is too high! at least you can attach more sticks in the future instead of 10 I mean as another reviewer stated there aren&#x27;t 44.99$ worth of product in there. With it being a LIFE SAVER for me but it&#x27;s still not enough product in the box for the amount of money paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the stated above reasons this product works it&#x27;s effective and the support of the creator is great 110% behind their product, which not many sellers do these days!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was almost instant I ordered and within a few hours it was shipped!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says and provides relief within minutes of application.</li>
    <li> I am dissatisfied with this product in that I am needing to purchase a second set to achieve the desired result.  I am satisfied in that they have caused enough of a correction that I am (grudgingly) willing to purchase another set, only because there is really nothing else on the market like it &amp; I am determined to have normal looking toenails by summer.  When you&#x27;re spending $50 and getting only 10 strips, I don&#x27;t really consider it good value for the price.  Like many of the negative reviewers state, there is some trial and error involved initially and a meager 10 strips doesn&#x27;t really allow for that and enough strips to really correct the problem.  Also, if your are a woman and want to wear nail polish over them during sandal season to try and conceal them, you&#x27;ll likely need to replace the strips when it&#x27;s time to redo your nail polish  It&#x27;s possible but very difficult to salvage them once they&#x27;ve already been used (they become brittle once worn).  The only reason I am willing to pay what in the end will hopefully be just $100, I&#x27;m sure this is considerably less than any procedure that might correct the curvature of my nail.  Also, given that I don&#x27;t have ingrown nails and am not in any pain, I would not be willing to undergo any surgery or procedures for a problem which is really only cosmetic in nature.  Overall, great idea and product but not a good value.  Hopefully there will be some competition in this market soon!!!</li>
    <li> I did not have the same intense issues other people experience with ingrown toenails, but I could see and feel mine getting deeper and worse with every year. I chose this product to stop my toenails becoming more deformed and have seen great results. I did not have the same problems with keeping the strips on my nails as other customers. I only used a total of three for the entire treatment time (just a note, I held the strip in place on my nail for longer than indicated and gave the glue an extra couple of minutes to set up before putting my socks and shoes back on to hopefully give it a better chance to last. Thanks for the reviews on that problem, I think they helped me!). The only time one came off was when a particularly stringy pair of socks caught on the strip. My most distressing issue was a little bit of bruising at the edge of my nails beneath the strip, but I often wear heels to work and think that put more stress on the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing, which the company has no control over so it isn&#x27;t their fault, is that I have bow&#x27;s lines in my nails which cause a horizontal crack in my nail surface that prevented me from attaching the strip where it should have been. Thus, I will have to wear it for a few extra weeks for my nail to grow out enough to be fully straightened, which isn&#x27;t too bad since I have many strips left over if I need them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product for preventative treatment of worsening ingrown toenails. My pain was gone, even in my work shoes, within a couple days just like the website foretold. I&#x27;m much less concerned for my nails now and that&#x27;s a great feeling.</li>
    <li> I just had my first ingrown toenail. It hurt a lot and there was pus everywhere. I looked on the Internet and found that you need to wedge a piece of paper towel or toilet paper up under the curved part to straighten it out. This will bend the toenail into its natural position. It is now one day after I did that and my toenail is no longer curved although the infection is stil present. You should use that curved side of the emery board that comes attached to most toenail clippers.</li>
    <li> The strips simply won&#x27;t stay on.  I have read the instructions several times and followed them carefully.  I have tried about 20 times (I flipped the strip over when it fell off).  The longest any stayed on was 4 days.  Most fell off within a day or within an hour.  I wish this would work but it simply doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to keep on, and if you CAN keep them on, it is quite painful. Feels like I slammed my toes in the door.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, been using it for a few weeks and so far has stayed on. Since the nail grows slow will have to see how well it straightens.</li>
    <li> After having several bouts with painful ingrown toenails and two rounds of antibiotics over a period of six months, my doctor recommended seeing a Podiatrist. He showed me how to cut my nails properly but recommended surgery to remove part of my toenail.  I discovered CurveCorrect as I researched alternatives to surgery and decided to give it a try. It works! I had been soaking my feet in Epsom Salts every night, and kept the toenail soft by using creams, ointments and wearing sock over it at night. The first application of CurveCorrect was a little tedious, but within a few days my pain was entirely gone. I have not had to use it for over 2 months but just ordered a new kit to be prepared if the need arises.</li>
    <li> It works!  Just make sure the first end of the strip is securely glued and dried before you do the other end.  Also, give it plenty of time.  Leave on until it has time to grow out.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> great product, it fulfilled my expectation. the curvature of my nail is much less accentuated and I don&#x27;t feel pain for a very long time. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and works exactly as advertised. It was fairly easy to apply (though I got it on a bit crooked) and the relief was instantaneous, almost unbelievably so. After a few weeks, one side of the brace popped off. Reapplication was no problem. After a few more weeks, I took it off (using polish remover which worked well) because I&#x27;m heading to a beach wedding and wanted to polish my nails!  I wasn&#x27;t sure the problem would be fixed in that short of time but it is!  Well worth the money spent. Tip: if I ever need to use it again, I think I&#x27;ll bring it to the lady who does my pedicures to apply for me...not that it&#x27;s hard, but she&#x27;s at a better angle to apply it straight and easily.</li>
    <li> Hoping to avoid surgery, I sought our CurveCorrect and have had very positive results. I can&#x27;t say I was surprised by the results because of how many fantastic reviews this product has. I have referred CurveCorrect to other people who suffer from ingrown toenails. The application of the product is easy, and you can see and FEEL the results very quickly after the application. I believe this product is well worth the cost and am so happy to have found it.</li>
    <li> I carefully followed the instructions and was pleasantly surprised when the first little strip that I applied relieved the pain of an ingrown toenail overnight.  That first little strip is still doing its job after many days and showers. I am so confident that this product will continue to work that I will cancel my upcoming appointment with a podiatrist.  The product was a bit pricey, but who cares.  It works and the pain from an ingrown toenail is gone.  I am a satisfied consumer of this product and recommend it without reservation</li>
    <li> This product WORKS! I resisted buying it because I do have a dermatophytic toenail fungus that has caused thickening along with curvature in two toes, my Right Big Toe and her sidekick, the Next One Over. I did my Right Big Toe first, and yes, it&#x27;s a trick getting the right amount of glue onto the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tip? Put the glue onto the tip of a toothpick *first*, then, scrape a small amount onto the end of the strip. Apply that as per directions, being sure to press for *at* *least* 15-20 seconds, and more is better. Then after you cut the strip down to size, repeat the procedure exactly. I found this method really ensures that you&#x27;re not using too much glue, otherwise, it really does pop right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address the thickened toenail I went at it with nail file usually intended for acrylics, right over the top. You&#x27;ll feel if you&#x27;ve gone too far and frankly, I was never able to get it that far. I just wanted to thin it down enough that the strip would be able to help flatten the nail, and I felt the difference IMMEDIATELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the same with My Big Right Toe&#x27;s sidekick, The Next One Over, but this time I cut the strip in half along the long axis, first so that it could actually *fit* on this much smaller bit of nail, and second so that it would not overstraighten. This information is in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve dealt with these two toenails for over 10yrs now, and when I went to my doctor I was offered nail avulsion since I&#x27;ve already used the most commonly recommended ingrown control methods, and having been licensed as a manicurist in the state of California, I have been aware of proper trimming techniques my whole adult life. I think all health plans should offer coverage for the CurveCorrect as an alternative to or before what should be the last result of full or even partial nail avulsion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I&#x27;ve got them straightened out, I&#x27;m going to Kaiser Permanente and asking that they offer this to their patients, I feel that strongly about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say you can polish over these, I&#x27;m not sure how you&#x27;d really cover or mask the strip itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****EDIT/UPDATE**** AUG. 26, 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller by message to ask about buying the glue separately, as mine had become thick and the strips wouldn&#x27;t stay on for any length of time. They sent me a new bottle for FREE, in less than a week! Is it possible to give you more than 5 stars?</li>
    <li> INSTANT pain relief....able to comfortably wear shoes for the first time in months.  Had no trouble putting it on, following thorough direstions.  Hoping this will solve my problem....</li>
    <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t think it would work but with the alternative being surgery, I decided to give it a go, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I&#x27;ve suffered an ingrown toenail periodically over the past few years, and had a toenail infection.  For the past year or so, my big toenail has become VERY curved, and has been squeezing the flesh of my toe, making it very sore.  As the nail was so curved, I thought that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply the brace, or that it wouldn&#x27;t stay in position.  However, although I found it quite tricky to apply (which I&#x27;m sure will become easier with practice), I noticed a big improvement with the shape of my nail immediately - I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  I did find my toe to be quite sore for about 24 hours (although it was slightly sore to begin with, due to the curved nail!), and there was a &#x27;pulling&#x27; sensation on the nail. The next day, the soreness was gone and my nail was further improved.  I didn&#x27;t make a great job of the first brace application - it&#x27;s lifted slightly on the one side and I keep catching it, but this is due to the fact that I probably didn&#x27;t put the glue close enough to the edge of the brace when securing the 2nd side.  Next time I will do a better job, but the brace is still working and has stuck well.  I really am so pleased with this product and would highly recommend it ... anyone who has had problems with the brace not sticking ... persevere until you get it right!  It&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Pain in toe stopped immediately after applying the plastic strip. My big toenail is badly &#x27;hooked&#x27; and imbedded into the flesh of my toe and was frequently quite painful. The strip lifted the toenail just enough to relieve the pain. Hopefully the strips will help restore the proper shape of my toenail over time.</li>
    <li> I had a pretty severely hooked toenail and had to work at using this treatment. I made the braces shorter so they would stay on longer and I wondered if it would work, but it did! Several months later, I&#x27;m still doing well. I&#x27;m glad I decided to try this before going for surgery!</li>
    <li> CurveCorrect is a miracle! In just one week, I have seen a tremendous change on my toenail. I applied nail polish on it and the brace was not removed even after using acetone to remove the poliah.I am not being paid for this review. Trust me. This is the answer to your problem. I am from the Philippines and this was brought to me by my friend.</li>
    <li> Simple, adaptable, easy solution for ingrown toenails. Don&#x27;t go to a podiatrist. Save yourself a lot of pain and expense. This is a simply elegant solution to ingrown toenails (if anything about ingrown toenails can be elegant).</li>
    <li> This product is extremely difficult to attach. The glue provided just doesn&#x27;t hold the strip down, I&#x27;m unable to say anything positive about this product. UPDATE -  The company has rectified this to my total satisfaction. They provided a toll free number to help me. When I was reluctant they offered and provided a full refund. This is an honorable company and all products are fully guaranteed by them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an ingrown toe nail for years.....you know.....that pesky big toe.  The first day I received my package I applied it to my nail exactly as instructed and I&#x27;ll say within minutes the pain went away. I&#x27;m not joking....no more pain.  I had to trim the plastic strip down a bit but that was fine.  The trick is to apply a SMALL amount of glue on one side first and let it dry COMPLETELY.  Then do the same on the other side of the strip.  The sore skin that was around the nail is not red and painful anymore.  I&#x27;ve had the strip on for 4 days and have showered each day and the strip hasn&#x27;t fallen off yet.  One thing I&#x27;d like to add is, I did have to file down the top of the strip on one side.  If you follow the directions...wipe off nail polish, file the nail with the nail file provided and use the cleaning solution, you should see good results.  I was hesitant due to the price but if you compare it to a visit to a doctor and have them poke and prod your toe causing pain and charging lots of money, this by far is a safe and reliable invention.  Wearing shoes and sneakers are a pleasure now.</li>
    <li> I paid attention to my ingrown toenail being pregnant, so surgery was not really an option. I started using CurveCorrect and the problem was gone almost immediately. Have been wearing it for a month and it seems that the nail became wider, the red swelling disappeared. Now it is time to change the brace ;)</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item about 3 weeks ago. I don&#x27;t  know what the final  result is going to be, but I can assure you that it is worth the money just because is takes the pain right away from the very first minute after the \\&quot;installation\\&quot; of the thing.</li>
    <li> shockingly it actually works</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW!!!! I have been using this for one week and my nails look like they did years ago, and the pain is gone. The product is expensive, and you have to take your time to apply, but the end result is fantastic. I get pedicures, and my nail tech couldn&#x27;t correct the curve. I can now do my own pedicure, so I guess the money I save will pay for the cost of this kit. I just wish we could buy the strips only, because I will run out of them before the glue and solvent. THANK YOU for inventing this product, it really does work :)</li>
    <li> Does not work. I tried with assistance 4 times to put this on.....it either snapped or it wouldn&#x27;t stick. Yes, I followed all of the directions</li>
    <li> It is true that it is hard to get these to stick to your nails - you really do have to follow the instructions to the letter and focus. It would also help if toes were easier to reach. I have a 65% success rate. But there is a generous amount of strips to try again. They work REALLY well - my nails were trying to do a full loop on both sides, and a hard C shape - in one application my nail is almost a gentle arc again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try leaving my toenails bare for the summer and see if they start to curve again, but I still have plenty of strips to correct them if I need to and I&#x27;ll go for longer.</li>
    <li> This product has performed well beyond my expectations in correcting my ingrown toenail that resulted from a broken toe. I highly recommend this product be used first if you think having the nail cut-back is your only viable solution. CurveCorrect could save you the pain and suffering like it did me!</li>
    <li> This works remarkably well for what it is... A tiny piece of metal that wants to stay flat.  I purchased mine from the company website a few months ago.  It was easy to apply, and stayed on my toe for several months.  The glue finally gave out.  I had no pain while it was on my nail and the curve of my nail is less... For me personally, I think I will need to re-apply it or get another because my nail is thick and did not flatten enough to solve my problem.  For the price, convenience, ease and success I got its a really good DIY choice.</li>
    <li> My nail periodically gave me pain. This certainly worked once I got it to stay attached. It is really a few nicely packaged, simple items. It came off on its own about 2-3 months later and my nail was clearly less curved. So far, so good</li>
    <li> The only reason I am not giving this product 5 stars is because I am still in the middle of the process of growing out my toenail, and not sure it if is going to work long term. I will reassess my review once my nail has completely grown out. I might still not give the product 5 stars due to the difficulty of attaching the brace to your toenail, even when following directions to the letter. But ultimately, with patience - the brace sticks!! And once the brace is in place, oh my, what relief!  Now, after 2 months, this product is working well and my nail looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;Yes - sometimes the brace can fall off, but the kit comes with multiples and enough glue that you can put on another one and keep going. It takes a long time for a toenail to grow out - so I am still in the &amp;#34;wait and see&amp;#34; mode. So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to buying this treatment, I bought other, less costly products, but frankly, all they did was put pressure on what was already in pain. They didn&#x27;t help change the shape of the toenail, they didn&#x27;t relieve the pain  so I figured their &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; was only short term, if they worked at all.&lt;br /&gt;Rather than continue to spend more money on cheap products, I read the reviews and tried this treatment because the concept made sense and so many people were so pleased. When my toenail finally grows out completely, then I will know for sure if this was the fix I hoped for. It seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, after 2 months, it IS worth the money.  Expensive yes, but a lot less costly than an operation. It seems to work and it doesn&#x27;t look all that bad on your nail. I have not tried nail polish yet and not sure I will... but it really blends into your natural color nail.&lt;br /&gt;All in all - this is a good product and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have had a curved toenail for years. No joke, probably about 20 years. I came across this product and thought I would give it a try. It arrived today and I just put it on about 20 minutes ago. Believe it or not I already see a notable improvement in the shape of my toenail. In just twenty minutes. I am totally amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure there is a bundle of science and research behind this product, but from the layman&#x27;s perspective, the brace essentially seems to lift the side edges of your nail up a little while flattening out the center of the nail. I can feel it working, but even more so, I can really see a difference. I will continue to update this review as time passes to let you know about my progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: The braces are thin and clear and really are barely visible. The application is fairly easy and the adhesive seems to be holding very well so far. I had trouble getting the brace to lie straight across the nail - my curved nail was so misshaped I ended up gluing the brace on at a bit of an angle (higher on one eide than the other) but it is sticking and seems to be working anyway. That&#x27;s one thing to note (and the instructions do warn you about this) - you have one shot at it. There is no opportunity to reposition the brace once you glue it on as the adhesive seems to stick almost immediately. Hopefully I will get it perfect with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 19: This is a miracle product! My toenail has flattened more than I ever thought was possible. The adhesive is as strong as nails. I have gone on a hike, run or walk every other day since applying the product - ranging from 5 miles to 18 miles. Normally activity like that would further exacerbate the curve problem but not with the brace. My nail stayed flat. And I never felt any pain and the brace never came off. I also applied some nail polish - you could see that the brace was slightly higher than the rest of the nail (the color made the brace a little more noticeable then without polish) but it wasn&#x27;t glaringly obvious at all...and I was staring at my nail looking for flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 60: I took my second brace off after about 7 weeks of treatment and my nail stayed beautifully flat for days. Despite the success I decided to attach another brace just to be safe since the instructions reiterate the need to continue using the product through at least one full nail growth. I will update in a couple months after I have stopped the treatment to see if it truly lasts but as of today I can safely say that this product is fantastic and does exactly what the company says it will do. Many many thanks!! I wish I discovered this product years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 180: I am completely and totally amazed by this product! My nail is completely flat and looks and feels completely normal. I continued to wear the brace for a full six months but I probably could have stopped after four. I think back to the days when my nail would cause me so much pain after a run or hike and I wish I had started using this product years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 270 (90 days without a brace): I am happy to report that I have not worn a brace for three months and my nail is still perfectly flat despite wearing pointy shoes way too often and hiking and running countless miles. I have said it throughout my review and I will say it again...if you are contemplating trying this product, TRY IT! I cannot say it enough. I wish I could rewind the clock and had bought it 20 years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to summarize, it works immediately, but the results continue to improve as you continue to use it. I suggest being conservative, like i was , and using it for at least 3-4 months. The glue is extremely strong. You can shower, swim, anything and it stays on but dissolves quickly with a little nail polish remover when you are ready to replace the brace with a new one. In the very beginning (especially the first couple days) I could feel it working, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t painful. As my nail startedto flatten I couldn&#x27;t feel it at all. Visually, it&#x27;s pretty transparent, especially when not wearing nail polish. If you are thinking about trying this product, i say go for it. My results are remarkable AND THE RESULTS LAST. It is a truly fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied with this product.to flatten I couldn&#x27;t feel it at all.

    <li> Within the first 12 hours ingrown nail pain stopped, and the toenails actually flattened out.  It does need to be done in a bright light, and having another pair of hands helps.  Follow the directions exactly.  It did hurt to press the strips in place while the glue set up, but that only took a few minutes.  I am amazed that this product works as advertised.  I was sure a visit to a podiatrist was in my future.  Because my toes were so tender, I was hesitant to start applying the strips.  But the results are wonderful.  It is such a relief to be pain free.</li>
    <li> I was at the point of trying anything in order to NOT have my toenail removed due to an ingrown toenail.  I found this product, tried it and it really works!  The instructions, if followed correctly, are not that hard.  I&#x27;m now trying them on a deformed toenail I have (as a result of a previous nail removal, then a nasty fungus occurring).  The podiatrist told me that it could not be corrected and my only other option was to have it removed ---- completely---- forever.  Hmmmm.  I don&#x27;t think so.  I&#x27;m hoping it will flatten out the nail and I can say &amp;#34;ha ha&amp;#34; to the doctor.  :)</li>
    <li> I guess I did not expect this to worked but is actually gradually bringing my &amp;#34;hooked nail&amp;#34; on my big toe put. This isn&#x27;t finished and may take two months but it is far better than a Dr. trip. Give it a try. Its tedious to install but if you follow directions fairly simple. A goog idea for a home remedy.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertized.  It is ridiculously expensive for the materials cost, and I wish the drugstores would pick up the idea and carry a copycat product, but even at the price charged it is better than the alternatives I have found.  It is not easy to apply if you have any reason for not being able to easily reach and easily see your toenail from a straight on vantage; and it is not easy to find someone else who will skillfully apply them for you.  The &amp;#34;crazy glue&amp;#34; and alcohol come in more sane packaging than in the first kit that I bought...  my toes seem to grow back to curved after 8 to 18 months necessitating a redo.  Currently the toe that was the worst in the beginning is pain free without a brace for about 2 yrs, but the one that had been less problematic is now moreso and I just applied a brace.  I tend to wear the brace for about 2 to 3 applications and then quit for a while, so maybe i should brace it for a longer period as my toenails grow much more slowly since &amp;#62; 50.  I have been using this product for several years now, and have only needed to purchase 2 kits - in one instance I went thru too many strips and they cheerfully sent more strips without charge</li>
    <li> This works!  I recommend applying in small room with a dark floor.  My first strip went boing! Across the room on ivory carpet and I never found it,.  I applied to only one toenail due to time issues.  A few days later, I was STUNNED that the one nail was so much flatter!  It is visible! I need to get the other strip on the other two immediately so it catches up. But I have visual proof it works.  Pain is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are fussy...follow them exactly and it will work. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but this is an amazing product. I have a moderately ingrown toe nail. But, could no longer wear most of my shoes, do to pain if there was any pressure at all on the side of my big toe. Did some internet research--saw one Dr. does a surgical implant to lift the nail (like this product promises). Ouch! how much would that surgery hurt? And cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product, skeptical but hopeful. My husband thought I was crazy; too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strip was easy to apply, following the instructions. Pain diminished within an hour. And, a few hours later--no pain at all. I&#x27;ve had the strip on my nail now for 2 weeks. It lasts well, and works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best $40 I&#x27;ve ever spent!!!</li>
    <li> Loved this product!!! I suffered for nearly a year with an ingrown toenail. It was so sensitive that I couldn&#x27;t sleep on my stomach or kneel on the floor because any pressure or even contact to that nail was excruciating! I couldn&#x27;t even have a Pedicurest work on it because even cleaning it hurt too much, and attractive shoes? Not an option! Curve correct was easy to apply and I had full relief within 48 hours. The band fell off 3 weeks later, but by then, I didn&#x27;t need to re-apply it. Curve Correct was worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This product works great in lifting the painful toenail.  I had not had longer term correction.  The only down side I see is that&lt;br /&gt;I has purchased 2 kits but because of the long time between use the glue went bad.  The glue becomes stringy and won&#x27;t hold the strips in place any longer.  I would like to see replacement glue for sale for this kit.  so  4 stars for working but not 5 due to the glue going bad after a number of months. It will, however probably take many months of application to correct the nail.  Mine is much better but not fully corrected yet.</li>
    <li> Works! Saved me from an expensive trip to the podiatrist. I had a slightly curved big toenail on one foot and a more severely curved nail on the other. It worked on the less curved one in about two months and on the larger curve in about 4 months. On the more severe curve, I used two braces and started quite low on the nail below the curve so it took quite some time to grow out. Would definitely use again if necessary.</li>
    <li> UPDATE October 2015:  Wow, it&#x27;s been almost two years since this product changed my life!  As winter approaches, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the pain of closed-toe shoes or the pressure of socks or a blanket on my toes.  I stopped using the product a few months ago, and my toenails are still NORMAL!!!  I probably could have stopped using it long ago, but I was afraid to stop.  Then one brace came off while on vacation, and I decided to give it a test run and go &amp;#34;brace-less&amp;#34;... and found that I now have NORMAL TOENAILS!!!    EVERY PODIATRIST SHOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  Thank you, Curve Correct!     UPDATE September 2014:  It&#x27;s been seven months since I started using Curve Correct, and I love it!  I just re-ordered, and recommend this to everyone who has ingrown nail problems.  My right toe, which had a very pronounced curve (U-shaped) is now completely normal. My pedicurist can&#x27;t believe the difference!  Toe pain is a thing of the past for me, thanks to this product.  If I go without the strips, I start to feel pain again within several days, so I make sure to keep the strips on all the time.  They last up to six weeks (use acrylic nail glue instead of the adhesive that comes with the strips).  DO NOT GET SURGERY --- TRY THIS FIRST-- I&#x27;ve done both, and this product is the way to go!  ORIGINAL REVIEW April 2014:  This has really helped with my pain.  Have used product for about four weeks now, and left toe is 100% better, right toe is 85% better.  I had toenail surgery on right toe about 15 years ago, so that&#x27;s the nail that gives me more trouble.  It&#x27;s narrower and more curved than left toenail.  (Don&#x27;t have surgery!  It works for awhile but makes the problem worse in the long run.).  My ingrown nails were very painful but not infected. It&#x27;s nice to wear socks again this winter, plus have a blanket on my feet without pain!  Also my nails are fairly thick but the braces are working great.  My nail technician did have trouble applying the braces but is getting better at it now; I doubt I could do it myself.  Also we found that nail glue (used for acrylic nails) seems to work better than the glue that came in the kit.  The first braces lasted 10 days before one came off.  One end has come off a couple times but was easy for my daughter to re-glue with her nail glue.  The adhesion problems are all on my right toe with more curved toenail.  Overall I highly recommend this product.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but worth it to me to end the pain.  Plus I don&#x27;t mind paying innovators -- without this innovation, I would still be in pain and wasting my time soaking etc.</li>
    <li> you better have somebody to help you put this  stupid thing on. strips breaks very easy and it sticks to the finger tips better that the toe nail. I finally got a tip on so I will see what it does. so far have wasted most of the product just trying to put on one strip. I think this just might be the worse waste of money I have ever done.</li>
    <li> Order came on earliest expexted date! I was super excited to try these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had ingrowns on my big toes for as long as I can remember. It all started in middle school when, in 6th grade, both of my toes were stepped on (accidentally) and as a result the nails broke all the way down to the middle. When they&#x27;d get almost to normal length again, my toes would be stepped on again, and the nails broke again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingrowns hardly ever bothered me, until recently. I was in agony!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hesitant to make the purchase because it was so expensive. It is denfinitely worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the braces on my toes for less than an hour and already there is a huge improvement with pain reduction and my toe nails look almost like normal toe nails!</li>
    <li> Works as described I suppose. It&#x27;s difficult to glue (superglue) as it sticks almost immediately, and if you have an extreme curve like I do, the little strips break becasue they are very brittle. Practice with a couple of them if you dont get it right away the very first time. Easier if you have someone do it for you. In my case, I used two at a time, and they do the job, but be ready to replace after a week or two, as they will eventually come off.</li>
    <li> I have used the reinforcements of the \\&quot;CurveCorrect Ingrown Toenail Treatment\\&quot; to relieve pain from a curled, ingrown toenail and to straighten it out in time. After some experimentation, I decided to not use the activator provided and found instead some cleaning solution (O.P.I. BondAid) which works well without time constraints. Instead of the adhesive provided, I found a particular superglue to use, because it sets faster and I had trouble holding the reinforcement still until the provided adhesive was set. The reinforcement was tailored to go where I could see it and control it -- sometimes diagonally, sometimes horizontally -- and depending on the spring force that had to be generated and the holding power of the adhesive I had to trim it or even cut it. As soon as the reinforcement strip was set, the pain started to subside and was totally gone within a few hours. The curl of the toenail also began to straighten out, showing a profound change toward normalcy within 6 weeks or so. My conclusion is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;a) this is a relatively inexpensive way to get rid of an ingrown toenail pain and straighten out the toenail.&lt;br /&gt;b) I believe that repeating judiciously the process of gluing reinforcements, when they come out, for several months can make surgery unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;c) The process of gluing the reinforcement to the toenail is challenging, but it could become easier with experience, inventions of tools for holding the reinforcement etc.&lt;br /&gt;d) Because it is hard for me to bend my back and to see well nearby, and because my hands are not as steady as they used to be while holding the reinforcement during the setting process, I&#x27;m thinking of continuing to use the product, but having a pedicurist affix the reinforcement to my ingrown toenails. It will be much cheaper, faster and most importantly a lot less painless procedure than surgery.</li>
    <li> I thought long and hard about spending this much money on a product that I really didn&#x27;t know would work for me because my nails were so bowed. But,  since the alternative was having the nails completely removed I decided to give it a shot. I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions recommend wearing the strip for an entire growth cycle, which is great advice. It takes time for nails to change the way they have been growing, sometimes for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight learning curve, but nothing to worry about. I applied the strip one night and by the next day most of the pain was relieved. I had to file down the vertical humps in the middle of my nail because the strips wouldn&amp;#34;t bend that much and stay attached. I also found that the best way to hold the strip in place while the adhesive dries is with the eraser end of a pencil. The enclosed stick slips off easily but the eraser keeps even, firm, no slip pressure in place for as long as you need it. Also, I use a toothpick to apply a tiny amount of adhesive in a very thin, even coat. Too much adhesive and it won&#x27;t work. I would recommend trying these before using drastic measures. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Holy cow, something that actually works as advertised!  I&#x27;ll update this as time passes, but three weeks in, I&#x27;m impressed.  Yes, it took a few tries to get the brace applied correctly; even if you are flexible, it is much easier if you have someone to help you.  Follow the directions and use half as much glue as you think you should.  I did spread the glue out a bit rather than putting just a dot on the end-- still confined to the ends of the brace leaving the middle unglued so it can flex and do its job.  I felt it working immediately, and the toe was a little sore that night and the next day, but nothing too bad.  By day three, my ingrown toenail pain was nearly gone.  After three weeks, I can really see a marked difference in the shape of my toenail compared to the one on the opposite foot.  I will probably do that nail as well, but want to give this a few months until the ingrown edge is grown out for comparison&#x27;s sake.  The strip did loosen on one end after 10 days; I carefully sanded the nail, applied the solution, then glued it back down and so far so good.  It&#x27;s stayed on since.  Yes, this kit is expensive for what you get, but if you have an ingrown nail causing pain and the only alternative is a surgery, the price is your least worry.  It does work if you have a little patience and follow the instructions exactly.  I am impressed so far and will continue to use it.  Will update as time passes.  7/16/15 - I kept the curve correct on until we went on vacation and a few trips to the hot tub meant the strips came off.  My feet felt great so I didn&#x27;t reapply them.  Big mistake.  My nail went from &#x27;feeling great&#x27; to &#x27;ingrown again&#x27; the other day.  I applied the strip and within two days the nail had lifted enough for me to drain the pus from the abscess and cut out the sharp tip.  The nail feels much better.  I am also applying a strip to the big to on the other foot as I see it&#x27;s starting to have issues as well.  One thing I did change-- the nail glue that comes with the kit will dry the bottle shut regardless of what you do.  I used Loctite Professional Superglue and that works so much better.  While Superglue probably isn&#x27;t supposed to be safe for skin contact long-term, I am not worried about the two drops over the nail.    I still wish this was easier to apply.  I can do it myself but it takes multiple attempts as I am not particularly flexible, and has reduced me to tears of frustration before of having to try over and over again to get the strip to stick to the nail, having it come loose when I try to glue the opposite side, then having to refile, reclean, and try again with a very painful toe.  Have someone help you for easier application.</li>
    <li> I am into the 4th strip and so far I haven&#x27;t been able to get the strip stick more than 1 hour. I have tried more than 6-7 times, trying to re-stick the same strip again. Based on the instructions, I have tried reducing the amount of glue but it doesn&#x27;t work. I will give the remaining strips one or two more attempt, but I do not have much hope in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For others looking at this product, this is basically plastic/fiber strips to be glued to your nail to allow the nail to auto-correct the curve. The main aspect of this product is to get the strip to stick to your nail which is entirely a hit or a miss. I would not recommend anybody else to use this product.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. Well worth the cost. It worked!</li>
    <li> This product has been a lifesaver for me.  I have a chronic nail condition due to many years of having Artificial Gel Nails applied  My nails just wont grow the way they should anymore.  This past year, I have been to countless Dr&#x27;s, Specialists, Dermatologists, Podiatrists, you name it, I have been there, in an attempt to find a solution.  I always came up empty handed until I found CurveCorrect.  Curve Correct is my solution to having pain free beautiful healthy nails back again, The pain I have experienced in my fingertips (and toes) this past year has been unbearable, underestimated.  I was at the point of having to make the decision, having the Podiatrist cauterize/cut my nail bed to correct the way my nails grow. I have put this off because the expense is $300.00 per cut, 600.00 per finger x 10 is whopping $6000.00. Not to mention the intense pain recovering from such trauma, had forced me to look for other options. Besides, I could not afford to take that much time off from work.  I am a merchandiser by trade. Pain free fingertips are essential.&lt;br /&gt;Curve Correct REALLY does correct in-grown nails....just as they claim.  You will see results In a matter of a day or two,  Leave the brace on just as they suggest.  If it comes off, (as they sometimes do) replace it.&lt;br /&gt;I have customized the braces to work for me personally.  I cut them in half, lengthwise and use two per nail. I find they just stick and stay on better.  This might not be suggested but it works, for me.  A special tip is to place a dot anywhere on the brace with black or colored ink so when you accidentally drop one, (and you will) they are easier to find.  Believe me, I have lost my share.  Its possible to apply the braces to your toes yourself but having a set of extra hands makes it a whole lot easier, mandatory for finger nail application. For me, It&#x27;s not probable to re-use the braces. Do not use too much glue.  A tiny dot at each end does it.  Use a tiny dot at each end of the brace.  MORE IS NOT BETTER, its worse.  You pretty much have to get it right the first time.  If you make a mistake, cut that end off and try again.  The glue wont stick if you try to re-glue the same spot over again. FYI  Make sure to rough up your nail and each end of the brace with the nail file included for best results.  USE the Primer (Solvent) for optimum results.  Use the end of the wooden cotton swabs included to hold the brace in place until the glue dries completely, about 2-3 minutes.  IMPORTANT ~ make sure the glue is completely dry and brace secure, before attaching the other end of the brace to the nail, otherwise it will pop off and you will have to start all over again. I don&#x27;t cut the brace to size until AFTER the first side is completely secure.  If you make a mistake and have to start over, the brace will be too short if you have to cut off the end of the brace and start over again.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions EXACTLY.  Your are on your way to healthier, pain free ingrown toe and fingernails for GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU CURVE CORRECT.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Karen Laser</li>
    <li> Purchased this product several months ago after reading mostly positive reviews on Amazon.  Initially I had some problems with the application, not so much getting the brace on my nail, but getting it to stay on.  Furthermore, if you have thin nails like me, the brace can actually hurt.  Once I contacted customer service with my concerns about pain and application issues, I received constant reassurance.  This company and it&#x27;s owner stand behind the product and will provide all the support you need to make it work.  I used the braces consistently for about 2 months and the pain in pressure was gone but I started feeling like my nails were lifting a bit too much so am giving it a break.  I plan to see how the nail grows now and will resume using the braces if/when I see the nail digging into the skin.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> These were difficult to apply, even when following the instructions.  I think the combination of needing fine motor skills to align the strips, working quickly to correctly use the glue and the worst:  getting your feet up where you can work on them makes this a frustrating job.  Patience helps alot.  I found that I could use the stick of the swab to even out/wipe off the excess glue.  I ruined one or two.  One or two didn&#x27;t stay on very long and got re-applied.  I haven&#x27;t used up all 10 and am really pleased with the flattening of my nails and have had no pain since the first day.  As long as you know that there will be a learning curve to this, you ought to be able to use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who complain about the price...you saw the picture and saw the price.  You should consider the outcome rather than the amount of product per dollar.  It&#x27;s worth every penny to me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with ingrown toenails until just a few months ago. I had purchased a new brand of golf shoes and suspect that the added pressure of the new shoes on my large toes was responsible for creating the condition since I play a lot of golf. After experiencing a growing amount of pain on the 4 corners of my large toes, my wife suggested that have a pedicure done at a highly rated local nail salon. I had never had a pedicure done before - but was fortunate to find a lady who was very good at working on ingrown nails. Within 30 minutes the pain was gone and I was OK - except that about 3 weeks later the pain returned and began to get worse. After a couple of monthly pedicures which did provide short term relief, I did not think I was making any long term progress and started Googling for long term cures. I discovered CurveCorrect, read the positive reviews and bought the product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit of a learning curve to trim the strips to size and then to glue them on correctly. I messed one up and found that I had to carefully remove all the dried adhesive before I could get a replacement strip to stick on properly. I used the strips right after the pedicure - so there was no immediate relief since my toes were in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first month, the strips did not seem to make difference. The pain began again much like it did without the strips. I called CurveCorrect and reached a very helpful support person who picked up the phone on the first ring. He suggested that I try a slightly stiffer strip and agreed to send me several stiffer ones that I received within a couple of days - all at no charge! These worked much better - probably due to the fact that I must have thicker than average toenails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has now been three months and I am totally pain free. I have been continuing to get monthly pedicures since I now like them - but am finding that the pedicures are probably no longer needed since the strips appear to be working. I plan to continue use of the strips for 3 more months in order to allow my toenails to go through a full re-growth cycle. Since the strips stay on for upwards of 60 days - it is not much hassle to keep using the product for a full cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caution: I learned that the strips can also be secured with water resistance super glue. However the adhesive supplied by CurveCorrect is a more expensive hospital grade material and much more sanitary than normal super glue. Stick with the CurveCorrect adhesive - especially if you have any open wounds in the affected area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
    <li> The solvent is just alcohol.  If you use acetone before on the nail before you apply the strip they just work ok.  They are difficult to apply and take some practice.</li>
    <li> Work. Not very noticeable (visually or physically).</li>
    <li> It is amazing how the plastic strips are strong enough to change the shape of the toenail right before your eyes.  The pain relief from the ingrown nail was noticed after only a few hours and I still have the original band in place after three weeks.  I plan on replacing the strip in a few days with a new one.  I had no trouble with the adhesive, but it must be used sparingly.  I consider this product to be well worth the money, as it saved me from a painful trip to the doctor&#x27;s office.  I strongly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I do like the product, but the glue container needs to be changed- super glue &amp; a horizontal case? Not a good combination.  The lid glues itself shut if you put it back in the case.  I feel the price is too high. In the beginning the bands stayed on for 2 wks. now,  I have trouble getting the glue to hold the band for more than a few days. But the toenail looks better!</li>
    <li> toes haven&#x27;t felt this well in years.</li>
    <li> did not think it would work but after about  6  weeks of use ,i could clearly see that the toenails were not curved anymore but were actually almost flat across the top.. takes awhile but much better than getting ingrown toenail removed or cut out..</li>
    <li> I have been diagnosed with pincer nails.  This is a very painful condition where some of your nails grow more and more curved- my left bit toe nail was trying to be a circle!  This went on for years and was excruciatingly painful.  I saw several doctors for this, finally ending up at a nail specialist who told me just to apply a special lotion daily- which did NOTHING to help.  I searched on my own, came across this product, and decided to risk the rather expensive price, because it sounded like it should work.  HALLELUJAH!!! I found the directions to be clear, the process of application do-able, and the results over time have amazed me.  I have been using this for over a year now, and my left big toe nail is normal and beautiful and painless.  I started to get relief initially in the first month, but my nail was severely curved, so it did take a long time to fully correct.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough, have even thought about going to that nail specialist and telling him he needs to recommend it, cause he is offering no hope!</li>
    <li> The application process can be difficult for some users.  You must use the right amount of adhesive for proper bonding.  It gets difficult near the last step when applying the final end of the strip.  I wish the applicator puts out less adhesive or has a sponge tip to allow you to control the amount coming out.  I ended up using too much on both nails I applied to.  One strip came off in one week, the second strip came off in three weeks.  I&#x27;ll have to try again and see if I get better at this.  This is probably why they give you so many strips.</li>
    <li> It took longer than expected to correct the ingrown toenail, but the product&lt;br /&gt;certainly works!</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with ingrown toenails my whole adult life.  When I started taking an adult ballet class this fall things went from bad to worse.  Debated ordering the kit, used the ole&#x27; cotton ball under the nail, soaking, etc.  One dance class back after the holidays and I finally ordered and wish I had done it sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One strip on each big toe nail and the pain is gone.  I could feel an immediate change, however they were sore for a few days as my nail adjusted to the strip.  A week or so later I was pain free and the nails are significantly less curved.  Had trouble with the strips staying on, one side didn&#x27;t make it through class.  I&#x27;ve since reattached each using superglue which has stayed put for three weeks now.  I&#x27;d recommend using the gel type of superglue cause its easier to control, and apply it the same as the instructions say for their adhesive.  The strips aren&#x27;t quite as invisible or smooth as i thought they&#x27;d be, but i haven&#x27;t had trouble with them catching on things too much either (not even my tights!).  Haven&#x27;t tried painting my nails, but I think it would look strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue using and replacing strips as they fall off per the instructions, but it seems even after the first strip it may not take that many to see a permanent flattening of the nail.  I&#x27;ve had both nails cut out in the past, one with medication to stop nail growth, and this certainly beats those experiences.  Minimum pain, no surgery, and relatively low cost.  Thank you curve correct!!</li>
    <li> I was unsure if this product would really work. Noticed a difference within the 1st week and after wearing for 2 months, ingrown toenail is completely fixed. Have recommended this product to family and friends. Would buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent great product that works.  The pain was gone almost instantly in both large toes so i initially gave this product 5 stars.  It can however be difficult to get the brace to attach for more than a day or so..    By the time I got it right on just one large toe I had used all 10 braces. It helped to cut the plastic slightly shorter than it looks liKe needed so it is not super bent at the sides even if the nail is.  I also put glue on more than just the ends of the brace on the one that finally stayed on.  It also helped to gently file the top and ends of the edges so they are smoother and less likely to catch on socks, bedding etc.  Now I need to correct the other large toe and have no braces left.  With plenty of glue and cleaner left I hope to purchase more braces without buying the whole kit.  If not available I will investigate making my own braces.</li>
    <li> This fixed my daughters ingrown large toe toenail. She got relief right away and helped solve the pressure. She hasn&#x27;t had it return.</li>
    <li> I do not suffer from ingrown nails.  However, my nails are very curved- it&#x27;s a hereditary issue. I was having pain especially on the sides of my big toes and was limited in the shoes I was wearing and experiencing discomfort 24/7. I finally relented and placed my order which arrived very quickly. It relieved the pain almost immediately! I have just ordered my 2nd kit- the strips only seem to last about a week before coming off, but it&#x27;s been such a huge relief that I don&#x27;t mind the cost because it relieves the pain so completely! I&#x27;ve been using them for over a month, but I am very doubtful this will actually SOLVE the problem of curved nails. When the strip is glued in place, I can see a more normal nail, but as soon as the strip comes off, the nail has a significant curve again.  My biggest issue: UGLY! There is no way a pedicure can cover this up because the nail must be completely clean and free of polish for the adhesive to adhere.  Still, I&#x27;m a fan!  Until sandal weather comes, at least!!!</li>
    <li> There was about four dollars worth of products in the kit, but I&#x27;m willing to pay for a good idea and this sounded like a good idea, but I could not apply the strips. I even bought other super glue, as per one suggestion. Finally got one on and but it did not seem to lift my not very curved nail. The curved side had popped off by morning. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Product really works.  They are a bit challenging to place but the results have been amazing.</li>
    <li> I was definitely hesitant to pay the premium to get this.  But very shortly after putting it on it did relieve the pain.  My second application (these are just super glued strips of plastic) fell off last night, which is suppose to naturally happen.  It is a great idea and I guess they have a patent or equivalent on the idea, but this could also be a $5 walgreens items in the future.  Not wrong with it besides the price.  I do think this is better than the other version on here that is half the price but only has 1 strip.  There is some technique putting it on right, and you want more than more strip to try with, this could with 10 or so.</li>
    <li> They make it sound so easy in the instructions but don&#x27;t be fooled.  I was never able to apply these correctly.  All I got for my troubles was super glued fingers and toes and half of one of my toenails fell off. Avoid and get the help of a professional.</li>
    <li> It works and gives almost instant relief of pain but!  It takes a lot of skill,and only comes with 10 clear plastic bridges.  They are clear  and if dropped, hard to find.Did not read how to order more with out whole kit, Not cheap. There is a practice effect and they might send you some more, If you are prone to ingrown toenails, the price of shipping and the a few bucks for the bridges would be&lt;br /&gt;worth it. It is an ingenious idea though, and painless and works.</li>
    <li> If there was an applicator and a variety of sizes this would be perfect.  A little tricky to apply on clients. I wouldn&#x27;t attempt to apply to myself. Waiting to see if it provided any relief to my client</li>
    <li> This is by far a god send product.  I couldn&#x27;t even stand for the air to touch my big toe nails.  After the third day of the first treatment I was pain free. I am going to send a letter letting my Dr know how wonderful this product is as an alternative to having the toe nail cut out.Thank You CurvrCorrect.</li>
    <li> Curve Correct is working better than I thought since my toenails are very curved. I am very happy with how the brace is working on my big toes.  I am 72 years old and had no problem placing the braces on my toe nails.  It has been almost 3 weeks since I placed them on the two big toenails and they are still staying in place very well.  I followed the directions as was written.  It took about a week not to have any pain when I placed covers over my feet but now my toes feel great!  The ends of the nails are beginning to flatten.  I am very happy with Curve Correct and will tell others about this product.</li>
    <li> I was told by my doctor I needed surgery for my ingrown toenail. After doing some research, I found your site and ordered the product. I&#x27;ve been taking photos of my nail for 2 weeks now and the before and after shots are really noticeable. My nail was really curved in the beginning and after approximately two weeks it really flattened out. I&#x27;m happy I don&#x27;t need to go for surgery now.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother.  It nails are real bad just take the time to have them professional removed.</li>
    <li> This product really seems to be working. It&#x27;s alleviated my pain and my nails seem to be growing out properly. The company even sent me some replacement items when I contacted them because I improperly attached some of the strips.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. The price is way way to high for what you get. A small tube of superglue, an emery board, and a couple small strips of plastic shouldn&#x27;t cost this much.</li>
    <li> Chiming in to agree -- it really works, but it&#x27;s tough to get it to adhere correctly, and it costs way too much for what you get.    I&#x27;m amazed at how well it works, but I&#x27;m frustrated by the glue. I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now -- almost all of the applications included -- and I still can&#x27;t get it to adhere well. I follow the instructions to a T every time, but half of the time, it pops off a few hours or a few days after. It&#x27;s quite frustrating, because when it works, it works so well. The lid to the glue is currently glued on, so I might just chuck it and try some nail glue instead.    I have a metal tool with a flat end that I use to scrape under nails and push cuticles back, and I find that it makes a much better tool for holding the strip down as it cures than the wooden Q-tip included. The Q-tip easily snaps under pressure.    I&#x27;m annoyed that I&#x27;ll need to buy a second kit if I really want to finish the job, but since one kit is roughly the cost of the specialist copay that a podiatrist requires for less of a benefit, I guess I&#x27;ll pony up again, because it really and truly does work.    Edited to add:  I notice that my review has been up for just a couple hours, and yet it already has a downvote. So I looked at the other reviews -- none have zero up/down votes, which seems unusual. All have at least one. Reviews that are purely praise get an upvote, and ones that contain criticism are downvoted, regardless of &#x27;helpfulness.&#x27; So who knows, but if it&#x27;s the company doing that, for shame!</li>
    <li> Best thing EVER for ingrown nails!!!!!</li>
    <li> This works very well.  Yes, it can be difficult to apply just right.  I used a little glue in the center as well and it stayed on for three weeks.  Within a day, I noticed the nail straightening out and the pain was gone.  I gave 4 stars only because of the price but it&#x27;s a good kit.</li>
    <li> I feel a bit silly writing this review so early, but it&#x27;s really amazing for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been developing pincer nails on both of my great toes over the past few years. Did everything everyone does, including stuffing cotton under the nail edges 2 or 3 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;I applied Curve Correct a couple of hours ago and I just noticed I can press on my toes and it doesn&#x27;t hurt! DOES&#x27;NT HURT.&lt;br /&gt;That may not sound like much to people with normal toenails - which is another reason I feel a bit silly saying it.&lt;br /&gt;If it flattens out my toenails, I will be delighted - but right now, I&#x27;m very happy that my toes don&#x27;t hurt. At. All. For real.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing this product, I can recommend it for that reason alone. Brilliant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from ingrown toenail pain for several years. I&#x27;d finally had enough and began searching on the web for some relief. I came across this product, read the reviews and decided I would give it a try. I received the product within a couple of days. Both my wife and I read over the instructions several times and then my wife applied it to my toe.&lt;br /&gt;Damn!!! Within 2 minutes after the application was complete my pain was gone. It is now the following day and I&#x27;m seeing my toenail has already begun to return to its normal width. I&#x27;m walking much better also as I was favoring my right foot due the pain I was experiencing. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  This is a great product and really works! Instant relief. This is truly an amazing product. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> My pain faded away since i started using the strip.  It looks like my nail was growing with it and it keeps correcting the curve.  I swim and use steam sauna 5 times a week, and it was on my nail for three weeks.  I don&#x27;t feel pain any more, but I will glue it again one more time just in case.</li>
    <li> Latest update 6/27/2013. Yesterday I used very little adhesive and the strip stuck wonderfully with no edges sticking up or anything. I was so excited only to discover it was gone this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK updating my orignal review. The super glue only worked for about 3 days. I must say, these people stand behind their product. I will try again and update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dog clawed my right big toe on the right side between the nail and the skin. I&#x27;ve had ingrown toenails a few times in my life but this one is different because it&#x27;s on the side near the base instead of at the top. After I was finally able to see it I could see the nail is jagged on the side and I just have to let it grow out. It was unbelievable painful. Although I think this product is over priced it was a better option then surgery. It took about a day for me, but the pain is pretty much gone. What bothers me is that I actually might have to eventually buy another kit because I destroyed 5 strips over about a week. If you order this product, go out to the store and buy super glue before your order comes in. Don&#x27;t even bother with the adhesive that comes with the kit. Even after letting it dry for half an hour it still came off the following day. I&#x27;m on my third day with the stip super-glued and it is still statying put.</li>
