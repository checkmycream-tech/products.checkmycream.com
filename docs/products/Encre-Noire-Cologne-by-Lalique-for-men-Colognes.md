      <li>From the moment I opened it, I loved it.</li>
      <li>but it is not as good as I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>I was drawn to buy this perfume because of all the good reviews all over the web.</li>
      <li>I wanted to get a fragrance good for fall and winter and with how inexpensive encre noire is I decided to try it.</li>
      <li>It was a good price.</li>
      <li>if you like tobacco, as in the wonderful scent of cigars/a rich tobacco blend and versace&#x27;s &amp;#34;the dreamer&amp;#34; cologne or &amp;#34;la nuit de l&#x27;homme&amp;#34; by ysl, you may like this.</li>
      <li>Very nice summer scent, perfect for hot weather wear.</li>

      <li>I am very pleased with everything about this purchase.</li>
      <li>VERY PLEASED in my error</li>

      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Amazing stuff for this price.</li>
      <li>The scent is amazing</li>
      <li>Encre noire is truly in a league of its own.</li>
      <li>The point of a cologne is to smell nice at work</li>
      <li>I liked it</li>
      <li>Then there is a note that I can&#x27;t identify - kind of smells creamy</li>
      <li>but the dry-down is really nice and</li>
      <li>If you own Aqua di Gio and consider it your \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot; because all your friends have it, it may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Anyway this is good fragrance :)</li>
      <li>I saw many good reviews</li>
      <li>Nice foil to my sweeter frags.</li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t like trendy fragrances.</li>
      <li>You cannot return bottles of cologne to amazon because they are considered hazardous.</li>
      <li>I will always own a bottle of this cologne from now on.</li>
      <li>Nice breeze.</li>
      <li>I liked and recommend.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Buy it and don&#x27;t look back. Awesome scent</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance :) it smells tobacco and wood, but there is a little problem... after 2-3 hour smell disappears. Anyway this is good fragrance :)</li>
    <li> I really like this fragrance. The only thing is I don’t understand WHY I like it. It’s not at all what would be considered pleasant. It’s not sweet or floral but has a very dark green, bitter scent. I’ve never smelled anything like it out in nature or in any other fragrance. Definitely a dark and mysterious scent. Bizarre. Gothic. Creepy. Don’t blind buy it because you probably won’t like it.</li>
    <li> A lot of wood scents in this one. Unique scent for the night. Good sillage and longevity. Recommended for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Women ask me what is that your wearing, it smells  so good.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells like a campfire and tobacco and woods. Lovely. Best blind buy ever.</li>
    <li> The best &#x27;wood scent&#x27; I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> So if your looking at this, you must have seen the reviews online. yes this has a great smell, no one else will smell like you but!!! not everyone likes it, . for me i love its Dark Smell, great for winter or great if your working outside. its really strong 3-4 sprays will LAST ALL DAY (depending, if your outside and how hot it is). the only problem i had was that the sprayer was defective (leaked and would not mist well) amazon.com was a great help and fixed the problem.</li>
    <li> Smells like burnt wood. First blind cologne buy ever and was the last time I have ever did it. This stuff stinks.....</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE the smell but turn out the spray makes me sneeze like crazy, with eyes redness&lt;br /&gt;I NEVER had any allergic before for any reason, so I am not sensitive or anything. This is the first time ever I got those symtoms. So you might consider before buying if you are sensitive w sense.</li>
    <li> I blind bought this due to it hi-rated reviews, the top note smell almost like Burberry Touch top note, woody &amp; spicy. Then it turns to smell like smoke from &amp;#34;burnt plastic drinking straw&amp;#34; (most of you said burnt wood)....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product from Neiman marcus  and thought it was overpriced but it smells good and last longer, but I bought like four different once from Amazon it doesn&#x27;t last and very weak in smell compare to the previous once from neiman marcus. Amazon should tell the manufacturer to sell the same thing in the stores to their on line customers.&lt;br /&gt;Bayo Ogundele.</li>
    <li> It wanst to smell peppery but it doens&#x27;t, it wants to smell fresh but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;To me it smells like an old man cologne.  It was a huge let down.</li>
    <li> For those of you looking for the \\&quot;green\\&quot; mysterious and absolutely undescribable vetiver fragrance for evening... look no further. While Creed and Tom Ford have outstanding vetiver fragrances, for the majority of you they are going to be out of your price range. I also really love Guerlian&#x27;s Vetiver, which is great to wear any time, any place... this is a fragrance that you wear when you want to make a statement that you are unique. It has a smoky and dark opening but the heart of the fragrance is truly a blanket of velvet and to some noses could be very dry. It is a little bit oriental but definitely masculine enough. Age range 25 or 30 older. But compared to the other fragrances listed above, the price cannot be beat. If you are not sure, go with the 1.7 ounce from anyplace other than Frangrencenet as they can be hit or miss.</li>
    <li> If you love Vetiver, you will love this fragrance. The scent reminds of me of ink, pine and a little of latex rubber/burning rubber. Definitely not the right scent for someone just looking to smell nice or pleasant. This is really a scent for the connoisseur. Which begs the question, what is the point of a cologne if not to have other people enjoy your scent? I know alot of so called &amp;#34;cologne experts&amp;#34; will love odd scents that the general pubic will not like and will dismiss these people by saying that they just don&#x27;t get it. Well, wearing colognes is not like reading Nietzsche, the point is not to wear some &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; scent that only &amp;#34;connoisseurs&amp;#34; will like. The point of wearing cologne is to smell nice for girls so they will want to date you and possibly sleep with you. The point of a cologne is to smell nice at work so people will like to be around you. This scent also does not last very long, 3 hours at the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t say I hate it because I do find it to be a interesting scent but in the big picture, does not accomplish my intended purpose.</li>
    <li> If youre a cologne guy this is the one youre looking for.  Unique smell.  Vetiver is there for sure and this blend is amazing.  Get it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this without ever having smelled it before, mostly because i had enjoyed [[ASIN:B000CNO4ES Lalique By Lalique For Men. Eau De Parfum Spray 4.2 Ounces]] so much (&amp; all of the other reviews here and on basenotes website). This scent did not disappoint. i would say it has a woodsy, mossy, old book, old desk, with a light grapefruit scent. the scent is not overpowering, yet seems to last a while. Thank you to all the other reviewers here for leading me to purchase what may just be my new favorite cologne.</li>
    <li> I love it I love it ,this is the best scent I have ever used in my life i&#x60;m addicted to this smell I can&#x60;t let single day goes by without spraying or open the cap to take a sniff, I&#x60;ll keep wearing it till I die... thanks so much Lalique House :) .</li>
    <li> I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong Amazon has always made me free and better; acquires another company uses Amazon are excellent, Amazon is always an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;this fragrance, for example, I love the way all I can even give gende and love and is also author of Through Amazon, as well as any product I buy, is truly exquisite.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t explain the smell other than I really like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it three but it gives me a headache and is too soapy. I am happy I bought the sample first.</li>
    <li> The scent of this cologne is intriguing, erotic and beyond any scent I have encountered. As the day/evening progresses, the scent becomes more a tobacco, smokey scent. I suggest wearing it in the evening, and use very little. The scent will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D.Abbott, New York</li>
    <li> The gift receiver was impressed with the size of the bottle and very happy.</li>
    <li> Just bought this base on reviews, here and other sites and I&#x27;m so disappointed it smell woody at first to turn into a lacquer like smell that literally made me sick.I won&#x27;t recommend this, sorry.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised how much like a bottle of ink this smells like. Don&#x27;t let this deter you from purchasing though, this is as good in quality that most other niche offerings costing $150-$200. Longevity can be between anywhere from 14-20 hours. Not kidding; and projection, well people are going to smell this on you easily from 3 feet away for an easy 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Give this one a try, the quality is excellent and i love the scent. I can&#x27;t say this is a people pleaser though, some will like it and others will hate it as it&#x27;s miles from the Aua di Gio&#x27;s and Issey Miyake&#x27;s of the world. Buy this for it&#x27;s uniqueness, buy this if you crave a heavy dry vetiver, buy this for your own pleasure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never pay $125 retail for this scent, but for the average $33 on Amazon, this gets a solid four stars.  I own many fine mens fragrances such as Creed, Guerlain, Tom Ford, Chanel and Bond No. 9 so have a frame of reference to compare.  This is just different; not exactly like anything else on store shelves.  To me, this fragrance smells deep \\&quot;spicy woodsy\\&quot; with hints of vetiver, light sandalwood and cedar.  I compared this to the cedarwood hanging in my closet and it&#x27;s not far off.  In my opinion, too much wood without anything to balance the wood scents.  However, it&#x27;s long-lasting (6+ hours) and the scent doesn&#x27;t project more than five feet; thus, stinking-out everyone around you which is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enre Noire Pour Homme is perfect for late fall into winter and suitable for dress or casual use.  The reason I&#x27;m not rating five stars is that there are better, in my opinion, fragrances on the market such as Tom Ford Oud Wood and Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille which smell similar but they balance the wood smell with another ingredient such as vanilla.  These fragrances cost a lot more, however.  What this fragrance could benefit from is a hint of nutmeg or vanilla.  Then, my rating would be a solid five stars.  Still, a fantastic purchase for the Amazon price point noted above.  I&#x27;d purchase again as this is different amongst a sea of copy-cat fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Footnote: I tried an experiment and mixed the Ente Noire Pour Homme with Creed Tabarome Millesime and the smell turned out to be heavenly!  The Creed Tabarome Millesime seems to balance the Enre Noire very well while not ruining the original Enre Noire scent.</li>
    <li> I liked and recommend.</li>
    <li> Great smell, great price. When I run out of this I will but it again. I saw this when looking at other colognes and read the reviews. It delivers. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my 6th bottle, really love it, buy it you will not regret any dollars you spend on this bottle. the best!!</li>
    <li> I bought it after reading the reviews. Good purchase. It&#x27;s formal yet you could have it on everyday. Perfect for cold weather.</li>
    <li> I get a peppery, sour floral smell from this one.  Then there is a note that I can&#x27;t identify - kind of smells creamy (is that the ISO Super E?)  Very different from others I&#x27;ve tried.  I like it very much.</li>
    <li> A fine, dark, woody vetiver. The scent is great for colder months. The scent is well composed with good projection and longevity.</li>
    <li> I was blind buying some cologne and this was one of them. I had expected this to be a woody scent and what I got was in whole different ball park then what i was expecting to smell. At first spray I couldn&#x27;t figure this cologne out. I wanted to like it but I was expecting something completely different. After it dried down though it smelled so unreal I could stop sniffing my wrist. I think it smells like earthy roots after a rainfall with a hint of pine. I don&#x27;t know what other way to put it. Bottle looks classic and for the price you cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT BUY.WAS ON TIME AT MY DOOR TODAY.GREAT SMELL,SECOND BASE ODOR OF WOOD ,LALIQUE HAD PERFECTED A GREAT EDT.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A NEED TO HAVE FOR ALL MEN.USE THIS AT NIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS THE ORIGINAL EDT.</li>
    <li> Dark pine, grass, charred wood, and leather. This is a very unique scent , and it smells great on me. It&#x27;s probably not the best blind buy though, so try it out first.</li>
    <li> Gentlemen, it does not get any better than this!!  This cologne is masculine and smooth!  Although masculine, the scent can best be described as pronounced, but not over-powering.  Very earthy/woodsy, but fresh aroma.  This one is an absolute winner!!  5 stars all the way!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I wite a review hope this will be beneficial.&lt;br /&gt; I purshaised Enre Noire. It smells wierd but very nice.</li>
    <li> It has unique smell if you like it. Kinda bitter and rich woody smell that lasts very long. The product came on time and the smell was the same as I had tried before. Just note that one or two sprays of it is enough, otherwise it might cause headache because it is too rich and strong.</li>
    <li> Woody, inky, niche....call it what you will but my conclusion is this toilette is on point. For me, it serves the spectrum of casual to formal outing. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this. Own at least one!</li>
    <li> This product has a great scent and is not too expensive. The longevity factor is questionable because I haven&#x27;t used it enough to judge it. Good buy.</li>
    <li> It was like my lost love! I used it like 10 years ago and it never went out of my mind. I believe people have really diverse tastes in fragrances but NO ONE has EVER disliked it. Vetiver can&#x27;t get better than this!&lt;br /&gt;On the usage side, the sillage is pretty good even in this hot and humid weather of about 40c! It even stays on the body after a mild shower. Two puffs are enough for the magic.&lt;br /&gt; I personally believe that its a must try for every guy out there!</li>
    <li> fantastic scent. smoky grass (vetiver), bamboo, grapefruit (at least that&#x27;s what I smell). Very nice summer scent, perfect for hot weather wear. Has a cult following, relatively inexpensive (compared to other Vetiver-ish scents). I use this as my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; Summer scent.</li>
    <li> Smells like Raid bug killer.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my boyfriend and it is the epitome of man&#x27;s fragrance!  It is an outstanding vetiver for the price!</li>
    <li> Third bottle and it&#x27;s as good as the first two. Definitely not a hot summertime frag, best suited for the fall, winter. One of THE Best vetiver frags on the market including Creeds Original! Has a dark smokey vetiver dry down that can&#x27;t be beat, sets it apart from all the others</li>
    <li> I had to write a review in hopes to provide some useful warning for those who are sensitive to the scent of ISO E Super.  For those of you who know what this is be aware that Encre Noire is LOADED with it.  For some of you that may be a good thing, for me it is a tremendous disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who don&#x27;t know ISO E Super is a synthetic molecule used to create a \\&quot;velvety woodsy scent\\&quot;.  For some people this scent is either hardly noticeable or even quite pleasant, but for a small percentage (myself included) it creates a sickeningly plastic and \\&quot;mediciney\\&quot; smell.  It can create horrendous headaches and nausea in many and for me this ingredient is the ruin of many, many fragrances.  Encre Noire is loaded with ISO E Super and unfortunately that isn&#x27;t advertised up front.  If you aren&#x27;t sure about how you react to ISO E Super then may I give you a strong recommendation to sample this first!  It might smell great on paper but once on your skin it might develop into a terrible plasticky smell.</li>
    <li> When I read reviews of classic male colognes before reformulation (for reasons of economy, allergen regulation compliance or both), I feel a certain sense of nostalgia that men back in the 70s and 80s could wear distinctive, powerful fragrances: outsize, extroverted, unique scents. In today&#x27;s male cologne market, we have sadly adulterated versions of these few surviving giants that are pale horribly modified shadows of their former selves (e.g. Eau Sauvage, Guerlain Vetiver) or, worse yet, we have the modern \\&quot;fabric softener\\&quot; scents of crisp acrid synthetics that smell of some artificial \\&quot;aquatic\\&quot; clean that never existed in nature (e.g. Cool Water, Acqua Di Gio, L&#x27;Eau D&#x27;Issey, Nautica Voyage, and the 5 million other clones of Cool Water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given this pallid field of has-beens and dudebro scented auras, it is a pleasure to bump into something strange, powerful, and wonderful. Encre Noir is one such fragrance, but it is definitely an acquired taste. There are two types of vetiver in here, and the odor created is at the same time spicy, earthy, and dank. This is an immensely polarizing fragrance, rather like A*Men, but it is worlds away from A*Men in affect, feeling somber, grim, and uncanny in its scent portrait rather than A*Mens sweet gourmand focus. You will either love it or hate it, and this is definitely not a blind buy, unless you already own a vetiver fragrance and wish for something ten times more powerfully scented of vetiver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note there is really little other than vetiver here. You get a faint hint of cedar and some cashmeran wood, and maybe the slightest hint of musk, but vetiver is the king here, and that damp earthy sort of vetiver smell that is not at all common. By way of comparison, Guerlain Vetiver is a mild citrus accented vetiver that is like a warm summer day, interesting, not especially offensive to most, and office friendly. Encre Noir in turn is a wintry midnight in Transylvania, and only Dracula would wear it to work! You are warned - do not buy lightly, as this is likely to end up gathering dust on your shelf unless you are utterly in sync with what Lalique is aiming for here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is superlative, weighty and expensive look and feel, and the atomizer is powerful and efficient, no anemic squirts here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are significant issues here even if you love the scent. This is a one squirter if anything in  the modern world is. The first day I wore this, I put on three squirts and watched coworkers and subway passengers cough and flinch away from me. I showered as soon as I got home, and let this one sit for a bit. The next time I used it, I went for one spray, and it worked out fine. Prominent, pleasant, but not offensive. And I am not sure if you should wear this to work at all, but you can make the call on that based on your own assessment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next issue, immensely linear. The fragrance is the same 6 hours in as it was 5 minutes after you put it on. No complexity, no evolution, just a permanent vetiver scented stasis. Longevity is great, 8 hours plus, and projection and sillage are also excellent; again, one spray will do unless you really don&#x27;t like whoever you will be near to that day! I think if these fragrance was made say 20 years ago, they would have chucked some more powerful stuff in like nitro musks or oak moss and we would have gotten a more complex nuanced fragrance, but what we have here is what happens when you stick a lot of powerful vetiver in a modern fragrance under IFRA regulations. This is not a fault of the perfumer so much as it is a sad truth of the modern fragrance market. You can put a little vetiver in and balance it out with other stuff (e.g. Guerlain Vetiver or Hermes Terre) or you can load your perfume up with vetiver and then get little else apparent to the nose. (This, plus other niche examples like Route Du Vetiver, Vetiver Extraordinaire etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final point: tons of Iso E Super in here, as more or more than the Terre D&#x27;Hermes. If you or your immediate loved ones have a sensitivity to Iso E Super, this one will have your eyes watering. I like ISO E just fine myself, but I know many are quite sensitive to it. (Next IFRA target perhaps?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am tempted to call this a three star perfume, as it is limited in scope and ambition, and is powerful enough so as to have limited social utility, save for undead monsters. However, there is something to be said for untrammeled intensity in the modern age, and I am sure nothing like this is going to be made again any time soon. (And Lalique might well be phasing this one out; pricing online has fallen to roughly half of what is charged for a \\&quot;first tier\\&quot; cologne like Eau Sauvage, a sure sign that retailers are trying to liquidate unsold inventory of a less popular fragrance. This scent, like a V8 Hemi Charger, is not long for this tepid  and faint-hearted age, so you may want to snap it up now before you are left with ADG and Nautica Voyage as your buying options to wear as you tool around in your skinny-tired Prius...an the Terre D&#x27;Hermes.

    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my brother, who&#x27;s preparing to graduate from college. He has an athletic, pretty classy style, and he says that this scent is awesome. I don&#x27;t have much experience purchasing products like this for people, but he&#x27;s been using it lately, and he just got a nice, pretty girlfriend. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This smelled fine but did not last very long. I gave it away to someone in my office for their husband.</li>
    <li> This an awesome cologne. A blind buy recommended. Quality juice at a cheap price. I will add a 2nd bottle soon.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Can&#x27;t describe it properly as I am no master of perfumery, but I get compliments on it and the price is great for so much quality fragrance.</li>
    <li> If you are on the fence about Encre Noire - do not hesitate - buy it!  I love vetiver scents and ended up blind buying this one - a true bargain at the price Amazon is selling it at.</li>
    <li> It is a great essence. It is very strong but I think it is not for me. It is very formal, for adults, like 30+ years old. I would use just for formal events. It is impossible to use with t-shirt and short.</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume it has everything for a man. I really recommend this seller. No problems at all, I hope I can buy something else in the not distance future</li>
    <li> This was honestly the first &amp;#34;blind buy&amp;#34; that I ahve ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about the cologne on line, watched videos on youtube, but was unable to find a store that carried it so I can smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, this cologne is actually really good!  Too bad it&#x27;s more of a winter scent and it&#x27;s now summer, but theres always this year!!</li>
    <li> This perfume is so great. The scent is masculine yet soft and attractive. I simply loved and my boyfriend was happy to receive it.</li>
    <li> You are going to love or hate this scent, I don&#x27;t think it has a grey area. I love this scent, like a dark, earthy vibe. This scent reminds me of a dark Christmas, I know that might not help but that&#x27;s what I feel when I smell it. Longevity last quite awhile on this.</li>
    <li> A different fragrance when compared to most of the industry&#x27;s heavyweights. I appreciate that it lacks the otherwise common heavy musky and animalistic notes. It is clean, invigorating and lasts long. My untrained nose finds it rather unidimensional, overwhelmingly dominated by the smell of colophony rosin. Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Very distinct smell, I have never owned anything quite like it. I will definitely buy this one again in the future.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite Vetiver...pure dark and earthy..just frigging magical stuff and I will always have a bottle on hand.</li>
    <li> Yea so... this smells really really good and it was not expensive at all. Perfect for a winter cologne. The end.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, a fantastic buy especially at this price. I buy as much as I can from Amazon, its so easy.</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like a man then you can&#x27;t find anything more fitting than this Fragrance. Nothing feminine about this whatsoever. The dry down is one of the best ever if you have good skin chemistry. It&#x27;s not many colognes that I have to keep buying more than once but this one is one in a very few.</li>
    <li> Gift for son who is into cologne, loved it.</li>
    <li> This is signature scent worthy!! This is such a quality fragrance for a low price. Beautiful presentation, the scent is inky and woody, it last 10+ hours on my skin. Just buy it already!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite everyday scent.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re into vetiver...buy this.  I find 3 or 4 sprays to the heart area of my chest will carry me through most of the day</li>
    <li> Awesome, unique fragrance but has no lasting power. Definitely worth the money for the quality of the scent itself and the brand, otherwise I would pass it up. Great for a casual evening out or for every day use due to its soft yet sensual and subtle scent. If your looking for something that will turn heads this will do it as long as its within the first couple hours of application. I recommend loading it on more than other colognes and do it right before you go out as it evaporates off the skin quickly which is unfortunate.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a cologne with vetiver and quite by accident I found Encre Noire. From the moment I opened it, I loved it. The fragrance is captivating and stays on strong for a long time.</li>
    <li> This cologne is definitely an acquired taste. I didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled at first, but over time it transformed into a more pleasant scent. Also, it lasts pretty long. Now I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> The vetiver is very noticeable and the scent is decently long lasting</li>
    <li> Powerful woody notes, with smoky undertones. But sophisticated and subtle at the same time. I didn&#x27;t even know about this brand, until I asked someone wearing the cologne Glad I did.</li>
    <li> Very unique fragrance, this is definitely a fall/winter fragrance. I live in Austin, TX with the heat and humidity this can be overpowering, and almost pungent. Although, I may have over done it a bit. I tend to do 3-4 sprays of whatever I use and I seriously think 1, 2 tops would do the trick.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing!!! Every time I wear it I get numerous compliments from both men and women.  This fragrance however is not for casual use, this fragrance requires a suit and tie or something formal.  Pair this with a nice ensemble and have stick ready because you will have to beat the women off you.</li>
    <li> I just received the spray in mail and couldn&#x27;t wait to open it in the office and boy did it make me all excited to write this review. The smell of old wood but with a soft touch and promising longevity and deep deep connection.</li>
    <li> Encre Noir is unparalleled in the dark and sensual parfume arena. This fragrance is for an individual with a refined palate, a desire for the unique, and a flair for the dramatic. Its essences of wood, tobacco, vetiver, and cashmere are a perfect recipe for the creation of a Sexy M.F. aura. I love it and it has been my fragrance du jour since its introduction.</li>
    <li> Great smokey and unique scent. It&#x27;s become my signature scent!</li>
    <li> Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I received my order in time.  I had gotten Lalique for my boyfriend. He just loves it! I do too!</li>
    <li> Smells like it should. Pure vetiver. Shipped fast. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Really great scent. It has a really strong scent that will last for a good time kn you. Not strong enough to the point where you start to dislike it though.  Some colognes tend to be so heavy that their scnet starts to follow you wherever you go and it gets annoying. This mellows out but still lingers. I have found this and Fahrenheit transits to this mellow state while still leaving the bold fragrance behind.</li>
    <li> Enre Noire is a very good woodsy scent that is very bold when first applied but drys down to a remote but very present scent that will last throughout most of the day. Compliments that will be received shall be, may we say. . . proof in the puddin&#x27;. Without doubt, if you enjoy the woodsy scents, Enre Noire is one that you will be very well pleased to have.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands of vetiver scents, and this is still my baseline. It goes on dark and brooding, and stays that way long into the day. I will continue to try other vetiver scents, but right now this is on top.</li>
    <li> Wow. I just blind bought AN and tried it. Dissapointed, hoping to get used to it. Better in dry down. I love M7 oud absolu, and thought this could be similar, with all the good reports of a woodsy fragrace. First thought was it smells like some illigal drug from my youth. Smells like raw or burning mariajana maybe. Its just a one dimensional harsh smell. M7 oud absolu is so much nicer and aromatic. Hopefully it will grow on me, I jusy blind ordered Encre Noire Sport. Oh oh?      Now after a while I allready like it better. It is so exreamly unique in a natural green way. It is allready growing on me like fine Limburger cheese.</li>
    <li> RaJuR real deep kool on the web and YOUTUBE!!!  APPROVED!!!</li>
    <li> Seems that the perfume lost his scent after a week in the bottle. I thought that a perfume should live as long as you have some in your bottle. but this one works only at the beginning and them pufff...it is gone</li>
    <li> I love this scent and was hesitant to buy it at such a discount, but decided to go for it and I&#x27;m glad. The code on the bottom revealed that this was manufactured in March 2013 and it smells spot on. Great deal for a true masterpiece.</li>
    <li> I purchased Enre Noire without smell or heard that name before, only based on the comments and reviews here. They are right, this is a unique, masculine fragrance that will make feel just like that: Unique. When you put it on, it is a little strong as any good cologne that last. This one lasted all day on me and I got great compliments from females which is what matters: smelling good for yourself and others who get in contact with you. One more important feature: as time passes, the fragrance improves to a more complex woodsy and vetiver smell that makes this a very good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other reviews. It&#x27;s the last time I will buy a fragrance without testing it first. It just doesn&#x27;t do it for me--very understated and doesn&#x27;t seem to endure--not that I would really care if it did or did not. Compliments on this one &#x3D; 0 and I can&#x27;t blame my wife or the ladies at the office from being underwhelmed.</li>
    <li> Id totally recomend this product and the seller. Well worth it, if you like this fragance you should try it.&lt;br /&gt;You wont regret.&lt;br /&gt;Great experience.&lt;br /&gt;Totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> AMAZING is an understatement!! Its sitting in front of my two Tom Ford fragrance&#x27;s. That says it all. - The R.</li>
    <li> The smell is reminiscent of Off bug spray. It lasts a long time and some people will enjoy it. Just not me.</li>
    <li> this is a complex fragrance. if you like tobacco, as in the wonderful scent of cigars/a rich tobacco blend and versace&#x27;s &amp;#34;the dreamer&amp;#34; cologne or &amp;#34;la nuit de l&#x27;homme&amp;#34; by ysl, you may like this. try it in a dept store first to make sure you dig it. you HAVE to try it first. don&#x27;t go by reviews cause smell is VERY VERY SUBJECTIVE!!!</li>
    <li> I will admit that I bought this without smelling it before.  Definitely one of the best gambles I&#x27;ve taken on a purchase ever.  I love the smell.  It&#x27;s a great combination of wood and leather, with just a little smoke.  The scent is powerful in close quarters, but doesn&#x27;t extend so much that people can smell you coming from a mile away.</li>
    <li> Gave it away......not my taste.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this cologne. I saw many good reviews and I wanted to try it for myself. Not too bad but it is not as good as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I never used a perfume until this one. I decided to spice things up a bit. I read up a few places about how to splash perfume, and the standard response seemed to be a spritz on the wrist, daub it onto the other and then rub it near the neck. I did that, and I barely smelt the perfume after a while, and while my wife complimented me on it, no one outside noticed it. I assumed that it was not strong enough and so I sprayed an extra spritz the next time around around my neck. If people noticed it, they didn&#x27;t say. But I like the smell of this perfume. It&#x27;s woody and floral and feels like a well-throated warble of a bird right after the first spring rain.</li>
    <li> This fragrance right here is the business, great for a night out women flock to this when the come in contact with it.</li>
    <li> Besides the price the scent is awesome. I&#x27;m very particular about my colognes. And I don&#x27;t like trendy fragrances. I hate when they are too musky or have too much citrus. I typically rock Gucci by Gucci or Polo Black. Much like those it is different and few people have it. This starts off with strong wood scents. As the day goes on it becomes sweet. And it lasts very long, which is a huge bonus. I&#x27;m sick of men&#x27;s colognes that only last a few hours. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance based on the reviews I saw on the site. I had first seen the product on a site called uncrate. I&#x27;ve been searching for a new cologne for the past year and I have finally found my every day sent.&lt;br /&gt;It starts off very sharp, very clean and crisp but quickly warms and dries down to an earthy Woody wet tone. A cross between fresh-cut cedar and wet green tea leaves. The first day I wore it I liked it but I wasn&#x27;t sure that other people would like it so I was a bit afraid to wear it. As the scent warms more the wetness seems to come out of it and what you&#x27;re left with is sort of a dry cedar or Cyprus with a little bit of smoke.&lt;br /&gt;To me it&#x27;s perfect it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m looking for now addicted to the smell. I put it on before going to bed that&#x27;s how much I like it. I strongly recommend this scent to anyone looking for a dark woody earthy fragrance.</li>
    <li> very unique sent.  I use 2-3 sprays.  within 2 hours there is minimal if any projection.  a nose needs to very close to smell it.  for the price worth a try bearing this caveat in mind.</li>
    <li> I am an avid wearer of fragrances and have been for a couple of years now. I have never smelled anything like this.  It opens with a damp, earthy, almost Indian ink smell and then develops into a refined vetiver that smells very earthy yet maintains its integrity and does not smell dirty.  The dry down is to die for with a linear smoky oud type of feel.  This fragrance lasts for 10+ hours on my skin with only two sprays and will project I would say a radius of 4-6 feet.  This fragrance I would recommend for formal occasions and does have a very mature feel to it and needs to be worn with some confidence.  This retails at $125 for the 3.3oz so Amazon is basically giving it away.  Fragrance enthusiasts, especially vetiver lovers NEED to purchase this.  Just go ahead and blind buy this one, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very nice men&#x27;s fragrance with a masculine scent....deep, rich, and lasts all day so a little goes a long way. Please do not be one who puts too much on and ruins it.... less is more here guys. She doesn&#x27;t want to smell it all the way across the room boys, you want her to smell it when she gets close to your personal space. All my lady friends agree and give it two thumbs up! Wonderful fragrance at a great price point.</li>
    <li> Love it &amp; will get it again, reasonable price, summery item  I recommend it to you as well. Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought a sample of this stuff and loved it. I am a vetiver fan and this is an interesting use of it. Once I bought the full bottle though, I find myself feeling nauseated. I actually have to scrub it off every time I dare try it again. Chanel Sycomore is very similar but a bit rounder, more complex and beautiful. It is possible that by smelling the better Sycomore, that now my nose detects the more synthetic components in E.N. and I can no longer enjoy it. I am scared that I may no longer love Sycomore if it reminds me of E.N. (have not tried yet). Very nice packaging for the price and excellent projection (hope you like it).</li>
    <li> This is a complex scent.  It opens with serious charred wood and old leather notes; however it transforms once it warms up.  Grapefruit and citrus notes shift to the front, followed closely by smoky wood, tobacco, vetiver, leather, and maybe a little black pepper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this based on reviews here.  I was looking for new cologne, something unique and interesting, but without flowers, powder and musk tones.  This definitely delivered on that. While it has lingering citrus notes, it isn&#x27;t fruity at all and it retains a distinctive masculine air (without hitting you in the face with it).  When I first wore it, I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it. Your first spay may startle you as your nose attempts to figure out what you have done.  It mellows nicely though, and lasts a very long time. I&#x27;ve grown to really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get a fragrance good for fall and winter and with how inexpensive encre noire is I decided to try it. It&#x27;s a very masculine, earthy scent. It smells almost like a fire that just went out mixed with soft, musky undertones. A great purchase for sure!</li>
    <li> LOVELY “MASCULINE” FRAGRANCE.&lt;br /&gt;HAS THAT HINT OF “DANGER”</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new scent and as i was reading the reviews decided to give this shot, i was not disappointed, this my go to cologne right ahead of hermes and polo double black. The compliments are plenty too..</li>
    <li> May smell like pot to some but a wonderfully seductive fragrance to others. Nothing else out there smells like this. Encre noire is truly in a league of its own. For the conisseur of fragrances.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this cologne at first but went ahead with it on my girlfriend&#x27;s recommendation since she has the female version which smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell because it is not reminiscent of other colognes and not overpowering and is lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy fragrances without testing them first, but I purchased this based on the other reviews on this page. I could not be happier with this purchase. The scent is amazing and I have received many compliments from friends and co-workers because of it. Shipping was very fast too.  I am very pleased with everything about this purchase.</li>
    <li> Does not have the retention that the bottole from Neiman Marcus has............Questionable</li>
    <li> Well this was a blind buy for me but it turned out to be the worst. Thing lasts for about 30 minutes so hopefully this is saturated version of the original. The 30 minutes smell is really good though</li>
    <li> DARK, UNIQUE &amp; SOPHISTICATED. THIS COLOGNE IS NOT FOR THE GUY WHO WANT TO  USE  ACQUA DI GIO BECAUSE ALL HIS FRIENDS USE IT., STRONG PERSONALITY IS A MUST TO ENJOY ENRE NOIRE. BRAVO FOR THE HOUSE OF LALIQUE.</li>
    <li> This is a modern classic. It smells very similar to Chanel Sycamore, but lasts longer on my skin and cost much less. I would recommend this for anyone looking a smokey vetiver scent that lasts a very long time and has very good projection. Less sprays is more with this scent to me. Will repurchase in a heartbeat</li>
    <li> I live in the Los Angeles area and it was around 80 degrees for the past few days here in the city just to give you a visual of my surrounding temp. No humidity. Nice breeze. Love LA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the fragrances being reviewed and their ranking in comparison to Encre Noire Pour Homme by Lalique. I purchased #1-7 below within the last 2 months but I&#x27;ve had the same Polo bottle for over 10 year lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut up 8 pieces of paper and sprayed each with one scent then had my girlfriend blind test me. I sprayed at 6:25pm and started writing this review at 9:25pm after giving them one more sniff. My review is based on the opening, dry down and projection within these last 3 hours only. I will also recommend (blind buy) or (try 1st) for those who care about stuff like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 Encre Noire by Lalique&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent reminds me of something or someone from my childhood. I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on it but the smell made me happy and I wanted to keep smelling it over and over. Great opening, dry down almost seems to project a bit more but fantastic,mysterious, vetiver and bourbon essence that is still banging after 3 hrs on a piece of paper.Personally, the dry down smells like you sprinkled salt n pepper on a grapefruit mixed with a WOOD undertone big time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will agree with some reviewers and say this is an acquired taste so-to-speak and you will either LOVE it or HATE it. It is somewhat aggressive but a wonderful scent in order to beat out Hanae Mori. It was very close but mysterious nostalgia pushed Encre Noire to the title. Simply divine smell. (Try a sampler of this 1st)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 Hanae Mori by Hanae Mori&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening to this scent is #1 on this list without a doubt but overall, the dry-down was also great but after such a magnificent opening, I felt cheated. DO NOT BE FOOLED. This parfum version is very potent and 100% authentic. The opening smelled to me like a caramelized pineapple dipped in chocolate with a hintof musk or pepper then the dry-down smells more like a pineapple with a strong vanilla vibe behind it. The fresh pineapple remains throughout  tho. I&#x27;m not a professional, I&#x27;m just sharing how it smelled to me. Ironicaly, I meant to buy Him by Hanae Mori but ordered this one by mistake. VERY PLEASED in my error but I only hope Him by Hanae Mori will compare or be better than this? It&#x27;s my next purchase. Great fragrance. Must buy. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 Uomo Maschino by Moschino&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A close friend recommended this one for me as he swore by it for the last 15 yrs. I must say thanks to him for adding this one to my repertoire because it is fresh, clean and masculine and fun wrapped in one. Fruity opening, even better fruity dry down with a musky undertone behind it while staying masculine, mysterious and potent. Good projection on this one too. Oddly, you can spray 4-5 sprays and not offend anyone because of the soft sweetness that remains throughout this scent. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 Blue Sugar by Aqualina&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent wins the 4th spot by default because #5 has projection problems and it ticks me off because its a designer fragrance. Anyway, this Blue Sugar is GREAT and a bargain bin special at just $17/1.7 oz . It opens like cotton candy or a slight bubble gum vibe but then drys down into a yellow cake batter or caramelized vanilla/sugar mixture. Amazing stuff for this price. Very well done for a cheapy. Must try if you like fresh, sweet summer scents. Go easy on the sprays in the heat tho. Can&#x27;t lose. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#5 The One by Dolce &amp; Gabbana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pissed off at D&amp;G for creating this masterpiece because it sure does fall short in the projection dept. It smells so, so, so, delicious that it even beats out Blue Sugar in smell but the dry down from D&amp;G for ($52) from a deisgner house is just pathetic. If you give someone a hug after 4 hrs, they might still smell it on you butyou have to go 4-6 sprays on this just to make it through a an 8hr work day. The good news is you can spray it on your clothes instead of your body and 3-4 sprays WILL LAST for your entire 8hr work day. Damn good smell tho. If D&amp;G 1 had the projection of Encre Noire, D&amp;G would be #1 HANDS DOWN it smells that good. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#6 Angel Men Pure Malt by Thierry Mugler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bias toward fragrances that I have smelled before that mimic other fragrance houses. For that reason, I didn&#x27;t really care for this opening here because I had smelled this scent before. It is slightly aggressive and interesting right off the top. It smells exactly like Dunhill Red by Dunhill that I used to own and didn&#x27;t really care for. Same exact juice, however, the dry down of Pure Malt is where this fragrance shines.This is another acquired taste. I can see why many reviewers rave about it, and I can see why some do not like it. I lean more toward not liking it but the dry-down is really nice and it projects very well. You get 6-8 hrs on the skin easily with this one and 24hrs on ur clothing. I can always smell it on my clothes the next day. Easy on the sprayer. (Try a sample before buying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#7 Silver by Jack Black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very generic summer scent that I bought because it has many natural ingredients. Nothing to write home about but good for a daily gym scent or after work run to the grocery store etc. Poor projection after 4 hrs and semi floral on the dry-down. (Try a sample before buying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#8 Polo by Ralph Lauren&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this years and years ago because it is a timeless classic. The time for this classic has come and gone in my opinion. I&#x27;m over it and so are the perfumers of the world because there are not many scents on the market like Polo&#x27;s green bottle original scent and noone is trying to mimic it anytime soon. I can&#x27;t believe this thing is not a parfum. It projects like a BEAST. You know the deal guys...Polostinks so good if you like it and it stinks so bad when you don&#x27;t. (Try a sample before buying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea of how opposites attract, my GF chose my #5, 6 and 8 as her top three best smelling scents respectively. I buy cologne because I love the way it smells on me. I do not buy it to impress females. If you are the type of person who buys based on what women like, then you better try some blind tests with some women you know because you may be surprised to find out that they may like the scents you don&#x27;t and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry this was so long people. Hope it was helpful at least.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is absolutely wonderful! One of my absolute favorites. If you love smoky and woodsy fragrances and you like vetiver, this is totally for you! It is definitely a niche quality fragrance at a very inexpensive price. In my opinion, this embodies the epitome of man.</li>
    <li> I can not believe I bought this Lalique product for such a cheap price !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;honestly when I wanted to order this product I was expecting to get a fake one for this price, and it was fair for me&lt;br /&gt;but it was NOT fake, I love the smell and it last a long time to go</li>
    <li> Classic fragrance belongs in everyone&#x27;s collection</li>
    <li> new fragrance used. brought as gift.</li>
    <li> I was drawn to buy this perfume because of all the good reviews all over the web. In my humble opinion I think this smells really DARK and DIFFERENT so if you get it make sure you only spray once because it&#x27;s really powerful to the point where you can get a headache anyways moral of the story is that it&#x27;s hard to buy fragrances online because you don&#x27;t know what they smell like. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I like this fragrance to wear for a night out dark but definitely not my main fragrance too powerful.</li>
    <li> Took me a few days to like it, but it definitely grew on me, and now I love it! Smells unique, dark and mysterious. Not for everyone though.</li>
    <li> This cologne causes me to want to curl up against my boyfriend, with my nose near his neck, and just... relax. This cologne is not bright or playful, it is dark and quiet, kind of mysterious.</li>
    <li> It has a great scent. It was a good price. I will definately purchase it again when this runs out.</li>
    <li> Its works for the me.  The  smell is amazing, long lasting, and it does not over power, but compliments. Get it while you can.</li>
    <li> This has become my signature EDT, great for night life guys! Every body is asking for the name, and it&#x27;s sound weird saying this in english to my spanish co workers. this perfume fits me well as black is my fetish color.</li>
    <li> ***** I&#x27;ve since change my review to a 5/5. The bottle is authentic. I&#x27;m still puzzled as to why I couldn&#x27;t smell anything the first few times I tried this cologne. But the smell has slowly intensified for me since and it&#x27;s a fantastic scent. My original review is below incase anyone encounters the same problem.*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are almost universally positive reviews of this cologne on amazon, fragrantica, bassnotes, youtube etc. I feel disappointed giving Encre Noire only 3/5 stars after hearing the word masterpiece used so often in regards to this fragrance. I could not wait to smell this cologne and when it arrived in the mail (fairly quickly) I tore open the package and gave it a few sprays... nothing. I smelled absolutely nothing. I had to have given the fragrance about 10-15 tries but could not for the life of me smell hardly anything except the usual alcohol opening of any fragrance. I was positive it wasn&#x27;t a fake, though. The fantastic box was authentic, sealed, no signs of tampering whatsoever same with the bottle. However, and please notify me if anyone else finds this on their bottle, the sticker on the bottom had a small portion of it cut out. If this is where the serial number is supposed to be placed somebody tell me. I was thoroughly disappointed at the thought of my bottle possibly being a fake. You cannot return bottles of cologne to amazon because they are considered hazardous. The next day however, I gave it another try. I gave it a spray and to my astonishment a scent had somehow materialized. How it did is a mystery to me but astonishment aside, what did it smell like. A very modern, bold, one dimensional (not in a bad way) scent. Not as dark as I was led to believe. I get a bright, GREEN scent accented with the black ink notes and smokiness. Do I like how it smells? Yes. Am I certain that I have an authentic bottle? I am not sure. Am I just glad it turned out to not be a total waste of money? Most likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seemingly niche quality scent but authenticity is dubious</li>
    <li> Great scent but a bit overwhelming at first. Put it on at least one hour before venturing into the human realm.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. If you love Vetiver this scent might be for you. I say might because don&#x27;t think this is some fresh, soapy Vetiver like most that are on the market. This is dark, hard, woody, strong, and masculine. Encre Noire translates into Black Ink and that name is spot on. On the initial spray the Vetiver is so strong the cologne has an inky scent to it. This initial blast of ink only lasts about 5-10 minutes however, as the scent dries down the Vetiver becomes more earthy and you start to pick up this slightly burnt wood scent. The dry down on this is hands down one of the best I&#x27;ve ever smelt. It does take a certain kind of man to be able to wear this cologne however. You have to be able to match its intense, strong, masculine scent. This instantly became one of my wife&#x27;s favorite scents. She loves Vetiver and her favorite cologne on me ever was Creed&#x27;s Original Vetiver. When she smelled this one on me she said she would put it tied with Original Vetiver. Not because they smell the same (they don&#x27;t) but because this Cologne is just awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The projection is out of this world. After spraying it (2-3 sprays) on my wife can be over 10 ft away in a different room and still smell it. It fills the air. Her immediate response when she smelled it in the room, not knowing what I had put on, was &amp;#34;Something smells REALLY good.&amp;#34; After I told her what it was she said, &amp;#34;You bought this one right? It smells amazing.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity is also a beast. I can wear in the evening, go to bed, and still smell it the next day. We timed it on my skin and could still pick it up over 18 hours later. This is a cologne where you do not want to over spray. 2-3 max will give you everything you could possibly need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything about this cologne just screams &amp;#34;niche&amp;#34;. This isn&#x27;t a department store fragrance made to appeal to the masses. The bottle, the quality of the ingredients, the smell. If I handed you this cologne you would assume it&#x27;s some ultra high end brand. The fact that you can get it for around $30 is insane. This cologne isn&#x27;t for everyone, it isn&#x27;t for the office, it isn&#x27;t for a summer day out. This is an evening out or suit &amp; tie fragrance. This is a fall/winter fragrance. This could be someone&#x27;s signature scent. For all the things this cologne isn&#x27;t, what it does do, it does to perfection. I will always own a bottle of this cologne from now on.</li>
    <li> Outstanding cologne.  The best hidden secret around.  I get tons of compliments and the bottle lasts forever.  Great value and terrific smell.  A win win.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always found that Lalique fragrances rely on a beautiful bottle and a name to plead their case.  This is one of the uglier bottles, and one of their better fragrances.  The scent is polished and sophisticated, without trace of &amp;#34;sporty&amp;#34; scent.  It identifies as male, but there&#x27;s no lumberjack in this bottle.  It&#x27;s an all-around pleasant scent that, under it all, has a faint trace of the old ditto machines from long ago--black ink.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this scent. Found it via the &amp;#34;uncrate&amp;#34; app on iPhone and it&#x27;s been great. Reasonable price and deep dark woodsy rich notes. Stays on for a while. Get lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Fragrances and &amp;#34;smells&amp;#34; are quite a personal subject.  I was looking for a woody and dark mens fragrance and stumbled on to this and I have to say it tops my list of EDT&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear this so others smell it, I wear it so that I can smell it.  Hopefully this paints a clear picture of how much I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> Not a scent for the drone metro, but rather for the strong, independent, \\&quot;John Galt\\&quot; type.  Not a safe blind buy unless you are that type of person, or at least love the smell of Vetiver.  If you own Aqua di Gio and consider it your \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot; because all your friends have it, it may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Encre Noir inspires mental images of a burned mine tunnel with roots dripping water coming from the ceiling and walls. The mine is warm, not cold, and humid. As you wander the mine, candle in hand dripping wax, you find an old cedar box, and open it.  Inside the box is an old book, which upon opening you smell the faint scent of old paper, and surprisingly the sweet smell of fresh ink.  The book is written in an ancient language, and you are intrigued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colors expressed: Black and brown  Emotions: Lovecraftian, Nature.&lt;br /&gt;Best owner: Confident man, even more confident woman, or Goth.&lt;br /&gt;Time and Place: For a scant few, anytime.  For others, Night, Winter, and Fall.  Or for the confident business man/woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really a cologne for the faint of heart, but an personal experience.</li>
    <li> I liked this - but its very very heavy for my taste, I might be willing to try the sports version....which I am guessing is a little lighter...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit it, Robes08 sold me on this and the high marks on fragrantica. If you&#x27;re a newbie on your fragrance journey, you might want to steer clear of this, mark my words. Of course, if you&#x27;re daring then go ahead. Personally, I think it will grow on me. I like it, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it sure won&#x27;t be daily wear. The box and bottle are beautiful. Nice details all around *wooden cap, solid black glass bottle, nicely detailed box*.</li>
    <li> Blind bought this after reading positive reviews on basenotes and fragrantica. Smells fresh, masculine, woody and mysterious. Definately a chick magnet and easy for me to pull off. (I&#x27;m 21 btw) I had read this is a hate or love scent but everyone who has smelled it on me absolutely loves it and the girls find it particularly sexy. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome fragrance, and I am happy is kind of exclusive since not many people get to know this brand. But high end product, and has to be on a cologne connoisseur collector.</li>
    <li> GREAT SMELL, IM VERY PLEASED&lt;br /&gt;I GOT MORE THAN WHAT I PAID FOR. YOU SHOULD TRY IT.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what Bobby Flay says to people who don&#x27;t like cilantro. Inhaling this the first time felt and smelled like dust and ink. The dry down took the edge off. The more I come back to this the more I like it. It is clearly masculine. It lasts 8+ hours. I find the scent pleasantly curious. It inspires a nostalgic and exotic feeling. I feel this is a mature, formal, and unique masculine scent. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was a great price and my father uses it daily. He has not had one problem with it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Unique and sophisticated. The women are going crazy for me now! I feel like James bond or a more worldly Brett Michaels.</li>
    <li> this is the best one . my cousin had so i took the info and bought it. everywhere is 90$ but here was cheap and I&#x27;m wondering why? it has same smells with original quality. thanks Amazon. Also don&#x27;t forget that all women like it.</li>
    <li> I took up the bottle, asking what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The inky abyss of a midnight-lacquered cigar box,\\&quot; it said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Whoa,\\&quot; I said.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m into fragrances with that said, when I saw the price for this fragrance I knew I had to get it. This fragrance is dark and mysterious to me, which I like. Enre Noire isn&#x27;t for everyone this is truly an acquired taste.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent for a great value, that can stand with some of its higher end counterparts! You do not have to spend a lot to smell expensive!</li>
    <li> My only complaint is the fancy bottle is so heavy and dark that you can&#x27;t really tell when you&#x27;re about to run out. Smells like incense and something dark and bitter but somehow sweet. Definitely a try before you buy.</li>
    <li> Nice foil to my sweeter frags. When I get tired of those I find I enjoy this more. I really enjoy the green cypress and the soft vetiver on this one. Love it!</li>
    <li> Fabolous Gem! A very Wonderful and Unique Fragrance! You must add this to the collection!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite scent on a man!  Hard to find.</li>
    <li> Smokey and long lasting. Sure not for everyone but nothing is.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, a good noire scent, this is an essential must-have if that is what you like.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Actually just now picked up Cartier&#x27;s Declaration, surprisingly similar to this but that one is brighter, more complex, and almost berries there compared to this.&lt;br /&gt;Do believe I prefer that to this now. This Encre Noire is quite heavy on the straight ahead smokier/noire associated scent.</li>
    <li> hahahaha! thats what am talking about. this is simply a masterpiece. i love this till death. aint nothing woody better than this. i have kenzo homme woody and its a piece of crap compared to this. thumbs up lalique</li>
