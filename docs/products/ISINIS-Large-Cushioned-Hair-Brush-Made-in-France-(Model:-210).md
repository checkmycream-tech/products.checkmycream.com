      <li>Good grip.</li>

      <li>(I&#x27;m guessing my kids have them, which is ok and understandable, as they grew up on them, too ! )  </li>
      <li>It was pretty unanimous that boar bristle was the best.</li>

      <li>We just love these brushes!  </li>
      <li>quality is top notch!</li>
      <li>I love this brush!</li>
      <li>I love Amazon reviews!  </li>
      <li>I received in perfect conditions and it was the the exact that I wanted to have.</li>
      <li>I used these years ago and was happy to see they are now available again.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a brush that compares to the no longer manufactured Jean Pierre I used to own.</li>
      <li>Nice brush.</li>
      <li>Nice brush,although not made like 25 years ago.</li>
      <li>I find this is the best way to verify your purchase will be appreciated.</li>
      <li>Thank you Amazon one more time for coming through for us, we are very pleased with the brush</li>
      <li>Love this brush more than any ever!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this kind for many years</li>
      <li>Love it, Love it, Love it!</li>
      <li>Absolutely loved my first three!</li>
      <li>Love love love this brush</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I have searched Beauty Supply since that time and have never been able to find them.    </li>
      <li>I scratched her name on it, as I am sure it will get lost at some point.</li>
      <li>Quality product was still in perfect condition many years later.  </li>
      <li>and I love the price.  </li>
      <li>but the bristles were shortened but again still worked better than anything we have at home.</li>
      <li>The bristles are plastic and they cause static cling in your hair.</li>
      <li>and I am really glad that I did.</li>
      <li>It has always been my favorite brush.</li>
      <li>I love ISINIS hairbrushes and have used them for years</li>
      <li>I foolishly believed the hype about the anti-static properties of this brush as I ignored the fact that rubbing two insulators together creates static elecricity unless one is connected to a grounding strap.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m buying two more of these and never switching again.</li>
      <li>, What more could you ask for.</li>
      <li>Love the brush.  </li>
      <li>(it really is that great).  </li>
      <li>I would choose this over the Mason Pearson even if I had to pay more for it, which thankfully, I don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>My kids love it, too.</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>Love this brush.  </li>
      <li>I love this brush...</li>
      <li>OMG I like it so much better than the brand</li>
      <li>I have had this brush now for a couple of weeks and find that it is a pretty good comparison with the Jean Pierre that I have been using for years.</li>
      <li>I use it every day on my long hair and its wonderful.</li>
      <li>It gives a thorough brushing from the top to the bottom of my longish hair and leaves it fuller and easy to style.</li>
      <li>I hope I will be able to fine it again when the one I have wears out.</li>
      <li>The beauty-store premium ionized brush and the drugstore similar-looking brush didn&#x27;t grab or go through my hair as gently or easily.</li>
      <li>I like the handle also as it is easy to grip.</li>
      <li>If you are quick to say ouch when brushing, this is the brush for you!  </li>
      <li>I basically received a cheap all-black plastic brush.</li>
      <li>This brush is comfortable to use and does not pull out or break my hair.</li>
      <li>Is gentle but effective.</li>
      <li>I have been using these brushes for over 20 years and they always make my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>I was excited to find this hairbrush being offered and it did NOT disappoint.</li>
      <li>Great for long hair.</li>
      <li>It feels great on the scalp and It can even get tangles out with ease after a long day at the beach</li>
      <li>Luckily it was still available for replacement purposes.  </li>
      <li>NOT, there is such a difference when you get a really good one.  </li>
      <li>I have not found a brush anywhere at a salon or drug store which is as good for this type of hair - boar bristle does not penetrate to the scalp in the same way.  </li>
      <li>The reviews were good enough to get me to order it.</li>
      <li>I returned it quickly.</li>
      <li>and it arrived quickly</li>
      <li>This is the third hairbrush that I have ordered in my quest for the perfect brush, and I finally found it.  </li>
      <li>This brush is definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the cost.</li>
      <li>My daughter now has a girl of her own with long hair.</li>
      <li>The larger size is really great for people with long hair.</li>
      <li>one for upstairs, another for my purse, and the first one for the bathroom.  </li>
      <li>I like this brush so much that I ordered two more last night--</li>
      <li>My husband and I have used this brand of brush for several years and we were very upset to find that our local beauty supply store didn&#x27;t carry it anymore, so we were delighted find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I thought no big deal, I&#x27;ll try a new one, maybe I&#x27;ll like it even better.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t feel as great on my hair and head; it also looked different in that it had a mix of black and tan bristles.  </li>
      <li>- I think it was a gift from my mom, who loves hers (and has short, fine hair).</li>
      <li>I like it so much</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i know it sounds crazy, it&#x27;s just a brusn, right?  NOT, there is such a difference when you get a really good one.  i would recomend highly.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush now for a couple of weeks and find that it is a pretty good comparison with the Jean Pierre that I have been using for years. I hope it holds up as well. I like the handle also as it is easy to grip.</li>
    <li> Thick long hair or short hair just love this brush!  If you are quick to say ouch when brushing, this is the brush for you!  I have used one  (on my 4th in 30+ years). They hold up well.  I just love it!  Purse sized brush is great too.</li>
    <li> My grandmother had an Isinis until the day she died.  I bought mine 30 years ago.  And I could never find another one because the store that sold then went out of business.  I tried ten years ago on the internet and all I found was the French web page...in French.  This is the best brush I have ever used...so I&#x27;m getting two.  All of my other brushes are going to brush heaven.</li>
    <li> Nice brush. I have only used it for a few weeks. But my Mason Pearson is half dead after only three years of use, so I thought I would try a different brand to see how it does. No complaints so far.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this brush for my yorkie.  She has hated every brush I had before this.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt her skin, nor pull her hair out.  I like it so much, I need one for myself now.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hairbrush!!  Had a hard time finding it where I live.  Very pleased with the hairbrush and seller.  Would definitely buy from again and again!!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews about this brush, and I thought it would be the greatest thing ever. It was not. If you like having your scalp destroyed by bristles that don&#x27;t have any little balls on the end, then this is the brush for you. I foolishly believed the hype about the anti-static properties of this brush as I ignored the fact that rubbing two insulators together creates static elecricity unless one is connected to a grounding strap. All joking aside, this brush is not worth $22, and I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I have long fine hair. This brush is comfortable to use and does not pull out or break my hair. I got one for my Mom also.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these brushes for 20 years.  I finally got tired of my daughters borrowing it so I ordered one for each of them.  It gets out the tangles without all fo the drama.</li>
    <li> I used Isinis brushes through high school and college until the handle broke off the last one I owned.   I have searched Beauty Supply since that time and have never been able to find them.    Finding them on Amazon was wonderful.   I hate ball tipped bristles,   my hair breaks off and tangles with them.    The Isinis brush is back,   I am going to buy quite a few of them for the future.</li>
    <li> I had three of these brushes for over 30 years and loved them all!  One I literally wore out as the black base cracked after hitting the floor one too many times; I duct taped it and got a few more years out of it!  My other two kept turning up missing.  (I&#x27;m guessing my kids have them, which is ok and understandable, as they grew up on them, too ! )  So a few years ago I got a new one on Amazon.  I was disappointed with it, though.  It didn&#x27;t feel as great on my hair and head; it also looked different in that it had a mix of black and tan bristles.  My other three only had black bristles.  I&#x27;m guessing that maybe the first three were all nylon bristles, and perhaps this new one has a mix of nylon and boar.  Does anyone know?  I never even knew about the ball tipped vs. regular tips, so I&#x27;m not sure what I had before in that regard.  I know it didn&#x27;t have actual little balls on the tips, and they looked like the brushes in the pictures.  So when it says ball tipped, does that just mean that the nylon bristle ends are slightly rounded rather than \\&quot;blunt\\&quot; cut?  Wish I knew what my first three were, because buying the wrong one is an expensive mistake.  I also wish I could find a site that describes all the different Isinis brushes.  Absolutely loved my first three!</li>
    <li> As described would do business again, super-fast shipping, &amp; great price!</li>
    <li> Jean Pierre used to be the best hair brush company.  DO NOT TRUST THEM ANYMORE!!  My family has used Jean Pierre brushes for years, and we loved them.  They were purchased a few years ago by a new company and fired most of  the old employees.  It&#x27;s another case of a lousy company buying a great company for the name to sell worthless garbage under a quality name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The employees of the old company work here.  In other words, quality people making a quality product.</li>
    <li> I used these years ago and was happy to see they are now available again. I ordered both the ball tipped and non ball tipped and our family preferred the non-ball tipped style best.  The larger size is really great for people with long hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush after searching online for the best brush for your hair. It was pretty unanimous that boar bristle was the best. I have slightly wavy hair that tends to frizz when I brush it. I love my subtle waves but can&#x27;t just not brush my hair. This brush leaves my hair soft and shiny every time. My kids love it, too. My oldest daughter has a very sensitive scalp and we no longer have morning problems when it comes to brushing her hair. This brush does not hurt her head!</li>
    <li> Have used Isinis brushes for 20 years.  This is the first one that has ever arrived without all the bristles, however, there are enough remaining to keep the brush and not hassle with returning.</li>
    <li> After you have used this brush, no other brush can campare to the quality.  Don&#x27;t buy a cheap knock-up imitation.  Spoil yourself on this beauty product, for it can last 30 years.</li>
    <li> At much less the cost.  I would definitely recommend - I have long thin fine hair and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife based on recommendations from women on Amazon. I find this is the best way to verify your purchase will be appreciated. For it&#x27;s price I was a little disappointed. The packaging was shrink wrap, no info concerning it all , not even a cardboard back. And the big one, missing bristles out of a new brush,</li>
    <li> Nice brush,although not made like 25 years ago. Good grip. This brush has always been a good stimulator for my hair. Gave one for a present at Christmas. Also the price has certainly come down.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes for over 20 years and they always make my hair smooth and shiny.  I have wanted to switch to Mason Pearson with a mix of Boar Bristles and synthetic nylon but am afraid I wont like it as much as this one (it really is that great).  I love this brush!</li>
    <li> Love the brush.  Have looked for a replacement for several years. Going to buy backups.</li>
    <li> I have been buying ISINIS brushes for over 20 years, and now my daughters both have to have them as well. We absolutely won&#x27;t use any other hairbrush. Great for long hair. Sturdy, perfect size. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Gotta say this was a great buy.  I have looked for this type of brush everywhere and could find one until now</li>
    <li> I received in perfect conditions and it was the the exact that I wanted to have. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for thirty years.  They last forever, but I left my previous Isinis in a hotel room!  Amazon got the new one to me in short order.  All is well.  Would never use anything else.  Quality product.</li>
    <li> Love love love this brush I&#x27;ve used this kind for many years</li>
    <li> Love this brush more than any ever!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful brush!  It gives a thorough brushing from the top to the bottom of my longish hair and leaves it fuller and easy to style. And it feels so good against my scalp.  Definitely worth the cost.</li>
    <li> These hair brushes were the rage when I was in junior high.  I have had one since then.  It is a great brush and lasts forever.  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  Bought one for me and one for my wife.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used this brand of brush for several years and we were very upset to find that our local beauty supply store didn&#x27;t carry it anymore, so we were delighted find it on Amazon.  Thank you Amazon one more time for coming through for us, we are very pleased with the brush and it arrived quickly, What more could you ask for. (we like this size for my husband and the smaller size for me)</li>
    <li> We just love these brushes!  They have been great for my daughters hair.  We have actually bought three of them so we will always have one handy!  I really like how they do not have little balls at the end of the bristles to pull on hair.</li>
    <li> I have used the ISINIS hairbrush for years and have it to be the only hairbrush to have for fine thin hair. Works beautifully.</li>
    <li> This is the s***est brush ever made! The plastic is cheap, the seam is sharp and scraped my finger. The bristles are plastic and they cause static cling in your hair. The rubber stinks. The whole hair brush is a s***y piece of crap. DONT BUY IT!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser told me about this brush. It feels great on the scalp and It can even get tangles out with ease after a long day at the beach</li>
    <li> Love it. Now I have two.</li>
    <li> Was on amazon looking for a good brush and was about to settle for another one when I read the review on this brush.  It sounded like what I was looking for and I ordered one.  It arrived yesterday.  It is THE brush I have been waiting for; I have thick, coarse, curly hair and a normal brush just will not go through it.  This brush does.  It is the first brush that has ever gone all the way through my hair except for those awful plastic ones with the little knobs on the end.  I like this brush so much that I ordered two more last night--one for upstairs, another for my purse, and the first one for the bathroom.  This brush is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Would definitely order again.  Tried finding just the right brush, not too soft and not too hard -  This is the third hairbrush that I have ordered in my quest for the perfect brush, and I finally found it.  Wil definitely buy again.  More expensive that the others but if you are looking for a brush that you will not regret buying then this is the one.  Love it, Love it, Love it!</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this brush. It is stiff enough to go through thick hair, yet pliable enough, it doesn&#x27;t scratch your scalp. It gets even better after using it for a few months.</li>
    <li> The Best hair brush on the market, bar none. &lt;br /&gt;Even the owner of the hair salon I go to  &lt;br /&gt;recommends it.</li>
    <li> I was excited to find this hairbrush being offered and it did NOT disappoint. I use it every day on my long hair and its wonderful.</li>
    <li> Being that the description of this product is really vague, I had no idea what I was going to get. The reviews were good enough to get me to order it. I basically received a cheap all-black plastic brush. It was hard to believe how cheap it looked. It wasn&#x27;t cushioned and it didn&#x27;t look like it was made in France. There weren&#x27;t any logos or words printed on the brush handle. The bristles were nylon. It wasn&#x27;t ball-tipped and there was no boar hair at all. I returned it quickly. Don&#x27;t buy if you&#x27;re looking for a boar bristle brush.</li>
    <li> The ISINIS brush that I was replacing was a larger size.  I love ISINIS hairbrushes and have used them for years - don&#x27;t recall if the description listed the actual size in inches - I just read &#x27;large&#x27; and assumed it was the same as the large ISINIS brush that I was replacing.  So I wish it was a little larger, but I do recommend ISINIS burshes.</li>
    <li> We had one but it was 20 years old and the back cracked. We were still using it but the bristles were shortened but again still worked better than anything we have at home.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush because I had owned one for over 25 years before the bristles started to fall out.  I love this brush...quality is top notch!</li>
    <li> Best brush ever. I have used this brand for over 30 years.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how bad other brushes were till I lost my ancient Isinis -- which still looked pretty much new (I&#x27;m not hard on my belongings). I thought no big deal, I&#x27;ll try a new one, maybe I&#x27;ll like it even better. No. Tried a couple that look similar to this brush and they were awful. This Isinis, I can pull through my very thick hair with an easy curving motion that helps the ends curl under. The beauty-store premium ionized brush and the drugstore similar-looking brush didn&#x27;t grab or go through my hair as gently or easily. I swear, I didn&#x27;t think there&#x27;d be much difference but I&#x27;m buying two more of these and never switching again. Didn&#x27;t even know it was French - I think it was a gift from my mom, who loves hers (and has short, fine hair).</li>
    <li> I bought one of these brushes when my kids were little. It has always been my favorite brush. It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair like a lot of brushes will.  I scratched my name on the brush and I am really glad that I did. Twice my daughters borrowed the brush and took it to their friend&#x27;s houses. The only reason I got it back was because I had my name on it. My daughter now has a girl of her own with long hair. I purchased another brush for my daughter. I scratched her name on it, as I am sure it will get lost at some point. Believe me, you will be really upset if you lose this brush. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great brush. have bought several. works well on both Men and women</li>
    <li> I found this brush by reading Amazon reviews on another brand I was going to buy. I love Amazon reviews!  I was ready to spend the bucks to buy my 3rd Mason Pearson brush (I lost one, wore one out) and one of the reviewers mentioned this brand so I ordered it. OMG I like it so much better than the brand I just mentioned and I love the price.  I have shoulder length, thick, fine textured hair and this brush seems to give my hair body. It does distribute the oil through to the ends and make it shine and I use it for styling.  I just ordered a small size to carry in my purse. I would choose this over the Mason Pearson even if I had to pay more for it, which thankfully, I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because it was recommended as a replacement for the Jean-Pierre  model from France.  The latter is the best brush we have found for our thick, wavy long hair, but the manufacturer went out of business.  I have not found a brush anywhere at a salon or drug store which is as good for this type of hair - boar bristle does not penetrate to the scalp in the same way.  This brush, also from France,  is comparable.  Hopefully it will hold up as well as the other one!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush years ago at a retail store.  I have long hair and it brushes so well without tearing up your hair.  When the one I had wore out, I finally found it on line and ordered it.  It was the exact same quality as the one I bought years ago.  I have tried other brushes and I always come back to this one.  I hope I will be able to fine it again when the one I have wears out.</li>
    <li> I was given this brush by my mother about 15 years ago and was devastated when I lost it.  Luckily it was still available for replacement purposes.  Quality product was still in perfect condition many years later.  Is gentle but effective.</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of using plastic vent brushes, I thought I deserved an upgrade. This brush wasn&#x27;t quite what I anticipated. My hair was left a static-y mess, rather than smooth. I&#x27;m still using the brush, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a brush that compares to the no longer manufactured Jean Pierre I used to own. Sadly, this is not it.</li>
