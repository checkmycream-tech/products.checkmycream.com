### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This primer is very good.</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>Go buy the good stuff.</li>
      <li>, i just say i like they are so good</li>
      <li>Its great quality, shipped fast with very great care, and it has a safety spill lid</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with this product as I have been doing my nails myself</li>
      <li>Returned this primer and bought a better brand name and my nail sets stay on for weeks now!</li>
      <li>Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
      <li>this product is nicely priced and came not damaged.</li>
      <li>love doing my own acrylic nail work, cheaper.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>will have to buy more</li>
      <li>Most primers that I used did not work well with gels.  </li>
      <li>I did not give it 5 stars because I&#x27;m waiting to find out if there is anything even better.  </li>
      <li>great product fast delivery.thanx</li>
      <li>Yeah, its cheap, and for a person whos still an amateur at this, I realized cheap isnt always good when you want to have nice nails.</li>
      <li>the smell is not super strong which is great for do-it-at home nails.</li>
      <li>I love the tip of the brush because it makes it easy to cover the natural nail.</li>
      <li>Used this primer for first couple sets of nails I did and the nails popped off in 2 days!</li>
      <li>Gel nails hold better without lifting as quickly like when we don&#x27;t use the natural nail primer.</li>
      <li>so the acrylic would bond better to the natural nail</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;d be lifting almost right away at times.</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time, applied product to my nails then continued with nail adhesive.</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time tonight.</li>
      <li>Luckily, that friend who does nails is a damn life saver, and is giving me 2 new primers and dehydrators.</li>
      <li>My nails looked fine for 2 days, then my first nail fell off and a day later another.</li>
      <li>I was a begginer whith the whole acrylic nails procedure, but I like to do things by the book, so when I was told I had to buy a primer</li>
      <li>I dont really see any difference in the way acrylic bonds with the nail with or without the primer.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I was highly allergic to this product</li>
      <li>The texture is very light, not too messy and</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice lifting for days with this stuff, and that&#x27;s only if the nails been pretty stressed anyhow.</li>
      <li>and I like the product so far.</li>
      <li>I recently just did my nails, and not even 24 hours later, they ALL fell right off.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it is just due mostly to the nail dehydrator I was also new to using, but previously I had mistakenly not used any primer etc.</li>
      <li>Works as it should my nails no longer pop off due to being in so much water all the time.  </li>

<li> Not much of these products because I&#x27;m experimenting in this field and have used it only to learn</li>
<li> The difference between when this has been used before applying acrylics as opposed to when it hasn&#x27;t been is quite noticeable - acrylics stay on a lot longer and seem noticeably less flimsy.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> My nails LIFT after a few HOURS.</li>
<li> In fact, I wanted a video on primers and the person who was doing the video had this stuff, and she said it was hands down the most awful primer to buy.</li>
<li> As with any artificial nail application, the nail has to be prepped first--cleansing, dehydration--before the primer is used.  </li>
<li> CRAP.</li>
<li> This stuff is terrible.</li>

    <li> Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
    <li> It works.  Gel nails hold better without lifting as quickly like when we don&#x27;t use the natural nail primer.</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time, applied product to my nails then continued with nail adhesive. My nails looked fine for 2 days, then my first nail fell off and a day later another. I don&#x27;t feel this product helps</li>
    <li> Works. Like the brush.</li>
    <li> This product worked well.  I found that my gel lasted longer--over 6 weeks--without lifting.  As with any artificial nail application, the nail has to be prepped first--cleansing, dehydration--before the primer is used.  Most primers that I used did not work well with gels.  I did not give it 5 stars because I&#x27;m waiting to find out if there is anything even better.  I would purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> great product fast delivery.thanx</li>
    <li> Works as it should my nails no longer pop off due to being in so much water all the time.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I have only used this once and I like the product so far.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Didn&#x27;t really help. You do not need to &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; your nails. Didn&#x27;t make the gel last longer.</li>
    <li> I used the ibd acrylic, ibd, líquid acrylic And  i have every produc from ibd, i just say i like they are so good</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time tonight. I&#x27;ll bring all of you up to speed in a week or two.</li>
    <li> Works just as it says it does. The difference between when this has been used before applying acrylics as opposed to when it hasn&#x27;t been is quite noticeable - acrylics stay on a lot longer and seem noticeably less flimsy. Perhaps it is just due mostly to the nail dehydrator I was also new to using, but previously I had mistakenly not used any primer etc. before doing my nails and they&#x27;d be lifting almost right away at times. I don&#x27;t notice lifting for days with this stuff, and that&#x27;s only if the nails been pretty stressed anyhow. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Thanks. It arrived in the time anticipated. Was packaged well and product appears to be as rated. I recommend.</li>
    <li> This primer is very good. It was recommended to me by a lady at the nail salon. The texture is very light, not too messy and the smell is not super strong which is great for do-it-at home nails. Lastly the price is considerably low compared to other brands like CND.</li>
    <li> Used this primer for first couple sets of nails I did and the nails popped off in 2 days! I thought it was my prep, but I was doing everything by the books. Returned this primer and bought a better brand name and my nail sets stay on for weeks now! DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> ive been using this for over 3 months and i still have it. it works and adhere the acrylic well</li>
    <li> I love the tip of the brush because it makes it easy to cover the natural nail. Its great quality, shipped fast with very great care, and it has a safety spill lid</li>
    <li> love doing my own acrylic nail work, cheaper. this product is nicely priced and came not damaged. will have to buy more</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought. Nails came off after 2 days or so. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. I even put on extra coats so they wouldn&#x27;t lift.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible. I&#x27;ve used it numerous times, thinking maybe its just me. And no. its not. I&#x27;ve watched tons of how-to videos, asked a friend who does nails, and my prep work is on spot. BESIDES this crappy primer. My nails LIFT after a few HOURS. YES HOURS. I recently just did my nails, and not even 24 hours later, they ALL fell right off. Luckily, that friend who does nails is a damn life saver, and is giving me 2 new primers and dehydrators. Girls, guys, whoever, DONT. BUY. THIS. CRAP. Yeah, its cheap, and for a person whos still an amateur at this, I realized cheap isnt always good when you want to have nice nails. I have never seen any nail salons with this stuff being used. In fact, I wanted a video on primers and the person who was doing the video had this stuff, and she said it was hands down the most awful primer to buy. SO yeah, avoid this at all cost okay. Dont be a cheap-ass. Go buy the good stuff.</li>
    <li> I was highly allergic to this product</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product as I have been doing my nails myself and I use the entire gel polish routine and it last up to 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Betty DeMarco&lt;br /&gt;badm38@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> I was a begginer whith the whole acrylic nails procedure, but I like to do things by the book, so when I was told I had to buy a primer so the acrylic would bond better to the natural nail I inmediately ordered it, and I have to say, I dont really see any difference in the way acrylic bonds with the nail with or without the primer. Maybe it&#x27;s me, but I&#x27;m not a beginner anymore.</li>
    <li> Not much of these products because I&#x27;m experimenting in this field and have used it only to learn but I think it&#x27;s good</li>
