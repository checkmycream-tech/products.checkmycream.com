    <li> I use make up in a bottle all the time, I really like it because there is no shine after you apply it. I told my sister about it and she loves it also.</li>
    <li> Really helps my eyebrows last! Like that it comes with two applicators.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me as some people indicated. My issue is that have an oily T-Zone and after a while it does wear off but, on cool dry days, it lasts all night. Also, when I wear my hair in my face, typically, my eyebrows rub off quickly but, Model In A Bottle helps to make them last longer. I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it though. It beats NOT using it for me.</li>
    <li> Great product. Last all day</li>
    <li> I recommend this product, eyebrows last all day!</li>

    <li> This stuff is great.  My eyebrow pencil always gets rubbed off and then I have &amp;#34;no show&amp;#34; eyebrows.  This really, really does keep the pencil on - stays all day.  I love it.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years and feel it is the best on the market!</li>
    <li> I use a brow pencil and it keeps my brows from smudging, even after an all-nighter my brows are still good the next morning.</li>
    <li> I definitely does what it says it will do however if you look really closely you can se a little hint of the crystallization of the liquid after it dry’s. so don&#x27;t apply to much just a bit and you are good to go.</li>
    <li> Works great, keeps my eyebrows in place all day and not super heavy gives them a nice subtle shine too which I like</li>
