### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>An excellent shaver:  holds a charge for 50 minutes according to the manual, but I wondered if it would ever run out.  </li>
      <li>As advertised, excellent product!</li>
      <li>Provides me with a great shave!</li>
      <li>Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>so it was a great buy!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not too impressed.</li>
      <li>What a great product.</li>
      <li>it does a great job at trimming.</li>
      <li>This razor worked great for about 1.5 years,</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Still cuts great.  </li>
      <li>Great shaver.</li>
      <li>i love it!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors for many years, and this one provides one of the best shaves yet.  </li>
      <li>The one bright spot is the trim attachment.</li>
      <li>The lighter weight and fit in the hand makes this the perfect tool.</li>
      <li>Comparing to the price, it is good.</li>
      <li>This razor just doing a fair job.</li>
      <li>So I opted to try this one and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Good notification lights for low-battery, charging, etc.  </li>
      <li>Outstanding shave, makes even me look good!</li>
      <li>I am enjoying this shaver!</li>
      <li>If you are seeking something that both easy for shaving and doing a great job, I will not recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled.</li>
      <li>Get one and give it a fair chance and you will love it also.</li>
      <li>Nice close shave.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had Norelco electric razors before and have liked them.</li>
      <li>While it does provide a nice shave, it doesn&#x27;t provide a nice experience.</li>
      <li>to use \\&quot;wet\\&quot; with shaving cream is nice.  </li>
      <li>Nice razor, close shave.</li>
      <li>This shaver works GREAT if you run out of razors or you just want a good quickie shave, it charges fast too.</li>
      <li>I get the best results using Barbasol Sensitive Skin shaving cream with it, making sure to soak the heads in cleaning solution after words.</li>
      <li>when major changes in the design of the Shaver have been introduced, I impressed with the improved performance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>ok it is made of like toy plastic very cheaply made and should be upgraded as well.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying it more each time I use it.    </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t be better.  </li>
      <li>for people wanting a better and faster shave a 3d would be ur</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend more then</li>
      <li>Also it nicks me more than an electric shaver should.</li>
      <li>and they keep getting better.  </li>
      <li>but i love the experience</li>
      <li>The razor works great, better than my old one.</li>
      <li>Found this 1160X at Costco at a great price and so far I love it.   </li>
      <li>And lastly, the head doesn&#x27;t do a very good job sealing away the trimmed hairs.</li>
      <li>I wish there was a larger case that would hold the spare heads, you can cram them into the travel case, but this isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
      <li>Everything Norelco says about this shaver is true!</li>
      <li>It is a well-build razor, but it does feel like it could break easily.  </li>
      <li>Easy once you know how.  </li>
      <li>-Easy</li>
      <li>Works ok - not as good as my old Phillips</li>
      <li>Easy to clean and so easy to use.   </li>
      <li>His beard is light to medium</li>
      <li>: i agree the pouch it comes in is really cheap</li>
      <li>I found it with the lock light permanently on no matter</li>
      <li>Easy to clean</li>
      <li>that makes the razor feel cheap.</li>
      <li>/&gt;+&lt;br /&gt;Easy &amp; comfortable to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>to clean  Cons:  -Feels flimsy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;CLEANING SOLUTION- Jet Clean Solution HQ200&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it in certain places to get most of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>The e-razor does its work just well and each charge is good enough for a week&#x27;s use</li>
      <li>We all know that no electric razor will give as close a shave as a razor does but this Philips model is not bad for 100.00.</li>
      <li>Quick recharge and</li>
      <li>I have been using different brands such as Panasonic and others but I am loyal to Norelco as it is the best, in my opinion!!</li>
      <li>Husband is very satisfied with his Christmas present.</li>
      <li>It is large and seems like it could break easily.  </li>
      <li>It cleans easy and shaves very well.  </li>
      <li>It works better then the previous senso touch that I had, but not as good as the older norelcos that I used in the 90s and 2000s.</li>
      <li>If you want a nice close shave spend the extra money and go with the 2D system, you will not be disapointed!</li>
      <li>My old Norelco worked ok.</li>
      <li>/&gt;PROS: sleek design, water proof, easy to attach detach razor head and trimmer, easy to open close and wash razor head,close shave(its a 2d sensotouch, not 3d</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great razor, but for the cost, I expect a nicer razor case and a little more durability.</li>
      <li>is the first miracle that I would not recommend</li>
      <li>-Included razor pouch/case is cheap and soft, and will not protect razor well.  </li>
      <li>well my first time with it</li>
      <li>This is my first electrical razor after using Gillette razors which always cut me and it hurt like hell.</li>
      <li>Long battery life, pretty easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Shaves fairly well but no better than other Norelco and Remington razors I own that are cheaper.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended and worth the price.</li>
      <li>my entire life was an easy pop off that stayed together</li>
      <li>and it really needs an upgrade, the trimmer though it works</li>
      <li>so it does not require much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nice!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>a couple of times to really get close.  </li>
      <li>we&#x27;re ready again.  </li>
      <li>so he went back to his cord norelco and remington that did a far better job in 10 min.</li>
      <li>a conventional razor shaver,really long lasting battery, love the feel, the charger is nice though i think the stand isnt really needed.</li>
      <li>you could clean it and just put it back on and be on your merry way.</li>
      <li>Did take some head-scratching to figure our how to open and clean the shaver head.</li>
      <li>but it is the model his Dad said he wanted and the price was more than half what it would have been in the store.  </li>
      <li>You would think for no bigger than it is and for the price it would be a lot more quiet.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>doing this keeps the blades fresh and gives you the closest shave possible before you use it again.</li>
      <li>I took my old razor and reshaved the side of my face that I used the new razor on and got a much nicer closer shave.</li>
      <li>Cheaper to just buy a new one.</li>
      <li>you know how much charge you have left in your shaver, so unless you dock your shaver every day, you won&#x27;t know how much charge you have between shaves.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had a much closer shave with the old razor with the old blades.</li>
      <li>In order to push the right buttons to make the razor attachment come off you have to kind of position your hand and fingers in a weird way.  </li>
      <li>replaces my old Norelco razor whose batteries were in need of replacement and needed new shaving heads.  </li>
      <li>as far as the shave</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What a great product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> An excellent shaver:  holds a charge for 50 minutes according to the manual, but I wondered if it would ever run out.  Quick recharge and we&#x27;re ready again.  Good notification lights for low-battery, charging, etc.  Actually was looking for a less expensive shaver, but the Norelco model 7345 had only one notification light--when fully charged.  When it ran out, you were out of luck, especially if in the middle of shave.  So I opted to try this one and loved it.  Bought it here on Amazon and saved over $40 anywhere else, including Norelco&#x27;s web site.</li>
    <li> After many years of wet shaving, I finally went back to electric.    Found this 1160X at Costco at a great price and so far I love it.   It says to give it 21 days for your face to get accustomed to it and using an after shave product I am enjoying it more each time I use it.    Easy to clean and so easy to use.   Close shave and no missed hairs.   Get one and give it a fair chance and you will love it also.</li>
    <li> Shaves fairly well but no better than other Norelco and Remington razors I own that are cheaper. I&#x27;m not too impressed.</li>
    <li> Outstanding shave, makes even me look good!</li>
    <li> This is my first electrical razor after using Gillette razors which always cut me and it hurt like hell. I was reading some of the comments and people are complaining about things that are just small picky things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: sleek design, water proof, easy to attach detach razor head and trimmer, easy to open close and wash razor head,close shave(its a 2d sensotouch, not 3d so some areas might have to be passed several times but i love the experience so i really dont mind), takes less time then a conventional razor shaver,really long lasting battery, love the feel, the charger is nice though i think the stand isnt really needed. basically does the job really good of course its not perfect but 1-10 its 8-8.5 rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: i agree the pouch it comes in is really cheap and it really needs an upgrade, the trimmer though it works ok it is made of like toy plastic very cheaply made and should be upgraded as well. as far as the shave well my first time with it it did pull my hair abit but it didnt hurt like a hand held one and after like 2 shaves the pulling of hair stopped and some areas need a couple of passing by but like i said before idc it feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i do recommend this shaver, for the price and performance its a steal. i love it!! for people wanting a better and faster shave a 3d would be ur pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* i did get mine from kohl&#x27;s for like 80 bucks plus the 20 dollar rebate&#x3D; $60 so it was a great buy!!! and i prefer using foam its smoother and closer!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors for many years, and this one provides one of the best shaves yet.  Pros:  -Long battery life.  I typically shave every other day, so I can go about 2 weeks on a full charge.  -Close shave. This razor provides a close and comfortable shave without having to press down, however, I do feel that I have to go over the same spots a couple of times to really get close.  I have less irritation with this razor than I have had with previous ones.  -Lightweight  -Travel lock  -Option to use \\&quot;wet\\&quot; with shaving cream is nice.  -Easy to clean  Cons:  -Feels flimsy.  It is a well-build razor, but it does feel like it could break easily.  I&#x27;m afraid to drop it or bang it against anything because I&#x27;m afraid it will be damaged beyond repair.    -Taking off and putting on razor head attachment can be difficult.  In order to push the right buttons to make the razor attachment come off you have to kind of position your hand and fingers in a weird way.  It takes some getting used to.  It&#x27;s also tricky to figure out how to align the attachment when putting it back on.  -Charger.  While the battery does last a long time, I find that the charger is difficult to travel with.  It is large and seems like it could break easily.  -Included razor pouch/case is cheap and soft, and will not protect razor well.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great razor, but for the cost, I expect a nicer razor case and a little more durability.</li>
    <li> Replaced a Norelco 8040X battery shaver with a Norelco 1160X battery shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The 8040X gear train got noisy so I decided to replace the shaver instead of buying a replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design:&lt;br /&gt;Water and hair flow through the head and shaver, draining out the bottom of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;This series of shavers all use the same head design.&lt;br /&gt;The head is bulkier than my 8040X, I cannot shave close to my nose. I have to use&lt;br /&gt;  the 8040X with the trimmer attachment to get the hair under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as well as the 8040X. I have to put a lot of pressure on&lt;br /&gt;  it in certain places to get most of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;It has trouble removing hair under my chin.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t shake out the water/hair from the shaver and head before you put it on&lt;br /&gt;  the stand, it will drain through the stand onto your counter.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the trimmer head since I am still using the 8040X with its trimmer&lt;br /&gt;  head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+&lt;br /&gt;Easy &amp; comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Travel lock and travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;Double sided brush for cleaning out the head.&lt;br /&gt;Indicator lights for battery - charge status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;Initial cost.&lt;br /&gt;I have to apply extra pressure to get it to cut smooth.&lt;br /&gt;High cost of replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;Stand does not have a place to store the trimmer head.&lt;br /&gt;Will drain through the stand onto the counter if you don&#x27;t shake it out before putting it on the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing performance from an expensive shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I would have bought another 8040X if they were still being made (only made in 2008,&lt;br /&gt;  don&#x27;t know what service I would get from that old of battery).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice!&lt;br /&gt;I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it  for my father ,he likes it ,and It works well !</li>
    <li> I can go over my face and neck three times with this and there are still stray hairs; doesnt matter the pressure or direction I move it. Also it nicks me more than an electric shaver should. Going to have to toss this and just get a panasonic foil shaver.</li>
    <li> If you are seeking something that both easy for shaving and doing a great job, I will not recommend this product. This razor just doing a fair job. Comparing to the price, it is good. I use the 1160X to do wet shiving, it wonld not hurt my skin, but the job is not as clear as Gillette shaver. I would say, if you are looking for a electric razor which you could take it to travel and you do not care the tiny stubble, choose this one, otherwise, go back for traditional way.</li>
    <li> Works ok - not as good as my old Phillips</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. Gives a close shave, molding itself to the contours of my face (and ears!!). Couldn&#x27;t be better.  Did take some head-scratching to figure our how to open and clean the shaver head. Easy once you know how.  Highly recommended and worth the price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t choose the item, it was a gift for my nephew but it is the model his Dad said he wanted and the price was more than half what it would have been in the store.  I was thrilled.</li>
    <li> Nice razor, close shave. My only issue is how loud it is. You would think for no bigger than it is and for the price it would be a lot more quiet.</li>
    <li> Looks fancy but this shaver is terrible!! I bought it for my husband about a year ago. From day one he had to spend half an hour shaving in order to get even a spotty shave. I kept asking him to re shave so he went back to his cord norelco and remington that did a far better job in 10 min. He has tried it again periodically since and still the same results. His beard is light to medium so it does not require much.</li>
    <li> the two hole cutting system is fantastic. My old Norelco worked ok. If you want a nice close shave spend the extra money and go with the 2D system, you will not be disapointed!</li>
    <li> Provides me with a great shave!</li>
    <li> I generally like Norelco, but the 1160X far exceeded my expectations for smoothness, speed, and long-battery life.  I had previously purchased a Braun Series 5 (565cc-4) because of the good reviews, but it was rough on my skin and slow.  Thankfully I found this one and no longer look like I&#x27;ve just come from the dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco electric razors before and have liked them. I tried this razor on one side of my face and my old Norelco razor with old blades on the other side. I had a much closer shave with the old razor with the old blades. I got this as a Christmas gift. I took my old razor and reshaved the side of my face that I used the new razor on and got a much nicer closer shave. It seems new and improved really is not improved at all and actually worse. To make matters worse I looked up the price online (since it was a gift) and it&#x27;s a pricey razor for such a poor job. The one bright spot is the trim attachment. I like the trim attachment for trimming my beard and sideburns it does a great job at trimming.</li>
    <li> Everything Norelco says about this shaver is true! I am enjoying this shaver! I have been using different brands such as Panasonic and others but I am loyal to Norelco as it is the best, in my opinion!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday, and he says that the shave is so close he even nicks himself if he&#x27;s not careful. Long battery life, pretty easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I have been a Norelco user for years.  Have found in the past when major changes in the design of the Shaver have been introduced, I impressed with the improved performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new shaver head is much easier to use and cuts as well as a blade, if not better.  The lighter weight and fit in the hand makes this the perfect tool.</li>
    <li> The razor works great, better than my old one. Nice close shave.  Not fond of the charging stand; would prefer to plug charger cord directly into base of razor.&lt;br /&gt;It replaces my old Norelco razor whose batteries were in need of replacement and needed new shaving heads.  Cheaper to just buy a new one.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Only problem is that it seems flimsy.  Time well tell.  Have mine for several months.  Still cuts great.  I have used Norelco shavers for about 30 years.</li>
    <li> As advertised, excellent product!</li>
    <li> every Norelco I have owne my entire life was an easy pop off that stayed together you could clean it and just put it back on and be on your merry way. when you take the cover off of the razor mechanism it falls apart and one two three for 5 pieces that you have to reassemble every time like a puzzle it&#x27;s a major beat down in this is the first miracle that I would not recommend</li>
    <li> This razor worked great for about 1.5 years, unitl I found it with the lock light permanently on no matter how long I keep the on button depressed. And I have never put it into locked mode to begin with. I took it apart, there is no way to reset the circuitry. Even the battery is welded in.</li>
    <li> We all know that no electric razor will give as close a shave as a razor does but this Philips model is not bad for 100.00. I wouldn&#x27;t spend more then that on an electric razor any way but that&#x27;s just me. I get a thick beard rather quickly between shaves and this shaver gets me about 2-3 days before I need to shave again which isn&#x27;t bad. This shaver works GREAT if you run out of razors or you just want a good quickie shave, it charges fast too. I get the best results using Barbasol Sensitive Skin shaving cream with it, making sure to soak the heads in cleaning solution after words. Mine didn&#x27;t come with the cleaning system so I just let it soak in a cup for a few hours and the hairs just fall off,  doing this keeps the blades fresh and gives you the closest shave possible before you use it again. Also if you don&#x27;t want to order the jet cleaning solution I heard that soaking the heads in regular vinegar cleans them up too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REPLACEMENT HEAD- Philips Norelco RQ11 Replacement Head (here on amazon)&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING SOLUTION- Jet Clean Solution HQ200&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger quit working after just 9 months.  3 stars :(</li>
    <li> The e-razor does its work just well and each charge is good enough for a week&#x27;s use so I can just bring the razor with me, no need to include the charger.</li>
    <li> It cleans easy and shaves very well.  I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for about the last 10-years and they keep getting better.  I always like the Norelco products.  I usually get about 5 years of life out of them before I decide I want something else or I drop it and break it.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Norelco SensoTouch Electric 1160X razor has one major flaw--you can&#x27;t charge this razor while using it to shave. I&#x27;ve had Philips shavers in the past that do allow charging while shaving, so it&#x27;s a shame they left it out. There&#x27;s nothing more annoying than needing a quick shave and realizing you can&#x27;t because the shaver isn&#x27;t charged. In addition, there&#x27;s no indicator that lets you know how much charge you have left in your shaver, so unless you dock your shaver every day, you won&#x27;t know how much charge you have between shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another minor drawback is the on off switch. It&#x27;s built to look like a seamless touch-sensitive power switch, but it&#x27;s actually a thin, flexible film of plastic over a conventional on off switch that makes the razor feel cheap. And lastly, there&#x27;s no indicator letting you know how much charge is left in the shaver. And lastly, the head doesn&#x27;t do a very good job sealing away the trimmed hairs. Just a little shake leaves behind a trail of fine trimmings that adds one more inconvenience built into a device built for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1160X comes with a spare shaving head (a definite plus), a beard trimmer, a rather flimsy charging dock, a brush, and a travel case. I wish there was a larger case that would hold the spare heads, you can cram them into the travel case, but this isn&#x27;t ideal. While it does provide a nice shave, it doesn&#x27;t provide a nice experience. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> He loves it.  The flexiblity to take the charged razor with him in the car or around the house is a plus.</li>
    <li> My son loves the razor that was a birthday gift to him. It shaves close without irritating your skin. Easy to clean</li>
    <li> Husband is very satisfied with his Christmas present.</li>
    <li> It works better then the previous senso touch that I had, but not as good as the older norelcos that I used in the 90s and 2000s.</li>
    <li> It works and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product. I would recommend my husband loves it!</li>
