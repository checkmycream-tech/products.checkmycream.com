      <li>Great hairspray for a natural hold for fine hair.</li>

      <li>light weight</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s full of alcohol.</li>
      <li>It smells super chemically and toxic when you spray it on (not afterwards, though)</li>

    <li> This is a good hairspray that brushes out.</li>
    <li> love it..light weight but it does the job well</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It holds your hairstyle and doesn&#x27;t make it stiff. Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it does its job.</li>
    <li> Light spray over my head of thick straight hair re-tains the smooth effect of the style I wear; normally keeps it out of my face and eyes.  Stays on for hours.  Great source to purchase Elastic flexible hold hairspray.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Great product.  That is all I gave to say.  Nothing more should be needed or forthcoming!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. It smells super chemically and toxic when you spray it on (not afterwards, though) and it&#x27;s full of alcohol. I have slightly wavy shoulder length hair that I sometimes curl using a curling iron and this stuff doesn&#x27;t keep the curls in any better than when I don&#x27;t use it. Worst of all, after one nights sleep after using this hairspray, the curls not only disappear, but I wake up with straight, stiff hair that looks like straw. Seems drying, too. Would never repurchase.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It is a perfect flexible hold spray works great with my extensions!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  Hardly any build up and my hair holds extremely well, while remaining soft and touchable.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great hairspray for a natural hold for fine hair. Not sticky or heavy or stiff.</li>
    <li> Merrr smell is alright. Hold is decent</li>

    <li> DOES NOT HOLD VERY WELL.</li>
    <li> Not Like I would like it to. I have fly away hair and needs a lot of attention.  Schwarzkopf Made  a product  &amp;#34;Shine&amp;#34;  hair spray and gel type that really worked Great. But disappeared  off the market? Tried to  track it down NOTHING. A lot of other on line were concerned about it???</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  It holds all day and will still brush out and let me re-do my hair at the end of day.  Never sticky or dulling.  My hair still moves and yet stays in place.  I am sort of a hairspray snob, so this was a big find for me.  And it&#x27;s reasonably priced so that makes it the perfect product!!!</li>
    <li> Have used this hairspray for many years.  I was pleased to find it on Amazon at a good price.</li>
    <li> good hair spay. wish was cheaper</li>
    <li> Would order smaller size next time</li>
