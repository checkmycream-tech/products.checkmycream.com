      <li>Make sure to allergy test!</li>
      <li>easy to use and gives great color results.</li>
      <li>I immediately jumped in the shower and rinsed out the henna with luke warm water and conditioner.</li>
      <li>First off the coverage is very good.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions and got... a very light cover.</li>
      <li>Hope you get fantastic results!</li>
      <li>Make sure you wear something you don&#x27;t care for.</li>
      <li>but I love this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Someone else may like it, but I sure didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
      <li>It certainly gives you a BRIGHT beautiful RED color!!</li>
      <li>It seems to be pure and works fantastic leaving you with bright hair.</li>
      <li>Have fun! :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s 100% organic and cruelty free to animals.</li>
      <li>I used this stuff, and my hair became the most gorgeous shade of red!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a redhead looking for that perfect shade of vivid red, this is the product for you.</li>
      <li>The first two days, I kind of looked Merida from Brave of Ariel for the little mermaid.</li>
      <li>This is, by far, the most effective natural hair color I have tried to date.  </li>
      <li>If you prefer to use shampoo make sure it is free of sulfates, and any major chemicals.</li>
      <li>I have been using henna for 15 years now, Light Mountain Natural is the brand i prefer, the colors are excellent and they stay in much longer than expected.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not as bright as it is the first week, but after that it stays red.</li>
      <li>you get all of the grit rinsed out you have soft, shiny beautiful red</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a more permanent and natural look this is it!</li>
      <li>Love my &#x27;natural&#x27; highlights!  </li>
      <li>ABSOLUTELY!!</li>
      <li>it was EXACTLY what I wanted!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not mad at that)</li>
      <li>Once that was done curing I mixed the henna until it was a nice consistency and sectioned my hair and applied.</li>
      <li>YEA RIGHT.  </li>
      <li>The process was fairly easy, especially with the detailed instructions that comes with this product.</li>
      <li>I am also pregnant, so I needed something that was safe enough to use during pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Use a very gentle shampoo or water and baking soda mixture to cleanse your scalp.</li>
      <li>It was my first time ever dying my hair</li>
      <li>I was nervous at first since my hair did look a bitdarker, but when I blew it out...</li>
      <li>I hope that this second application will make me a believer in henna and that I will have better results.</li>
      <li>It has been about 8 months since I first dyed my hair</li>
      <li>So I did A LOT of research, watched endless tutorials, and even did a strand test before getting fully started just to make sure it was the color I wanted!</li>
      <li>The egg provides your hair more moisture, and gives it a bit of a different texture.</li>
      <li>It looked better before I even began to color it, last night.</li>
      <li>let it cure in the bowl for 3 hours (any more would be too long)</li>
      <li>This really masked the henna smell well.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair.</li>
      <li>In fact, it doesn&#x27;t really look like I colored my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I guess it&#x27;s really a matter of preference.</li>
      <li>other brand, gives me a deep, beautiful, red.</li>
      <li>I decided on &amp;#34;Light Mountain Natural in Bright Red&amp;#34; since the color is similar to my natural highlighted red hues.</li>
      <li>on a more personal note...I am a natural redhead that is experiencing some color loss as i am getting older (even natural redheads can fade)</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m buying another box to do a second application as I hope I&#x27;ll get more red results versus orange.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t look patchy, it wasn&#x27;t SUPER red...</li>
      <li>The results is the hair i had in high school</li>
      <li>Additionally, I live in the high desert</li>
      <li>a bit different from standard henna, this comes with easy to use instructions, hints on how to make the color brighter or darker and plastic gloves and head wrap.  </li>
      <li>I mixed up a whole box, certain that I would need all of it, well after I had thoroughly coated all of my hair</li>
      <li>&gt; Just keep in my that every shade of hair will turn out slightly different; dark hair will have a reddish tint, and blond hair will be a bright orangish red.</li>
      <li>I used the bright red henna over dyed dark blonde hair about a week ago.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m assuming that since it&#x27;s light red it doesn&#x27;t have enough pigment.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the kind of red that doesn&#x27;t clash with pink and red, which is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>To color came out the exact same, which is why i give 4 stars.</li>
      <li>I mixed about 2 1/2 tbsp of Henna, 1 egg, and hot filtered water.</li>
      <li>The only reason I bought this one was because I wanted to see if Bright Red was a cooler color on my hair than just the plain &amp;#34;red&amp;#34;, which ive been using for a couple of years.</li>
      <li>also want to add that while chemical colors, especially red fade rather quickly, this stays red</li>
      <li>To first time users of any henna product...be patient I will not lie its messy and takes longer than chemical dye but the result is natural, low cost and chemical free color.</li>
      <li>My hair is a light orangish brown, and I felt it was a little blah.</li>
      <li>but this bright red is a little brighter (not much)</li>
      <li>I let the Henna cure for about 1 hour before using it (place a clear bag or wrap over henna mixture since the heat helps to cure it faster).</li>
      <li>I stumbled upon henna dye when I was reading a Cosmo magazine and they mentioned how to brighten up your natural hair with Henna.</li>
      <li>The red is deeper red than this, this leaves you with a light strawberry blond-type red.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Immediately after it did seem fire red, but in a day or two it had faded into a much more natural hue, and quite a few people thought I had it professionally done because of how natural it looked.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, which I&#x27;d heard about through EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database (lowest hazard rating: 0).</li>
      <li>have very short, light brown hair, which had been colored previously with the Red Henna Hair Dye 100 Grams (purchased from Amazon).</li>
      <li>It barely changed my hair color.</li>
      <li>I am a natural redhead with auburn red hair, and I really wanted to brighten up my natural red hues without using those harsh chemical dyes.</li>
      <li>It is MESSY, but it didn&#x27;t stain my countertops right away, only your CLOTHES!</li>
      <li>My mother&#x27;s hair is medium/dark brown and while it does really make her hair look red as my other henna product does, it&#x27;s alright for her.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like using shampoo&#x27;s since they strip your hair from it&#x27;s natural oils and leave my scalp feeling dry and frizzy!</li>
      <li>I had very thick, curly hair, and it was a light caramel-ish colour.</li>

<li> As a matter of fact, I find it quite dry and straw like.  </li>
<li> and I have read that these dry conditions can cause hair to become dry and straw</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, to cover grey hair, which makes my dark boring brown hair shiny and full of pretty red highlights!  </li>
<li> In my opinion this color is not what I expected.  </li>
<li> but I disliked the grainy feel of the henna it left in my hair</li>
<li> Not only did this take the least amount of time (45 minutes for my normal, shoulder-length hair), but I also found it to be less messy with immediately noticeable results.  </li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t use on bleached hair. Mine turned bright orange!</li>
    <li> Wanted to use this to stain my nails. (Which is very easy to do!) After many layers I finally got some ugly, orange color. I&#x27;m assuming that since it&#x27;s light red it doesn&#x27;t have enough pigment. I just purchased the red henna from the same company.  We&#x27;ll see how it works...</li>
    <li> I have been using Henna for a while now, specifically Red Henna Hair Dye 100 Grams. I came across this brand and thought, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very short, light brown hair, which had been colored previously with the Red Henna Hair Dye 100 Grams (purchased from Amazon). It was time for a re-color and thought I&#x27;d use this brand instead. I followed the directions and got... a very light cover. In fact, it doesn&#x27;t really look like I colored my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other brand, gives me a deep, beautiful, red. This one... well... you know when your hair color starts to fade? That&#x27;s how my hair looks now. It looked better before I even began to color it, last night. Yay me!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A waste of money and especially time, for less than mediocre results. Not happy with results at all. Will not repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being said, my mother likes it. So I guess it&#x27;s really a matter of preference. My mother&#x27;s hair is medium/dark brown and while it does really make her hair look red as my other henna product does, it&#x27;s alright for her. I personally didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> a bit different from standard henna, this comes with easy to use instructions, hints on how to make the color brighter or darker and plastic gloves and head wrap.  easy to use and gives great color results.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping :D</li>
    <li> I really hate the smell but I did have a little color form it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. First off the coverage is very good. Especially if you have already dyed your hair using red henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I had very thick, curly hair, and it was a light caramel-ish colour. Now, I&#x27;m exactly five foot, and it went down a little past my bum, so that is pretty damn long. It was my first time ever dying my hair and I had done tons of research. (Which you should always do!) I mixed up a whole box, certain that I would need all of it, well after I had thoroughly coated all of my hair i had maybe a half a cup left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after it did seem fire red, but in a day or two it had faded into a much more natural hue, and quite a few people thought I had it professionally done because of how natural it looked. It stayed very vibrant for at least 3 weeks afterwards. It has been about 8 months since I first dyed my hair and I think I have only gone through about four boxes.</li>
    <li> The only reason I bought this one was because I wanted to see if Bright Red was a cooler color on my hair than just the plain &amp;#34;red&amp;#34;, which ive been using for a couple of years. To color came out the exact same, which is why i give 4 stars. Great product otherwise.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> This henna did the job but I disliked the grainy feel of the henna it left in my hair I would not order this brand again...I am being generous  with the stars because it did the job of colouring but not satisfied with the residue left behind.</li>
    <li> I used the bright red henna over dyed dark blonde hair about a week ago.  I left it on for 6 hours and it turned my hair an orangeish color.  A week later and I&#x27;m buying another box to do a second application as I hope I&#x27;ll get more red results versus orange. I put a TON of cinnamon and cloves in the henna, in addition to Greek yogurt and 3 different type of pomegranate,  apple, and ginger teas.  This really masked the henna smell well. Unfortunately, the first henna application did nothing in regards to conditioning my hair.  As a matter of fact, I find it quite dry and straw like.  I am not going to blame this on the henna though as I have been abusing my hair with heat and chemical dyes for years.  Additionally, I live in the high desert and I have read that these dry conditions can cause hair to become dry and straw like.  I was hoping, though,  that the henna would improve it somewhat, but it did not. I hope that this second application will make me a believer in henna and that I will have better results.</li>
    <li> It barely changed my hair color. And after leaving on my head for 4 hours it should have done something</li>
    <li> Love my &#x27;natural&#x27; highlights!  I&#x27;ve used this product for years, to cover grey hair, which makes my dark boring brown hair shiny and full of pretty red highlights!  The best part is, as I age, I get more :-)  !!!!</li>
    <li> Works great and can be used over or under boxed dye, which a lot of henna can&#x27;t. It seems to be pure and works fantastic leaving you with bright hair. Just remember, henna is translucent so any color you have underneath will come through. I had a bit of blue left in my tips and it was still blue after I used this so I just cut my hair a bit. Leaves you smelling earthy- reminds me of a farm... perhaps alfalfa? I personally like the smell. Some may not. It lasts for a few days. The red is deeper red than this, this leaves you with a light strawberry blond-type red. The regular red leaves you with a deep orange if it is on lightened hair. Make sure to allergy test!</li>
    <li> To start off with the product arrived in a timely manner and was as pictured. on a more personal note...I am a natural redhead that is experiencing some color loss as i am getting older (even natural redheads can fade) I used this product today and am very happy. The process is a little messy but worth it. I mixed the product as directed and left it to cure for one hour, applied it and left it on my hair one hour. I rinsed with LOTS of water and conditioner (after the bulk of the henna was rinsed out) The results is the hair i had in high school (perhaps a touch brighter but I&#x27;m not mad at that) I will buy this product again. To first time users of any henna product...be patient I will not lie its messy and takes longer than chemical dye but the result is natural, low cost and chemical free color. Have fun! :)</li>
    <li> Gift for someone who uses this henna, works great. lovely product!!</li>
    <li> I have naturally red hair, and was looking to make my hair redder. My hair is a light orangish brown, and I felt it was a little blah. I used this stuff, and my hair became the most gorgeous shade of red! The first two days, I kind of looked Merida from Brave of Ariel for the little mermaid. After a couple of washings, my hair became a deep red. It&#x27;s the kind of red that doesn&#x27;t clash with pink and red, which is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Just keep in my that every shade of hair will turn out slightly different; dark hair will have a reddish tint, and blond hair will be a bright orangish red. If you&#x27;re a redhead looking for that perfect shade of vivid red, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I started out using just the red but this bright red is a little brighter (not much) it makes my medium brown hair a beautiful bright reddish brown, esp in the sunshine!&lt;br /&gt;I let it cure in the bowl for 3 hours (any more would be too long) and then I keep it on my head for 3 hours. This timing works perfectly every time.&lt;br /&gt;Once you get all of the grit rinsed out you have soft, shiny beautiful red hair.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands of henna but I love this.&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add that while chemical colors, especially red fade rather quickly, this stays red forever.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as bright as it is the first week, but after that it stays red. Which is so nice!&lt;br /&gt;And zero damage to the hair!</li>
    <li> I tried to cancel this order like 2 minutes after I ordered it because I had gotten the wrong color.  The seller emails me back, the next day, telling me I cannot because it was already being processed (even though they could have).  But I decided to try this color anyways so I wouldn&#x27;t of wasted my money...YEA RIGHT.  I wasted my money.  In my opinion this color is not what I expected.  I had medium brown hair and it turned out orange...like a fiery red, sun orange.  I hated it so bad I had to go to the store and pick up some different haircolor to get that crap off my head.  Someone else may like it, but I sure didn&#x27;t.  And it didn&#x27;t help the seller screwed me over.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the most effective natural hair color I have tried to date.  I used to color my hair red, then black, with commercial chemicals for over two years, and the damage was apparent every time I went into the salon.  Formerly, I used LUSH&#x27;s Caca Rouge and, while it worked, it would usually have to curate on my hair underneath a plastic cap for at least three hours before I noticed any color difference.  Not only did this take the least amount of time (45 minutes for my normal, shoulder-length hair), but I also found it to be less messy with immediately noticeable results.  I highly recommend this product, which I&#x27;d heard about through EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database (lowest hazard rating: 0).</li>
    <li> I am a natural redhead with auburn red hair, and I really wanted to brighten up my natural red hues without using those harsh chemical dyes. I am also pregnant, so I needed something that was safe enough to use during pregnancy. I stumbled upon henna dye when I was reading a Cosmo magazine and they mentioned how to brighten up your natural hair with Henna. So I did A LOT of research, watched endless tutorials, and even did a strand test before getting fully started just to make sure it was the color I wanted! I decided on &amp;#34;Light Mountain Natural in Bright Red&amp;#34; since the color is similar to my natural highlighted red hues. The process was fairly easy, especially with the detailed instructions that comes with this product. I mixed about 2 1/2 tbsp of Henna, 1 egg, and hot filtered water. The egg provides your hair more moisture, and gives it a bit of a different texture. I let the Henna cure for about 1 hour before using it (place a clear bag or wrap over henna mixture since the heat helps to cure it faster). Once that was done curing I mixed the henna until it was a nice consistency and sectioned my hair and applied. It is MESSY, but it didn&#x27;t stain my countertops right away, only your CLOTHES! Make sure you wear something you don&#x27;t care for. Also, I would advise anyone to put vaseline or any greasy product along their facial hair lines, ears, neck, etc. I left the dye in for 45 minutes using the plastic hair cap provided by LMN and added heat from my blow dryer. I immediately jumped in the shower and rinsed out the henna with luke warm water and conditioner. I don&#x27;t like using shampoo&#x27;s since they strip your hair from it&#x27;s natural oils and leave my scalp feeling dry and frizzy! I &amp;#34;water wash&amp;#34; and condition. If you prefer to use shampoo make sure it is free of sulfates, and any major chemicals. Use a very gentle shampoo or water and baking soda mixture to cleanse your scalp. NOW, for the RESULTS!....I was nervous at first since my hair did look a bitdarker, but when I blew it out...OMG my hair LOOKED BEAUTIFUL!!!!!! It certainly gives you a BRIGHT beautiful RED color!! It didn&#x27;t look patchy, it wasn&#x27;t SUPER red...it was EXACTLY what I wanted! So...do I recommend this product? ABSOLUTELY!! If you are looking for a more permanent and natural look this is it! It&#x27;s 100% organic and cruelty free to animals. I read the ingredients and there is nothing questionable to be considered. I think this product deserves a better rep! TRY IT OUT LADIES!!!!!!!! Hope you get fantastic results! I will try and post a pic!</li>
