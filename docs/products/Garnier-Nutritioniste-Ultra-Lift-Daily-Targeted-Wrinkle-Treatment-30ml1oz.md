      <li>It is very easy to apply and in minutes my face seems softer and more youthful.</li>
      <li>I love it around the eyes also.</li>
      <li>so I figured this product would work for me for sure--</li>
      <li>&quot; I was hoping for, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>Now, if I put foundation it does not fill those lines in any more.</li>
      <li>This product os ok...  </li>
      <li>but I panicked and started using anti-aging products even though I was mostly fighting acne up until that point.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t too prominent</li>
      <li>Also I could not of found this at a better price.</li>
      <li>I look more youthful and awake.</li>
      <li>I was amazed when I saw many of them smooth out within minutes of applying.  </li>
      <li>I do break out easily and this did not break me out.</li>
      <li>It did keep my eye-lids from drying out, but again, no discernible change to my fine lines.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t make any noticeable change to my fine lines.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of fine lines.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a product for fine lines, so it can smooth them out.</li>
      <li>BUT SKIN DID FEEL SMOOTH</li>
      <li>Thankfully, it was cheap.</li>
      <li>and I liked that it was both inexpensive and had decent reviews</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s rich.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get the amazing \\&quot;wow factor\\</li>
      <li>Not even worth the time and effort even if I got it free.</li>
      <li>So I was very pleased that it also came at a very low price.  </li>
      <li>I have the smile crease around my cheeks and mouth (the parenthisies)</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product as worth trying.</li>
      <li>Sometimes you can&#x27;t tell if it is doing any good but other times</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell and I use it around my eye area and the wrinkles are reduced after a few days use.</li>
      <li>When I received my package the box was smashed completely, but the product was fine.</li>
      <li>I have used MANY different anti wrinkle creams, but this one beats them all.</li>
      <li>This product works quickly and softens the puffiness and fine lines especially under my eyes.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a more youthful appearance.</li>
      <li>The skin on that area is much firmer (before it was kind of hanging there loose).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have  &amp;#34;deep wrinkles&amp;#34; just a couple of fine lines that are honestly barely noticeable</li>
      <li>I am still using this but am not sure if it is as good as the ultra lift.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect miracles but  a little notice of lines would have been nice.</li>
      <li>This product really fills them in.</li>
      <li>I noticed the difference the very moment I squeezed some out.</li>
      <li>NO, THIS REALLY DIDN&#x27;T WORK FOR ME AT ALL.  </li>
      <li>and I really do see a difference.  </li>
      <li>I have used almost the whole tube.</li>
      <li>THIS REALLY DIDN&#x27;T DO TOO MUCH FOR ME..</li>
      <li>and I looked in the mirror and noticed some minor fine lines forming around my eye area as well as on my forehead.</li>
      <li>I normally buy my products at Wal-Mart and they are very pricey.</li>
      <li>I have to say that of all the different wrinkle products I have tried this one had the most immediate effect (within only a week).  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have super deep wrinkles, just a few fine lines around my mouth and eyes.</li>
      <li>but it WASN&#x27;T my normal Garnier stuff.</li>
      <li>Overall, I think that for the money, this is worth trying.</li>
      <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but this product is cheap enough to try.</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin and after trying many very expensive skin treatment products, I am finding Garnier products do as good a job as the really pricey ones.</li>
      <li>The tube is also pretty big.</li>
      <li>This ultra-lift deep wrinkle treament delivers exactly as it states.  </li>
      <li>I like this but not sure I love it...</li>
      <li>Easy to use because of the narrow point applicator.  </li>
      <li>and I noticed a deep wrinkle started forming on my furrow line making me look older and kind of mean.</li>
      <li>So far, he likes how smooth his skin feels, but hasn&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any of the anti wrinkle effects.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money if you are trying to reduce the appearance of fine lines / wrinkles.</li>
      <li>54 YEARS OLD</li>
      <li>It doesnt work, do not waste your freakin money.</li>
      <li>It is not a heavy cream</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 28 years old</li>
      <li>I applied it heavily in my deep wrinkles and then applied it normally on the rest of my face.</li>
      <li>The shipping was quick, and within a few days of using both day and night I noticed my skin was alot smoother.</li>
      <li>you can not beat the price for what the it can do to your skin, only a doctor should be able to make the changes, but this works, the wrinkles are gone, not just for the time of use all day, and I use it under my makeup and as a night cream also, and a little will go a long way.</li>
      <li>I am not sure how it would work on those with really deep set wrinkles, but for fine lines I think it does the trick.</li>
      <li>I am not sure how fresh it was based on the results I am seeing.</li>
      <li>It had a funny paste-like smell and the consistency was not the same as all the previous tubes I have purchased at local drugstores.</li>
      <li>I am 57 years old and my skin is very dry with a lot of deep wrinkles.  </li>

<li> So, if you use it only on deep wrinkles, it will last for a very long time.</li>
<li> I will continue to use this product as long as it continues to keep working.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and have not noticed any improvement as far as any wrinkles or lines.</li>
<li> It turned out to be a complete waste.</li>
<li> I am only 28, but I recently had my second baby and was missing out on sleep</li>
<li> I have deep forehead wrinkles and these are now slighty smaller and less noticeable.</li>
<li> and I believe the dry tiredness in the skin of that area has improved.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been applying on my forehead, and have seen minimal results.</li>
<li> It is not overly greasy and even though the tube is small, it lasts a long time because alittle goes a long way.</li>
<li> Luckily I only paid very little as I bought it at OSJL with a coupon.</li>
<li> I will say though that the  other Garnier  product to get rid of sun or brown spots does work but takes about a month  to see the spots disappear.</li>
<li> I wanted to look into what I could do to keep them from getting worse or perhaps preventing new ones from forming.</li>
<li> gave a neutral 3 stars because it is neither good nor terrible.</li>
<li> Skin that holds moisture looks less wrinkled.</li>
<li> I thought that my wrinkles looked a little less noticeable in the morning when looking in my 10x makeup mirror.</li>
<li> In fact, it dried out my skin a bit (probably because it was less moisturizing than my previous moisturizer).</li>
<li> This was a waste of money for me.</li>
<li> so I ended up using it as a hand creme since I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use it in the daytime because it is too heavy for my skin.</li>
<li> Before, the foundation was filling them in (I just hated it because it used to make them more visible).</li>
<li> Usually this product works well.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know what was wrong with it, but what was in the tube was either expired or NOT the actual product.</li>
<li> I just use small dabs of it in problem places</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not very pleasant to me.</li>
<li> AS ANY OTHER EXPENSIVE CREAM.</li>
<li> I can continue to describe how pathetic this product is all day long</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had moderate results with this cream.  Sometimes you can&#x27;t tell if it is doing any good but other times I see that it helps with deep wrinkles, as time goes on.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t care for is the smell.  It&#x27;s not very pleasant to me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and have not noticed any improvement as far as any wrinkles or lines. I didn&#x27;t expect miracles but  a little notice of lines would have been nice. I bought two and will keep using as with any product you have to continue on. I will say though that the  other Garnier  product to get rid of sun or brown spots does work but takes about a month  to see the spots disappear. Will keep using this and see if this product will actually work Time will tell! Thank you</li>
    <li> Usually this product works well.  I am not sure how fresh it was based on the results I am seeing.</li>
    <li> This product os ok...  I didn&#x27;t get the amazing \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; I was hoping for, but it&#x27;s okay. I probably will not buy it again, but will use what I have...</li>
    <li> you can not beat the price for what the it can do to your skin, only a doctor should be able to make the changes, but this works, the wrinkles are gone, not just for the time of use all day, and I use it under my makeup and as a night cream also, and a little will go a long way. A must for men and women....</li>
    <li> I have to say that of all the different wrinkle products I have tried this one had the most immediate effect (within only a week).  So I was very pleased that it also came at a very low price.  I just use small dabs of it in problem places and I really do see a difference.  I will continue to use this product as long as it continues to keep working.</li>
    <li> I like the product and have been buying it a local drug stores. It&#x27;s the seller that I do not recommend. I ordered this from Champion Liquidators or something like that and it was awful. I don&#x27;t know what was wrong with it, but what was in the tube was either expired or NOT the actual product. I noticed the difference the very moment I squeezed some out. It had a funny paste-like smell and the consistency was not the same as all the previous tubes I have purchased at local drugstores. I just threw it out. Like I said, I have no idea what was in that tube but it WASN&#x27;T my normal Garnier stuff.</li>
    <li> It doesnt work, do not waste your freakin money.It is really stupid when companys lie and leave misleading information. Wish that this product could receive no stars instead of one. I can continue to describe how pathetic this product is all day long</li>
    <li> this is s good wrinkle cream, I have seen a difference in some sun spots and wrinkles also, smell could be better but cream is working good.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I do not have deep set wrinkles yet. I am only 28, but I recently had my second baby and was missing out on sleep and I looked in the mirror and noticed some minor fine lines forming around my eye area as well as on my forehead. I wanted to look into what I could do to keep them from getting worse or perhaps preventing new ones from forming. So I searched online and read reviews. I saw this product and I liked that it was both inexpensive and had decent reviews so I figured, for the price, What did I have to lose? I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it. The shipping was quick, and within a few days of using both day and night I noticed my skin was alot smoother. It is not overly greasy and even though the tube is small, it lasts a long time because alittle goes a long way. I have been using it for about a month now and I notice a difference. I look more youthful and awake. I am not sure how it would work on those with really deep set wrinkles, but for fine lines I think it does the trick. I ordered another tube for myself and one for my husband to try as well. So far, he likes how smooth his skin feels, but hasn&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any of the anti wrinkle effects. I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a more youthful appearance. TIP: If you purchase it on amazon it is alot cheaper than purchasing in the store.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s rich. I&#x27;ve been applying on my forehead, and have seen minimal results.</li>
    <li> This product indeed does add some plump to deep wrinkles. It has a pleasant smell and I use it around my eye area and the wrinkles are reduced after a few days use.</li>
    <li> I like this but not sure I love it...I am still using this but am not sure if it is as good as the ultra lift.  Time will tell</li>
    <li> I use this product at night. I applied it heavily in my deep wrinkles and then applied it normally on the rest of my face. I thought that my wrinkles looked a little less noticeable in the morning when looking in my 10x makeup mirror. I don&#x27;t use it in the daytime because it is too heavy for my skin. Overall, I think that for the money, this is worth trying. It has a fragrance but nothing that bothers me. I only mention it in case you are someone who is looking for a totally unscented moisturizer. I am not saying this will do wonders for you but I have used more expensive products and have never noticed anything different about my skin. I do break out easily and this did not break me out. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but this product is cheap enough to try.</li>
    <li> When I received my package the box was smashed completely, but the product was fine. I have been using the cream for a while now and my skin feels smother.  I have deep forehead wrinkles and these are now slighty smaller and less noticeable.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money for me. I don&#x27;t have  &amp;#34;deep wrinkles&amp;#34; just a couple of fine lines that are honestly barely noticeable so I figured this product would work for me for sure--NOT It didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all so I ended up using it as a hand creme since I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money. It may work for you, but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all</li>
    <li> I have used almost the whole tube. No changes. I have a lot of fine lines. It moisturizes, but that&#x27;s IT. Don&#x27;t waste your money if you are trying to reduce the appearance of fine lines / wrinkles. Luckily I only paid very little as I bought it at OSJL with a coupon. Not even worth the time and effort even if I got it free.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product for fine lines, so it can smooth them out. I use it twice a day and it seems like it is working</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have super deep wrinkles, just a few fine lines around my mouth and eyes. I thought this might help add moisture to those areas. It turned out to be a complete waste. I used it for about 4 months and it didn&#x27;t make any noticeable change to my fine lines. In fact, it dried out my skin a bit (probably because it was less moisturizing than my previous moisturizer). It did keep my eye-lids from drying out, but again, no discernible change to my fine lines. Thankfully, it was cheap. I will not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave a neutral 3 stars because it is neither good nor terrible. It works like a basic moisturizer, not the deep treatment it claims to be.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year or two. It is inexpensive yet,  it still does a very good job.  I use this under my makeup and it seems to relax my facial skin.  It is not a heavy cream and I can&#x27;t feel it on my skin.  It is very easy to apply and in minutes my face seems softer and more youthful.</li>
    <li> Easy to use because of the narrow point applicator.  I like the way the area around my eyes feel when I use it and I believe the dry tiredness in the skin of that area has improved.</li>
    <li> I have used MANY different anti wrinkle creams, but this one beats them all. I have the smile crease around my cheeks and mouth (the parenthisies) they talk about on tv. This product really fills them in. I love it around the eyes also. Also I could not of found this at a better price. I normally buy my products at Wal-Mart and they are very pricey. A third of the cost to buy on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old and I noticed a deep wrinkle started forming on my furrow line making me look older and kind of mean. It wasn&#x27;t too prominent but I panicked and started using anti-aging products even though I was mostly fighting acne up until that point. Anyway, I bought couple of Garnier products: night cream, skin renewal cream, around the eyes cream and this one to use it just on those furrow lines. After about a month of constant use before bed time, I can tell that it works. The skin on that area is much firmer (before it was kind of hanging there loose). The lines are almost unnoticeable. Before, the foundation was filling them in (I just hated it because it used to make them more visible). Now, if I put foundation it does not fill those lines in any more. My skin is also oily and acne-prone, as I mentioned before and this product doesn&#x27;t affect it in a bad way. No break-outs, no irritation. The tube is also pretty big. So, if you use it only on deep wrinkles, it will last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> THIS EYE CREAM IS GOOD. I WOULDN&#x27;T SAY IT GETS DEEP WRINKLES OUT, BUT THAN AGAIN I DON&#x27;T HAVE DEEP WRINKLES.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M 54 YEARS OLD AND I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AS GOOD, AS ANY OTHER EXPENSIVE CREAM. IT WORKED THE SAME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  LEE DEE</li>
    <li> This product works quickly and softens the puffiness and fine lines especially under my eyes. I would recommend this product as worth trying.</li>
    <li> THIS REALLY DIDN&#x27;T DO TOO MUCH FOR ME..NO, THIS REALLY DIDN&#x27;T WORK FOR ME AT ALL.  BUT SKIN DID FEEL SMOOTH</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with this product.  I am 57 years old and my skin is very dry with a lot of deep wrinkles.  I was amazed when I saw many of them smooth out within minutes of applying.  I would recommend this product for anyone with deep wrinlkes.</li>
    <li> This ultra-lift deep wrinkle treament delivers exactly as it states.  Any wrinkles around the eyes (crowsfeet) disappear.  I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and after trying many very expensive skin treatment products, I am finding Garnier products do as good a job as the really pricey ones. Skin that holds moisture looks less wrinkled.</li>
