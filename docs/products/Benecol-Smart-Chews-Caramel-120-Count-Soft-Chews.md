<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Delicious and conveniert</li>
    <li> I like these a lot.  It just took a long time to get them.</li>
    <li> These are only 26.99 at drugstore dot com.</li>
    <li> I started on the Benecol when my Cardiologist recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on 80 mg of Lipitor that has my Cholesterol under control but my Cardiologist is putting me on the Benecol to lower my Cholesterol even more so that I could cut back on the Statins (Lipitor).&lt;br /&gt;My Cardiologist has his family and friends taking it because it works.</li>
    <li> Along with proper diet, a delicious &amp; uccessful project to keep serum cholesterol in healthy range.&lt;br /&gt;Tasty &amp; convenient to use.</li>
    <li> It helped lower my cholesterol, is easy to take, travels well, and tastes good. It is a bit expensive, though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like eating a caramel candy.  Got it because I can&#x27;t use statins and MD recommended it.  I just wish Amazon didn&#x27;t run out of it.  Tough on the system when I can&#x27;t get it - ya know?</li>
    <li> So for anyone looking for a product that actually works, Benecol Chews are the answer.  Here are my numbers for proof; From Jan 2013 my total cholesterol was at 234, LDL at 144.  I started using 3 Benecol Chews every day and had my cholesterol retested in May 2013.  My new numbers were total cholesterol 214, LDL 131.  I just got my results back (January 2014) after taking Benecol for nearly a year and my most current numbers are total cholesterol 199, LDL 113.  My doctor was happy with results and this was all done without cholesterol lowering drugs of any kind.  Of course, I do exercise regularly (which does lower cholesterol too) and I try to eat healthy.  Benecol Chews will definitely be a part of my daily routine! There also is a Benecol margarine out there&lt;br /&gt;as well.</li>
    <li> my cholesterol is down 30 points.  need I say more?  I guess I have to to get this review published.</li>
    <li> Great tasting, and recommended by my doctor.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the new cholesterol levels next time I go.  Fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> I have dealt with the cholesterol issue like everyone else here. I&#x27;ll do everything to avoid the Statin poison...fish oil, olive oil, little red meat, exercise, although I&#x27;m all of 110lbs, have to watch it, as I loose to much weight, then get grief for that!!      OK here we go:    My good (HDL) has always been pretty good - anywhere from   70 but down to unfortunately 57 in &#x27;08 but that&#x27;s still pretty good    2008 much to my horror on total and LDL    Total Chol   UP to 232    (highest I&#x27;ve ever had!)  Naughty LDL          UP to 157    (highest I&#x27;ve ever had!)  Nice HDL             UP to 57     (NOT best I&#x27;ve had/was once 70)  Tryglycerides        DOWN to 92 (Best I&#x27;ve had in some time)  Sweet ol&#x27; Glucose  DOWN to 86 (best I&#x27;ve had for a while)    So, found this BENECOL stuff!!  I have taken it for just maybe 3 weeks or slightly under - taking 2 with 2 meals    2009 Much to my joy, today Nov 18    Total Chol  dOWN TO 204 - CAN YOU BELIEVE IT??    LDL...WAIT FOR IT  DOWN TO 122 - CAN YOU BELIEVE IT??    HDL though   DOWN TO 53    (from 57 in &#x27;08)    Tryglycerides  UP   TO 146   (from 92 in &#x27;08)    Glucose  UP   TO 107   (from 86 in &#x27;08)    So.....a little set back on a couple of readings, but HDL/TRYG still in range, the Glucose did not seem to bother my Dr. and his assistant immediately went to the Benecol website and announced that they did contain a lot of sugar and could have contributed.  I can deal with that, I can make other changes.    Other than those couple of little glitches - I AM OVER THE MOON!  The Dr. seemed pretty impressed and didn&#x27;t suggest the dreaded Statin - I will continue on with these Sweet Little Gems and see what happens - I&#x27;m almost looking forward to my next blood tests next year - I might demand them earlier!!  Give it a go if you haven&#x27;t already, for this short period of time I&#x27;ve taken it, I just can&#x27;t believe the drop in numbers!</li>
    <li> Smart Chews are the greatest beneficial non-prescription product to fight against cholesterol on the market today!</li>
    <li> Smart choice for fighting high cholesterol. Order from Amazon all the time since some stores don&#x27;t carry 120 pk. container.</li>
    <li> I have been using Benecol smart chews for the last 2 years and they have been great for lowering my cholesterol. A great alternative to statin drugs. I was completely dismayed when they were taken off the market a few months ago. I just received my first shipment of the \\&quot;new\\&quot; Benecol  chews. The taste is dreadful! I will take them but I am very disappointed in the new taste. I guess they reformulated this product. Also, they are not available any more by the automatic system at Amazon-also a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Although my cholesterol was not high, I have a family history, and do not want to go there.  This product tastes good and lowered my numbers quite well.  As a result I do not have to take any type of prescription medication.  Works for me!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s Cholesterol Specialist recommended this along with others. They all worked together to lower it. She&#x27;s happy with this product &amp; the others.</li>
    <li> Here are my test results taken over a period of 6 months with various drugs and diet.&lt;br /&gt;semi-vegetarian&lt;br /&gt;(no beef or pork, chicken or fish 3-4 times week, dairy and eggs)  LDL 158&lt;br /&gt;vegan diet, no drugs  LDL 112&lt;br /&gt;vegan diet, 10mg simvastatin 3x weekly  LDL  80&lt;br /&gt;vegan diet, 10mg simvastatin daily  LDL  51&lt;br /&gt;vegan diet, no statin drugs, Benecol chews 3x (1 after every meal)&lt;br /&gt;plus 1 cardio multi-vitamin which contains 400mg stanols. (Benecol chews contain 700mg stanols each)  LDL 81&lt;br /&gt;It appears that 3 Benecol chews plus 1 cardio multi-vitamin is equal to low dose simvastatin (10mg 3x weekly)&lt;br /&gt;As an added benefit, triglycerides went down from averaging 135-145 to 122.  Don&#x27;t know if Benecol did this.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, works for me. update 5-9-2014: Been taking Benecol chews for several years now.&lt;br /&gt;My cholesterol is tested twice a year on average now.  My LDL stabilized in the 80&#x27;s.  (No statin drugs)</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a doctor to help lower my   cholesterol(along with other meds)because I have trouble taking statin drugs. Follow-up visits have shown improvement in my levels.</li>
    <li> I gave Benecol Smart Chews a four star rating due to the fact that for me, reviewing the efficacy of this product is near impossible on account that I&#x27;m also currently taking other anti-cholesterol supplements in accordance with my wellness provider. The four stars is for ease of use (tasty/chewy) and for its delicious caramel flavor. Yummy!</li>
    <li> When you don&#x27;t have time for the toast and Benecol spread, these handy chews are great to help you control your cholesterol.  After one month of daily Benecol usage, my husbands cholesterol drop 16 points.  I&#x27;ll be a repeat buyer of this!</li>
    <li> Along with incresased fiber and this product i was able to lower my cholesterol numbers significantly. Worth the try !</li>
    <li> Works great has dropped my cholesterol from 210 to 162.</li>
    <li> These chews, along with a cup of oatmeal several times a week, has lowered my HDL by 10 points!</li>
    <li> I had blood work done &amp; for the first time I was told I had high cholesterol. After doing some searching online, I came across Benecol Chews. Rave reviews made me give them a try. After a little less then 2 months I had my cholesterol checked again. My total cholesterol went from 215 down to 205 and my LDL went from 144 down to 129. Keep in mind I made little to no change in my diet so I know these changes were from taking Benecol. Aside from the numbers, which is the most important part, the chews are tasty. Not too sweet, taste like caramel &amp; aren&#x27;t tough. Sometimes they can leave a little bit of a residue in the mouth but that quickly goes away with a drink. I grew to get used to it. They are actually a nice treat after meals (one you know is good for you!). Amazon makes it so easy with the automatic shipments. I never have to worry about running out. And after the change in numbers, I never want to be without them! For those on statins, the package states you can safely take these. If you&#x27;re looking for an easy way to help improve your numbers, definately give these a try!</li>
    <li> The best I can say about this product is that by eating 2 of these special caramels, which taste very good, and greatly reducing eggs in my diet, my cholesterol dropped 29 points in 5 months.  I&#x27;m sure the eggs are big factor, but reducing eggs alone didn&#x27;t give me  as dramatic a result as eating caramels as well.</li>
    <li> Taste like carmels except softer.  Ingredients:  Sugar, Corn Syrup, Plant Stanol Estrs, Nonfat Milk, less than 2% of Caramel color, Soy lecithin, salt, natural and artificial flavors, and yellow 6.  Sodium 15 mg per chew or serving.  0.85 g of Plant Stanol Esters per chew.   2 per day recommended on package.  Expiration was about 14 months beyond the date I recieved so that was good.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this pruduct now for a month, Before I was taking the Benacol Spread , That brought my Colesteral down from 278 to 244. But These are so much easier , Cause you can take them with you, I have to have my Colesteral taken in a couple weeks, Cause I can;t take statins, So I Just started taking 4 a day, My Doctor wants to see how these work,They have no side effects, And it is working.Thank You Benacol</li>
    <li> Cholesterol went from 257 to 233 in less than a month. LDL dropped from 163 to 140.</li>
    <li> I like the Benecol chews. They are good and a good way to lower your cholesterol at the same time.</li>
    <li> I have been using twice per day and along with Krill oil &amp; Sytrinol and my cholesterol has dropped from 260 to 180 in one month.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000NBQUNW Benecol Smart  Chews, Caramel, 120 Soft Chews]]This product does exactly what it claims to do. I used it according to directions for 3 months and my cholesterol went from 256 to 199. I am still using this product and am hoping that soon it will be available in the local stores. I have told everyone I know about this product, my pharmacist is amazed in the way it has worked.</li>
    <li> I must admit that I have not been able to gauge any benefit of this product to date. I can only say that I await my next LDL results with hopeful expectations. The concept of this product is positive - that is blocking the absorption of adverse components from my diet in my digestive system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the taste of the caramel chews and find them to be portable and easily taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will attempt to update this review when I get my next blood work in a few months.</li>
    <li> Not wanting to resort to \\&quot;drugs\\&quot; to manage Cholesterol, I did some research on plant Stanols, and plant Sterols. They both seem to have the ability to lower the cholesterol in your blood.  However, based on a Johns Hopkins health alert....plant sterols tend to lose their ability to lower cholesterol, and instead start to appear in the blood them selves. Where as plant STANOLS seem to stay active and continue to lower cholesterol.  BENECOL is the only off the shelf item that contains stanols instead of sterols. The Benecol spread is good and tastes fine, but the caramel chews are portable so you can easily take them with you. I would recommend the chews to anyone who wants to keeps tabs on your cholesterol....they are reasonably inexpensive, taste good, and have STANOLS in them...and they are portable.  I was able to lower my cholesterol by 80 points by consumming STANOLS and watching my intake of cholesterol....</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! IT LOWERED MY LDL BY 23 POINTS IN LESS THAN 2 MONTHS. IT&#x27;S ALOT BETTER THAN TAKING MORE MEDICINE AND IT TASTES LIKE REAL CARAMEL!</li>
    <li> I had been using these for awhile when they suddenly became unavailable.  Was glad to find them here and discover that they had not ceased production, but just changed the packaging from the mylar zip-loc pouch I was used to buying to this sturdier container.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this product to lower my cholestorol.  Works great!  Taste is just like a caramel chew.. Delish!..    Only available online and not in stores.. that is my only set back.. although shipping was quick and easy. it would be nice if it were available on your local stores shelves..</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t know how effective this product is for lowering cholesterol until my husband has his next blood test.&lt;br /&gt;The vendor was shipping automatically each month.  A month was missed and I received twice the amount a month later.  I will cancel this auto order if that happens again.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with high cholesterol earlier this year.  300 total, and low HDL level.  I took some aggressive steps to adjust my diet and to start exercising more, and began taking phytosterols.  But I came across many reports that warned how sterols passed through the colon and could accumulate in the arteries much like cholesterol.  Stanols, on the other hand, are not absorbed in the colon, yet provided the same protection from cholesterol.  So I switched to Benecol.  I used their margarine because the Chews weren&#x27;t available since March, but it looks like they finally started stocking the Chews again.  FYI, my last checkup showed a 20% drop in total cholesterol, and my HDL/total ratio is up to 4:1, which my doctor said is good.  I&#x27;m hoping my next checkup will be even better.    BTW, be careful of misinformation from reviewers.  Sterols and stanols are not the same, and the literature bears this fact out.  Do your own research, and read CAREFULLY, and use your best judgement.  Eat well, exercise, have a glass of red wine every night :) and find supplements that can help.  Avoid statins if at all possible!</li>
    <li> They recommend 2 chews a day to help with the cholesterol.  My problem is only eating 2!  These are a great help with both my cholesterol and my diet.  I&#x27;m glad I found them.</li>
    <li> Benecol chew brought my cholesterol level down to a normal range after 3 months of use.  No problems with liver function as with the statins and cheaper than red yeast rice.  I recommend it and have recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> Benecol Smart Chews disappeared from the market for a while, and returned in a \\&quot;new-and-improved formula\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m so disappointed with the new formula.  I have no idea if it works any more, and I won&#x27;t find out, because the taste is not good.  I used to enjoy them as a snack - nearly as good as a caramel.  Now they taste grainy, greasy, and artificial, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get the metal wrapper off the chew.  In addition, they give me gas, unlike the old formula.  I won&#x27;t be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> I bought these because it seemed a compelling way to get plant stanols, which medical literature praise for their cholesterol reducing abilities.  I don&#x27;t consume a lot of bread, so the benecol/stanol butter substitute spreads were not a reliable source of stanols for me.    However, these chews aren&#x27;t all they are cracked up to be.  If you have 4 chews per day (like they suggest), you get 16 grams of carbs, 12 grams of sugar, and 80 calories!  For anyone who has high cholesterol + high triglycerides, that isn&#x27;t a desirable way to get your stanols.  Even if these lower your cholesterol, the offsetting risk to your triglycerides might negate the heart healthy benefits.  I&#x27;m no expert on this, but I find that eating too many sugars only makes me hungrier.    If you like to have spreads on your breads and are using stanols as part of your heart health regimen, I&#x27;d suggest a tub of Benecol or Smart Balance instead!    Benecol - can you bring me stanols in a capsule without the sugar?</li>
    <li> Expensive for a supplement, but it&#x27;s better than having a heart attack.  I snack on these to lower my cholesterol</li>
    <li> Have used this product for my cholesterol for 2 years now and it seems to be working.  Easy to take.</li>
    <li> Our Dr. Recommened This product to help lower our cholesterol .  We will have our new #&#x27;s next month.</li>
    <li> I product taste great; like caramel.  The jury is still open if it does what it claims, redue cholestrol.     The delivery and condition of the product was all great. I will probably reorder again.</li>
    <li> I have had high cholesterol since my 20&#x27;s but the ratios were good so my doctor didn&#x27;t recommend medication until age 45.  Since I didn&#x27;t want to take medication, I went on a strict low cholesterol diet and exercised 5 days a week for 45 - 60 minutes a day and lost 16 pounds and am at my goal weight and my cholesterol gradually went down (10-12 points every 3 months#. After a year of stict low cholesterol diet and exercise, my doctor said I would not have to take the medication. My total cholesterol was 199. Diet alone would does not work for my cholesterol levels. As soon as I stopped exercising as much, the cholesterol levels went back up.  Then I decided to try Benecol and am I glad I did.  My total cholesterol went down to 176 in 3 months and the bad cholesterol was lower than ever and the good was even higher and all this without any exercise and after adding in back all the foods I had done without for years!  I take 2 chews before lunch and 2 chews before dinner every day and that works best for me.  When I tried to take 1 chew before lunch and 1 before dinner, my total cholesterol went back up quite a bit #in only 3 months) so I switched back to 2 chews before each meal where I&#x27;m eating food with cholesterol. I highly recommend this product and can&#x27;t wait to go back to the doctor again to see if it has gone even lower!</li>
    <li> I began taking Benecol four years ago and I&#x27;m now terrified. Stanols/sterols may harden arteries. They may clog heart valves. Yes, they will lower your cholesterol but cholesterol may in fact be the least of your problems. [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are multiple recent studies showing the possibility that this stuff is collecting in your arteries. The fact that this company does not mention this possible danger is disgusting. A few years back they cut in half the amount of stanols in their margarine, possibly aware of the possibility they were damaging millions of hearts. PLEASE HEED THIS WARNING. Unfortunately, I only recently found out about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you may notice you&#x27;re developing xanthelasma around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve just received my blood tests back. I have significantly elevated campesterol levels which could only come from taking this product. This puts me at a much higher risk of heart attack. If you are taking this stuff, demand your money back and stop taking it immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read this: [...]</li>
    <li> I just started taking Benecol Smart Chews, so I don&#x27;t know yet if they will lower my cholesterol. I am writing this review so other people will try them and not be afraid that they taste bad. They really are good. They taste just like a carmel candy.</li>
    <li> Some others have pointed out that the new formulation changed the shape, size taste and consistency of the chews.  But there are some more important changes you need to know about.      First of all, each piece contains less plant sterol esters (0.70 down from 0.85), but more sugars (4g up from 3g).  They have also added 50mg of calcium.        One study has shown that calcium in conjunction with plant sterols has beneficial effects on HDL and LDL. (Effects of calcium and plant sterols on serum lipids in obese Zucker rats on a low-fat diet - Timo Vaskonena, Eero Mervaalaa, Ville Sumuvuoria, Tuulikki Seppänen-Laaksoa and Heikki Karppanena - British Journal of Nutrition 2002)     However, other studies indicate that calcium might be associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer, possibly due to supressing Vitamin D levels.  All of this is still somewhat controversial, so I suggest you do your research before using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to lower my cholesterol by natural means and Benecol chews are helping a lot!  In just two months of using these my triglycerides dropped over 70 points.  I also used the Benecol margarine and made some diet modifications, so can&#x27;t say that the chews made all the difference, but they are tasty and a little sweet treat (without a lot of calories) after a meal. I have recommended them to my friends who want to lower their cholesterol.</li>
    <li> This product works-lowers cholesterol. And my 13 y.o. uses it and remembers to take it because she loves the taste!</li>
    <li> WITH BENECOL IT REDUCED MY AND MY WIFES CHOLESTEROL 33 PERCENT. GREAT STUFF</li>
    <li> Helped reduce my cholesterol by 25 points in six weeks, in combination with other non-prescription products without much change to my diet. The chews are sweet and tasty, and many times satisfy my craving for something sweet.</li>
    <li> This may be the last thing you need if your triglycerides and blood pressure are high and you&#x27;ve read some of the books (starting with Gerald Reaven) about Syndrome X, Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, or metabolic syndrome.  In fact, high blood sugar counts and the aforementioned considerations may be as indicative of a tendency toward heart disease as LDL and HDL levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main ingredients in Benecol chews are corn syrup and sugar.  True, they taste as good as chewy candy caramels, but the minimum daily quota requires you to imbibe 80 grams of simple carbohydrate calories.  True, 80 \\&quot;empty\\&quot; calories isn&#x27;t a great deal, but if you&#x27;ve read a popular book by someone of the other, \\&quot;cholesterol camp\\&quot;--Caldwell Esselstyne, fpr instance--you know that he believes the least bit of fish oil, or any sort of oil, can be damaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later: I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that many of the popular heart books, Esselstyne&#x27;s along with the \\&quot;China Study\\&quot; included, say far too little (some totally ignoring the subject) about the role of sugar, insulin overproduction and insulin resistance, and the implications of all this to triglycerides and high blood pressure.  I doubt that Dean Ornish would endorse this product.  Since I&#x27;ve decided that corn syrup, simple sugar, etc. DOES matter--at least for some folks--I&#x27;m reducing my rating by a star, even at the rate of appearing a bit of a sourpuss.  Besides your cholesterol levels, check your blood sugar count and triglyceride levels, both of which contribute to metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, syndrome X, and heart disease.</li>
    <li> I was mainly concerned with my triglycerides as they were astronomically high.  Was prescribed Tricor but refused it after reading possible carcinogen.  Here is my data with no weight loss or change of diet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre-Benecol:&lt;br /&gt;Total cholesterol - 225&lt;br /&gt;Triglycerides - 900&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 6 weeks:&lt;br /&gt;Total Cholesterol - 185&lt;br /&gt;Triglycerides - 500</li>
    <li> Love the creamy caramel taste but haven&#x27;t yet checked my cholesterol numbers so don&#x27;t know yet if these work!</li>
    <li> These were recommended by our Endocrinologist because they contain stanols, but not sterols, and are noted to help lower cholesterol without causing harm.  We&#x27;ve been using them for 4 months, and cholesterol test numbers have been improved.  We prefer to avoid taking Rx drugs whenever possible, and do not like the cost and side effects of statins and other drugs for cholesterol.  Statins also block production of CoQ10, and can cause muscle damage, even kidney damage when rhabdomyolosis occurs (admittedly rare, but still a risk of statins).</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and though my cholesterol count remains above 200 with or without the product, my hope is that it would be higher without it . Call me a dreamer or a cockeyed optimist, but that&#x27;s how I feel.</li>
    <li> this product is pretty good just little expensive it fulfilled  the need and had a great taste to it  with no after breath.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy these to reduce the possibilities of having high cholesterol on my next blood test from my annual exam. I eat 5 per day.  The taste is great although I get a slick feel in my mouth after eating them, but it is not annoying. These are soft chews and similar in texture and taste to a caramel. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> Why someone hasn&#x27;t advertised the heck out of this is beyond me. It is an over the counter product and it works. My cholesterol numbers improved significantly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for over a year, and possibly my chol. has been lowered a little, but who knows really?  I hate taking them, but the alternative is statins. (Another alternative is to ignore cholesterol levels, which may well have nothing to do with heart disease risk if there are no other risk factors, particularly in women.) The new product is greasy, even on the outside, and takes soap to wash off my hands.  It could be the glycerin, but why?  I called the company (there is a toll-free number on the box) to complain about the taste and consistency and ingredients!  They confirmed the reformulation.  They \\&quot;noted\\&quot; my comments and sent me a refund for one of the boxes.  It&#x27;s unlikely anything will change because they just reformulated. The sugar content is the same, but they taste even sweeter than before.  They are granular now, where before they were smooth.  The shape is different but who cares (except they were interested in what I thought about that!).  Mostly why do they have to put all that corn syrup and sugar in (I told them adults were taking this, not children), and why any dye (yellow #5). I urge you to call and complain, they said all the calls had to do with help in finding the product.  When I asked why it was only available online the answer was it&#x27;s always been that way.</li>
    <li> Just got back from the doctor. He reviewed my blood test. Three months ago my cholesterol was 302. I have been taking 5mg of Crestor twice a week and the chews. MY CHOLESTEROL IS NOW 188!!!!! The lowest it has been in years!</li>
    <li> We have been taking the Benecol \\&quot;Smart\\&quot; Chews twice a day with meals ever since they became available.  Based on our lab tests, they must be working -- and they have a\\&quot;yummy\\&quot; taste!  They&#x27;re not easy to find in stores.  Amazon is a great and convenient way to order them!</li>
    <li> I have been using these Benecol Chews for some time now and always loved the taste.  They really were like having a small, satisfying snack.  While I am still going to purchase them because I&#x27;m running out and they really did help lower my cholesterol, they really do taste awful.  They are gritty and I don&#x27;t look forward to having my \\&quot;small snack\\&quot; any longer.  Please change them back to the delicious caramel taste they had!</li>
    <li> My cholesterol was getting high, so I decided to try Benecol.  In one month, it went down 20 points.  I&#x27;ll get another check-up in the spring and hopefully it&#x27;ll be further down.</li>
    <li> I tolerate the taste because I know this is keeping my cholesterol in check.</li>
    <li> Wonderful beginning for my day, and helps to keep my cholesterol down.</li>
    <li> [As evidenced by the &#x27;Not Helpful&#x27; votes on this review, folks apparently don&#x27;t want to hear what I point out below (the idea of popping candy to save your heart is just TOO appealing!), but I&#x27;m going to keep this review available for the reasonable folks out there.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a couple boxes of these and enjoyed them for several months. They are convenient, they legitimately taste good, and supposedly they&#x27;re good for my health -- what&#x27;s not too like? Eventually, I uncovered three problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) My physician mentioned something I hadn&#x27;t realized: 75% of the cholesterol in our bodies is synthesized BY our bodies. Only 25% is ingested through food. Then I read a WebMD article (\\&quot;Cholesterol Control: The Alternatives\\&quot;) which mentioned that plant sterols/stanols like Benecol only block absorption of about 10% of the cholesterol in the food we eat. So essentially, these Smart Chews are blocking 10% of 25%. I&#x27;ll do the math for you... we&#x27;re blocking 2.5% of total cholesterol. Surprisingly, you&#x27;ll find other reviewers reporting much larger cholesterol drops, but then it turns out they&#x27;ve changed their diet, gone on statins, started exercising, or introduced other confounding factors... These are wildy uncontrolled experiments from which it is impossible to draw cause-effect conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The whole idea behind this product is based on the \\&quot;diet-heart hypothesis\\&quot; -- which is the scientific name for the idea that eating cholesterol causes heart disease. At this point, nearly every reputable scientist in the field has dismissed this idea. Ancel Keys -- the father of this hypothesis in the 1940s -- said in 1997: \\&quot;There&#x27;s no connection whatsoever between the cholesterol in food and cholesterol in the blood. . .Cholesterol in the diet doesn&#x27;t matter at all unless you happen to be a chicken or a rabbit.\\&quot; (A reference to the inability of certain animals to process dietary cholesterol). Most researchers now believe the primary causes of heart disease are inflammation and oxidative stress. So if the amount of cholesterol in our body really isn&#x27;t the heart disease driver, what are we doing here with a product to lower cholesterol?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) This might be my own weakness, but I found myself sporadically eating things that I would never normally touch. The guys at work are going for fried chicken? Sure I&#x27;ll join them -- why not! I&#x27;ll just pop a Benecol and feel better about it. It was a strange \\&quot;enabler\\&quot; of bad eating behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, there is very little benefit with this product, but there certainly is cost! If you want to improve your cholesterol, you&#x27;re going to have a much more powerful impact by making some key diet changes (e.g. eat a big salad for lunch most days... eat high HDL foods like walnuts... reduce your carbohydrate intake... etc.).</li>
    <li> pricey. I paid less the last time.</li>
    <li> test are not in as yet</li>
    <li> I take Benecol for more than a year, I use to have all my lipids very high, over the healthy limit, now my figures are excellent.  Before, only with my medications I could not keep my lipids down, now with both of them I am OK !</li>
    <li> This product works very well and lowers cholestrial over 50 points alone. Stay away from stations and do it the natural way</li>
    <li> These really do work!  I didn&#x27;t want to keep buying them until we did a blood test after 1/2 of the product was used, 2 chews a day.  No change in activity level or diet and currently on perscription medication for cholesterol.  Cholesterol was within normal levels after the benecol chews and it didn&#x27;t change much or quickly with medication.  We will keep buying these for sure!</li>
    <li> Just got my blood work back and lowered it by 20 pts.  This is the only thing I have added to helping lower my cholesterol.</li>
    <li> The smart chews taste good and are easy to digest.  I really like them.</li>
    <li> I Buy these 4 times a year, they work, my doctor&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> I would prefer to lower my cholesterol by not eating a candy-like substance with the calories it includes. I deal with this by eating  these Smart Chews at a time in the day when I start to feel hungry. This replaces some other snack that I may eat which keeps my  calories down. The Smart Chews do have somewhat of a waxy taste but since I love caramels I can somewhat enjoy them and hope they are  helping my cholesterol (which I will be getting checked soon). I will continue to use them along with the spread. They both are   rather pricey.</li>
    <li> I bought these after my work had a health screening and I realized I could use to increase my healthy cholesterol.  They taste absolutely great and my good cholesterol has gone up too! I love these things.  They taste so good they could be a candy.</li>
    <li> this really works&#x27; it reduced my cholesterol so much my doctor decided i didn&#x27;t need medication after taking this for a couple of months</li>
    <li> This product allows us who can&#x27;t take Staten&#x27;s a chance to lower our cholesterol. Flavor is caramel and texture is like a tootsie roll. My dietician recommends this product and I have had good results from using it.</li>
    <li> Never helped at all after 3 months use!I don&#x27;t think I would recommend to anyone. I was really hoping it would be a help to me since I can&#x27;t take statin drugs.</li>
    <li> Yes plant sterols help lower your cholesterol, but why pay top dollar for a product that contains partially hydrogenated vegetable oil?!  Get your plant sterols elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Seeing some people say there is a waxy taste and texture, I have found that if I have just had a cold drink, the carmel is waxy.  If my mouth is room temperature or I just had a hot drink, the carmel taste and texture is fine. Don&#x27;t know re blood work yet.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quick and taste great.  Not sure yet how effective it is yet but it&#x27;s easy to take.</li>
    <li> The chews are good.  However, I have by blood tests in a month and will be interested to see if my cholesterol is lower.</li>
    <li> I take 5 a day and will update when my bloodwork is done again.  I am hoping for the best!  The taste is better than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> This product was recommend to my wife by the Heart Institute.  It has done a great job of helping to keep my wife&#x27;s cholesterol in check. She takes 4 chews a day and some diet modification has helped her levels at a safe level.</li>
    <li> The price at Amazon keeps bouncing up and down (tending up), but having a box shipped automatically with the ability to adjust shipment timing as needed, works great.  As for the Benecol itself, the butter version isn&#x27;t cheap and is hard to find, so we prefer these \\&quot;caramel\\&quot;-like chews.  We also use Smart Balance&#x27;s Heart Smart butter spread, which uses stanols/sterols, but stores locally have discontinued it, so it has to be special-ordered at exhorbitant prices, and in a hard-to-store 6-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wife&#x27;s Drs. have had her all over the map with prescription cholesterol drugs for 20+ years, but only since she consistently uses the Benecol chews, Heart Smart spread, and RX Zetia, has her numbers become acceptable.  In the past she&#x27;s used Benecol in a pill form, but I think they quit making it, and it wasn&#x27;t cheap.  Neither are the chews, but Amazon&#x27;s price, though variable, the ease of storage and use and tastiness, and the lab test results all make this a highly viable solution to the cholesterol problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, whenever she&#x27;s used some version of Benecol, her cholesterol numbers dipped.  Having Amazon automatically ship a box every 2-3 months means she for once is consistently using the stuff, and her latest lab tests bare the great results - down to 199 from over 300.  And she&#x27;s been off the Crestor/Lipitor prescription scheme (except Zetia) for 6 months because they make her muscles ache.  As I understand it, Zetia works in the gut like Benecol and Heart Smart, not in the liver like Crestor, etc., so it has had no side effect we&#x27;ve noticed;  but I&#x27;m not sure she even needs the Zetia except to placate the Drs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t restrict your body from manufacturing its own cholesterol like Lipitor or Crestor work, but it definitely will affect your lab results by taking food-sourced cholesterol out of the picture so you won&#x27;t absorb it out of your intestine.  The wife prefers the Benecol because it works and is like eating a piece ofcandy, rather than taking another pill.  I let her have her indulgence, and for my own cholesterol control I watch my diet, use Heart Smart spread instead of butter, and rather inconsistently use Cholest-Off caplets;  but my cholesterol count has always been on the high side of normal without pills anyway.</li>
    <li> My experiment was a success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ate like a pig and took two Benecol chews a day and ate oatmeal intermittently. Unlike my experiment with Colest Off I made no  attempt to be a vegetarian. The results were still promising and show that the Benecol Chews are a potent force in lowering Total Cholesterol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Total Cholesterol with no supplements and no diet change is a scary 287, with Colest Off and a partial vegetarian diet my total cholesterol  is about 197 with a good ratio of HDL to LDL. The Benecol Chews reduced my total to an unimpressive 237, but considering that I ate high cholesterol foods this shows the potency of plant STANOLs.[[ASIN:B000CD0W8U CholestOff 240 cplts]]</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I was unable to tolerate this product.  My stomach hurt daily and with each day it got worse.  Stopped taking the Benicol and the stomach pains went away.  I gave this product a try for 2 weeks, by the end of that period I was in a lot of pain that radiated to my back.  I wished I could have tolerated this product.</li>
    <li> There seems to be some side effect to the Benecol chews.  Eveytime I try one, I get a GI upset and gassiness with nausea.</li>
    <li> After my bad cholesterol hit a high of 167 my doc gave me 3 months to make some changes before we considered medications.  After some research and reading the reviews here I decided to give these chews a try.  I also cut out red meat, cheese, switched to non-fat milk and ate more produce.  I had 2 of these per day for the last 8 weeks, 1 after lunch and 1 after dinner.  I had my repeat blood work done two days ago and my bad cholesterol is now at 177....  :o(  Up 10 points in 3 months.    Glad it works for so many, but don&#x27;t assume they&#x27;ll work for you and don&#x27;t avoid follow-up appointments with your doctor thinking you have nothing to worry about.  You might just be one of the unlucky ones like me...</li>
    <li> Oh man..these taste like candy. I could probably eat the whole container in one sitting - they&#x27;re that delicious. But something bad would probably happen if I ate that much...like plants growing out of my armpits. As a caramel chew its very light, not at all chewy, rather more like soft chocolate fudge consistency with a bit of cake icing texture. Somewhat leaves a slippery residue on the roof of my mouth that goes away pretty quick (most likely the sugar or corn syrup in it). These make a great replacement for candy while I&#x27;m at work.</li>
    <li> AFTER READING ONLINE THE AFFECTS OF YELLOW DYE 6, I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO USE THIS PRODUCT.  I NOTICED THAT I WAS FEELING ANXIOUS AFTER EATING THESE CARAMELS SO AFTER DOING RESEARCH ABOUT THE DYE THAT IS USED, I DECIDED THAT MIGHT BE THE PROBLEM.  I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THE COMPANY CANT REMOVE THIS FROM THEM.  I DID EMAIL THEM TO ASK THAT QUESTION.  THEY JUST EMAILED BACK AND THANKED ME FOR MY INTEREST.</li>
    <li> I had my cholesterol Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120 Soft Chews checked in January of 2007 and it read 270 and trigl. was 145.  I was rechecked in August of 2007 and my cholesterol was 206, but the trigl. went to 300.  I just spoke to my endocrinology doctor and he believes the trigl. elevation has to do with my intake of sugar and losing weight, exercise.  I will be tested in another 3 months for cholesterol level.</li>
    <li> I had high LDL 137 after taking benecol it dropped to 107.  May total was 216 it dropped to 191.  Did nothing for HDL or triglisercides.  It was worth the try did not change eating habits or lose weight.  Not I need to find something to bring up my HDL.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended these for me and she is happy with the results my blood work has shown. They taste good also.</li>
    <li> Great convenient way to get Plant Sterols.  The taste is great and packaging makes it easy to carry with you.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying these Benecol Chews, I am a big chocaholic and I needed something to stop me eating so much chocolate.  Only time will tell if my cholestrol will have dropped, but I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> My niece recommend the Benecol Chews.  They are very easy to take and the taste is very good (reminds me of the good ole carmels).  I am taking them to help reduce my cholesterol. They also help my sweet tooth.</li>
    <li> These tasty nuggets are a great way to help control the issue at hand with cholesterol. they do have an oily texture, especially noticed when it is colder outside, but not an issue.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my dietician. I am now off any  medicine to control Clorestyrol level and using just diet and Benecol  to control it.</li>
    <li> I have been eating 2 benecol chews daily for about 8 months.  My cholesterol has dropped to 180.  I must say that I am also on a cholesterol lowering medication, but I think the chews helped a bit.  Also, I like the taste.  They can be a little waxy , but I don&#x27;t get to eat much candy these days.</li>
    <li> I use to help with cholesterol. Also use Benecol spread. I do find it expensive, but still use. Not too sweet, so a seemingly less guilty treat. I would recommend to others who need a boost with cholesterol.</li>
    <li> While my wife and I like Benecol, I question the pricing.  I purchased this in September, 2009 for $22.00.  Then when I went to reorder some more,  the price had jumped back to $27.99.  That is the exact same price as charged by the other two companies that sell Benecol on the internet.  This product is only available from three internet sources and all are charging the exact same retail price.  That smells of price fixing to me and raises antitrust issues.</li>
    <li> Benecol Smart Chews is a terrific product. It has an effect on cholesterol levels and it tastes good. It may seem like a petty complaint, but I am so tired of taking pills, and I already take a lot of them. Being able to have some positive effect on my health by popping a couple of these Benecol Smart Chews is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add this to the Mediterranean diet and a bit of exercise and you&#x27;ll be contributing to maintaining your health! That&#x27;s certainly worth trying.</li>
    <li> I was recomended to this product by my nutritionist. I took it for two months for lowering cholesterol. It sure did the job. My total cholesterol went from 325 to 205. My LDL went from 146 to 122. I am happy with this product and plan to continue its use.</li>
    <li> I just got my result today and my cholesterol level dropped from 265 to 228 after taking this product for 2 months. I took 2 cews a day for 2 months. I also exercise 3-4 times a week and consume less fat.     I will take 3 chews a day starting tomorrow and will have another test in the next 2-3 months. My target is to get my cholesterol level below 200, and I think I am in the right path to get there.     I think that would be good also if Benecol can bring stanols in a capsule without the sugar.</li>
    <li> Was recommended by my dietitian for Cholesterol control. Have now been taking it for 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.</li>
    <li> It helped reduce my husband&#x27;s cholesterol. Not to mention, its great caramel taste. You should try to believe it.</li>
    <li> Nice and chewy, caramel flavored, individual wrapped servings. Do not know the current progress of cholesterol reduction but am optimistic at this time.</li>
    <li> I took 4 chews  of benecol every day and 5mg Lipitor every other day and reduced my cholesterol from 220 to 140.</li>
    <li> I have been taking these for a month or so and find them not only to be a very effective way to lower my cholesterol, but they taste great (like candy) as well.  No easier or effective way to lower you cholesterol without a script.  They can also be used in conjunction with a script to maximize your ability to lower cholesterol.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I am seeing one of the 84 board certified lipidologists in the U.S. and he strongly recommends Benecol margarine, so when I saw these chews I knew I had to try them. I was having trouble eating 2 tbsp of the Benecol margarine a day, but it is easy to get the recommended amount with these chews. I will have my cholesterol checked again in a couple of weeks, so hopefully it helps along with medication. They really do taste like a caramel candy. I would recommend them highly!</li>
    <li> Once ordered I was updated regularly by email as to item&#x27;s availability and when it would be shipped. Upon arrival everything was perfect. THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!!</li>
    <li> These were real tasty and good and I finished the first batch ahead of time so had to order more. No problems with the order. They make for a great snack but I have not yet checked my cholesterol so unsure if really beneficial. Will be going for my annual checkup in Jan, so will find out if it really works.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old has very high cholesterol (genetic), but we are afraid to give him medication because of the risks.  He has been taking these chews with every meal for some time, and they DO work.  His doctor is not pushing me to give him medication because these are working so well.  I recommend them to anyone looking for a natural way to lower their cholesterol.</li>
    <li> These caramel chews are part of my campaign to keep my cholesterol down after having 3 stents placed in my heart.  They taste good and so far my test results have been excellent.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely not for diabetics, or anyone watching their weight (which most cardiac patients are supposed to do).  It is very high in calories (20 per chew, and they recommend two chews at a time), and it is also high in salt (Sodium 15 mg per chew, 30 per recommended serving).  Salt is somthing cardiac patients are supposed to restrict, or at the least, limit.  I also noted an undesirable thick waxy coating left on the roof of my mouth.  The coating is tasteless (not the candy itself).  One other side-effect I noticed is constipation.</li>
    <li> My cholesterol dropped 33 points in less than 3 weeks!!       I highly recommend this product to anyone who has cholesterol issues.  Give it a try if you have high colesterol.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000NBQUNW Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120 Soft Chews]]    The Smart Chews are a very tasty product but I was looking for a product to reduce my high cholesterol without taking statins.  My results came in today after taking 3 a day for a month.  There was no improvement or very little in my LDL.  HDL was OK.  Smart Chews are a nice candy but that was not the objective.  Sorry to give Benecol a bad review.  Everyone&#x27;s body is different.</li>
    <li> Benecol Carmels are very tasty .  We have not had a cholesterol test  since taking them.  My husband has a test in a couple of days.  We are  watching our diet.  My husband can not tolerate the cholesterol medicine  and hopeful these will make a difference. The web site is easy to use and  they were here within 4 or 5 days.  Thank you for quick servie.</li>
    <li> My doctor wants me on statins but I think the possible side effects are&lt;br /&gt;worse than the cholesterol the drugs treat.  These chews sound like a great idea.  The taste is ok - not great but ok.  However, the texture is yucky.  One reviewer said waxy but to me it&#x27;s more like slimey and the slimey feeling stays after the chew is gone.  I&#x27;ve only had a few so far&lt;br /&gt;and I really don&#x27;t know if I can make it through the bag much less order them again.  The chews may lower cholesterol but only if you can tolerate them and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to do that.  I think the company needs to rework the formula.  It&#x27;s back to the drawing board for me.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s service was great (as it usually is).  They came fast and in perfect condition so it&#x27;s only the product that I&#x27;m complaining about.&lt;br /&gt;I just had another one and actually I&#x27;m not too happy with the taste either.</li>
    <li> It does work! My cholestoral level has decreased since I started using Benecol. It is easy to take . Keep selling it.</li>
    <li> The chews are sweet so it&#x27;s an easy way to get the phytosterols needed to help lower cholestorol. I also use the Benecol spread which I buy in the grocery store. It&#x27;s a good combination to get the daily \\&quot;dose\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using the Benecol chews for several months, planning on getting a cholesterol test, to see if they helped.  Then they went out of stock for several months &amp; I tried another product that I didn&#x27;t like as well.  I was so happy when these came back, since they tasted much better.  They really taste like caramel chews.  HOWEVER, they do leave a little film on the inside of your mouth afterwards.  The film is not too bad; I think of them as little desserts.  I just got back my cholesterol test results and my LDL (bad cholesterol) went down 27 points (from 164 to 137)!  I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
    <li> I have heard from many that chewing 2 of these a day will bring down cholesterol.  I&#x27;m hoping that by January, my chholesterol will be down since it&#x27;s always been high my entire life.  It runs in my family.  I don&#x27;t want to have any health issues now that I&#x27;m getting older, so I thought I would try this out.  My family doctor was optimistic and said to give it three months before getting tested since it takes that long to process in your body and show a significant change.  If all looks well in January, I will DEFINITELY buy more of these!</li>
    <li> The Benecol caramels taste very good and they work surprisingly well.  My cholesterol has been high for years and I couldn&#x27;t take the statins because  of side effects.  I took three caramels a day with meals for only two months and  tested my cholesterol.  It went from 260 to 210 mostly because of a lower LDL which  is my basic problem and no side effects.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have had allergic reactions to other cholesterol lowering products.  I have been taking Benecol Chews for about six weeks and so far, no allergic reactions.  I will be going in for tests in about three weeks and will know then the cholesterol lowering effects of this product.</li>
    <li> When I first started using this product, recommended by my doctor about a year ago, the consistency was very creamy.  Once the packaging was changed--each caramel had been a cube, then it changed to a rectangle--the consistency did also.  It is now grainy.  So far, I&#x27;m continuing to use the product, but I much preferred the earlier version.  What happened to their quality control?</li>
    <li> After making hundreds if not thousands of purchases on amazon this is the first time I have left a review on a product.  This product had very good reviews so I bought it and I feel the good ratings were very misleading so I finaly decided to write a product review.  After eating a couple of these I thought they would be ok.  I have now taken about 20 of these and I can&#x27;t stand them, they leave a greasy white substance on the roof of my mouth and don&#x27;t taste that good either.  The packaging says that 5 of these chewables need to be taken a day to get the recommended 2 g of plant stanols/sterols.  I can hardly force myself to take one a day.  Do yourself a favor and find a pill form.</li>
    <li> Took my LDL from 106 to 66 dL/gm but then I switched to Cholestoff.  Benecol Chews [4 - 5 /day] took my LDL from 108 to 66 dL/gm even though I took 40mg/day of Lipitor. Because it was not candy and was much cheaper, I switched to [what I thought was] an equivalent Cholestoff dose [5 tabs/day] of stanols based upon the information told me by a Nature Made agent. Benecol states the stanol content on the packaging, Colestoff does not. My cardiologist switched me back to the Benecol and my LDL went back to &lt; 70.  [[ASIN:B000CD0W8U CholestOff 240 cplts]][[ASIN:B000MI3DOK Nature Made CholestOff 240 Caplets per Bottle]][[ASIN:B001F1DXF2 Nature Made Cholestoff Complete, Value Size, 120-Count]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t be the only one that stops using this product after they changed the shape and more importantly the flavor of the chews. I just received my most recent shipment of the chews on November 4th, 2010 and I noticed the size of the individually wrapped chews was now rectangular. My first thought was no worries, it&#x27;s all good new shape, same great product. But once popped that Carmel colored rectangle into my mouth I quickly realized that Benecol had changed the flavor of the chew from caramel, to something that tasted like a combination of butter, sugar and caramel flavoring and in a word, YUCK!      The old chews tasted exactly like a piece of caramel, they were actually pretty tasty and even though it helped lower my cholesterol, I actually enjoyed them as a treat. Now I&#x27;ll have to find something else because I just can&#x27;t bring myself to eat something that tastes as bad as these things.     It will be interesting to see how long it takes for Benecol to change the formula again, because I&#x27;m willing to bet that the popularity of the product plummets now that it no longer tastes good. Brain dead move Benecol, no doubt someone loses their job over this blunder!</li>
    <li> These are an easy way to get the plant stanol esters they were recommended by my nutritionist to reduce cholesterol. It has been working</li>
    <li> These are a great way to lower cholesterol. They can be taken on trips (unlike the spread). It really does work if you use it as directed.</li>
    <li> Benecol Chews were recommended to me by my Endocrinologist because I do not tolerate the statin medications.   I haven&#x27;t had a re-check on my lipid profile since I started taking them, so I don&#x27;t know if they work yet or not.   They are tasty, easy to take - and I sure hope they work.[[ASIN:B000NBQUNW Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120-Count Soft Chews]]</li>
    <li> This was exactly as described and came in a safe secure fashion, and very fast, you can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> I just started using this, so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it will work to lower my cholesterol, but I want to alert people to inconsistencies in the labeling. The 120-count package is supposed to be a two month supply. On the front of the box it says \\&quot;take twice a day to reduce cholesterol.\\&quot; If you consumed two per day there would indeed be a 60-day supply in the box. On the back it says, \\&quot;. . . can help you meet the National Cholesterol Education Program Guidelines recommended amount of 2 g plant stanols/sterols per day. To meet this recommendation, enjoy 5 chews per day.\\&quot;     Each candy as 0.7 g of stanol in it, so if you had 5 a day you&#x27;d be getting 3.5 g, not 2. If you want to get around 2 g per day you have to take three of them (2.1 g), which means 120 of them won&#x27;t last 60 days. (And if you consume them at a rate of five a day you won&#x27;t even have enough for a month.)     The research says the minimum effective dose is 0.8 to 1 g per day, and the maximum is 2 g per day; therefore, there&#x27;s no reason to have more than three of these a day, and less than two a day probably won&#x27;t do any good. Natural sources of phytosterols don&#x27;t come anywhere near the recommended intake. For example, a half cup of wheat germ has 197 mg of phytosterols.    They are soft, pleasantly flavored, small, and only 20 calories each. I think they&#x27;re worth a try.</li>
    <li> Benecol Smart Chews taste great and my cholesterol went from 245 to 212!  My blood pressure has also gone down.  I am happy with my results and I would recommend Benecol Smart Chews to anyone who wishes to lower their cholesterol.</li>
    <li> Benecol is easy to take and inexpensive, but it does not comply directly with Prevention magazine&#x27;s scientific research.  The package suggests taking up to 4 \\&quot;chews\\&quot; per day, while Prevention says that amount of plant sterol may actually cause more cholesterol in the body.  Prevention says that 2 grams per day is the ideal amount that should be taken.  Also each chew has .85 grams, so taking 2 chews does not give you the ideal amount.  It would be better to have each chew be 1 gram of plant sterol.</li>
    <li> I have already been able to lower my cholesterol and LDL&#x27;s through my eating plan, and hope to see a difference now that I&#x27;ve started using this product. They taste very much like caramel candy chews. I don&#x27;t know yet if they will affect my cholesterol levels any more, but hope to find out in 5 months. DJ</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended taking a supplement with plant sterols to help my cholesterol levels. Benecol has been a great choice. Since it is good tasting, it&#x27;s easy to remember to pop a chew. Since this product is not sold in stores, I signed up for the Amazon recurring purchase program at a lower price with no shipping cost. This will help me keep taking the Smart Chews on a regular basis. I can&#x27;t wait to see if my next doctor&#x27;s visit shows a good result.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended I eat 2-3 of these a day to help with my cholesterol numbers.  I have only tried them for a few weeks.  Too early to tell if they will help, but they do taste very good.</li>
    <li> Lowered my cholesterol 25% in just 4 months with this product.  You just have to be diligent about it.</li>
    <li> These are so good. My husband and I heard about these through friends.  They however are disciplined to take two each after their evening meal in place of any kind of dessert.  On the other hand, we ate them all day long.  They are expensive but so good.</li>
    <li> Benecol Smart Chews have been great for lowering my cholesterol. They are so convenient to take along if I am going out and it&#x27;s time for me to take them.  I was also using the Benecol spread but have not been able to find it in the stores lately.    Thank you for the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Smart Chews since Sept. 2007 and they really have worked to lower my cholesterol. No side effects like regular medications and the lab results speak for themselves. I am very pleased and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> My HLD cholestrol is bad so I was looking for ways to improve without a perscription medication.  I have only been taking this for a short time so I have not had any blood work done to check.  They are good tasting--tastes like caramel.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my cardiologist to lower the ldl cholesterol. So far it has worked fine for me.  The only thing I dont like is that it also lowers your good cholesterol- hdl and if you stop for a little while the ldl goes up.  what can you recommed for this effect.  Secondly, I would like to see that you are allowed to order an item say every 4 months because if you take 2 tabs a day for 30 days it lasts for two months only and you do not have a slot for 4 month period only shows 2 months and 6 months.  Thank you</li>
    <li> This is an easy way to follow my doctor&#x27;s orders.  The chews are tasty and hopefully will get the results he is after for my cholesterol control.  Benecol Smart Chews are only available on-line, not in stores and getting it through Amazon.com was easy and quick.</li>
    <li> I have been using Benecol chews for several months now.  I am one of those who absolutely cannot take statins to lower my cholesterol.  The statins will lower my cholesterol...but they cause a lot of other problems.  I do not know if the Benecol alone would lower my cholesterol because I am on Niaspan also, but my total cholesterol is down, my HDL is up, my LDL is down as well as my triglycerides.  The number and size of my LDL particles has also decreased greatly.  Research has now determined the more particles you have, the more likely they are to stick together and therefore cause blockages.  Give Benecol a try.  I will continue to use them.  I also use Benecol spread that can be found at most grocery stores.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> The product was delivered promptly.  I have been taking it as directed.  I will be able to give you a better review the next time that I go see my doctor and have my BP taken and cholesterol checked.  We will revisit this by the spring.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I just got these..a wee bit expensive, but maybe they will come down soon if enough people know about it. I asked my 3 pharmacy&#x27;s near my house about this product and no one heard. The pharmacist said she will look into it to carry it. I told her I will do a test for the next two months to see if it works:) Started  JANUARY 5th  I diet, exercise and use promise super smart drink everyday. I will report results  here on my next doctors appointment:)    Update- I used this and it did work while I used it:)</li>
    <li> We are still on the first 3 months of a trial to see if Benecol will reduce my husband&#x27;s cholesterol.  This product was recommended by his doctor after taking prescription medications which produced awful side effects.  We are hoping the answer is Benecol.</li>
    <li> By using Benecol Chews I have lowered my cholesterol by 20 points.  My husband lowered his by 40 points. The chews are like carmel candies and easy to take twice a day after each meal.  Janet Woods</li>
    <li> This really helped my cholesterol number, combined with a change of diet and exercise.</li>
    <li> If I would have looked at the ingredients before purchasing, I would not have purchased this product.  The first two ingredients are sugar and corn syrup. There is also soy lecithin, which I try to avoid, if possible.  Just be aware that the use of the words smart chews may be misleading, if you try to avoid certain ingredients in \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; products.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my cardiologist to reduce my pretty-high cholesterol. I was, as always, skeptical of \\&quot;naturo-pathic\\&quot; type remedies. After one (1) month of daily use as recommended my total cholesterol decreased 78%. I am not on statins or those types of meds so this was almost a stand-alone effect as I barely adjusted my diet or exercise-level. It didn&#x27;t seem to negatively effect my other blood test results during this period. I am still in shock but plan to keep chewing. Imagine what will happen if I get off my butt &amp; exercise and eat more veggies!! I am not a fan of the caramel/butterscotch like flavor but that&#x27;s just my taste preference issue--like strawberry or pistachio ice-cream. To me, the results are well worth the temporary endurance of caramel taste that food or water quickly washes away. Again, wow!</li>
    <li> I have been on 10 mgs of Lipitor for about seven years. I thought I might be able to get my cholesterol down even further by taking the chews. I don&#x27;t eat meat, eat sensibly, count calories (I&#x27;m not obsessed), exercise at least three days a week, no alcohol. I&#x27;ve been taking the chews since February. My cholesterol is approx what it was last year (prior to the chews), 184, but my triglycerides are now in the borderline high zone. Not sure what happened but I&#x27;m off to the doctor&#x27;s to see what I can do about it. I&#x27;m glad it works for some and wish it worked for me. :(</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to a group of us ladies by a cardiologist who spoke at one of our meetings.  She said her patients were getting fantastic results taking this to help them lower their cholesterol (LDL levels).  My LDL needs to be lowered by 20 points and I don&#x27;t want to take medication.  So, I decided to give this a try.  I have taken it for two months but it will be a few more months before I have my cholesterol level checked.  At that time, I will know if this works.  In addition to taking this, I&#x27;ve been eating steel cut oatmeal for breakfast and have cut way back on beef.</li>
    <li> The product is tasty, which is good since I have cut out sweets.  Have not had a blood test to confirm that the product actually does have any effect on my cholesterol count.  My problem now is that I am trying to reorder and nobody at Amazon can provide any idea of when the product will be in stock.  Almost out.  Will have to order from some site other than Amazon.</li>
    <li> My physician, who practices alternative medicine, recommended Bencol for chlosterol control, among othet holistic remedies. It is like eating candy, it is so delicious,  Benecol takes the place of other sweets and for me, kills the urge to &#x27;cheat&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Not Available on Amazon anymore!  Not sure why but Amazon said the product is not available and cancelled my order</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this product to a variety of friends who have only slightly elevated cholesterol and did not want to start taking statins yet. Dropped my overall cholesterol from 217 to 196--used these and cut back on my cheese addiction.  I don&#x27;t eat much red meat, eggs, etc, however, and stay away from any product that has transfats. Sadly, they are NOT as effective on  LDL as on total cholesterol.  But still worth the money!</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this product for help in reducing my cholesterol count.  I&#x27;ve been taking 2 a day for a month and honestly, I can heat them like  candy - they are sooooo good. I haven&#x27;t gone for lab  work, so I don&#x27;t know if they helping to reduce my numbers.  I&#x27;ll review again after I have my lab work done in August.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are talking about. I love the taste of this product! I have never heard of it until a few days ago and I was almost turned off by some reviewers saying that it tastes bad, grainy, gooey and sticks to your fingers. well, I decided to take a leap of faith and order one. I got it today and ate 5 pieces on the spot!! DELISH!!! tastes like werther&#x27;s original to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this review is strictly for the taste of this product, not on the effectiveness. I&#x27;ll post another review in about 4 months when I have my cholesterol recheck.</li>
    <li> NOW I AM GOING TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE WITH HIGH CHOLESTEROL. IN NOV.2011, I HAD BLOOD WORK AND MY BAD CHOLESTEROL WAS, 196-(LDL), 60-(HDL), &amp; TRIG.-146. I WAS TOLD TO BEGIN STATINS. HOWEVER, WITHIN DAYS OF TAKING STATINS I BECAME EXTREMELY WEAK, AND MY MUSCLES WERE SORE. MY DOCTOR TOLD ME TO DISCONTINUE USE. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, I ORDERED BENECOL CHEWS IN 12/2011. FOR THREE MONTHS I ATE ANYWHERE FROM 4-TO-5 A DAY. ON 3/2012, I HAD BLOOD WORK AGAIN AND MY (LDL) NOW IS-144, 63-(HDL), &amp; TRIG.-173. I AM A LONG WAY FROM IDEAL CHOLESTEROL LEVELS, BUT WITH A CHANGE IN MY DIET, THIS WAS A GOOD START WITHOUT MEDICATION SO NORMALLY PRESCRIBED. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE WITH HIGH LDL.</li>
    <li> Seems to have lack of consistency in manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;some are very waxy which sticks to dentures</li>
    <li> Not sure if they actually help lower cholesteral. I have stopped taking them.</li>
    <li> After using this product for 6 months, I lowered my cholesterol by 20 points. My doctor even asked me the name of the product I am using so that he could refer to it with other patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10-08-13 Follow-up: The product is still working wonderfully. But, the price has increased dramatically at this store (IPROZON) and many others on Amazon. Drugstore.com has it for 27.99! The stores on Amazon are price gouging this product!</li>
    <li> Great for lowering cholesterol; I have always had a very high cholesterol reading and this product has reduced my cholesterol to below the maximum amount I should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;28MAY2014 I have increased my intake of chews to 4 per day and if my cholesterol continues to lower I will be a very happy camper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;19JUL2014 The company that makes this product should exercise better Quality Control as about 33% are not the same size.  The 33% are always smaller and not as well wrapped.</li>
    <li> I always liked Benecol Smart Chews and I looked forward to taking them.  They are not only good for lowering cholesterol(My reports have told me so), but they also tasted good.  It was just like a caramel candy and it was square and dry and chewy.  I do not like the new taste and new shape.  It is long and narrow.  I can&#x27;t even get the foil off without tearing it apart.  It is sticky and oily.  I do not enjoy them anymore.  I gave it only three stars.  I suppose they still work to lower cholesterol, but I will not be buying them anymore, because I do not like the new shape and taste and feel. If Benecol Smart Chews go back to the former shape and taste, I will give it a higher rating and continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> This is a taste good product for those of us with s cholesterol problem.  It does help to a degree in reducing the problem and is valuable for people who cannot tolerate the statin medications</li>
    <li> These worked! I was able to bring my cholesterol down 52 mg in 2 months with these! I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> The product did nothing for my cholesterol.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work as I can&#x27;t take statins.  after only two chews I developed severe diahrrea and stomach pain.  the stomach pain was so bad I was up all night.  I am retired and was very disappointed to learn I can&#x27;t return it.  I don&#x27;t have the 44 bucks to just throw in the trash.  please consider something else.  too expensive andno possibility of return.</li>
    <li> Works great to help my wife&#x27;s cholesterol to stay in tacked</li>
    <li> Good experience - I noticed no change in Benecol Smart Chews as far as the taste and ease of use!  However!  What made the price double from the last box that I purchased??  I can&#x27;t afford to purchase it anymore now.  So sorry!  I&#x27;ll miss you Benecol Smart Chews!  You have been helping cut my cholesterol.  Jane Hinckley</li>
    <li> I recently purchased Benecol chews to help lower my cholesterol. Haven&#x27;t taken them long enough for positive results yet, but they are sweet and delicious. The price is reasonable. Will be better able to comment once I have used them for a longer period of time. If they work, I will use them every day and will recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> I placed my first order a couple of weeks ago.  Paid something like $23. Decent taste. Easy to incorporate into my cholestrol-reducing plan. If they work (too early to know), yippeee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I went to place a reorder on Amazon this weekend, they were first $42/box. And now $39.  What&#x27;s up with this?  Heck, I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t sign up for the automatic reorder.  More like automatic lighten wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are still around $23 on Drugstore.com with a limit of 2, and that&#x27;s where I placed my reorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, I don&#x27;t get what you are doing with this.  2 weeks ago they were available from Amazon.  Now they seem to be only available through Amazon stores at stupidly inflated prices.</li>
    <li> We use this item for my teenage daughter who already has high cholesterol due to a strong family history of same.  It&#x27;s much easier and more convenient than taking the pills, and less expensive.  She thinks the taste is good as well.  I can&#x27;t say for sure whether they are effective in bringing down cholesterol or not.  However, my daughter&#x27;s recent bloodwork shows significantly decreased cholesterol levels, so it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> This product, along with some other supplements and giving up cheese :&gt;), helped reduce my cholesterol from 254 to 165--chose to try this before statin drugs.  Really worked and now no need to take the statins!!</li>
    <li> We like the taste and the ease of taking the medication. So far no side effects have been noted. We will rate this product again after our first lab results to see whether or not it helped in lowering our cholesterol.</li>
    <li> product arrived in good order and now I must wait for my next blood test to see how effective it is.</li>
    <li> I no longer wanted to take lipitor for my high cholesterol. After consulting my doctor, I stopped my medication, started an exercise program and changed my eating habits. Eating less red meat along with more Oatmeal, fruits, vegetables and Benecol Smart Chews brought my total cholesterol down from 240 to 198.      Gil</li>
    <li> My cholesterol numbers have definetely dropped.  There was a drop also in the triglcerides and a change in LDL and HDL.  I have lab work coming up soon and hopefully the test will confirm that sterols play a role in lower cholesterol numbers.  If this works then Smart Chews are an easy and convienent way to aid in dropping cholesterol numbers. As of this date I highly recommend the Chews.</li>
    <li> I have seen a drop in my total cholesterol and LDL-not dramatic, but enough that I don&#x27;t need to go on cholesterol-lowering medication .</li>
    <li> I found the Benecol Smart Chews to be tasty and easy to take.  I won&#x27;t know the good that they did until I go for blood work on Dec. 15.  I&#x27;ll let you know how I did.  Kathie Wilkes</li>
    <li> bought this product to try to lower my cholesterol  it is a very tasteful product. I went for a check on my cholesterol this  morning and I will get the results on Wed. December 17, 2008.  If my cholesterol has gone down I will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> I used the product and saw improvement in my total cholesterol and LDL.  It tastes good and is convenient to use.  I keep some at home and some in my desk at work.</li>
    <li> Can not rate yet as far as results until I have eaten for a couple of months and go to the lab to have cholesterol check.  Would like to rate again at that time.  Tastes good though - no problem with that.</li>
    <li> This product is a natural way to lower cholesterol. The chews have a caramel flavor and are easy to take. I do not know if they are actually lowering my cholesterol because I have only been using them for a few weeks. I read others&#x27; reviews and was pleased to see that the reviewers were positive about the product. The Chews arrived very soon after I ordered them--much more quickly than I had anticipated.</li>
    <li> Have only just started taking this suppliment so have not had any labwork that will tell me whether my \\&quot;numbers\\&quot; have improved but it is not a bad tasting thing if you like caramel.  Will give it 4 months, have labs rechecked and will be able to tell you more then:)</li>
    <li> I have been taking Benecol for 3 mos now.  Three mos ago, my Dr wanted me to start a statin, instead I ordered Benecol and ate healthier.  Fruits, veggies, lean protein.  Cut way back on red meat and lowered carb intake.  New lab work done 2 weeks ago and my results were better.  I believe the Benecol is helping along with the changes I made.  I do not want to take a statin until it is absolutely necessary.  I will continue with Benecol and a healthy diet with added exercise.</li>
    <li> The chews have helped me change my cholesterol and fat numbers for the better. I&#x27;ve ordered 3 containers from Amazon. The first two were great. When I opened the third batch, the wrappers on the chews were slightly sticky. The chews themselves were different from my first two experiences in that they were waxy and opaque on the surface. The waxy/stickiness made them difficult to unwrap and I tend to just have to squeeze them out of the wrapper. I&#x27;m guessing they were stored/transported at too high a temperature and melted at some point but really have no idea. I&#x27;m hoping that my next order is not like this one. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> These were recommended by a cardiac rehab center to lower cholesterol.  I was skeptical but my total cholesterol had risen above 200 and I didn&#x27;t want to take medicine.  Started taking the chews the end of Jan. 09 two per day for a couple months, then upped it to 4 per day for a month and a half.  Just had my blood tested and the total dropped from 231 to 172.  I exercise everyday same as before eating the \\&quot;chews\\&quot; and eat healthy but don&#x27;t avoid ice cream or desserts.  I think these are the way to go and avoid the side effects of drugs.</li>
    <li> My cholesterol had been high -- 265 - for some time.  I did NOT want to take statins, so I tried many methods said to lower cholesterol, like eating oatmeal everyday, cutting out red meat, and exercising.  That dropped my cholesterol to 257.  However, after using Benecol -- taking one or two chews with a meal twice a day -- for five months, my cholesterol is now 219!  I am thrilled.  I have referred several other friends to this wonderful product.  Some people like to eat a \\&quot;chocolate mint\\&quot; after meals, I eat a Benecol chew !  Thank you for carrying this product.</li>
    <li> Legitimate controlled medical tests prove these things lower cholesteral.  As a bonus they are a great way to satisfy your sweet tooth after dinner (instead of a fattening dessert).</li>
    <li> Iam taking Benecol because my Cardiolagist recommend them because I have a problem taking Cholestrol medication like statin drugs.The taste is great , I got the Carmel . My Cardiolagist recommend that I take one before or after each meal. He takes them after his meal it is like a treat for him.</li>
    <li> This product, which I take after lunch and dinner is delicious.  I feel like I am having dessert.&lt;br /&gt;And the best news is that it has kept my cholesterol under 200.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to exercise as often as I used to and I have been eating out and drinking alcohol which leads to consumption of more greasy food. after taking this for a few weeks I went to get my general blood-work done and my doctor indicated that my cholesterol was perfect. Very high good cholesterol and low bad cholesterol</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t have this at stores, I had checked and I can only find it at Amazon and on their website. I like it because i can take eat it twice a day, taste good and it works.</li>
    <li> I rated the Benecol Smar Chews, Caramel 5 stars because the Chews have greatlyhelped me reduce my cholesterol and blood sugar levels!!!!!</li>
    <li> My cholesterol doctor and dietitian recommended that I chew one of these 2 - 3 times daily with meals. They actually taste like caramel.  I don&#x27;t know if they work yet as I am not due to have a cholesterol lab until the end of January.  One word of caution, don&#x27;t chew these and take a drink of cool water afterwards.  What is left of the chew in your mouth will stick to the roof of your mouth like glue.  I take these in the middle of a meal and that does the trick.</li>
    <li> This stuff works to lower cholesteral and the bad ldl&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve been taking it for years because I cannot take statin drugs to lower my cholesteral.  My numbers have gone from about 250 to 180.  However, this is combined with a low fat diet.  No easy solutions.  But this product works in conjunction with eating low fat, vegetarian pretty much diet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for a couple of years and my cholesterol has gone down.  Highly recommend this seller and product.</li>
    <li> Such a great price and a good product</li>
    <li> I have now taken the Benecol caramels for about 8 months.  Other then the caramels, I kept my diet the same including the consumption of one dish of ice cream per day.  My LDL (bad cholesterol) dropped from 132 which was borderline high to 105.  My good cholesterol (HDL) went up from 52 to 64.  Samuel J. Orr III</li>
    <li> bought the benecol chews to try to bring down my overall cholesterol level.  i&#x27;m not real clear about how many to eat per day - between 2 and 4 with meals is what i&#x27;ve been doing so far. they are quite tasty although they tend to leave a cardboard type residue on the roof of my mouth, but it will be all worth it if my numbers come down.  i&#x27;ll let you know in july when i go back for my annual checkup.</li>
    <li> These are delicious.  If you are concerned about your cholesterol at all, give these a try.</li>
    <li> I purchased these chews at the request of my mom, who had read about them.We were both sorely disappointed, in that they start out OK, but as you near the end of eating one, you are left with a waxy film on your mouth, tongue and lips, which needs to be scrubbed off with a toothbrush!  It is disgusting!  And I wrote repeatedly to the company, asking for a refund, and telling them of the problem, and have never heard back.    A terrible way to do business, but a good idea.  The other company&#x27;s calcium chews do NOT have this problem!</li>
    <li> I have phenomenally high HDL (&gt;100), which is great, but my LDL was creeping up---it got to 160.  I&#x27;m vegetarian.  I cut out nearly all dairy fat, added ~15 almonds/day and ~3g/day of psyllium, and started taking 1 Smart Chew 3 times/day.  My HDL remained the same, but my LDL dropped to 120, a 25% decrease!  I am a very happy camper!  My only complaint is that the product contains Yellow 6.  I&#x27;ve written to the company requesting that they remove it; if enough of us do that, maybe they&#x27;ll comply.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000NBQUNW Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120-Count Soft Chews]]  I am using my second 2 month supply.  These are a tasty way to lower cholesterol. I will have a fasting test in October and am optomistic that my cholesterol will be down.</li>
    <li> The product was deliveried on time. I have not had a Cholestrol test to see if the product did in fact perform as advertised but I will be doing that within the next 2 months. The product is very good and easy to take.</li>
    <li> they gave me a very bloated feeling in my stomach and a strange taste on my tongue.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that my cholesterol specialist is pleased that my cholesterol numbers are almost perfect - just need a little higher HDL. The only problem with the product is that the wrapping is so tightly fastened to the product that it is a bit hard to unwrap.  The product itself is tasty and almost like a small dessert :&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> The product lives up to its claim.  I was having trouble lowering my cholesterol and found several websites talking about Benecol products.  It sounded like it might be worth it,so i tried it, and it worked. Within a couple months of eating 3 per day (plus using their butter spread product) my cholesterol dropped from a warning level to a mid range regular level that I just have to watch what I eat now.  Part of what i think was the key is making sure to get enough of the plant stanol esters per day.  I did some research to find out how much I would need to consume for my body size to make a difference before buying them.  They taste good, just like a regular caramel soft candy from the candy section of the grocery store.  The only draw back that gave it a four star rating is that they are expensive to buy.  But they did work, and I don&#x27;t need prescription meds now, so it was worth it in the long run.</li>
    <li> I took the Benecol to lower LDL..It did..from 146 to 124... in 3 weeks.  My triglyderides rose from 155 to 198.. Also, my T.cholesterol declined to 198&lt;br /&gt;and my HDL went down to 37.. So, back to eating healthy food and exercising MORE.&lt;br /&gt;I had gotten off the fish oil too. Today&#x27;s new food is brussel sprouts,  Vitamin C 3 times a day and maybe niacin 3X tomorrow. My BMI with the machine went down..&lt;br /&gt;Got any natural ways to lower plaque(LDL) in arteries?</li>
    <li> I watch Dr. Oz, and he recommended to get cholesterol down, to use Benecol. I now use the \\&quot;butter\\&quot; which is GREAT, and decided to get the chews also. They certainly do NOT taste like caramel, more like butterscotch. A bit grainy, but doable. I will continue with the spread, as the chews are too expensive. They also say you need to eat 5 to get the benefit of a lower cholesterol.</li>
    <li> Love the caramel flavor and texture. Had high hopes for this product as my cholesterol is extremely high and I cannot tolerate the statins in normal medications. Used the butter for about three weeks before the chews. Extremely expensive but does it work? After about a week on the chews I noticed that my stomach was not feeling normal. A couple more days and constipation set in. I stopped taking the benecol and started stool softeners and laxatives. After about two weeks my system somewhat returned to normal. Side effects include but are not limited to constipation.</li>
    <li> We were very well pleased with the Benecol Chews &amp; the promptness of the delivery.</li>
    <li> I started using this product by chewing 1 chew after each of my 3 meals a day and 5 weeks later had my lst blood test.  The stunning news was my Cholesterol had dropped 43 points and 41 of those points was the LDL, which we call the \\&quot;Low Down Lipids\\&quot; because it&#x27;s the bad stuff in your arteries. That huge drop was due to the Benecol Chews AND without medication. Nothing else in my health regimen had changed except this....so I am very pleased and will stay on these as long as they make them and/or the FDA makes them stop making them because they work!</li>
    <li> Benecol was recommended by my doctor in an attempt to lower my cholesterol.  I checked out the spread and it was so expensive &amp; then saw the chews on amazon.  I thought I would try them.  They are very tasty and no problem at all to take after meals.  I will not know for another few weeks if they did have an affect on my cholesterol or not.  I sure hope they did.  What a sweet way to take your medicine.  More like candy than a treatment!</li>
    <li> My total cholesterol was reduced by 16 points and LDL went down 10 points after 4 months and that was by having only 2 chews per day.</li>
    <li> Benecol Smart Chews have been a part of my daily regimen for almost two years. The plant stanols have definitely helped to lower the \\&quot;lousy\\&quot; LDL cholesterol (in conjunction with a doctor-prescribed statin), and I&#x27;ve recommended them to all my friends. The label states that Benecol can be taken 4 times a day, but my clinician advised me to take only two, and I still had dramatic results in only four months, and have maintained benefit since. By the way, I like Amazon.com&#x27;s automatic shipping option so I never have to reorder or run out. There&#x27;s no obligation to accept subsequent orders, and it lowers the purchase price and shipping is free. The Smart Chews taste like candy, so it&#x27;s like eating a caramel (that doesn&#x27;t stick in your teeth) after breakfast and dinner.</li>
    <li> The chews do not taste bad - but the buttery spread is better.  I probably will not buy them again.</li>
    <li> just start using this product so I do not have sufficiant expirience</li>
    <li> If you like caramel chews and need to lower your cholesterol. No Brainer! Buy it!</li>
    <li> These are soft and chewy - have a sort of butterscotch / caramel / peanut butter taste. Nothing very distinct, but not unpleasant. They remind me of those &amp;#34;space sticks&amp;#34; protein snacks from the 70&#x27;s. The thing I did not care for is after you eat it, the inside of your mouth gets an unpleasant &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; that you need to wash or brush out. I&#x27;ll finish up this container but going forward I&#x27;m going to try the CholestOff plant sterol pills instead.</li>
    <li> My Doctor told me to eat Benecol to help lower my cholesterol. He said it&#x27;s been proven to work. Benecol is very expensive and this is a more affordable alternative to the spread I purchase at the store.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give much of a review until I have my cholesterol drawn which won&#x27;t be until this summer......I received them in a timely manner and they taste great....after my cholesterol is drawn, I&#x27;ll be able to tell you just how good they are.....</li>
    <li> I was faced with a choice of moving to a higher dosage of Lipitor or trying something different. I had bypass surgery in 2003 and have never really had high cholesterol (above 200), but I have been on some sort of statin since then. I take my medication religiously though, So when my primary care physician wanted to up my dosage I really didn&#x27;t want to go that route. I had a office visit with my cardiologist 2 days later and told him. He suggested taking 2 of the Benecol chews per day and see if that did the trick. To make a long story short I did that until my next blood work. My overall cholesterol dropped by 15 points to 150 and my LDL dropped from 100 to 72 (70 is what I am told for heart patience is the goal). The HDL(good cholesterol) went from 39 to 44 - with 40 being the least they want for me. I am pleased and just about to buy 2 more 120 ct for the next blood work.</li>
    <li> My nutritionist recommends these b/c I have high cholesterol.  They taste great.  They are also hard to find so get them on AMZN for fresh product, quick delivery and a good price.</li>
    <li> On my second container of Benecol Smart Chews.  Pleasant sweet taste.  I try to take a total of 3-4 chews a day in order to get the suggested requirement of the plant stanol esters, usually with the meals that are higher in cholesterol.  Will have lab bloodwork done soon.  Hope to give it 5 starts if it truly has lowered my cholesterol.</li>
    <li> I lowered my cholesterol count with Benecol Smart Chews.  My doctor wanted me to go on statins but I asked to try this first and the results convinced my doctor to keep me off statins.  The Smart Chews taste good and are easy to take.  Be aware that taking plant sterols will affect your bowel movements.</li>
    <li> Husbands numbers when down from 230 to 180 in about 8 months.  Granted he did also make some minor diet intake adjustments (cutback on bacon &amp; fried foods) but he was never big on that stuff to begin with and still does have the occasional piece of bacon or French fries &amp; burger.  One of his co-workers recommended it as it had reduced his numbers and some of his friends.</li>
    <li> These chews are easy to use and tasty.  But, you will surely follow them with something as they leave a coating on the roof of your mouth.  And, there are 30 calories per serving (2 chews).</li>
    <li> These work wonderful for me, but unfortunately it appears that Benecol has stopped making them.  Very sad.</li>
    <li> Product seem to work.  Feels like you are having a piece if candy while being good for you.&lt;br /&gt;Benecol was recommended by a friend. Happy she did.</li>
    <li> A little on the waxy side.</li>
    <li> When I received this product I was horrified that they actually put corn syrup in it. I immediately put in for a refund and Amazon tells me it isn&#x27;t eligible for a refund.. If you want to put corn syrup into your body, that&#x27;s fine, but I I sure don&#x27;t. . To top it off, the first ingredient is sugar, 2nd is corn syrup. What&#x27;s wrong with these people?</li>
    <li> I could not calculate the right amount to take but combined with a lower dose of lipitor my cholesterol level really lowered significantly.</li>
    <li> I have been through every cholesterol lowering drug that can be prescribed.  They all caused me muscle pain.  I saw this on Amazon and decided it was worth a try.  I have just received my blood work results and after 3 months, taking two chews a day, my cholesterol has gone from 254 to 218 (good for me as my problem is considered \\&quot;familial\\&quot; (not from the food I eat).  My HDL went up to 50 and my LDL went from 177 to 144. I did not change my diet. Cholesterol ratio is now 4.4 with 5 being the optimum.  Finally I have found something to help without causing me pain and it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg!</li>
    <li> 5 Benecol chews are required to lower cholesterol.  I thought that at one time before the chews were discontinued, only 2 were required.  5 chews have too much sugar, but I suppose that I will continue to use them for awhile.  I am trying to combine the chews with Benecol margarine so that I can take both fewer chews and less margarine.</li>
    <li> I tried this product several years ago with great success, and was disappointed when they stopped making it.  I tried managing my cholesterol through diet and exercise, but the numbers crept back up. After 2 months of 2 chews per day, my cholesterol is down 40 points!</li>
    <li> I finally got my cholesterol down to a level that my doctor is happy with. Prescription medications alone never worked in spite of  very healthy diet habits. Seems that I have the wrong ancestors. Now I can even eat eggs more often then the once a week I had been sticking to. Plus they are so tasty that you think you have had candy. I like to take mine with a handful of walnut pieces and think I&#x27;ve had dessert. I do continue taking my prescription also. [[ASIN:B000NBQUNW Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120-Count Soft Chews]]</li>
    <li> This is a great way to get your plant sterols to lower cholesterol.  They are very tasty - easy to take with you and since you chew them, you don&#x27;t need to find water to take them when you are out.  They taste just like a very soft caramel.  Hopefully they lower my cholesterol as well as capsule plant sterols have in the past.  Once I take a blood test, I will post results and let everyone know.  Really convenient and great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking that it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.  My doctor had recently told me that my LDL cholesterol was high.  After only two months of using it, my LDL cholesterol dropped by 40 points.  I no longer have to consider a statin drug.  I have been telling everyone I know to buy it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now and believe it helps me keep my cholesterol under control.  The taste is very pleasing.</li>
    <li> For a health product, why does this contain high fructose corn syrup ? The additive provides no value to a person and according to current research may actually be harmful. Benecol should offer it sugar free. If Coke &amp; Pepsi can offer sugar free products, why can&#x27;t Benecol ?</li>
    <li> They taste good, very sweet and I can almost us it as dessert.  I have not had my cholesterol re-checked though so I don&#x27;t know if they are really working.  Glad to get them on Amazon since they are only available on-line.</li>
    <li> according to him you should take 2 each evening with supper.  Hubby and I both started and both our numbers went down!  MD also said a person would be incapable of using enough of the Benecol spread to see a benefit.  I tend to have a sensitive stomach and found I could not tolerate them without a unacceptable to me amount of loose stools but hubby has no GI distress whatsoever.  I do kind of miss taking them each evening - they honestly are delicious!</li>
    <li> Great product for me. Helped get my LDL down to 51 as well as other numbers in the Lipid Panel. Used to purchase for Amazon for around 32.00 to 35.00 per box of 120. Lately have been purchasing from drugstore.com. Purchased 2 boxes of 120 just yesterday for a bottom line total of $41.00 and change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is the price difference so great between Amazon and drugstore.com?</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had lol levels checked but they&#x27;re very sweet. Would like them more if they weren&#x27;t so sweet. Good way to curb the sweet tooth.</li>
    <li> We have been using benecol products for the past few years. They work and has kept our cholesterol at normal ranges. We took a proactive approach due to family members having high cholesterol and I&#x27;m glad we started this regime!</li>
    <li> I have been using these chews for some time.  I also use the Benecol Spread (1 TBS per day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am most happy to say that I brought my cholesterol down from 341 ti 246 in a matter of several months. I will continue to take these about twice a day and sometimes three times.  You need to be careful not to take more than that as the plant stenols have a slightly&#x27;easing&#x27; effect on bowel movements. Helpful at times !</li>
    <li> My cholesterol went from 240 to 167 in 6 weeks.  It taste like candy, and I would recommend it if you like caramel.</li>
    <li> I say \\&quot;seemed to work\\&quot; because I did not use these in isolation. I used them as part of the diet outlined on the \\&quot;Cholesterol Down: Ten Simple Steps to Lower Your Cholesterol in Four Weeks--Without Prescription Drugs\\&quot; book by Janet Brill, and I lowered my total cholesterol from 255 to 173 in 3 1/2 weeks.  Since my results have been amazing, I am not planning on changing a thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years. Within the first 3-4 months my cholesterol was down 30 points. I may not remember every day but I try to take them on a regular basis. At last count my cholesterol was down from 235 to 186. I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Have been taking one chew at lunch and one chew with dinner. Am also taking satins; however, I could never get my LDL below 100. After taking Benecol Chews for three months my LDL came in at 71.  My MD was flabergasted.  If I come in low again in three months I plan on cutting back on satins.  If you want to lower your LDL&#x27;s give Benecol a try</li>
    <li> This reviewer was \\&quot;pushed\\&quot; to try these chews by his dietician in response to high cholesterol. Carmel flavored, they are taken twice a day at mealtime-and they work. The chews are not available at retail, so outlets like amazon are the sole choices.  If there is a downside to Benocal, this reviewer/consumer has yet to discover it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER! Since writing the original message (above), this reviewer experienced major availability problems with this product. As it is unavaiable at retail, there was no no alternative but to go on a prescription drug. This situation can always recur. For safety sake, Benecol isn&#x27;t worth it, no matter how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;At least Crestor, Lipitor and similar formulations are always there at your corner drug store-side effects notwithstanding.</li>
    <li> I have been using Benecol Chews for about seven months now. I must say, I was not at all&lt;br /&gt;sure they would do much for my cholesterol, but boy was I wrong. I had a cholesterol test&lt;br /&gt;done last January and had a reading of 281. Had it rechecked in April and it dropped to 230.&lt;br /&gt;My doctor was really impressed with a 51 point drop in just 3 months. I will have it checked&lt;br /&gt;again in November. If it wasn&#x27;t a fluke, should be below 200 by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to this product is the foil wrapping they come in. There seems to be a&lt;br /&gt;manufacturing flaw. About 90 % of the chews were almost impossible to unwrap. Had to use&lt;br /&gt;scissors to cut the wrapper then tear it off piece by piece. A real hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for all who have cholesterol problems.&lt;br /&gt;At least try it before medication.</li>
    <li> I started to take BENECOL last winter. My Doctor was pressing me to get on a cholesterol medication and I was very resistant to this. A friend had recommended BENECOL since her partner was taking this and had good results.....long story short.....my cholesterol dropped around 40 points and my Doctor was so amazed that she didn&#x27;t even stress over my blood pressure (it always goes up in her office).....I did follow the other guidelines that were given to me and kept my cholesterol count to 300mg a day (and that is a lot of counting).....I love the chews....and I love not having to take a prescription drug for cholesterol. Now when I see the commericals on TV about cholesterol in your blood vessels...I clearly visualize that mine are healthy and clear. THANK YOU BENECOL SMART CHEWS!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used the product for over two years and have found it very beneficial.  I have recommended it to my friends and they are using this product as well.  Keep producing it.</li>
    <li> Last year my HDL was 80 and my LDL was 161.  I have always had a healthy diet and was shocked to find that my bad cholestrol was high, even though my good cholesterol was very high as well.  I started taking Benecol Smart Chews in July and with no other changes in my diet or lifestyle, my LDL dropped to 127 with my HDL at 71 at my last checkup.  My doctor was amazed as well.  I know these have been recently reformulated in some way, better tasting apparently, but I have only tried the new formula and I think they taste great, just like a little caramel.  I&#x27;m happy and am reordering another box, and one for my Mom too!</li>
    <li> So far I have been very happy with it.  It is easier to use than taking a pill or mixing a liquid.  I haven&#x27;t used the smart chews long enough to get my blood drawn so will let you know my final thoughts when I get the results of my cholesterol and lipids profile.</li>
    <li> Excellent substitution to Rx drugs chemicals.</li>
    <li> Benecol Smart chews lowered my bad cholesterol by 20 points.  They are delicious.</li>
    <li> Will wait till my next cholesterol test to see if my already very high &amp;#34;at risk&amp;#34; reading has been reduced to give Benecol Chews a better rating. It contains the ingredient proven to do this ( do your own research its available)  but how much of the substance is actually in the chews will tell I guess. Stay tuned, I have tried everything else. The Benecol spread ( butter replacement) I am also using.</li>
    <li> Great taste, but didn&#x27;t change my cholesterol numbers at all.</li>
    <li> Great product and I also use Benecol spread instead of butter or margarine.  It really helps to reduce cholesterol.  But, the price on drugstore.com is between $25.99 - 27.99 with free shipping so beware of the people selling this product on Amazon or even Ebay!</li>
    <li> This product is tasty and works. My cholesterol level dropped a 100 points after using the benecol and eating a more vegan diet.</li>
    <li> not had a cholesterol test yet, but fingers crossed these work..&lt;br /&gt;taste good, only pain is that they are sweet, and have a wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;d rather have this product in a yoghurt or a juice, but since i like fudge, they&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
    <li> This came highly recommended to reduce cholesterol. However, if you read the fine print, you really need to take more than the recommended daily amount to get the full benefit. I will keep trying it to avoid drugs.</li>
    <li> Referred by my cardiologist.  Great tasting way to reduce cholesterol.  Mine is low-normal for the first time in my life.</li>
    <li> Benecol does what it says it would do - reduce your cholesterol. Only wish there was a vegan version because it has dairy.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been to the doctor lately, but the last time I was there, she was very impressed with how much my cholesterol level had dropped.  I avoided prescription medicine.</li>
    <li> Easy way to get the Stanols into your system to help manage Cholesterol!! Easy open foil packest and thy taste good!!</li>
    <li> A previous cardiologist was selling this in his office for $12 more than amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started getting from amazon but they raised the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new cardiologist never heard of Benecol. Seems if it was valuable all cardiologists would know about it by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the expense; I&#x27;m no longer using.</li>
    <li> It works......take it faithfully when you have fatty foods.  It works!</li>
    <li> I loved the taste of these, but they didn&#x27;t work for me.  They may work for others though.</li>
    <li> These appear to have made a noticeable improvement in our cholesterol numbers/ratios.</li>
    <li> These are really good for people who can&#x27;t swallow large capsules.</li>
    <li> Actually brought my cholesterol level down in about 2 weeks, in time for my work screening ❤️</li>
    <li> Seems to have affected my lipo profile for the better.  Have tried many other means.  Good tasting, easy to take.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, and it really helps reduce cholesterol, as claimed. It is rather expensive, but it&#x27;s a natural way to help control cholesterol without using so many drugs...worth the expense.</li>
    <li> The taste is much better than I anticipated. I had read that they had a sandy taste.  Not so.  I will be chewing these until December and then have the levels checked to see if the products lives up to its expected benefits.</li>
    <li> My doctor wanted to put me on cholesterol medication.  I talked him into letting me try to get my number down without medication until the next office visit/blood work.  I didn&#x27;t change my diet except I took Benecol chews daily.  My cholesterol was lower at the next visit, enough that he didn&#x27;t mention cholesterol medication.  They make a great treat/dessert after a meal.</li>
    <li> So far I like the product &amp; the taste.. a little gritty but good.. haven&#x27;t been on it long enough to tell if it&#x27;s made a difference in my cholesterol but will comment when I have my next blood work done..</li>
    <li> Smart Chews taste great!! I will learn in Jan. whether they have helped lower my cholesterol or not.I was taking them before and then you couldn&#x27;t get them for quite awhile so I am back on them with the hope that they will help. If they do the job I will recommend them very highly because I&#x27;ve tried most everything,. I don&#x27;t want to go on the statin drugs and am doing everything I can to avoid doing that. I will let you know!</li>
    <li> 20 Calories, 4 grams sugar, 15 grams sodium, 0.7 grams plant sterols, 40 mg calcium.  1st ingrediet- Sugar, 2nd corn syrup. etc.  Looks like we will enjoy the sweetness as we lower the LDL&#x27;s. Bring it on !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up:  Well I have went through 3 boxes &amp; had several routine bloodworks &amp; I really can&#x27;t see where they help. Sorry</li>
    <li> Statins caused me muscle pain, joint cramping and headaches.  My cholesterol was 244 and my doctor said I needed to get it down.  I started exercising every day (with the Shapely Girl DVD&#x27;s which are low impact and easy to do), started eating healthy (with advice from a nutritionist at my doctor&#x27;s office), and started taking 3 Benecol Smart Chews after dinner every evening.  3 weeks later, my cholesterol was down to 222.  3 months later, it was down to 185.  The Benecol.com website says you can take 1-2 chews twice a day with meals, or 3-4 all at once with a meal:    \\&quot;Plant stanol esters should be ingested at meal times, because this is the prime time when fat and cholesterol in the diet is absorbed into the intestinal wall. Stanols are absorbed in place of cholesterol into the intestinal lining and also cause cholesterol to be secreted back into the intestine.  Studies show that peak benefits are derived with a stanol intake of approximately 2g per day...Studies also showed that once-a-day with a meal is sufficient as a daily dose of plant stanol ester, and that consuming the stanol as a food ingredient but not as part of a meal was not as effective.\\&quot;    Benecol Smart Chews have no scary side effects because they simply pass through the intestine, but if you eat too many, you can get diarrhea.  The chews are carefully wrapped in foil so it takes a minute or two to unwrap 3 of them, perhaps to discourage children who might think they are caramel candy, or adults from accidentally eating too many.  Each chew has .7g of plant stanols, so you need to eat 3 a day to get the recommended dose of approximately 2g per day.  Benecol lowers cholesterol up to 14% in just 3 weeks.  I am glad I found the Smart Chews here at Amazon.com as they are only available online.</li>
    <li> The Benecol chews are totally delicious.  My doctor recommended them, I haven&#x27;t had my cholesterol checked since I started talking them so I don&#x27;t know yet how well they work, but when I do I&#x27;ll add to this post.  In the meantime as I said they are delicious, you don&#x27;t know you&#x27;re taking &#x60;medicine&#x27; at all!</li>
    <li> These chews taste delicious and help you to be healthier.  Not a bad combination.  No side effects either.  Try them.</li>
    <li> Have been very effective in helping to keep my cholesterol down.  My doctor also endorses them.  Have been taking them for several years, and will continue to take them.</li>
    <li> Benecol Smart Chews have helped me to lower my cholesterol number and they taste very good.  I eat a chew along with a hot drink to help it melt it better in my mouth and I have 3 chews a day. I have been using Smart Chews for 3 years now.  I also eat a healthy diet and try to exercise every day.  The reason I chose Benecol Chews is because, after reviewing effective methods for lowering Cholesterol, scientific studies showed Benecol to be beneficial.</li>
    <li> Last spring, I had borderline high LDL (146, where it should be less than 130).  I started using this product in May 2011, but unfortunately, as I was traveling over the summer, I wasn&#x27;t as good about taking it as I should have been.  My goal was to take it 3x a day, but in foreign countries, in the heat on the road, the little squares would often get melty and smashed in my small travel fanny pack, and then weren&#x27;t very palatable, so often I only had 1 per day, not optimum.  When I came back from traveling in September, I had my cholesterol checked, and it was 136.  Lower, but not below the magic number of 130.  On September 12 I made a pledge to take the chews 3-4 times per day, and then recheck my cholesterol again in late November.  Full disclosure:  I also added in 1/2 cup of oatmeal every day because I had read this can lower cholesterol.  I also cut all dairy products, but did not cut out red meat, which I eat 2-4 days a week.  My diet was basically oatmeal (but no other carbs) fruits, lots of veggies of every sort, beef, pork, chicken and fish, with no dairy and very low sugar.  It was very similar to my diet before (when LDL cholesterol was at 146), but without the dairy products.  I was hoping that the combination of the 1 serving of oatmeal, no dairy and 3-4 Benecol chews per day would lower my cholesterol 15 points or so.  Was I EVER surprised when I saw the results... in a late November cholesterol check, my LDL was down to 81... a drop (from the May reading of 146) 65 points!!!!  Now granted, it&#x27;s not clear how much of the result was from the Benecol, how much was from the oatmeal, and how much was from the no dairy/no sugar.  But I feel confident that the Benecol is definitely a big part of the success.  I will definitely keep using this product.  My only complaint is what is noted in the beginning of this review; if you are traveling it is hard to remember to take it at all the meals, and if you carry it around with you, it tends to get soft and squishy.  If you put in into a small hard container (like a medium-sized plastic pill bottle, or a square plastic soap container) that would prevent it getting squished.  You just have to remember to grab 3-4 each morning out of your suitcase and bring them with you each day.</li>
    <li> I used this product for one month, taking 1 or 2 chews before each meal.  My cholesterol went from 234 down to 189.</li>
    <li> works for me,along with watching diet</li>
    <li> Cant say yet what they may have done for my blood but they taste great. I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> I love these chews.  I have never particularly cared for the Benecol spread, but these are delicious, and, even better, they DO lower cholesterol!  After several weeks of consuming these (I tried for 3-5 per day), I lowered my cholesterol about 30 points -- and that&#x27;s without modifying diet or exercise, though I hope to tackle those areas next!</li>
    <li> these sure do taste really good i hope they really do help me on this&lt;br /&gt;need to lower price though&lt;br /&gt;thank you Joy</li>
    <li> was very tasty but i will not be reordering found at local store little better price but was glad i tried it!</li>
    <li> the only way to reduce my bad cholesterol at doctors checkups</li>
    <li> good stuff....nor horrible at all</li>
    <li> I like the chew and taste of these, and they are stanol instead of sterol. Haven&#x27;t had the chance to see if they actually make a difference in my cholesterol yet. But the cost, taste and stanol vs sterol are pluses.</li>
    <li> Best way I know to get calcium and it taste good too.</li>
    <li> Good price! And received the next day.</li>
    <li> Perfect transactions.  Fast shipping. Great prices.</li>
    <li> got my two month blood work back and dropped 60 points  no need to go on statins now  very happy</li>
    <li> My cholesterol has not gone down as much as others have reported, but with more diet change I am sure these can help quite a bit. Taste very yummy and easy to take and order.</li>
    <li> The chews taste just like a carmel.  The foil wrapping is a little hard to remove at times but that is probably what helps keep them fresh. I just hope they help lower my cholestrol.</li>
    <li> I liked the taste and the idea of reducing my cholesterol with these yummy gums, but unfortunately I got the worst diarrhea just shortly after taking my first dose of 2 gums. Now, I don&#x27;t dare to take any more. Anyone else who had the same experience? Or was it just a bad coincidence?</li>
    <li> We have used benechol offor a long time.  It u[[ASIN:B000NBQUNW Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120-Count Soft Chews]]sed to be a little bigger portion and easier to open.  Now is OK but gripes a little thats its smaller insize  I think they had to do it for economical reasons.</li>
    <li> I think this product could have been stale.  The wrappers are almost impossible to remove.  Once removed the chews seem to be OK but I think they are old.  Very disappointed considering this was almost a thirty dollar purchase.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was fresh.</li>
    <li> The chews are soft and taste like any other caramel chew.  I plan to have my cholesterol checked again to compare the results.</li>
    <li> I  should give this a five star rating because I know the product works.  Ive been cheating for 3 months, and not doing so well.  Im back on track watching my fat intake, and using the benecol chews, Ive gotten my numbers down to 212, but its back up to 245, so Im REALLY GOING TO STICK TO MY BENECOL.  TRY THEM THEY WORK.</li>
    <li> When I used the Benecol Smart Chews a couple years ago, they were the only product that helped lower my cholestrol.  Then for awhile, the Smart Chews were not available in the U.S., I&#x27;m so glad they are back and am hoping for similar results.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, if a little sweet.  I purchased it because I was unable to find my regular Benecol products whilst on holiday in USA.  Now I wish I could buy this product in the UK.  Incidentally, Benecol has been really effective in reducing my cholesterol levels to acceptable levels.[[ASIN:B000NBQUNW Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120 Soft Chews]]</li>
    <li> I ordered and received the Benecol caramels.  They are quite expensive but if they do what they are supposed to do then they are worth the cost. I have eaten them now for about 2 weeks.  They are quite tasty-not sweet like candy but certainly good.  But it is too soon to review this product completely until I see evidence from my bloodwork to know if it does what it is supposed to do-that is lower overall cholesterol and raise the good cholesterol.  I will review it again when I have a bloodtest taken in another month.  Certainly, if they do what they are supposed to do, I&#x27;d much rather take them than some prescription medicine that has side effects.</li>
    <li> I started using Benecol Chews in June 2007.  I just recently had my cholesterol checked and I dropped significantly.  My last count was a total of 233 and the most recent count was a total of 190.  I was very thrilled.  I purposely wanted to get a new test before I ordered more Benecol Chews to make sure they were actually doing something for me.  I don&#x27;t have to question the effects Benecol has had on me.  I attribute the drop in my total cholesterol to the Benecol Chews and adding more soluble fiber to my diet via oatmeal.  Look for oatmeal that contains at least 4 g of soluble fiber.  Most have just 1 or 2 soluble fibers.  Quaker Weight Control has 4 g of soluble fiber  and if you are familiar with Trader Joe&#x27;s they have a Heart Healthy Oatmeal (Blueberry and Cranberry, Blueberry is my favorite) that also has 4 g of soluble fiber.  I also exercise regularly at least 4 time a week.  So I personally feel the combination of the above was the result of my drop in cholesterol.  I have highly recommended the Benecol Chews to family and friends.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is proven to lower cholesterol and the caramel form is a pretty good small dessert that hits the sweet tooth while still providing the same benefit as the spread.    Our only irritation was that the packages received were from an expiring lot with a very limited remaining \\&quot;Sell By\\&quot; time.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this tasty product to help lower cholesterol. My most recent test results showed a significant improvement in my cholesterol levels after using Benecol Smart Chews as directed for three months. I sometimes just have a couple of these delicious chews instead of having dessert. They taste great &amp; deliver results as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful and tasty way to fight high cholesterol. I am not too fond of the Benecol butter, so this makes it easy to get the cholesterol fighter into my body.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Doctor recommended it, and evidence shows this has reduced by husband&#x27;s cholesterol with no side effects like the statin drugs that were turning his muscles to mush.</li>
    <li> I love the taste of the Benecol Smart Chews.  I&#x27;m hooked on these and my mom is also taking them.  It&#x27;s great to have something taste good and help your cholesterol.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> After reviewing the ingredients I immediately threw away this product.  The research that has been done on corn syrup indicates not only is it a big factor in the obesity area, but very hard on digestion - affecting the kidneys!!!  All Americans should be eliminating this from their  diets immediately.  I am on a campaign to hopefully have that happen.  Lets us the corn for feed and ethonol.   There is no nutritional value in corn!!!</li>
    <li> In order to lower some arbitrary number people will willing ingest the following;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sugar, Corn Syrup, Plant Stanol Esters, Nonfat Milk, Less than 2% of:, Soy Lecithin, Salt, Natural &amp; Artificial Flavors, Yellow 6 Aluminum Lake (CI 15985)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a tip, do some research, cut out the sugar/corn syrup and eat veggies instead.  Do the research instead of listening to outdated medical propaganda that will kill you sooner rather than later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over and out .</li>
    <li> My heart doctor recomended Benecol smart chews as a way to get my cholesterol down a bit.  He said it could lower it by 10%.  I have been taking them twice daily now for six months and it has lowered my cholesterol by 18% or 34 points.  This is huge.  My cholesterol has never been below 192 and is now 158.  Great stuff and besides that they taste good.</li>
    <li> These are very delicious!  They are soft, and do taste like caramel.  The wrappers are a bit of a pain to open, so if you have arthritis or something, it may be difficult.  I do wish that they were few calories.  Each serving is 35 calories, for 2 chews.</li>
    <li> At the recommendation of 2 doctors I tried these. They weren&#x27;t horrible tasting, but they weren&#x27;t good either. Plus they made me nauseous. Enough said.</li>
    <li> I started using Benecol chews in conjunction with Benecol margarine -- 4 servings a day of one or the other or a combination of both -- immediately after a checkup. I continued through my next checkup and beyond. My cholesterol numbers improved by 15% at my next checkup (6 months later) and have remained that low ever since. I have only two gripes with the product. First, the wrappers are stuck like glue. It is irritating as $&amp;!?&amp;$% to unwrap the darn things. Second, the product has been unavailable at two periods of time while they were retooling their packaging or whatever. UPDATE 2/2/2013: Someone must have noticed all the negative comments about the pesky wrappers. In my last two orders the wrappers were not quite so tight making them much simpler to open. You might think that this would allow the contents to dry out quicker, and it does, but not enough to be a problem. I much prefer the easier opening and can definitely live with the slightly accelerated drying out of the contents.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my physician. I found it to be too sweet.  I have not gone for a blood test yet so I don&#x27;t know how effective these chews  are going to be for me. Have to keep taking Benecol about 2 or 3 months. I did not want to take a prescribed drug so I am trying this plant based chews.&lt;br /&gt;If these chews are effective in lowering my cholesterol, I will keep taking them.</li>
    <li> The chews taste quite well.  The chews were recommended by my cardiologist for lowering my cholesterol.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> Like most of us, trying to find ways to reduce &amp;#34;Bad&amp;#34; cholesterol (LDL) can be challenge. Alot of what we consume, thanks to fast food, increases bad cholesterol levels. Having high cholesterol level of course can be bad and unhealthy for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many ways to fight &amp;#34;Bad&amp;#34; cholesterol. One way is to consume a healthy product like Benecol Smart Chews. It&#x27;s a great product that helps lower cholesterol levels using a ingredient called plant stanol ester. Each serving (one chew) contains about 20 calories with 0 grams of fat. Why I enjoy this is it taste like candy. Caramel flavored candy! Who doesn&#x27;t like candy?  120-Count Soft Chews should last you about 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking two chews a day. I feel better taking it. Hope to take a cholesterol test soon and will let you know the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to like about Benecol Smart Chews is the container. It makes a great storage container for storing almonds or other snacks.</li>
    <li> My husband used these and liked them.  He had purchased them before and these were cheaper than the ones he purchased before.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  The taste is good.  I have not had my cholesterol checked since I started using it so I can&#x27;t say if it has improved my numbers yet.</li>
    <li> Order was shipped and delivered in satisfactory window of time.  The product was fresh and I am very satisfied with this order in all aspects.</li>
    <li> I have had stomach issues w/other products of this nature. So far, no issues with this as long as taken with food! Plus, tastes like candy.</li>
    <li> This product is a huge disappointment.  The chews taste awful.  No wonder it is impossible to buy these in stores.</li>
    <li> I was not chewing these daily and had put them into a airtight container.  I found they hardened much faster than I would have thought.  Taste and texture are quite good but it was like eating candy, which is OK a 1-2 times a week but not daily. So since I can&#x27;t eat them fast enough before they harden, I&#x27;m not sure they are best fit for me, but probably a great fit for candy lovers who might be intaking saturated fat with their candy as well. I LOVE Benecol margarine spread however.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with elevated cholesterol my whole life...since I was 18 years old.  REALLY bad genetics for this problem.  Anyway, after several years of cholesterol meds and unable to budge my cholesterol any more, I was going to have to increase my dosage.  With Benecol and just two other ADDITIONS to my diet, I lowered my cholesterol 30 whole points in just 3 short months!!  AWESOME product!  They taste good too.</li>
    <li> At this point I am taking it as suggested, however I will not be going to the dr for 2 months to find out if it has helped as promoted....</li>
    <li> If a candy will make my cholesterol go down then &amp;#34;all aboard!&amp;#34; These were recommended to me by my Doctor first. before the option of medication.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who has a high lipid profile, but I can&#x27;t say that these smart chews have made any difference. I also don&#x27;t care for the fact that the #1 and #2 ingredients for this product are Sugar and Corn Syrup. I&#x27;m sure it might work for some people, but there are more natural ways to fight high cholesterol so I won&#x27;t be poisoning my husbands body with this any longer.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my endocrinologist&#x27;s office but I use it in combination with other medicine so my review is lopsided in terms of whether as a stand alone works.</li>
    <li> Two in the morning and two in the evening and i&#x27;ve seen a significant ldl drop enough really bring my ratio down!</li>
    <li> I like the product; it is not the be all end all for cholesterol management but I do think it helps along with a healthy diet and other steps in cholesterol management.  The chews are pleasant tasting and easy to consume.  No after taste or gastrointestional side effects.  My cardiologist reccomended them for me.  I will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> Great taste. Nicely packaged and easily opened and relative small size. Reasonably priced. Improved digestive functions. Used for several years.</li>
    <li> The Chews taste good.  However, I didn&#x27;t give them a five star because they are suppose to decrease the bad cholesterol and I need to take them long enough to verifiy the results.  I plan to take them for 6 mos. and then have a blood test to see if they really work.  I had a test a month prior to starting the program, so I have a base line.  I will report back later.</li>
    <li> This has brought my cholesterol down by 40 points in the last year.  Easy drug free way!</li>
    <li> The fact that it tastes good makes it easy to take.</li>
    <li> Our cardiologist recommended these since can&#x27;t yake statins. Love them</li>
    <li> Delicious way to lower cholesterol</li>
    <li> The purpose is to lower cholesterol and results are yet to be seen.  Will rate again after lab work to see results.</li>
    <li> I love these Benecol Smart Chews - they are wonderful &amp;#34;treats&amp;#34; that help lower cholesterol and they are my afternoon snack too. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have had high cholesterol my whole life and these really HAVE done the trick!  I went from cholesterol reading of 249 to 188 in 3 months of eating these delicious tasting chews twice a day .  My Doctor was shocked and wanted to know what I had been doing!  Along with a low cholesterol diet, you too can lower your cholesterol just by eating these delicious cholesterol lowering chews!</li>
    <li> My doc. told me to take this along with red yeast rice and QC10 to lower my colestrol and it seems to be  working. It tastes good and that&#x27;s a plus, so taking it every morning is easy.</li>
    <li> the tastes is too sweet and the texture is weird - haven&#x27;t taken long enough to know if it works.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor didn&#x27;t order. I would rather take the benecol (which has lowered my cholesterol to an acceptable level) than risk taking Lipitor and ruining my liver. These work very well and there is no risk of side affects.</li>
    <li> I cant say enough good for this product, I take two a day and my chol. dropped 55 points, the only thing I find that is a problem and that is the way the chews are wrapped, it is very hard to get to the chews.....</li>
    <li> Not sure yet if they work to lower my cholesterol, but they sure taste yummy!!  Hoping they will work the way they are supposed to...</li>
    <li> The results are probably different for each individual, but for me, this product works great!  I don&#x27;t have to be on cholesterol meds anymore!</li>
    <li> I love these chews .  They have lowered my clorestol 30 points on the last 12 mo. &amp; 6mo. appts .  I take them at breakfast  and one at my evening meal.. They taste greAT AND acts like a little dessert</li>
    <li> I enjoy the taste of this product..However ,they are difficult to open . They arrive in a timely manner. They seem to be doing what they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I have been using Benecol chews for several years.  I cannot say enough how effective they are.  High LDL cholesterol has always been a serious problem in my immediate family -- including a parent and siblings -- ranging from sudden cardiac death, angioplasty with stent and quadruple bypass.  As I got older I began to see the same pattern of rising LDL levels.  My cardiologist initially prescribed a statin but I simply could not tolerate it. After doing some research I decided to give the Benecol chews a try.  The chews are very pleasant taking; I use them twice daily.  They are worth a try.</li>
    <li> After starting on this product at the Dr&#x27;s recommended regimen, and combined with a rx, cholesterol numbers were greatly improved in just over three months.</li>
    <li> This tastes great and is supposed to lower cholesterol. This is a good product that was as described. It arrived on time and was well packaged.</li>
    <li> So far, I like it , they taste like Fudge candy and are easy to digest. I don&#x60;t know how effective they will be since I have only been using them a short time. I have been controlling my cholesterol for several years, by using the Benecol Spread.  I bought the smart chews so I would have a supplement when I&#x60;m on vacation...</li>
    <li> I bought this because a friend of mine used it and it was effective in lowering his cholesterol level. His physician recommended it instead of starting a prescription statin drug which my friend was hesitant to do. Hopefully my levels will be better next  time they&#x27;re checked.  The chews taste great.</li>
    <li> Love this product and highly recommend to anyone that needs to lower their cholesterol!</li>
    <li> Instead of prescription chemicals to lower my cholesterol I decided to try the natural way, after six months of two chews a day my number went down extremely. Very happy with this choice.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you much about it because I have not had a cholesterol test yet. Ask me again in 5 months</li>
    <li> Really convenient way to Lower Chloresterol. They work and are easy to chew.</li>
    <li> These chews really work and are tasty but very pricey.  My husband doesn&#x27;t like the film they leave in your mouth but it&#x27;s now a problem for me.  Both of our cholesterol has gone down since eating these chews.  We usually have a couple after dinner.  The taste like butterscotch.</li>
    <li> My licensed nutritionist told me that Benecol will take a cholesterol reading down maybe 3 points over a few months. I took these sugar filled chews as directed and nothing changed except that I now have a dental problem from the sticky chewy consistency. A useless product..</li>
    <li> Like Benecol better then going on Lipitor and it&#x27;s side effects.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product did not reduce my cholesterol. Effects vary from person to person. Worth a try though. Meds are the only thing that help (I&#x27;ve tried red wine, I&#x27;m vegetarian, low fat, exercise and the list goes on).</li>
    <li> I didnot ordered this item. It was even hard for me to effort the benecol smart chews. This was really very good for me to lower my cholestrol. I really liked it.</li>
    <li> These chews are easy to carry when dining out ,they taste good ,leave a bit of a film on roof of the mouth...have not has my blood work done so cannot say if my numbers are lower ...I will continue to take them,wish the were cheaper$46.00 a month is a lot...will see if they work!</li>
    <li> I am doing so many other things to lower my LDL that it&#x27;s hard to say, but I think Benecol may be helping.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my heart Dr. to help lower my cholesterol level.  I have been taking them for more than 5 years now and I do believe they help, probably lowered my numbers by at least 10%.</li>
    <li> Actually is helping to lower my bad cholesterol and raise my good cholesterol!</li>
    <li> Good flavor and good after-taste. But like other reviewers, left a fuzzy/rough texture on the roof of my mouth.  Not sure what it is from, but I think I will stick with Cholestra Cardio Chews.</li>
    <li> i havent used it much dont like the taste and its kinda expensive I dont want to come up with that much money every month</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a couple of years, and it is keeping my cholesteral numbers where they should be.  For those who cannot take the drugs to lower cholesteral, this is a great alternative, BUT must eat a low fat diet for it to work.  Negative is that this stuff is getting more expensive all of the time and I can only find it on line.  Be aware that Benecol is plant stanol which is much superior to plant sterol.</li>
    <li> They are OK.  When you&#x27;re a caramel lover, this will nix the cravings, but, doesn&#x27;t taste like a true blue Werthers Caramel Chew. The positive is, it lowers cholesterol. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m shooting for. Might lose a little weight as well.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my docter.  But it tends to upset my stomach. I need to take it with a meal.</li>
    <li> The Benecol Chews is very good I have 1 a day and the result off my test the cholesterol  going down i feel good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is helping me lower my cholesterol since I haven&#x27;t been for a checkup lately, but these do taste great anyway.&lt;br /&gt;My wife approves of me eating these more than say a Bit o Honey. :)</li>
    <li> I have been taking this consistently for almost a year now. I am taking these to help control my cholesterol. Next cholesterol test is in January. (Have also made diet and exercise changes.) These taste great too!</li>
    <li> I took Benecol for one whole month but it lowered my cholesterol only by 4 points. In order to get the 2 g recommended plant stanols/sterols per day, I had to take 3 servings (a serving of 2 chews contains 0.8 g). Each serving contains 7 g of sugars.&lt;br /&gt;This means that for that minimal improvement I ingested 630 g of sugars in one month!  And what it worse, this also includes corn syrup. The first two items listed are sugars and corn syrup.&lt;br /&gt;I am switching to Profibe which has a proven track record. It tastes less pleasant, but I find this a lot safer than putting corn syrup into my body.</li>
    <li> Dr. recommended these to lower cholesterol since I can&#x27;t take statins. These work great and this is the only place to get them. Now have a few friends trying it too.</li>
    <li> Benecol tastes really great &amp; is easy to chew. It is a great way to control your cholesterol, without statins!</li>
    <li> My wife and I eat the Benecol Chews twice a day, morning and evening,  &amp; it has, along with other supplements, lowered our cholesterol significantly.  It tastes like a caramel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benecol was recommended to us by a physician.</li>
    <li> Many reviews on here go something like this:  \\&quot;I used this product for two months while eating healthier and starting an exercise program, and my cholesterol dropped 30 points!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are worthless reviews, because there are too many variables.  I used this product and did not change anything else.  3 weeks, 2 chews per meal (which is about the whole box).  Cholesterol had been consistently at 210, just tested at 181.  LDL went from 120 to 107.  Triglycerides went WAY down (150 to 70), although I&#x27;m not sure why that would be.  (Stanols are not usually associated with trig lowering.)  Just one person&#x27;s evidence to throw on the pile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Please consider the fact that LDL is only one measure of heart risk.  Ingesting the sugar in these tasty chews could adversely impact your triglyceride levels and blood glucose, which are just as important.  They also have calories in them from the sugar.  The first two ingredients are sugar and corn syrup.  35 calories per serving times three meals a day equals 105 calories per day, or a pound of weight gain every month.  This product works for lowering LDL but I stopped taking it because I concluded the benefits to lower LDL were not outweighed by the calories and the harmful effects of the sugar.  If they made a sugar-free version of this, that would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A reasonable approach would be to ingest these only with your \\&quot;worst\\&quot; meal of the day.  But even then you must consider that a fatty meal (which increases LDL) also increases your HDL, the good cholesterol.  So I do not even bother with that.</li>
    <li> My Dr recommended Benecol no prescribed it for me and I do love it. Anything that will help to lower my Colesterol</li>
    <li> My Lipid clinic recommended this product to reduce my cholesterol level.  It worked along with a smart diet. Lowered my cholesterol  50 plus points.</li>
    <li> For me, it did what it said it would do. My LDL cholesterol dropped by 15 points after 2 months.</li>
    <li> very good for lowering cholesterol. they taste like carmels. easy way to lower cholesterol.  recommend to those with slightly elevated cholesterol levels not in need of prescription medications</li>
    <li> Product  is  fine.  Amazon  price  is  too  high.</li>
    <li> Very easy to take, tastes good, and i am hoping it is taking my cholesterol numbers down -- I also use Benecol spread per a Dr&#x27;s advice a while back -- more expensive but if it works, that&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> Very tasty for something that is soposed to help you.  Sometimes leaves a film in your mouth.  If you are counting calories, be sure not to miss these--they add up!</li>
    <li> My cholesterol was 315, after taking 2 Benecol chews daily, 6 months later it went to 212. Wow.  Nothing else worked this great, even medication,.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t take statins and this Benecol herbal statin is safe for me.  I have already recommended this product to my friends that have cholesterol problems.</li>
    <li> very effective in lowering cholesterol levels when taken regularly as part of&lt;br /&gt;low cholesterol, low fat diet every day period</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years, and it did lower my cholesterol. My endocrinologist told me about them and said that plant sterols, which I was taking as a supplement, do not work in menopausal women, but plant stanols do. It did drop my cholesterol, coupled with 1000mg of niacin (the regular not the flush-free - that type doesn&#x27;t work). She told me to take one with each meal, and sometimes I take up to four a day.However, my cardiologist said that even though it might lower cholesterol, it does not prevent plaque from building up in the arteries, so he wanted me to go on a statin. I refused to do so, but I do have a blocked renal artery and 50% blocked carotid with a narrowing of one of my heart arteries from high diastolic pressure.I don&#x27;t know if it will prevent plaque, but I don&#x27;t want the wretched side effects of statins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the last 4 boxes I ordered from amazon, two were without silver linings when I opened it (there is another reviewer who had the same problem). In addition, a few of the wrappers were opened, and I was very afraid that the box was either a return (someone tried it and amazon put it back in stock) or that they were tampered with. Amazon credited the account right away, and they did tell me they were having some problems with the supplier but she didn&#x27;t know what the issue was. I would bet it was this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed that the product has skyrocketed in price! When I first started buying them, they were $27.99. Since benecol seems to have a monopoly on plant stanols (I&#x27;m going to check to see if there is another product that is similar), I guess they can charge whatever they want, but $50 is too much for me and I would think many others. Once people stop buying them, perhaps the price will drop (hoping so). Everyone is out to make a buck. What they don&#x27;t realize is no one&#x27;s salary is increasing to afford these increases in groceries, fuel, utilities and property taxes. Something better change soon.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these all the time.  It lowers his cholesterol!!!  We will continue to order this product.  Great product!! I know a lot of people are allergic to Lipitor and other cholesterol medications.  So give these a try they work. I also got these at the best price on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Buy this product.  Tell your friends about it.  Unfortunately J&amp;J doesn&#x27;t have a clue of how to market this great product, don&#x27;t let it slip out of production. I am in club Benecol and haven&#x27;t received anything. Spread the word, a safer way to lower your cholesterol. Word of mouth is about it, lets hope it works.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect miracles with Benecol, but if you are borderline, this is a great supplement in addition to diet and exercise. Take at least 2 per day.  Expect ~10% lower total cholesterol in a month or two, some have reported more. Could be enough to keep you off the risky statins.  However, some report using Benecol and Statins, but I can&#x27;t vouch for the results. It would be good to hear reports of that combo.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:0743292545 You: On A Diet: The Owner&#x27;s Manual for Waist Management]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to stay healthy and reduce cholestrol, this product may be just what you need. Best of all, it can be used by those taking cholesterol medications and, if you don&#x27;t want to use the meds (or can&#x27;t), this might provide some help. They are tasty and full of plant statins, not medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I used them as directed but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d work if you aren&#x27;t also watching your diet and getting a minimum level of exercise - but perhaps they would. I work out 3 times a week (but not too intensely), watch my diet (but I&#x27;m not rigid, just common sense) and found these boosted the results I got.</li>
    <li> these chewables are delicious. Do not know about the results of lowering cholesterol...I will have to wait until the next Dr. exam. yum</li>
    <li> I have been taking two chews a day as recommended for about two months and when I had my cholesterol checked, found that my LDL had dropped a great deal. I recommend this as an easy way to deal with your cholesterol.  While I have used the Benecol spread, this is a more certain way of getting the amount you need without all the fat and calories.</li>
    <li> Great product - IF it does the job for me (reducing cholesterol).  Quick and easy service from you all, also.  I think I will like the automatic re-order system, also.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000NBQUNW Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120 Soft Chews]]  Product is great! I take 2-chews in the morning &amp; 2-chews after my last meal for the day and for approx. 2-months now. The chews have been working to reduce my high cholesterol and so far they are worth it. Benecol also makes the butter spread, but it is very expensive for one small tub of butter. I recommend the chews because you can have them anytime especially if you have a craving for something sweet. It&#x27;s like chewing a caramel candy, but remember it is not a candy so do not take/treat the product like one or leave them out in the open especially if you have young kids. Take the chews/dosage as it is recommended by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This was a super saver shipping item that charged me shipping when I entered the benicol discount code. I am through ordering from you.</li>
    <li> If you are serious about lowering your Cholesterol level and want to enjoy a product that will accomplish this goal, then Benecol Smart Chews is exactly what you need.</li>
    <li> Tastes great, easy to use and lowers cholesterol.  We leave them sitting out on the counter so my husband can grab one easily.  It works great.</li>
    <li> I just received my first order of the Benecol smart chews and they tast great. A nice smooth caramel texture that melts in your mouth.    OK, so compared to most of the other posts, my cholesterol levels are not too high but my doctor says it&#x27;s high. One of my biggest problems is keeping my HDL (good) greater than 40. So when I read the Benecol website and it said this would help lower my LDL (Bad) and not my HDL I thought why not try them out. I already eat well balanced meals and walk 5 times a week for 30 minutes. In addition, prior to my most recent blood test I was able to loose 15lbs. Now at 5&#x27;2\\&quot; I weight my ideal weight of 110lbs. Yet my cholesterol levels have not gone down.     My last test was on 10/28/08  TOTAL CHOLESTEROL &#x3D; 214 goal less than 200  HDL CHOLESTEROL &#x3D; 40 goal greater than 40  LDL CHOLESTEROL &#x3D; 145 goal less than 130  TRIGLYCERIDES &#x3D; 146 goal less than 150    My next test will not be until April so I plan on adding all bran to my breakfast and taking 3 Benecol chews a day. I will update you with my results in April 2009. If they do manage to reduce my numbers I will be more than willing to give this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My liver doctor recommended Benecol Chews to try and help lower my cholesterol.  They seem to be helping and I thank her for the recommendation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these chews for a few weeks now, I have no idea if I&#x27;m getting health benefits I just have to assume so.  But I can comment on the flavor which I like a lot, these definitely rate as a &#x27;treat&#x27; not as medicinal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only slight gripe is the foil wrapping, about half of the chews are so tightly wrapped its like the foil was welded on, and I spend a minute or two just unwrapping the thing, and good thing I have some fingernails to help.  Seems like a nit, but it might cause me to reconsider after I plow through this whole package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get it unwrapped, I&#x27;m a big fan for the flavor anyway.</li>
    <li> This product did not make a difference in my cholesterol after 3 canisters and blood work done at my physician. Trying another route with Red yeast Rice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff&lt;br /&gt;BHM AL</li>
    <li> I have no idea how well these actually work but they taste good and ease my guilt whenever I eat an egg.</li>
    <li> I started using this product in Oct 2012 in hopes it would lower my cholesterol.  Now it is May of 2013 and had my cholesterol checked in April.  It  came down 36 points.  So I recommend this to anyone who wants to lower their cholesterol. You of course have to do your good diet of course-oatmeal, fruit-vegs-no greasy fast food etc.  My doctor still wants me on statins but at least the Benecol helped.</li>
    <li> After chewing two of these every day after dinner for two months, with no other changes to my diet or exercise, my numbers were noticeably improved. Triglyceride number was down by HALF from what it had been prior to starting Benecol, and is now the lowest by far that it has been in many years. LDL (bad cholesterol) decreased by 15 points. Total cholesterol number was down by only 5 points, and is still borderline high, but coronary heart disease risk was reduced from 4.7 to 3.7 (with &amp;#60; 4.9 considered optimal). HDL (good cholesterol) increased by 11 points, but Benecol makes no claims of improving HDL. I&#x27;m convinced, especially by the vast difference it made in my triglycerides, that this is a beneficial product. I&#x27;ve already ordered more and will plan on using Benecol Smart Chews indefinitely. The taste is not bad, the consistency is a little gritty, but the results speak for themselves.</li>
    <li> The ease of taking with meals is great and so is the flavor, but after two containers worth my cholesterol level did not come down.  Very disapointing.</li>
    <li> After taking for three months (3 times a day after every meal),  it seemed to have lowered my bad cholesterol (LDL) by at least 10-15 points and increased my good cholesterol (HDL) by about 5 points.  I will update my review in three months after the next blood work.</li>
    <li> I took these chews for 2 months and (along with limiting my diet) my cholesterol dropped 80 points.  I know that is pretty damn good, but I really wish these caramels were not so high in sugar.  Taking 5 a day (which is the amount suggested based on their studies) equals 14g of sugar added to my diet.  That can cause trouble over the long run</li>
    <li> I began purchasing the Benecol Smart Chews for my father who was directed by his doctor to reduce the level of his &#x27;bad&#x27; cholesterol. We started off with just a diet change for Dad, which had limited success, but not with the overall speed and effectiveness we were looking for. After some research, I found the chews and ordered a 3 month supply for him from Amazon. Over that period, we were able to achieve the level that the doctor asked for and Dad found his &#x27;medicine&#x27; tasty and easy to tolerate. Great buy, great price, and very convenient as I can order it and have it shipped directly to him.</li>
    <li> This is a product that really works. My cholestrol levels are now normal after 3 months of using this product along with a modified diet.</li>
    <li> This stuff does work to lower cholesterol! I&#x27;ve been using it for over 4 months.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the aftertaste so gave it to a friend of mine, who really liked it.</li>
    <li> This delicious tasting soft chew has helped to lower my cholesterol from a high of 273 in 2010 to this years 170. And I only chew one in the moring and one at night.</li>
    <li> I used these and with regular exercise, managed to bring down my cholesterol from high to marginal.  Not sure which contributed more but I suspect it did help.</li>
    <li> Not sure if they are working. Maybe not chewing enough. One a day and sometimes two. Thanks much. Got the&lt;br /&gt;info from a large heart groups office.  Thanks much, Wayne</li>
    <li> love these and they help to lower colesterol</li>
    <li> I have been taking this product for a few months now, along with Benefiber, to try and lower my cholesterol before my doctor put me on medication.  Before finding these products, I changed my diet radically for about a month with no results, except my HDL dropped significantly and I gave up.  Now I eat as I normally would (which has it&#x27;s good and bad), and today I received the stunning results of my recent labwork.  Total cholesterol down 48 points!!!  LDL down 47 points!!!  HDL remained about the same.  Even my triglycerides went down. Now I feel as though I can change my diet a little more, keep being diligent with my workouts, increase the amount of Benefiber I&#x27;d been taking, continue to take the chews and I can hopefully drive the numbers down even more. I can&#x27;t say for sure which of the two products have produced these results--maybe a combination of the two, but if you have high cholesterol and want to avoid medications, I would give this a try.    The taste is really good, just like a caramel. They are also very convenient to take along when eating out. I make sure to keep some in my purse at all times.  Instead of taking a Benecol Chew after a meal, I take it before I eat a meal that is high in cholesterol. Even though they are expensive, I have not taken them 100% of the time and the container has lasted for quite a while.  As far as the Benefiber, I&#x27;ve been taking that once a day, but I&#x27;m going to increase that to 2-3 times a day.</li>
    <li> This is my second box of Benecol.  I ordered this product which was recommended to aid in lowering Cholesterol. So far, My cholesterol has remained at an acceptable level.  The chews have a nice carmel flavor.</li>
    <li> I was recommended Benecol to reduce my Cholesterol.    In other parts of the world it is a yoghurt drink.  In the US it is a sweet tasting candy chew.  You are supposed to have these around every meal time but the sweetness wreaks havoc on your taste buds so I recommend having them after the meal not before.    Yet to have a retest so don&#x27;t know if they have worked.</li>
    <li> The Benecol chews taste really good, just like a caramel.  I have been taking twice a day for high cholesterol.  I don&#x27;t know what percentage of help the Benecol has been, but with it, fish oil, and a low carb duet, my cholesterol has gone down from 349 to 296 in a couple months.  Also has greatly lowered my triglycerides.  So I plan to continue the Benecol. My doctor has highly recommended the Benecol.</li>
    <li> My cholesterol readings have improved with the help of the chews, I believe.  However, I may like the chews better if they were less sweet.</li>
    <li> My cholesterol was very high, 396, so I was started on cholesterol medication, Simvastatin 40 mg. daily.  In addition, I took 1200 to 2400 mg of red yeast rice daily and 4 Benecol chews daily.  After 6 weeks, my cholesterol level had dropped 139 points to 257.  I attribute this to all three products, but I think that the Benecol had a significant effect, as I had tried the red yeast rice previously, and alone it did not lower my cholesterol.  They have a pleasant taste and serve as a low calorie &amp;#34;dessert&amp;#34; after meals.</li>
    <li> A good, pleasant way to work on cholesterol problems.  Try these chews if you prefer not to take drugs to control the problem.</li>
    <li> Benecol Smart Chews helped lower my cholesterol better than the prescription medicine I was taking.  I recommend it very highly.</li>
    <li> I had my cholesterol tested after using these for 4 months and it dropped 40 points, I&#x27;m a true believer in these now!!  I like the taste of these also, I know some don&#x27;t but they are just fine with me and like a nice little treat after I eat.  My next batch I received they seemed to have changed the wrapper a little and now they are much easier to open also.  I will continue using these as long as I contiunue getting good results in my cholesterol score.</li>
    <li> A low-fat, low-cholesterol diet helps, but isn&#x27;t enough by itself to keep my cholesterol below 200, so I use the Benecol Smart Chews regularly.  My wife even keeps a supply in her purse for when we go out to eat.  It&#x27;s a simple, tasty, and convenient way to stay healthy.</li>
    <li> My doctor wanted to put me on statin drugs but I had seen too many people with muscle aches by taking these drugs.  I had heard about Benecol and decided to try it.  When I had another blood test three months later, my cholesterol level went down by 30 points.</li>
    <li> I had a blood test after using Benecol for two months and my good cholesterol went up and the bad went down.  Very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Although not sweet, Psyllium would be more effective then this candy like product. It would probably be cheaper too.&lt;br /&gt;Or, you can try the Metamucil.</li>
    <li> Using plant sterols has saved me from taking medication that made me ache all over.  Smart Chews are easily portable, taste just fine and they are working for me.  I&#x27;d prefer something that didn&#x27;t contain sugar and corn syrup, but compared with the side effects of medication, I&#x27;ll take the Smart Chews.</li>
    <li> Lowered my total cholesterol by 30 points! I only have 2 chews per day and my Triglycerides  went down 27 points, my HDL up 7 points, LDL lowered 20 points.</li>
    <li> i used benecol smart chews along with benecol margarine, statin medications and a very healthy diet to get my cholesterol nos. to a very low level. the nos. were total chol. 138,  hdl  68  ,  ldl 60 ,, trig. 50.  i also work or exercise 7 days per week.  something is working real well.</li>
    <li> We are happy with the good service and the convenience of getting this product on a regular basis, and at a good price.</li>
    <li> Not sure how well they work yet because i haven&#x27;t been on them that long, but the taste is great.</li>
    <li> My husband had a heart attack and is supposed to have 3 helpings of Benocol each day. This works well when we go out to eat. Taste great too!</li>
    <li> Benecol chews are delicious and an easy way to lower cholesterol. They are an inexpensive way to try to lower your cholesterol to try to avoid having to take medication.</li>
    <li> I ate two chews twice daily for almost three months, and here are the results. My total cholesterol went from 241 to 184; HDL from 75 to 68; LDL from 153.1 to 101.8; TGL from 67 to 71. The LDL needs to drop to 99 or lower, but still a major improvement and the TGL, although it increased, is still below 150.  My HDL risk dropped from 3.2 to 2.7.  I only made one change to my diet and exercise routine, and that was to eat less cake and cookies, which I believe contained eggs (the yolk).  I tried and will continue to use Benecol chews because I do not like the side effects from Statins, other prescription cholesterol lowering drugs, and over the counter remedies (supplements, etc.).  The chews taste like caramel candies and two chews contain 35 calories, so that&#x27;s 70 calories in total per day.  I may consider taking one more chew a day.</li>
    <li> This item was suggested by my doctor to help reduce cholesterol. It is very difficult to find in stores so I have ordered it online.  Great fast service.  This is actually a very good tasting chew and I will be anxious to see my cholesterol count at my next doctors visit.</li>
    <li> The soft chews are in a silver foil, it is extremely difficult to unwrap them and would be near impossible for disabled, old&lt;br /&gt;person to unwrap thus making the product essentially useless for most people who are in need of loweing their cholesterol</li>
    <li> It works, that&#x27;s all it needs to be said.  A minor comment: The chews are packaged too tight; it is hard to open the &#x27;flaps&#x27; because they are sort of glued to the chew. Could Benecol just let at least one of the flaps loose? Thanks!</li>
    <li> These are sort of like a treat during your meal.  Since you are supposed to eat them during your meal!  Kinda fun and they taste great!  Do they work?  Well see in 3 months!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking these long enough to know what the effect on my cholesterol will be, but opening them is bound to increase my blood pressure. Separating the foil wrapper which clings tight to the caramel is a real challenge. There is no easy way to do it. It&#x27;s too bad. The taste is not bad but the packaging is so annoying I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t rate yet until I have lab  tests to determine if my cholesterol levels have gone down.  Hope it works as claimed.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product except with great caution. It raised my blood pressure to unacceptably high levels. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Love It!  My nutritionist recommended it to lower cholesterol.  The flavor is great!  The routine is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betsy K</li>
    <li> These were recommended to me by a nutritionist.  Taste was good but, not sure if it made a difference because I did not use them long enough.</li>
    <li> Has helped my cholesterol down and my wife and I look forward to it at the end of a meal.  It tastes like a delicious caramel!</li>
    <li> My wife has trouble with statins.  Finding something that both helps control her cholesterol and doesn&#x27;t have nasty side affects is a problem.  This stuff works for her.  It is not a solution in itself, but coupled with other prescription drugs it makes a difference.  Don&#x27;t use it unless you consult your doctor first.</li>
    <li> My cardiologist actually suggested I buy this.  He chews a couple a day to lower his cholesterol.  My triglycerides are high and he said this would help since it is plant based.  I&#x27;m on Coumadin so can&#x27;t take many extra drugs.  I was skeptical about the taste, but if anything, the chews are almost too sweet!  Yet they don&#x27;t have a lot of calories.  Wish I could buy them in the store!!</li>
    <li> I like the flavor of the smart chews, they actually satisfy my sweet tooth which is a bonus.  It&#x27;s too early to know whether my cholesterol&lt;br /&gt;has been impacted.</li>
    <li> Really appreciate you for having this item in stock. It truly helps lower my cholesterol.</li>
    <li> Why does benecol have a picture of a vibrator?  This is a chewable supplement, not a sex toy.</li>
    <li> I have reviewed these before.  I&#x27;m not a big believer in getting your cholesterol down in the first place, as evidence suggests that this is not so neccsary any more.  But just to get a pushy doctor off my back, i took these.  I don&#x27;t like to be hounded into taking statin drugs, which i will never take anyway.  My cholesterol began around 275 and four months later it was 202.  My endocrinologist couldn&#x27;t believe these results and said even with the highest does of statin drugs he didn&#x27;t see a drop like this.  So, we were both happy.  IN addition, these taste great.  I take two after every meal.  I think if you don&#x27;t take enough of them, you won&#x27;t see results.  Yes, they have sugar in them.......life isn&#x27;t perfect!</li>
    <li> good for reducing cholesterol level.. try it for a few months and see for yourself.. I find this product too sweet though.</li>
    <li> Bought these on the advice of a friend to lower cholestorol . These taste just like a caramel and I like them. Delivered quickly and securely packaged.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still in the trial stage with this product. Will say now that the chews are pleasant tasting and have a palatable consistency.  But they are difficult to unwrap.  It&#x27;s hard to find a corner or edge to grab and the foil sometimes sticks to the chews. This is at room temp. I imagine it would be a mess in heat.  There&#x27;s no unwrapping a chew discreetly  if you are out to dinner or on the run at work.  And it would be a challenge with arthritic or large fingers.  Based on this I give it a 3. Will re-rate when I get actual results in 2 more months.</li>
    <li> I had my cholesterol checked before starting and about 2 months after.  My LDL went down around 20 points.  My triglycerides did go up about 10 points, fortunately I had some room there though.  Around the same time I started keeping a better eye on my saturated fat.  I was surprised how much saturated fat I was eating as a vegetarian and was able to cut some.  So I definitely feel like the Smart Chews contributed but I can&#x27;t say for certain how much.  If I had to guess I&#x27;d say most of the benefit came from the chews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About those chews.. they do have a decent caramel taste but kind of a weird texture that leaves a bit of waxiness in your mouth.  Definitely not top notch candy but then I didn&#x27;t really expect superior candy out of a cholesterol lowering chew :)  Part of me does wish this could be reformulated into a pill without the calories and artificial coloring and all of that, but I&#x27;ll take them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add- there IS a pill-type product without the corn syrup and Yellow #6.  I&#x27;m currently using Kyolic&#x27;s Moduchol with similar good results.  And there are  few other similar products to choose from.  Sorry Benecol.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my husband to help bring his cholesterol down. He said he likes them, they&#x27;re soft enough. But the wrapper is a pain to open. He&#x27;s only 37. I read on someone&#x27;s review that they changed the wrapper. The wrapper is a paper, not a foil wrapper. I remember when the calcium chews had that foil wrapper. It was a pain to open. So these are somewhat easier but maybe they should just stop wrapping them or change the shape and make a twist wrapper instead...I could see how these would be difficult to open for the elderly or someone with arthritis.</li>
    <li> What I expected. Helped lower chesterol with the regime I followed (which others have listed in previous comments). It helped keep me off Ned&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I started taking this product on the advicfe of my cardiologist some 10 years ago. WOW. Did it work! I went from 255 to 144 total Chol. Then it went off the market and my choleserol shot up again. Now, here it is again, and I just ordered 2 boxes from Amazon. I have read the negative reviws that note the taste as being unpalatable since the reformulation; I hope that is not so, but it still will be so much easier to look forward to a \\&quot;treat\\&quot; rather than trying to remember to take my Cholestroff. I am also on statins.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep abreast of cholesterol levels and report back, but at the very least, this was and I believe still is a very valid alternative to tablets as there is the added incentive of taste that makes it easy to remember to take them. More later.</li>
    <li> My cholestrol is very low. Doctors are amaze. Along with eating healthy these work wonderful</li>
    <li> These Benocol chews were fine and it lowered my cholestrol by 6 points but I decided not to keep taking them because it also added alittle calories to my diet that I didn&#x27;t want. I hope to just try eating healthier.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to remove the wrapping on most of the caramels.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, the taste is OK.&lt;br /&gt;However, the real test will be when I have my next cholesterol test to see if indeed it helped to lower it.</li>
    <li> Order twice and never saw any change</li>
    <li> Good price. No longer using.</li>
    <li> These are the best.  My dr. was upset that I had not been taking the statin drug he had prescribed, but quickly changed his mood when he seen my bloodwork.  In 3 months my cholesterol went from 209 to 180.  My triglycerides went from 104 to 72.  Hdl went from 67 to 73 and Ldl went from 121 to 93.  I took 2 or 3 benecol chews a day and also used smart balance butter with plant sterols in it. I have always used real butter (part of my problem with my cholesterol), but this butter tastes like the real thing.  I have been watching my diet a little more than I used to.  I am very pleased with the results.  The Dr. said he was going to do some research on the benecol chews, because he had never heard of them before.  He never said another word about me taking the statin drug he prescribed and I don&#x27;t have another appt. for a year.  The only bad thing I have noticed with them is the waxy residue on your lips and that they are a pain to open, but that is nothing compared to the potential side effects from taking statin drugs.</li>
    <li> Brought my cholesterohl and my husbands down alot. We told our son about it and it brought his down too. My husbands cardiologist recommended it.</li>
    <li> Everything went as it should, price was about what I want to pay, product arrived on time and in great condition.  As long as the price does not go up and the availability continues I will be a repeat customer.  Price and availability has been a MAJOR problem with this product.</li>
    <li> So far I have had good results with the Smart Chews keeping my numbers down. They are very tasty and smooth!  Hoping my next check-up has a good report.</li>
    <li> I would recommend Benecol Smart Chews. My cholesterol was at 240 when my doctor told me to watch my diet and exercise and get my cholesterol retested in 6 months.  Since I already did watch my diet to some extent, and I am not overweight or have other heath issues, I decided to try Benecol Smart Chews. My cholesterol went from 240 to 214.  I also limited high cholesterol foods as much as possible, but I credit some of the reduction in cholesterol to Benecol.  I will continue to take them.  They taste very good, like caramel and do not upset my stomach, even when taken on an empty stomach.</li>
    <li> My doc told me to \\&quot;take\\&quot; Benecol twice a day to keep my cholesterol in check, but just try to take a little tub of it on a trip to the tropics...So I got the Smart Chews and \\&quot;took\\&quot; 5 per day. They make for easier traveling and do the job just fine. My only objection is how sweet they are - I&#x27;d prefer a sugarless version.</li>
    <li> With basically no lifestyle change or exersize adjustments, my cholesterol went from 130 to 80 and has stayed there for my last 4 doctors visits.  They tried to get me on Crestor, but I wasn&#x27;t going to do something that drastic just because my cholesterol was over 100 and i am diabetic.  This was a good alternative, and I take 1 or 2 a day before meals.</li>
    <li> Since I used this I have noticed better blood work numbers</li>
    <li> There is a good supply of the chews in the box.  The taste is good but, of course, not as good as real candy.  I eat them with almonds to get better flavor.  As for lowering cholesterol, only time will tell.</li>
    <li> I don´t know really if they work or not, what I do know is these caramels have very good taste!!</li>
    <li> These were recommended by the Dr. I think they taste good so not bad to take. Waiting to see if they healp my cholestrol.</li>
    <li> These taste great and are easy to use.  Haven&#x27;t gotten back my first labs since starting to take them so don&#x27;t know how well they work.</li>
    <li> Have been taking one per day and will be anxious to see the results when I visit my PCP in a month.&lt;br /&gt;Although people have stated that you have an aftertaste when taking these, I don&#x27;t find them objectionable at all. The only thing,&lt;br /&gt;if you have dentures, wait until you take them out to eat these. They are just as sticky as a caramel and definitely not recommended for people with dentures. Otherwise, I&#x27;m sure I will get good results from my Cholesterol tests when I see my doctor next month.</li>
    <li> Still using this. Taste delicious</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER 5 YEARS, AND SEEMS LIKE IT CONTROLS MY CHOLESTEROL,&lt;br /&gt;I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD TO TAKE ANY OTHER PRISCRIPTION MEDS.</li>
    <li> Delicious and nutritious little chew.  They are soft caramel chews that are proven to reduce your cholesterol.  It has worked for me!  Thanks Benecol!!!!</li>
    <li> Taste good and easy to keep with me.</li>
    <li> I order these for my father in law and they work great for his high cholesterol.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Benecol chews taste like caramel! So easy! Just chew a caramel candy and help reduce your your cholesterol....and it&#x27;s inexpensive!</li>
    <li> After using this product for many months, I finally had my blood work done.  Unfortunately, there was no lowering of my cholesterol, actually, it went up by one.  Mind you, I am a healthy eater and exercise regularly.  I was a bit disappointed.  So whether or not it really helps, I am not too sure.  I was just trying to prevent having to take medications.  After I am done with my supply of benecol, I am going to see what happens without taking it too.</li>
    <li> Great taste.  Lets hope it helps lower cholesterol.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t taken these chew long enough yet to get a cholesterol check to see how they&#x27;re doing but they&#x27;ve been out for a long time so I assume they will lower cholesterol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this a 4 star because I haven&#x27;t gotten back to the doctor&#x27;s yet to check my lab results. However, I am more than confident that this does work because the light headedness assoicated with consuming a high fat meal goes away almost instantaneously after consumption. Will update when I get results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking 2-3 Benecols daily for about 6 months, along with Co-Q10, and at my last check-up found that my high cholesterol levels had decreased by 40 points - great! - thereby avoiding statin medications. They&#x27;re easy to take, no side effects; my only criticism is that they&#x27;re very sweet, but I just drink a glass of water to counteract the sweetness.</li>
    <li> Will see if it lowers cholesterol...too soon.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these and received them in very good delivery time.</li>
    <li> I have been using Benachol Chews for a couple of years, I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I had a total cholesterol reading of 239.  After a month of taking these and Cholestoff, eating oatmeal daily, eliminating beef and pork, and using the Benecol spread, my total went down to 199.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as advertised.  It was the best price I could find and it does help keep cholersterol in check.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these chews for 8 months and plan to use them for 1 year.  When I have my physical in 4 months, the proof of their success will be in the numbers.  Stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;May 2013:  update...my total cholesterol dropped 42 points from May 2012 and puts me in the desirable range!  WOW...I am impressed.  I hope they are not being discontinued.</li>
    <li> I have been battling cholesterol for ten years by diet and exercise, and I am convinced that these have helped in that battle.</li>
    <li> I started taking Benecol chews on Feb. 26th.  Had Cholesterol tested today April 13th.  In 6 1/2 weeks totals changed lots!  Total Cholesterol  in Feb. it was 284  -  today it is  216 ....  LDLs in Feb.  200  -  today it is  147  ....  Trig did not change much  Feb.  177  -  today  158 ....  The problem is my HDL was Feb.  52  -  today it is 37  !!  That is a huge drop!!  Basically Total Cholesterol dropped 24%  LDLs dropped 26.5% and the biggest drop was HDL 29% !!!  Also quit taking Megared extra strength krill oil.  (I think they are what pushed my numbers so high)  I don&#x27;t know whether to be happy or sad....now my ratios are worse than they were with the higher numbers!  I may stop the chews for a few weeks and continue with the Cholesterol Down:  10 steps to lower cholesterol naturally.  I will do 9 steps and leave off the phytostanols and retest in 4 weeks.  For someone that has a very high HDL level, the Benecol Chews may not cause any problems, but just know that they lower all of your numbers....even the good ones.</li>
    <li> They taste fine, I just don&#x27;t like that you need to take 6 of them to get the daily benefit.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to keep them in a bowl at your desk at work or some place handy so you&lt;br /&gt;eat 6 a day.</li>
    <li> The product was fine.  I found that the packaging of each chew was really hard to open.  The other containers of packaging were not this hard to open.</li>
    <li> We are having a problem removing the tin foil wrapping.  It appears that the product was exposed to heat possibly in shipping and the foil wrapper is stuck to the benecol and is very difficult to remove by hand.</li>
    <li> This is a a good product... While I was taking them my cholesterol numbers went down.  If you stop taking them your numbers will go up... I found that out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with Benecol Smart Chews on the whole.  I&#x27;d suggest not eating them and then drinking something cold--it leaves a funny waxy feeling, but hot beverages or food work fine.  (They advise eating them with food for best results.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my recent package, however, the individual wrappers are so flattened that it&#x27;s very hard to lift the corners and unwrap the chew.  A small thing, but somewhat annoying.</li>
    <li> The expiration date seems soon ,the taste isn&#x27;t as good as the ones I had before.usually expiration dates are really far out . These expire in a few months.</li>
    <li> The chews are very good to eat and help control my diabetes. The only complaint I have with this shipment in that they all have a slight gooey&lt;br /&gt;film over all of the wrapper that is rather nasty feeling. Other than that they are great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really make an accurate review as these are for my wife.  She tells me that she likes them.</li>
    <li> I like the idea, and convenience of this product.  The flavor is good, and I like being able to carry the small portions in my purse for the times I am out, and happen to eat a higher fat meal. I also use the Benecol spread at home. However, I do have a concern - If it blocks the fat, does it also block the protein and nutrients? I haven&#x27;t had my blood work checked since I began these products, so I am not able to comment on that, yet.</li>
    <li> 3 things that kept me from rating it higher are it has artificialcaramel color (probably carcinogenic according to reports), 7 grams of sugar per serving and price went up $20 since I purchased it some months ago. At that price,$40 plus, this will be my last purchase.</li>
    <li> I used this product because of a recommendation by my doctor for reducing cholesterol, and it has worked very well!  I take one twice a day.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised but Johnson and Johnson having difficult time in maintaining supply and gives out no information on customer service line.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I&#x27;d like to re-order. Can you do this or instruct me how? I&#x27;m away on the 9th of April for several weeks.</li>
    <li> so far I seem to like it. Won&#x27;t know more till I get my blood work done.we will see then</li>
    <li> A friend of mine told me about them.  Her doctor recommended them to her and I thought I&#x27;d give them a try.</li>
    <li> My doc recommended these to lower cholesterol, and I&#x27;m always happy to eat yummy sweet things like caramel. It&#x27;s a yummy way to get your plant thingamabobs. Plant sterols and stanols.</li>
    <li> I gave a 5 star rating because it worked for me. Lowered my chloresterol 35 points with no prescription drugs.</li>
    <li> I eat 3 a day and my blood work is within normal limits. My doctor is very happy and so am I. I was on a statin drug and I had horrible side effects. I went off the drug and started using these chews with great results I couldn&#x27;t be happier. They also curb my sweet tooth! They taste great to me.</li>
    <li> Tastes good; let&#x27;s see what my blood work reveals</li>
    <li> taste like a caramel treat...we will see how they work this week, having a blood test.</li>
    <li> Doctor recommended these along with new medicine Livalo 2 mg.  Had tremendous aches in joints now nothing with new meds.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for both my spouse and myself.  We have each been complimented by our doctors on how well we are doing.  We have increased our usage about a month ago.  I only wish it was in other flavours as I&#x27;m not fond of Carmel.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product. I am glad Amazon continues to offer it.  Benecol has a good reputation and this product is easy to take.</li>
    <li> I presume the Benecol is doing its anti-colestoral job, but I also take Lipitor. The Benecols are tasty but seem difficult to open since they are wrapped in foil tightly. A \\&quot;draw string\\&quot; would be helpful if it does not add to expense.</li>
    <li> My husband using these to control his cholesterol; he is allergic to statin drugs, and the Benecol is keeping his cholesterol down to a happy level.  I would recommend these to anyone who is having a cholesterol problem.</li>
    <li> So far we have had excellent results reducing in our LDL Cholesterol . It does leave a waxy feeling on the roof of your mouth that goes away after a short time. We are extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> These have kept me off cholesterol medication!  When I first went on them, and also watched my diet carefully, my cholesterol dropped 40 points. If you can afford the extra calories/sugar in your diet, try them.  But I only do two a day; If I had to do the suggested dose of 4, I may not be as happy with them.  They also seem to have a bit of a laxative affect on me.  I use them in conjunction with another product called &amp;#34;Cholest-off&amp;#34; which is a pill.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended them to aid in lowering my cholesterol. I can&#x27;t say definitively that they work for that, but they are a nice little treat after dinner and certainly can&#x27;t hurt. anyway, my cholesterol went down so I&#x27;m optimistic they helped.</li>
    <li> It is hard to tell if something like this is beneficial;  but my doctor recommended I take it for cloresteral control</li>
    <li> I really like this product since it enters my system faster than the tablet form.  On the negative side, it is high in sugar, making it a challenging for folks like me who are pre-diabetic.  The taste is a little chalky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had good lab results.&lt;br /&gt;Like the flavor.- feels like i&#x27;m getting a treat.&lt;br /&gt;Like that I can have regular deliveries.</li>
    <li> wow if they were just a little less money I would order again but for now I cant afford them</li>
    <li> I went off of Simvastatin (any statin drug has the same effects) after taking it for years with good results.  However, several people told me to get off a statin drug.  I researched Amazon (as always), weaned off my stating, told my doc I was weaning off and he said, &amp;#34;Well, we&#x27;ll check your cholestorol in a month or so and if it&#x27;s fine, the benecol is okay.  I have talked to a couple of people who attributed muscle aches to statins and told them about benecol, much to their joy.  I didn&#x27;t have any side effects that I noticed but just like to find natural cures when I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put two chews out for each day, so I won&#x27;t forget.  At first, I felt like it left a sort of film on the roof of my mouth but it went away quickly and, after a few days, I didn&#x27;t really notice it at all.  It has a caramel taste and is pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> The chews are sweet and palatable. The plant steroids are supposed to reduce cholesterol, so it is one part of a cholesterol reducing program that is pleasant. I can use them any time of day.</li>
    <li> I like taking them after food in the hope that they help my cholesterol. Do not have numbers to back it up yet but I do not mind the taste. Most of the time , they are too pricey at amazon and the price seems to vary a lot</li>
    <li> I have been using them for years and have always found them tasty.  Recently I have had a major problem with the silver wrapping.  It is almost impossible to get it off the caramel!</li>
    <li> I like the chews, and my cholesterol was 18 lower after 7 weeks.  However, when I went to reorder from Amazon, they doubled in price in that 7 week period! That was a huge disappointment!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had mine tested since taking the Benecol chews. But I gave a container to my dad. He took 2 a day &amp; two weeks later his doctor checked his cholesterol again his cholesterol levels dropped 256-122. That is spectacular! Also I talked to him this morning. He said he took his blood pressure this morning &amp; it was  110/76, he took a benecol chew &amp; checked his bp about 2hrs later &amp; it was  91/63. WARNING: If you take Ibuprofin or any other NSAID you should not take this product. It can cause kidney issues including kidney failure.</li>
