      <li>of this moisturizing cream that is refreshing, but also nourishing for the skin.</li>

      <li>First, it is non-alcoholic and contains top emollients of aloe and shea butter to truly moisturize and help a man&#x27;s skin .  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great; you can use it after a wet shave or even after an electric shave;</li>
      <li>and find it&#x27;s much easier and better for my skin than those with alcohol.  </li>

      <li>Works great on the face, however the Brute scent may be a little old.</li>
      <li>Love this after shave balm and will continue to buy it as long as I can get it.</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to cologne and other fragrances, but the Brut cream did not bother me at all, felt good on the skin and will continue to use.</li>

      <li>After trying two of the &amp;#34;three Ts&amp;#34; brand aftershaves, with one being completely awesome yet completely expensive, I came across this little beauty.  </li>
      <li>Makes the face feel smooth after shaving, not dry like some other alcohol based products.</li>
      <li>My wife is somewhat sensitive to odors, and have given Brut her unqualified &#x27;thumbs up&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>I am not a regular user of after shaves or balms but occasionally my face feels a bit raw after a shave and this stuff soothes nicely.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it and this is my second purchase of the product.  </li>
      <li>But the problem with most of these cheaper balms are that they are not moisturising and protective enough and like this one they dry up on my face leaving a dry white patch.</li>
      <li>I had to return this and ordered the new proraso blue balm</li>
      <li>It takes me back to the 70&#x27;s when I was a youngster and Brut, Jade West and English Leather were the chosen scents of us young bucks!</li>
      <li>Economical (little bit goes a long way).  </li>
      <li>Found it a few years back at a Walgreens and then it disappeared - have only been able to get it online and buy a few at a time.</li>
      <li>It is a must for an old man&#x27;s dry skin like mine.</li>

<li> and it is not as harsh as the liquid Brut or other aftershaves.</li>
<li> Fragrance is not overwhelming.</li>
<li> but slow time in shipping it out....</li>
<li> Subtle fragrance.  </li>
<li> Shipping was very very slow.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t understand why none of the local drugstores carry this product.  I&#x27;ve used this product for at least five years and it is the only after-shave I&#x27;ve found that takes care of that occasional nip and conditions your skin at the same time.  It is a must for an old man&#x27;s dry skin like mine.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with nicks, and moderate cases of &#x27;thousand cuts&#x27; shaving from time to time.  I have found Brut After Shave Balm to be just the ticket to soothe and heal despite my efforts.  My wife is somewhat sensitive to odors, and have given Brut her unqualified &#x27;thumbs up&#x27;.  Packaging for shipment was done with care, and the product was fresh and well within its expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Vendor and the product.</li>
    <li> Keeps face smooth. Smell is good and disapates before I leave the house.</li>
    <li> Found it a few years back at a Walgreens and then it disappeared - have only been able to get it online and buy a few at a time. It&#x27;s really a superior product.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it is not as harsh as the liquid Brut or other aftershaves. I am sensitive to cologne and other fragrances, but the Brut cream did not bother me at all, felt good on the skin and will continue to use. Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Has the great smell of Brut.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a number of years. Started using 1) because I like the smell of Brut, 2) its a moisturizing balm with aloe, 3) contains no alcohol. Makes the face feel smooth after shaving, not dry like some other alcohol based products. Difficulty is not finding it in all stores, have to order online.</li>
    <li> I am not a regular user of after shaves or balms but occasionally my face feels a bit raw after a shave and this stuff soothes nicely. Brut regular is one of the few fragrances that i can stand having on me which is why i use this over any other.</li>
    <li> After trying two of the &amp;#34;three Ts&amp;#34; brand aftershaves, with one being completely awesome yet completely expensive, I came across this little beauty.  This is what I think of when I think &amp;#34;man&#x27;s man.&amp;#34;  The smell reminds me of my grandfather and great grandfather but not in the repugnant kind of way.  The smell is very masculine and old fashioned but not too strong.  It lasts maybe a good 30-1hr depending on the day.  It soothes perfectly and if it has any sting to it, it&#x27;s so mild that it will pass within milliseconds.  Obviously, skin sensitivity plays a big part as well so your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> Great aftershave balm with a fragrance that is pleasant, masculine and not too much like perfume.  Although I change off between after shave balms, I enjoy wearing this fragrance without becoming tired of it.</li>
    <li> Fast Ship Time, Item just as described.  Great seller.  Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Love this after shave balm and will continue to buy it as long as I can get it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Brut in one form or another since 1966.  This stuff is great; you can use it after a wet shave or even after an electric shave; very \\&quot;calming\\&quot; to your skin, excellent Brut fragrance.  HINT:  Pairs nicely with Clubman After Shave Talc.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent after shave balm, probably the best I have ever used.

    <li> I prefer the balm to the liquid and the Brut Balm has always been good stuff. I like the fragrance of Brut products.</li>
    <li> Brut has great products.  Their aftershave have great masculine scents.  Awesome aftershave.  Good ingredients too. I would recommend. Makes a great gift.</li>

    <li> This is fhe best aftershave I ever used leaves me no red skin no acne or bumps at all, and others do. So thats y I will never stop using this great product ans smells great thanks.</li>
    <li> If anyone objects to the use of alcohol in an aftershave, they should try this Brut Moisturizing after shave.  I use it&lt;br /&gt;regularly and find it&#x27;s much easier and better for my skin than those with alcohol.  There is a smooth and soothing&lt;br /&gt;aspect of this moisturizing cream that is refreshing, but also nourishing for the skin.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is too strong but otherwise good.</li>
