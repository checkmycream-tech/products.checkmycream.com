<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely love this perfume, but don&#x27;t like the price of it in stores. This product came brand new and greatly packaged for about 25 dollars less than at stores. Love it!</li>
    <li> The scent of this is very floral and romantic and lasts a very long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive lots of compliments on the perfume!</li>
    <li> This perfume is a classic..... Very exotic and soft.  Will have everyones head turning.  Men and women will notice the sexy aroma.  It is light and definitely breath taking.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a fragrance that is light &amp; not overpowering, this is the one. I always get lots of compliments from both male &amp; females. I love it!</li>
    <li> New g/f, use to have this and ran out. We both loved the smell. She loved the name after I translated it to her, and I love how it smell on her. She is my empress and sports the smell all the time :)</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great. Its like fresh strawberries in champagne. I love the way it smells. Its perfect for summer</li>
    <li> Imperatrice in Italian is empress...I would have to agree that this scent is more feminine than masculine. In any event, I love it and the parfum is wonderful. Something very sensual and sexy about this scent. Davvero una splendore!!!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this D &amp; G perfume . . .light, fresh &amp; clean!!  I searched the internet for the best price&lt;br /&gt;and found it here at Amazon. . . as I do a considerable amount of my shopping on the web . . . I do my homework&lt;br /&gt;researching products and prices . . you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one ladies!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume; it&#x27;s light, but still fragrant (fruit/citrus-y). You can wear it anywhere (work/school/etc) and not have to worry it&#x27;s too heavy. Buying it online is a much better deal than buying it from the department stores.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing/beautiful scent I have ever smelled. I treated myself to this #3 and would recommend it to anyone who likes sweet fragrances.I give it 10-stars!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife and I found this product at the local Macy&#x27;s for approximately $80 and looked on amazon and found it for a great price!  Perfume arrived promptly and it was the real thing, not a \\&quot;tester.\\&quot;  We both really enjoy the scent!  Recommended!!</li>
    <li> I love the scent- I bought it bc i smelled it on someone else and thought it was such a fresh scent.  I&#x27;m still trying to see how long it lasts.  I feel like I have to put a lot on for anyone to notice it.  We&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> Sweet, warm &amp; a little tangy due to the rhubarb notes.  If you&#x27;re looking for a sweet smell that isn&#x27;t floral, powdery, or overly fruity, this is the perfect choice.  Not overpowering &amp; not too subtle, it&#x27;s just the right strength &amp; lasts all day.  Smells amazing year round, day &amp; night.  I looked all over for this perfume - the only store I could find it in was Sephora, but Amazon has a lower price.  I have gotten a lot of compliments on this perfume!  Comes in a nice big bottle &amp; lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> This perfume is very hard to get. You cannot buy it at any of the department stores. It is a very clean and&lt;br /&gt;fresh scent and does not give me a headache. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it and I will continue to buy it&lt;br /&gt;as long as I can find it.</li>
    <li> The odour is most appealing but the time to live is under four hours without bathing in it.  I prefer to pay the extra green for pure parfum sans the watered down &amp;#34;Eau de&amp;#34; handle on the bottle. But, hey, that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> This is a floral yet bright fragrance that just makes people&#x27;s head turn. I love it!! I feel like an empress when I wear it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. I&#x27;m yet to wear it for a full day but I just checked how it smells upon receiving it and I love it! I can absolutely imagine that this will become my new signature scent. It&#x27;s so amazing that I seriously want to order 10 bottles just to keep stored away for when this one finishes. I am in love! :) It&#x27;s definitely more of a fruity smell but it is sooooo fresh that it&#x27;s not even a TINY bit overbearing. It is one of those scents that will not give you a headache at all, which in my case is rare because I am very sensitive to scents. I read somewhere that this compared to the smell of Garnier Fructis hair products and I have to say I definitely agree. So great! Another thing worth mentioning is that this bottle on amazon costs about fifty something dollars which MAY seem like a lot, however, in other places it runs for about sixty something. Despite the high cost, you definitely do get a lot of bang for your buck! Please give this a try if you love anything fresh and fruity! :D</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s perfume and I bought it for her last Christmas I ordered her more for this year!</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance for my woman and she loves it. I like when she wears it too.  Give it a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for at least 4 years now, it&#x27;s amazing.  I get tons of compliments.  It&#x27;s fruity and light.</li>
    <li> this cologne is soo amazing! its my fav when my bf wears it! only special people can wear this cuz it doent work for anyone!</li>
    <li> I cant find this in any store in MX, Really nice sweet smell, perfect for ladys, low alcohol content at the right price</li>
    <li> Love it! And so does the man! Not to light, and not to strong. Also very refreshing. My new favorite!</li>
    <li> OMG I love it I&#x27;ve been looking for a perfume like this it doesn&#x27;t go away it smells really good. The price I paid for it it was really good and I&#x27;m happy because they don&#x27;t carry this perfume in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Fantastic perfume!  I feel like an Empress when I wear it.  I smelled it in a store where they didn&#x27;t have any more in stock because it sells out so quickly so I went on here to order it rather than wait because it&#x27;s just that good.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something light but so fruity as most perfumes are these days for the daytime. I really love it will keep it around</li>
    <li> A great Summer fragrance! The smell reminds me of grapefruit which I love but just a little sweeter. Whenever I wear it someone always compliments me on the smell.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! People ask me all the time what im wearing, but I never want to tell them. Lol, its such a soft and flirty scent and my husband loves it on me. I would recommend this fragrance to everyone! ♥♥</li>
    <li> Love it , good seller</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this on my wife, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife, she loves it! I&#x27;m not a fan of perfumes, this one is actually not bad, I would recommend and buy it again. Shipping took longer than what I have been accustomed to from Amazon. Amazon does state it will take 1-2 days to ship.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted for the summer</li>
    <li> Recomended AAAA +++++++</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, and yes I am a guy. Alot of people have told me that they love the way it smells, yes it is a bit fruity, but I&#x27;ve had girls tell me it smells really nice and other guys i know have bought it cuz they liked the way it smelled. D&amp;G themselves say its unisex. I love it! Buy it and you wont regret it!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume!  I got a sample in my Birch box and loved it so much, I had to buy it full size.  It smells of grapefruit to me and it is perfect for daytime.</li>
    <li> ...because everyone will be asking you what perfume you have on.  It&#x27;s such a nice, fresh, clean scent.  Buy it.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I smelled this at Sephora and loved the scent (but not the price), thankfully I managed to get it from Amazon for 20 dollars cheaper! When it arrived I was so excited because it smelled even better than I remember and I noticed that it combines with my chemistry into a warm but crisp scent-so good. Literally ever since using it for the first time, I get compliments on it from women and men. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tend to like many fragrances, many of them make me nauseous.  I&#x27;ve been wearing Kenzo D&#x27;ete for quite some time and recently ran out of my latest bottle.  While at a wedding in France, I loved the fragrance on a woman sitting near me.  She mentioned it was from a bottle sitting in the bathroom for guests to use to freshen up... I ran in and had to track it down once I returned back home from France.  It has such a lovely smell!!!</li>
    <li> Everything about this product was as promised. It came on time. It was in its original packaging and it smells just like the last bottle I bought from Macy&#x27;s. I am so thankful that this is available cheaper than $80 a bottle! It smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend recommended this and I usually don&#x27;t wear perfume (used my DKNY Be Delicious 5 times in 3 years), but this is so mild and light that I loved it right away. It has a light fruity and floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It&#x27;s been 2 years since I bought this and the scent seem to have gotten stronger and muskier. I store this in my bathroom cabinet where it&#x27;s cool, not sure if that matters. I&#x27;m not liking it as much with the stronger scent, so back to using my DKNY one, which still smells delicious 5 years later!</li>
    <li> I had this perfume before and was very sad to hear that I could no longer purchase the item in the Department Store. I was so glad to see that Amazone carry&#x27;s my Dolce &amp; Cabbana and many more.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this transaction as a whole. The price was better than buying this product from the mall (which is what I usually do). Shipping was fast. The product was exactly as I expected.  For the past few years, this has been a fragrance that I can&#x27;t do without. It&#x27;s a soft, fruity (but mature &amp; sophisticated scent). I will put emphasis on the fact that it does not make you smell like a little girl. D&amp;G did a great job with this one. I&#x27;ve read that this line of fragrances is part of a group that can be worn by men or women. In my opinion, this one is strictly for the ladies. I wear it year-round because it smells that good. In the warmer months, I probably wear this scent 4 if not 5 days of the week. My only criticism would be that this scent does not last the whole day.  I will re-apply mid-day. You really can&#x27;t over do it. Having said that, I still give it 5 stars. For me, it&#x27;s a must have fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is my go to perfume and I adore it. The smell is sweet but sexy all at the same time and I am so in love with it. The bottle lasts a long time and the smell stays with you all day. A very good quality perfume.</li>
    <li> A gift, for someone who loves it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received the perfume in the mail, but when I tried it, it does not smell like the one my friend has. My friend made me try on Limperatrice 3 and I immediately fell in love with it that is why I bought this perfume. I am so disappointed. I could not even return the product anymore because I already threw the box away. I didn&#x27;t think that this perfume I received would smell different than the one I originally tried. I&#x27;m really thinking that the one I received is a knock off. I am writing this review to warn others. I am not buying from this seller ever again! I just wasted $65 on this junk perfume.</li>
    <li> LOVE this perfume and the found it super cheap here on Amazon! Shipping was SO fast too. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Love love loved it!!!! Never going back!</li>
    <li> Love it! My all-time favorite.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent. It has a fresh citrus smell. I dont think anyone could go wrong with this perfume</li>
    <li> Smells fruity and soft at the same time. Don&#x27;t know how else to explain it. Fresh and clean, but for some reason kinda reminded me of alcohol but not in a bad way lol XD</li>
    <li> not as cheap as i think it was going to be but 5 or 6 dos less than a duty free shop</li>
    <li> LOVE it!!! I caught a whiff of it in Sephora one day and I was in love. It reminds me of a childhood memory that I can&#x27;t quite place my finger on (my mother said the SAME thing when she smelled it - it&#x27;s a scent that seems to evoke memory in us for some reason!). It&#x27;s quite sweet, rosy, and fruity, but not in that overwhelming, powdery Viktor/Rolf &amp;#34;FlowerBomb&amp;#34; way. It&#x27;s a very refreshing yet warm scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really DON&#x27;T love the packaging, it&#x27;s a very heavy bottle and I keep fearing I&#x27;ll drop it because the cap is pull-off, not twist off. I wish they had made a more elegant bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. I&#x27;m a sucker for florals!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!!! Good price too!!!</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how much I love this perfume. It&#x27;s sweet yet not overpower. I got so many compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a guy, looking for a gift for girl, this is it.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite Eau de Toilette since it became available in 2009. Amazon had the best price for a genuine product.  The top notes are kiwi, watermelon with base notes of musk, and pink cyclamen. It has a moderate  citrus/fruity scent that lasts 6 to 10 hours. Recommended for mature women and sophisticated younger ladies.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!!! The best one that I ever had!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE!!! Nice pretty smell--- that lasts! I typically wear D&amp;G light blue and came across this---  I am very happy with this fragrance</li>
    <li> This has such a pleasant, light smell that I look forward to putting it on every morning. I had previously been a Cool Water perfume wearer (for years in fact) and finally decided that I needed to update my &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;. After reading many reviews, I decided on this and I am so happy I did. I will probably need to by another bottle in 6 months or so :)</li>
    <li> Get many compliments on this.  This is my 3rd bottle.  Not overly sweet smelling, but crisp and citrusy.  Great scent!</li>
    <li> I received my product on time or earlier! I was very excited! The seller was very prompt! I look forward to using the product. I am extremely excited when I get the chance to use this it is a very soft sweet and subtle smell!! I&#x27;m excited to wear this product! This is my number one perfume!!Thank you!!</li>
    <li> A personal favorite in my collection since its debut in 2009, I use this perfume more than any other. It has a nice light, crisp scent. I love using it more in the Spring and Summer because of its kiwi and watermelon top notes and base notes of musk, and pink cyclamen. It comes across as a moderate citrusy / fruity scent. The musk is absolutely untraceable, as I do not like anything with a musky smell. I normally get a solid 6 hours of wear out of it. As long as this is in production, it will be in my rotation.</li>
    <li> So I got this about 2 months ago, and was quite contented on it until this afternoon when I went to ULTA and sprayed the same perfume on my left arm. On the way home I smelled something new and realized it was my left arm. I was kind of boggled since I have the same perfume but I never really got that scent on me before. So right when I got home I immediately sprayed the perfume that I bought from here on my right arm. I waited for it to dry down but the two just smell different. Like the one that I have is a little weak compared to the one in ULTA. It&#x27;s been about 4-5 hours now and the scent on my left arm is still there and smells fruity (watermelon) while the scent on my right arm smells barely anything. I&#x27;m honestly really disappointed since I could have just gotten it in ULTA for the same price and better quality. Oh well, lesson learned.</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume in the world!</li>
    <li> Excelent item, the quality is so good, very nice, I&#x27;m fun, Thank you very much.the price is so nice, very good.</li>
    <li> My perfume for 4 years, had been discontinued in many places, I was very happy to find it on Amazon with a lower price than the average perfume stores.&lt;br /&gt;Well packed, original, perfect!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance wish it was more accessible. One of the best D &amp; G as made for women. Nostrils REJOICE!</li>
    <li> This is already my favorite!! My friends like this too. Balance of sweetness and fresh floral is great. I have been wearing Daisy. If you like that you&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
    <li> This is a great perfume that is really unique. It kind of has a peachy after scent but it is really sophisticated. It last a long time too.</li>
    <li> This perfumes smells so good. It has a very soft fruity scent. Everyone says I smell good when I get into their car. spray a couple times on a pulse point and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> amazing smell, good quality, strongly recomend it to everybody who likes easly sweet and with a lot of personality frangrance</li>
    <li> First, please find the scent that personifies your essence before rushing a perfume purchase. I was hunting for such a scent until; I found this eternally spring-time scent, mixed with girlishness, delicacy, and sweetness. The drooling aromas of tropical fruits are refreshing. I exclusively and vehemently wear D&amp;G No. 3. Titillatingly and romantically flawless! &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! This was my second bottle and it&#x27;s hard to find. Amazon had the cheapest price. People are always asking what I&#x27;m wearing, but I don&#x27;t always tell them because its my signature scent!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. Its already out of season and I cant find it anywhere then in Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Found this purfume several years ago and just LOVED it! Have had a hard time finding it... Either the store did not carry it or, it didn&#x27;t smell like the original, nor look like the original (liquid had a different color to it).....This was just like the original:) smell, look, etc. VERY happy buyer:)</li>
    <li> the only fragrance I love!!!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, product is much better than the one I got from Sephora. Feels like it lasts longer. Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> Suave, dulce... delicioso !</li>
    <li> This is - &amp;#34;Eau de toilette&amp;#34;  - &amp;#34;toilet water&amp;#34; , NOT a &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;. So do not expect this to last long or to smell nice and strong like perfume would! That&#x27;s why it seems like it smells differently... I must notice, for toilet water, it is way overpriced.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good! I sprayed it at the store, walked out, then had to go back and purchase it because it smells so good! Smells sweet with like a citrus/peachy note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is for an older woman or a sophisticated young lady. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for ladies under 22, there are many other fragrances for younger ladies (like D&amp;G light blue, Coach, Juicy, etc), this is not one of them. (If you&#x27;re planning to give this as a gift)</li>
    <li> I love this and I cant seem to find it anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Women really enjoy smelling this on me....and I like that!!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, very light but impactful</li>
    <li> This is the greatest perfume!  I&#x27;ve tried so many and nothing compares.  It&#x27;s light and sweet and not overpowering.  It&#x27;s a ...make you feel pretty...kind of scent.  Everyone will ask you what you&#x27;re wearing!  : )</li>
    <li> Wow! I love this perfume so very much! I get stopped every single day. The scent is peachy yet very soft and sexy!! i HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU BUY IT!! XOXOOXXXX</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with Dolce &amp; Gabbana.  This particular scent is one of my absolute favorites!  Make sure to store all your perfumes in a dark place such as a drawer or medicine cabinet.  This makes a huge difference in the life of any perfume.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite scent! Its sexy and light at the same time. I live in fear of this item being discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;I just wonder why the other numbered scents in this series are cheaper in price?</li>
    <li> Fruity and tropical, perfect year round - so fresh and clean just what i expected I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff luv luv love it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I&#x27;ve been ordering it through Amazon since it is no longer available in local stores in my area.  I have to say, this last bottle was a little disappointing.  The fragrance is a little weak, like maybe the bottle has been sitting a shelf for a long time.  Since this product was sent by a third party, maybe that is the source of the problem.</li>
