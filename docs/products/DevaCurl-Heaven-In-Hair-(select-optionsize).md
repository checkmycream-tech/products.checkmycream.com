      <li>My girls are biracial and I LOVE this stuff.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s ok in a pinch</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>i use once a week and hair never looked better.</li>
      <li>I plan to continue to use the Deva Curl Heaven In Hair in hopes that everytime I use it, my hair will improve more and more.</li>
      <li>not before I read all 12 reviews on Amazon, to get more information...</li>
      <li>Maybe this product has more protein than my hair likes.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the product.</li>
      <li>I can now go 3-4 months without a haircut because my hair still looks bouncy and healthy and hydrated.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it once a week since then, and I cannot get over how much more manageable and healthy my hair is --</li>
      <li>I love it,</li>
      <li>I like One Condition much, much better.  </li>
      <li>If you have hair like mine you&#x27;ll love the product.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for the great deal!!</li>
      <li>She was so right, it was amazing</li>
      <li>Leaves your hair silky smooth.</li>
      <li>Sound like alot?  </li>
      <li>Great deep conditioner for my hair type.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great deep conditioner that I use as an overnight pre-poo and a conditoner when washing once a week.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use silicones or sulfates (although the conditioning cleansers like Deva&#x27;s No-Poo don&#x27;t work well for me), and very rarely use styling</li>
      <li>I normally dislike hair products from high-end salons, but I LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>A bit on the pricey side, but it is worth it!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence, I promise, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>Then one day I agreed to a deep condition, and wow -- did my hair feel great after she finished with me; soft, hydrated and beautiful looking curls.</li>
      <li>let this treatment sit in longer (about 60 minutes) under a plastic cap then wrap up in a towel for the warmth; rinse with cool water.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am biracial and thought that this wouldn&#x27;t meet all the needs that my hair type demands, but it really does meet all of them and more.</li>
      <li>Most leave-ins either don&#x27;t do much for my hair or leave it feeling coated.</li>
      <li>an 8-ounce jar has lasted me the full two months</li>
      <li>(I didn&#x27;t believe it either, but it&#x27;s true) and NEVER use a towel; instead blot or wrap with a t-shirt.</li>
      <li>It quenches my dry curls; making them soft and awesome!</li>
      <li>And I made sure to rub the product on the tips of my fingers to make sure it was mixed well before applying.</li>
      <li>Super conditioning.</li>
      <li>All I want is for my curls to look healthy; soft, bouncy and frizz free.</li>
      <li>I have mostly 3B curls in the upper layers of my hair with more 3C below, and because of that difference, some parts of my hair hold a curl well while others tend to frizz.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly after I ordered and was packaged well.</li>
      <li>This is by far the BEST deep conditioner I have tried thus far!!!</li>
      <li>Now, I laugh at the weather and give it not another thought.  </li>
      <li>Worth every dollar</li>
      <li>To be honest I have tried several of the &amp;#34;Deva Curl&amp;#34; products and</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s curly natural hair is more defined when she uses it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Another great Deva Curl product. Since my hair is very think and curly I use this every time I condition my hair. A bit on the pricey side, but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> My 4C (really 4D or E or even F!) natural African American hair reacted very well to this conditioner. It smoothed the cuticles and gave a good shine and snap to my curls.</li>
    <li> I have used Deva Curl for about a year, having heard about it from a previous co-worker, and I will use nothing else!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying embracing my curls! Deva Heaven In Hair is bomb and allowing me to rock the curls with confidence and shine!! 💚</li>
    <li> I cant say enough good things about Deva products!!  It makes curly hair very soft and defined!  It is a very superior product to anything else on the market!  Worth every dollar I spent!</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Made my curly hair less frizzy and much more manageable.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair silky smooth. My daughter&#x27;s curly natural hair is more defined when she uses it. Good product. Arrived timely.</li>
    <li> This should be mandatory for every person with naturally curly hair. If you have not tried it, the hair gods command thee!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok in a pinch (if I run out of other conditioners). I have medium length, wavy, to spiral curly hair that loves to frizz when dry :/&lt;br /&gt;I found that you have to use an awful lot of this product and it is quite expensive. To be honest I have tried several of the &amp;#34;Deva Curl&amp;#34; products and I really didn&#x27;t care for any of them. Like all the other products I&#x27;ve tried they either leave your hair sticky, greasy (dirty looking) or crispy and I don&#x27;t like any of those results. All I want is for my curls to look healthy; soft, bouncy and frizz free. I won&#x27;t be spending top dollar for their product again.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner.  i use once a week and hair never looked better.</li>
    <li> I had super high hopes for that product on my natural curly hair. A coworker recommended it, and had great results on her curls. However, I am not very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing is the smell… I can’t say scent because it is so strong and reminds me of the toilet bowl cleaner my mom used when I was a child. Not pleasant to my nose, and running around with that smell around my face all day long is not very desirable. I had read most reviews but no one ever complained about the smell… to the contrary. So I figure it is just me and the toilet bowl memories that are attached to the product now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance… My hair doesn&#x27;t look any different (perhaps I had used good products before that too?) and it feels not different. Maybe after a day or two I can see a difference? Someone wrote you have to grow with the product… Well… I will not toss it out quit yet… I will give it time, and my nose will become more forgiving over time I hope.&lt;br /&gt;So far, only 2 stars… but updates will come.</li>
    <li> love this while doing the curly girl method works good with my 4b textured hair</li>
    <li> I have mostly 3B curls in the upper layers of my hair with more 3C below, and because of that difference, some parts of my hair hold a curl well while others tend to frizz. I use other Deva Curl products and love them, and after reading up on the benefits of deep conditioning for taming frizz, I decided to give Heaven in Hair a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me say, this stuff is AWESOME. I applied it after washing my hair with No Poo and One Condition as usual, and I put on a shower cap to help hold in the moisture. After washing it out 25-30 minutes later, my hair felt softer than I had in ages, and the next day my curls looked really well-defined and MUCH less frizzy (and this was during a 90-degree, humid spell in July!). I have been using it once a week since then, and I cannot get over how much more manageable and healthy my hair is -- the frizzy factor is way down, and it does not get nearly as tangled as it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers, I admit that I initially balked at the price of this stuff, but like all the Deva products, it does such a good job that the cost is justified, and a little goes a long way -- I imagine the 16 oz. jar will last for several months, even using it weekly. If you&#x27;re on the fence, I promise, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Great product to control frizz! I put it on my hair after I get out of the shower (I don&#x27;t rinse it out!)!</li>
    <li> My Deva Concepts hairstylist of many years introduced me to this product. I ignored her for quite awhile because I found the price to be ridiculous. Then one day I agreed to a deep condition, and wow -- did my hair feel great after she finished with me; soft, hydrated and beautiful looking curls. I have gray/white tight curls and coils and my shoulder length hair is now cut medium short. If you have gray hair you know that it can be coarser than other colors. My gray hair also sucks up moisture through conditioners, pre-conditioners, leave-ins, butters, castor oil based products. I no longer have to use gel to keep my curls for 2-4 days, just refresh them with Devacurl Set It Free, and a little pomade to shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great deep conditioner that I use as an overnight pre-poo and a conditoner when washing once a week. I alternate with Jessicurl Deep Conditioner, another great product.</li>
    <li> Did not really do much for my hair.  Did not see the results of a good conditioner.</li>
    <li> It took awhile to see what exactly I needed to do with this but after I discovered I needed to use it with a mix of another hair mask my hair has been extremely happy. On days I use it I only use the hair masks and nothing else and my hair is light and happy and wavy the way it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a must in my hair routine.</li>
    <li> 5 star deep conditioning treatment at home. This product coats the curls and sets in to protect the curl from frizz and keeps the moisture locked.  It is easy to apply and smells wonderful. I have left it in for 30 minutes (no heat) twice a week and can already notice a difference . The stylist at the Déva Salon I go to said it looks great! A must have for curly dry hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the product. It smells great and does a great job of keeping curly hair moisturized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  It leave my hair so soft.  I use it weekly.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hair is naturally curly and in the winter when it&#x27;s dry it gets extra frizzy. Thanks to the Heaven in Hair it&#x27;s not anymore! I use it once a week in place of my normal conditioner. It arrived quickly after I ordered and was packaged well. The seller and the product are both wonderful.</li>
    <li> Super conditioning. I love this stuff. It quenches my dry curls; making them soft and awesome!</li>
    <li> I am biracial and thought that this wouldn&#x27;t meet all the needs that my hair type demands, but it really does meet all of them and more. This system has raised the bar for what I expect from my hair products. The only negative thing I can say about this product is that I am not personally the biggest fan of the smell, but the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> My hair LOVES this product!  I have 2c/3a course, thick hair and this has helped with the frizz immensely!  Leaves it so soft!</li>
    <li> Fabulous moisturizer for my thick, porous, curly hair. I use this as both a leave in as well as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> My girls are biracial and I LOVE this stuff.  It really helps tame the wild, course, dry hair.  Deva Curl products are expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for just over 2 months, on the advice of a stylist at the Devachan Salon.  I made the mistake of highlighting my hair this past summer and I&#x27;m paying for it now in the form of dry sections of hair that don&#x27;t want to curl :-(  The stylist at the salon used this product in conjunction with the One conditioner from the same line.  The results were impressive.  I, like most curly-haired girls, have several different curl patterns and some parts of my hair are straighter than others.  I was skeptical that anything would help to encourage better formed curls in those areas, but this combo did it.  Because some of my hair was damaged from the highlighting, I was advised to use Heaven in Hair as part of my daily routine.  It doesn&#x27;t take much, so an 8-ounce jar has lasted me the full two months and I&#x27;m likely to get another 2 weeks out of it...and that&#x27;s with daily use.  The tricks to maximizing the product are: 1) use it on sopping wet hair; 2) apply dime-sized dollops one at a time, drying your hands between applications; and 3) rub the dime-sized dollop between your hand and watch it magically increase in volume.  This is where most people mess up.  If you do this, you&#x27;ll use less product, which results in a better look and saves you money in the end.  Occasionally, I add a little One conditioner to \\&quot;finish\\&quot; my hair in the shower and then comes the scrunching.  Flip your hair and scrunch like mad.  Never use a comb or a brush (I didn&#x27;t believe it either, but it&#x27;s true) and NEVER use a towel; instead blot or wrap with a t-shirt. Towels break curly hair and contribute to frizz. You can air dry, but I find that 10 mins under a dryer (table top or stand dryer, low-med setting) makes a huge difference in curl definition.  You can also use a diffuser on a low setting.  You don&#x27;t want to blow the hair around, that would encourage frizz.  Sound like alot?  I thought so too, but in reality, I was doing just as much work to keep my naturally curly hair straight and I was paranoid about humidity, rain, etc.  I spent a ton of money on anti-frizz serums (silicone-based and really bad for your hair), anti-frizz shampoos and conditioners, gels, sprays, and so on and I STILL got frizz, even with my curly hair. Now, I laugh at the weather and give it not another thought.  No frizz here...ever.r straight and I was paranoid about humidity, rain, etc.  I spent a ton of money on anti-frizz serums (silicone-based and really bad for your hair), anti-frizz shampoos and conditioners, gels, sprays, and so on and I STILL got frizz, even with my curly hair.

    <li> This is by far the BEST deep conditioner I have tried thus far!!! During my transitioning period I have tried everything from Shea Moisture, Organix, Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Mizani, Redken... You name it.. I&#x27;ve tried it.. I have attempted to make my own deep conditioners, but I always felt as though whatever I was using would not penetrate to the hair shaft. I was leery at first to try the product especially with it being on the expensive side, but it was the best $26.00 (at Ulta) I have ever spent. It&#x27;s thick and creamy, I can tell this product is going to go a long way. I am very impressed of how this product was able to bring out the best in my hair. I was able to comb through my hair (with a wide tooth comb of course) to really work the product in. I have very thick, coarse hair, and it sucks up moisture like a vacuum. It is very difficult to keep my hair moisturized due to its texture, but &amp;#34;Heaven in Hair&amp;#34; truly brings out the best in my curly/wavy 4a hair. ***Be careful while using this product in the shower.. It will get very slippery***  Word of advice.. If you are in the same boat as I was as far as transitioning and trying to find a good deep conditioner, make sure you read the directions.. A true deep conditioner takes longer than 5 mins to condition your hair.. This particular product instructs you to leave it in 20-30 mins with a cap on (plastic cap is optional, but I used it for deeper penetration)</li>
    <li> Deva products are amazing.  Great product if your curls need moisture.  Can use as a leave in or a deep treatment.</li>
    <li> Everything was as posted.</li>
    <li> I have very large curly frizzy hair that is never soft. This product has made my hair so soft, yet it still curls. I can&#x27;t stop touching it, which I know is bad. If you have hair like mine you&#x27;ll love the product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected thank you!</li>
    <li> It is heavy, I take strands of just washed hair and condition it, in a few minutes I rinse it off lightly, my hair feels soft after this treatment. There is a fine line between hair being too heavily coated and just right.</li>
    <li> I love this mask! I have a portable mini heat-pad for my hair.  I put this in, put a shower cap on, apply the heat for 30 minutes, rinse...and soft silky, hair.  I use the entire Deva line and it&#x27;s really transformed my hair.  Happy with this!</li>
    <li> Great deep conditioner for my hair type. I have also used it as a leave in by just putting a dab on my ends.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It worked wonders on my hair, turing the frizz to soft curls. The product does leave a residue after using it every other day is the only negative aspect of this product. I do love how long the product lasts; I used this jar for about 6 months before it ran out! It kept my hair soft as well as contained the mess of curls. It worked really well on my relaxed curls helping to define them. I am a poor college student and needed a product that would last me a while and preform well and this was it! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after watching \\&quot;Mahogany Curls&#x27;\\&quot; Deva Curl Product review on YouTube.  Her review included the pros and cons of the product and because her hair is absolutely AMAZING, I decided to give the product a try, but not before I read all 12 reviews on Amazon, to get more information...lol.  I should tell you that I&#x27;ve been using and making all my deep conditioners from ingredients in my kitchen (mayonnaise, alvacado, egg yolk, greek yogurt, banana, pumpkin, etc.) and they&#x27;ve worked wonders on my hair.  That being said, I mixed together mayo, greek yogurt, pumpkin, and apple cider vinegar (ACV) and applied that to one side of my hair, and applied the Deva Curl Heaven In Hair, on the other side of my hair.  I covered my hair in a plastic cap and went to sleep. When I rinsed my hair, the next day, the Deva Curl side was MUCH softer and silkier than the side with the homemade conditioner, although the results of, the application, of the two conditioners were just the opposite; the APPLICATION of the homemade conditioner made my hair feel much softer than the APPLICATION of the Deva Curl.    Note:  When I applied the Deva Curl Heaven In Hair, I followed the Amazon review that said to put a dime-sized amount in the palm of your hand and rub your hands together and watch the product expand.  She was so right, it was amazing and it saved me from wasting product unnecessarily.    I plan to continue to use the Deva Curl Heaven In Hair in hopes that everytime I use it, my hair will improve more and more.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;I did not know how dry my hair was until I started to use this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is softer, silkier and the curls are more healthier and look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;I let this treatment sit in longer (about 60 minutes) under a plastic cap then wrap up in a towel for the warmth; rinse with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks and feels amazing!!!</li>
    <li> This is thee best conditioner i have ever found for my daughter&#x27;s kinky, curly locks!!! Thanks so much for the great deal!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and then for my niece.  She loved it so much that we went to Deva to get her hair cut - and she loved that too!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have fine Botticelli curls that wilt if you just look at them wrong. I was using the light AnGel or whatever the new equivalent is, and it was just way too much for my hair. When I used the gel, I would always get crunchy curls, and I could never get second day curls to work with it. This stuff is a great solution. I get defined curls that are easy to revive the next day. I took the advice of a there reviewers to use this as a leave in. My hair needs a lot moisture, so I use no-poo  and then one condition, which I mostly leave in only getting it off my scalp. Then I separate my hair into three sections, rub a dime size amount into dry hands (this really helps) and apply it to the first section then repeat. I let it dry in my microfiber towel and air dry, and I get results for my moisturize-starved, fine, long curls.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really effective for my hair. Since its effectiveness may depend on your hair type and other products, for reference my hair is medium-long, fine, wavy-to-curly depending on the humidity, low porosity, and usually very dry on the ends. I don&#x27;t use silicones or sulfates (although the conditioning cleansers like Deva&#x27;s No-Poo don&#x27;t work well for me), and very rarely use styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a deep conditioner, used for an hour with a heat cap, this stuff really changes my hair for the better. It&#x27;s not weighed down, has less fly-aways, feels flexible instead of brittle, and is shiny all the way down to the ends (something I&#x27;ve never managed with other conditioners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned that this also works well as a leave-in, so I gave that a try, since I don&#x27;t often have an hour to sit around in a heat cap. Most leave-ins either don&#x27;t do much for my hair or leave it feeling coated. But a very small amount of this product--spread around in my hands and squeezed through sopping wet hair right out of the shower--was outstanding. Left even the ends shiny, didn&#x27;t weigh it down, no coated look or feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way this product didn&#x27;t work so well for me was simply leaving it on for a few minutes in the shower before rinsing (without the extended heat cap treatment). Used that way, it seemed to just disappear without leaving any &amp;#34;conditioned&amp;#34; feel. But I don&#x27;t really need to use it that way, even when I&#x27;m in a hurry, since it works so well as a leave-in. And as a bonus, using it as a leave-in is super economical, since such a small amount is needed.</li>
    <li> OMG! The best, I love this product.</li>
    <li> This makes my super thick curly hair softer and really helps in the detangling process.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way and it smells divine.</li>
    <li> THE BEST FOR CURLY HAIR!</li>
    <li> Love this, makes hair feel great and defines curls!</li>
    <li> This is my go to conditioner to keep my curls in shape through the mean, dry winters.  I love it, just wish it weren&#x27;t so pricy.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this product, it makes my 4B natural hair feel hard. Maybe this product has more protein than my hair likes. I&#x27;ll stick to my Giovanni Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using Deva products for a few years already, I get my hair done in their SoHo NYC salon.  They are just simply the best products for curly hair! My hair is more manageable, softer, I just can&#x27;t say enough about these products.  I have thick curly hair and get many compliments.  I cheated this summer and used other drug store products (mainly due to the cost) and I paid the price 10 times over. My hair got so dried out from the drug store products.  I will NEVER stray from DEVA again.  THEY ARE THE BEST PRODUCTS FOR CURLY HAIR.!! TAKE IT FROM ME, I&#x27;VE TRIED EVERYTHING OUT THERE!!</li>
    <li> Love this as a leave in conditioner.  Tames my frizzy curls even in the most humid of weather.</li>
    <li> Best deep moisturizer</li>
    <li> I use this weekly for my DC, I will be getting it again... Happy that I have found this product.</li>
    <li> I have wavy/layered hair and style my hair to enhance those waves.  This conditioner made my hair very soft and limp, so much so that I had much less wave than usual.  It wasn&#x27;t until I rewashed my hair - using my usual products - that my waves reappeared.  Also, it did not seem to detangle that well.  I like One Condition much, much better.  For those reasons, I would not recommend this product.  (Maybe for very curly hair the relaxing effect is good??)</li>
    <li> Very happy with this conditioner! It has made a big difference with the moister of my curl...my holy grail!</li>
    <li> I have tried several times this product and, like any other Deva product, leaves my curls dry.</li>
    <li> The BEST product ever for your natural curls!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the product I expected.</li>
    <li> Im not to happy with the smell, but it works wonderful on my hair!!!!</li>
    <li> I normally dislike hair products from high-end salons, but I LOVE this product! I actually get my hair cut at the Devachan Salon here in NYC 2-3 times a year (I&#x27;d go more often but they are very expensive) and they do such a great job cutting curly hair but the other products from them I haven&#x27;t cared much for so I was reluctant to try this product.  But they finally talked me into trying it because my hair is so dry.  I wish I had listened to them earlier because this made such a noticeable difference in the way my hair looked, it was really amazing!  My curls are softer and they almost never get that frizzy look.  I can now go 3-4 months without a haircut because my hair still looks bouncy and healthy and hydrated.  I&#x27;m hooked on this stuff.  And while it does seem expensive, you don&#x27;t have to use very much so it lasts a LOT longer than you would expect.  I think mine lasted about 6 months before I needed to buy more.  If you have curly hair that tends to get dry I think you&#x27;ll really be thrilled with this product.</li>
    <li> First off, I actually like the smell of this product. Not very sure where the it smells bad thing is coming from. My issue is that after two tries my hair did not feel deeply conditioned.(There was a full 7 day gab between each try). It actually felt dry, drier than when I started. It felt dry as soon as I started putting it on my hair. I followed their instructions to the letter. And still this product just did not work for my hair. I did use the No-Poo first, then applied this by sectioning my hair. Each section was small. And I made sure to rub the product on the tips of my fingers to make sure it was mixed well before applying. 30 minutes later and I had a head full of wet, brittle hair. TWO tries!! I had to add Shea Butter oil to it to get my hair to become pliable enough to comb/detangle while this product was in. I am so very upset that I have a large amount left. I really just do not know if I want to try again. Their stylist said try doing it every other week. So I may try one last time. Otherwise said product is in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Hair type: 4a,4b with a little 4c thrown in.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it as a leave in but pricey</li>
    <li> Arrived on time &amp; good experience</li>
    <li> this is by far the best leave in product for curly hair, i can&#x27;t be without it!!</li>
    <li> Horrible !  smells awful !  I left it on ,  the result &#x3D; dry  , dried out breaking mess.  It was hard to get out,  a dry&lt;br /&gt;brittle cement.  I used my conditioner and ugh,  still breaking dry,  more frizzy than ever !  I am furious&lt;br /&gt;Do Not Buy this !  It will dry out and break your hair !</li>
