<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly what I needed! Big enough for both hands or both feet. I get many compliments on my nails now and I don&#x27;t even tell anyone it&#x27;s not professionally done! You have to follow the directions carefully with the polishes, but this lamp is awesome.</li>
    <li> I chose this product so that I could start to do shellac manicures for myself at home.  It was not the most expensive unit, not the least expensive.  I was surprised at its size when I opened the box.  It is large enough to cure both hands at once.  I have only used it once so far, but I had no issues with it.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Almost 4 weeks into use and I love it. Works superbly just like the salons. It&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> Love all the different time selections and fan. Sturdy.</li>
    <li> The first only lasted about 2 uses and stopped working. Amazon replaced it and haven&#x27;t had any problems with the new one. Wife loves it. Last longer than nail polish, looks better, and easier to remove. Use it plenty within first 30days to test it. I will say I&#x27;m disappointed in the company for raising the price by $20 and another $10 as Christmas got closer just to boost profit</li>
    <li> I used to go to the nail salon every 2 weeks... In an effort to save money I picked up this machine and nail polish from Candy Lover.&lt;br /&gt;1. The gel look is the same quality as in the salon&lt;br /&gt;2. The machine is way larger than in the salon which is good because doing your nails yourself allows you to dry both hands at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;3. It takes so much longer to dry!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been an hour and my nails are still drying! I never write reviews but I&#x27;m so bored waiting for my toes to dry that I decide to make use of this time. My finger nails are still wet so I&#x27;m being super careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally got some fuzz on my thumb; I have no idea where it came from, so that finger is ruined - but you know what? For the price of this machine, it&#x27;s less than how much I pay+ tip in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I love it? NOPE! But I&#x27;m going to save money and still get the look. I just have to be ridiculously patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not patient, you will end up chucking this thing out the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re trying to save but still look fabulous, you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how long I will last but if I use this thing and the polish just one more time, I will have saved money on the two mani and pedis I would have paid for, you decide if it&#x27;s worth your 2 1/2 hours. Going on 3...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*So far my toes have sat on the 300SEC setting + fan, 11 times.</li>
    <li> I received this parcel in great time for how large it was shipped to protect the device inside. It works perfectly and I&#x27;m very impressed by the logical consideration of the features.</li>
    <li> Loooove. Works perfect!</li>
    <li> Horrible item. Im the owner of a nails salon and this is the worst UV light ever. It came with no 6 uv lights and I have to buy all the lights from a nails supply shop for 30 bucks so I already waste 80 bucks for this s***. I installed the lights, plugged in n It didnt work at all. I havent give any 1 star for any items but this is the first one. Must return this s***.</li>
    <li> Great lamp! I&#x27;ve had the light for a couple of weeks now and it does a great job at curing gel polish. I love that you can do two hands or two feet at once. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, no broken pieces.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I dont think the gel nail polish i bought worked well with this machine. I will try OPI nail polish. Hopefully it works.</li>
    <li> I love the fan it makes it so much nicer</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very simple to use and the set-up instructions are easy to follow. One of the bulbs was blown upon delivery and the company replaced it within 2 business days and I really appreciate that. The fan option works great for regular polish. It conveniently fits both feet or both hands for the curing of gel polish. This product is saving me $40 a week by not going to the nail salon and doing my nails myself.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I love the fact that right after I get done curing my nails I can go and do laundry, dishes, take care of little ones, etc... as a stay at home mom that is very important because I can&#x27;t wait and hour or even longer for regular nail polish to dry. This is a must have product for anyone wanting to do at home gel nail polish!</li>
    <li> I will admit I read the reviews a LOT more carefully than the product description.  I didn&#x27;t realize what a quality light this was, the option to have the fan on or off is awesome on those cold days.  The lights cure my shellac and I love the timer feature.  The huge span of light is awesome when I&#x27;m in a hurry and I have to do both hands or feet at once.  I would totally buy another one of these for a gift.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and great value!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on the nail dryers before ordering this one, I am so happy that I did, it works perfectly, the only small draw back to this dryer is that it is large, you can fit both feet or hands at the same time which it clearly states. I like the larger size and so happy this is the dryer I ordered works perfect. I wish I had ordered the nail systems earlier doing my nails at home saves me 100.00 a month and it is so easy.</li>
    <li> My daughter actually checked out all the ratings for these type of dryers for me and told me to buy this one.  I was skeptical, but went with it.  What a fantastic choice.  A great dryer, with multiple dry time settings as well as a fan.  Capable of doing both hands at once, perfect for pedicures!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this appliance.</li>
    <li> This is a low to medium skilled application, that you will gain confidence overtime.  We preferred the Harmony Gelish polish Cameron the results are amazing, Impress your friends with your creative skills.</li>
    <li> Love it, works perfectly. Bigger than I thought it would be but then I didn&#x27;t read the details about the size of the machine. Perfect even for feet. Love it love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult to get it right at first but I&#x27;ve just used it one time. If you follow the other girls reviews as I did they are dead on.  One thing I didn&#x27;t give that much consideration was if you use to much it pools around the edges and you cannot wipe it off. Make sure your brush is completely not to loaded dripping.  Wipe it off on the edge of the bottle. ESPECIALLY THE base COAT. It is the coat by which all the other coats will be decided. Believe me this stuff will last forever because it goes far.  IF YOU GET ANY ON YOUR FINGER AND TRY TO GET IT OFF YOU&#x27;LL PULL OFF THE WHOLE NAIL OF POLISH. IT&#x27;S ALL MEANT TO WORK TOGETHER and it does. I Ithought at the end it would be tacky not wet sticky and it is. Don&#x27;t keep trying to dry it like I did.  Just wipe it off with alcohol and you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s beautifully shiny and dry.  I&#x27;ve had it on almost two weeks and it&#x27;s starting to peel on the edges slightly and I am not kind to my nails. Even though it&#x27;s beginning to peel its still remarkably shiny. Ist the base coat, nail polish then Top coat sealer. It&#x27;s completely worth it to spend the money for it. The cleaning stuff looks like alcohol in one bottle and acetone in the other. II wouldn&#x27;t spend money on that again. II used the acetone and alcohol iI have here and it worked just as good. . II saved half the price going to the salon with the first use. My hubby was happy. Base coat must be sparring don&#x27;t let it pool around the sides. What you put on the base and how it looks is how it will look with the rest of the coats.  Happy manicures.</li>
    <li> Great light! After looking and searching for a good lamp that holds not one, but TWO hands, this was on my to get list. It has a fan, although I wish it was a little more powerful, but no worries. The UV light works amazing. Love the fact that it has timed settings up to 300 seconds. Would defiantly recommend this product. Oh, btw... Shipping was fast and item was packaged very well!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I do my own nails at home and the little one I had was not equiped with the uv light. I saw this on sale at amazon and decided to buy it an was very suprised when it arrived. It was a lot bigger than expected so I had to make room on my coffee table for it. I am not complaining I think it&#x27;s great. It works well to.It had the uv and a fan for faster drying I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this light. I recommend it to everyone in search of a UV light. I do my nails every 2 weeks and its the best UV light out there.</li>
    <li> It was bigger and nicer than I expected!  Works great and didn&#x27;t have to wait to get it. Works great!!</li>
    <li> Love this item. It&#x27;s opening is wide and high enough that one does not have to worry about messing up the polished nails.  The heat is great and works in minutes.  It was packaged perfectly and delivered in a quick and timely.  The instructions to install the bulbs were simple and easy. 1.2.3. and it&#x27;s ready to go.  I would definitely recommend this all.  If you want to save yourself money, polish and dry your own nails and definitely buy this item to top it off.  You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I use this in my salon and it is the best UV light I have ever had. Thinking about buying a few more.</li>
    <li> After few years, I am reducing star to 2.&lt;br /&gt;Light bulbs are not staying in place. (See pictures)&lt;br /&gt;They are all very loose and I have to keep pushing them back in. They are not mounted tightly!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s annoying. I am interested to know if others are having same issue.</li>
    <li> CND Shellac was listed as one of the gels this could be used for but ir did not dry the gel.  Wrong wattage. CND lampe, though condiderably more expensive is 36 watt this is 54.</li>
    <li> There was a light that don&#x27;t lit. I had two options: return it or keep it that way. I had a compromise counting with the lamp on that date.</li>
    <li> This is one of the greatest investments I&#x27;ve made in doing my own nails.  The amount paid for this dryer has paid for itself in two uses.  I usually pay upwards of $25 or more for shellac nails in the salon.  It&#x27;s easy to use and works as needed.  It was very easy to set up, just pop in the bulbs that were included.  It&#x27;s much larger than what I expected.  It&#x27;s actually the same item used in the salon that I frequent.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine suggested this to me. I tend to believe her since she works at a salon. I still call on her for nail repairs, but this works great for in between visits.</li>
    <li> big enough for 2 hands or 2 feet.  I have only used it for regular polishes so far, but will be trying my own gels with this dryer...</li>
    <li> I bought this to use so I could do my own gel manicures. I&#x27;m still waiting on my gel kit to get here, but I did use this light on my daughters nails with regular nail polish and it took at least 5min for it to completely dry under the lamp. I&#x27;m hoping that it works as well for my gels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 31, 2013&lt;br /&gt;Update since getting my gel polish and using the UV light. It works perfect and drying time is a breeze!! Love this lamp. It&#x27;s large enough to put both hands in if needed and nothing in there to hit your nails on and mess them up like the lamp that was at my hair dressers. Can&#x27;t sing it&#x27;s praises enough and hate that I didn&#x27;t get one sooner!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and I&#x27;m no professional at all.  I am a working mom that can afford to pay the salon every other week however making me beautiful with my very on tools as if I walked out the salon works for me.  Love it.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seems to work good even after the correct directions. Leaves the nail still tacky&lt;br /&gt;to the touch after 240 seconds to 300 seconds. Plan on returning this product</li>
    <li> I purchased this UV light/nail dryer about a month ago and recently used it for redoing my previously store done shellac nails. It&#x27;s not commercial grade, but the high use parts seem like they will last for the next couple decades (since it only needs to be used once every two weeks). Be sure to use ethanol to wash your nails when done with the cycle (at least with the shellac starter kit) otherwise it will seem like it is not working as they initially come out a little sticky. Overall I am very excited by the results and extremely happy with the quality. My husband is also very happy as he hates the smell of toluene, especially in our house. With this, my nails are done much faster and stay nice for much longer than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> After reading the great reviews here, I decided to purchase this light and I&#x27;m so glad I did. The quality is really great and it has worked without any glitches doing what is supposed to do. I love that you can cure both hands or feet and the same time (it&#x27;s bigger than I thought). I&#x27;ve used it a ton in the last month since I bought it and I&#x27;ve been so impressed I have purchased another one as a gift. I highly recommend this UV light.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping and its pretty big good for your feet too</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It was reasonably priced and seems to be good quality. I would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Just received mine!! Got it very fast, very neatly packaged, everything was intact, no broken bulbs, very easy instructions to follow.  I don&#x27;t have a single complaint!  Already used it and my gel nails came out perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. For those of you saying that your gel polish never dried....don&#x27;t forget to rub the alcohol (not acetone) on them at the very end.  That&#x27;s what takes off the sticky film!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have invested in gel nails at home.  I was very hesitant at first, but a friend of mine ordered her own light and supplies and she was very happy, so I went ahead and ordered the Royal nail dryer.  This dryer is so fast and I had no problems with the gel when using this dryer.  I can do my nails and be out the door in a 1/2 hour.  It is faster than conventional nail polish by far. I am very pleased with my purchase, could not be happier!</li>
    <li> I was debating on whether or not to invest in one of these and I  am glad I did.  I love shellac manicures, but they are so expensive and it is not always easy to get an appointment when I want.  The dryer came super quickly, but there really isn&#x27;t much in the way of directions.  Thanks much to previous poster advising that you can open the bottom of the dryer to remove the film and insert the bulbs.  I would just like to add that to open the dryer on the bottom you have to push in the tabs for it to open.  It is also a bit larger then I expected, but it will accommodate both hands or feet without any problems.  They dryer works great.  I used it to give myself a shellac manicure and it did a great job of curing the nails.  The timer runs from 90 to 300 seconds and there is also a fan button if you wish to use it.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Just used this UV nail dryer and it works so great! I did my research for a long time to find the best quality nail dryerwith a high wattage without spending $300+! And this is it! It has a fan and different timers for the UV light. 90 seconds was more than enough time to dry my gel Polish! Must buy!</li>
    <li> Better than most salon UV lights!  When my daughter got married, I didn&#x27;t want to mess with the daily maintenance of standard nail polish, so I went to the salon and got them shellacked.  I watched the process and knew I could do it myself.  I looked at a lot of UV lights before picking Royal.  My research paid off.  This light is amazing! I purchased all the supplies via Amazon and got fantastic results on my first attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is large enough for both hands so I polish both hands and cure them in the light at the same time. Start to finish.. I have professional results in 20-30 minutes.  The quality of the light was a pleasant surprise, sturdy power cord, multiple time settings, .... Like I said.. It&#x27;s better than many salon lights.</li>
    <li> I feel like I have a nail salon at home. I have never done gel nails myself before but I did my own gels at home last night with my new UV light and dryer and the came out great. I bought this dryer after seeing reviews for smaller less powerful lights taking forever. This one is a great quality and I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy this lamp separately instead of buying a starter kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as she had been coveting it. After using it for the first time she was absolutely blown away. She is bragging about it to all her friends now. Thanks for the great product for a gift.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I wanted to do gel and shellac nails but really couldn&#x27;t see spending double the amount on a lamp with less wattage. I did my research on this and its perfect!!!!!!!  I&#x27;ve done about 5 sets of gel and shellac on myself and it&#x27;s just perfect.  I would most certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent lamp.  Not only is it great for fingers, but toes as well.  Both hands fit at one time and if you do your toes, both feet fit at the same time.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for a birthday present for daughter but unfortunately she couldn&#x27;t use it so sent it back..looked like a great deal tho</li>
    <li> Love this light, It cuts down on my gel manicure time and is super efficient. Works great with Gelish, CND and Light Elegance! Would recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item about a month ago. I have used it twice, once to do my nails and to do my moms. The first time it over heated so I recommend turning on the fan to cool it down when in use. Other than that, the UV light works extremely well and it dries your nails within 60seconds. It gives you didn&#x27;t selections to choose from in order to set the time. For example, you can set it for 90 seconds all the way up to 180 seconds. In addition, when the time is up the light will go off automatically. I really enjoyed using it and I hope it last awhile. I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my daughter, she truly loves it and will save her a lot of money to get her nails done, now she can do it herself with the end results like the salon.</li>
    <li> It takes a long time to cure gel and acrylic.</li>
    <li> Love It!!! It works FANTASTIC! I highly recommend this UV light system. I purchased a set of BMC nail polish and the BMC base &amp; top coat. I use the BMC brand along with this Royal Light and it works GREAT!! The polish stays on and has the shiny salon look for about 2 weeks. No chipping at all. This was a great purchase and I highly recommend buying this UV Light.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a great Gel lamp, then this is the one to have. I&#x27;ve ordered many laps and find this one to be the best ever, I have ordered. Large enough for both hands and feet... A must have for the true professional.</li>
    <li> It is the best gel dryer I&#x27;ve had! Good price too! And fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed that this product did not come with all things needed to get started.  Did not have polish, base or final coat items.  This was a gift and when it was given to them, I assumed that it was complete and ready to go.</li>
    <li> This UV light system is very easy to use and nice for my clients. I how you try it because i love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few lamps before this one and this by far is the best one. The most powerful but not too intense. I use it for Gelish products and it dries the gel quickly and the gels last longer then all the previous times. I&#x27;m glad I got it, I would highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my younger sister for christmas.. I might have been more excited than she was!! She loved it. Naturally, it being my younger sister, I made her do my nails. She is completely new to this so we just bought a $30 starter pack from walgreens and it worked fantastically. Very easy to use. Cant wait to go back to my parents to have her do them again!</li>
    <li> This light is convenient for doing both hands at the same time. However, I feel like you must leave your nails in longer than 2 minutes for them to harden.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love this product. Works as well as the salon ones except you get to do your nails over and over</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! One of my best purchases so far. Great price! Fast shipping. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Excellent, nails came out shinier using this unit com pared with another one that I have. Not hot on the hand because there&#x27;s a fan. Price was the best out there. Highly recommended by nail technician.</li>
    <li> I tried the light with Gelish Harmony base,top coat and gel polish, and cured for 2 mins per coat.  The ending result is perfect, the coats are dried in time and the polish is glossy and shining after I rubbed out the sticky residue at the end.  This uv lamp has very high wattage and enough room to put both hands or both feet in it, which I really love.  The space inside is also long enough to make sure your thumbs can be cured too.  Very easy installation and also easy to use.  Bottom line is that the lamp is well constructed and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional manicurist and let me tell you, this I&#x27;s the best gel curing light I&#x27;ve ever used! I decided to purchase this light for home use and it works just as great or even better than one of those 300 dollars LED curing lights! It has a built I&#x27;n fan so it won&#x27;t get hot while curing Ur nails .. U can&#x27;t beat the price for a 54 watt ! If Ur looking for a gel curing light , this I&#x27;s the one for u !</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product.  There is so much room to put both of your hands or feet in the unit.  It also looks very stylish.  There is a fan in the top of the unit which is very convenient.  The unit opens up so you can easily put the bulbs in. It also has set timers so you will know exactly when to remove your hands or feet. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> We received the item faster than expected, and are very pleased. The unit is large, and seems to do a great job. We used ours with Gellish nail system, and they came out great our very first try. Would definitely recommend product and seller.</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful purchase. With this affordable UV light, I am now able to do all of my own shellac nails at home for the price of about 1 trip to the salon! It works very well and I don&#x27;t have any complaints. One of the bulbs arrived broken but I contacted the company and their customer service was amazing. They immediately shipped me a new one and it arrived within days. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Quality product--does great!</li>
    <li> Used twice and works well, so far.</li>
    <li> Great UV light for curing gel nail polishes. There are a lot of reviews posted stating that the UV light does not dry their nail polish. You HAVE to apply isopropyl (alcohol) to a cotton ball and rub it over your nail AFTER you apply your top coat. This will rid any of that tacky feeling left on your nails and the gel polish will be dry.</li>
    <li> Broke after two months of light use. I tried to contact the distributor AND the manufacturer and no one will reply. Too late to get a refund from Amazon because it&#x27;s past 30 days. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions and recommended drying times for certain polishes. Also I only used regular nail polish, not gel. Like previous reviewer wrote: it is best to dry for complete 300 secs b4 after applying each coat. So 1st coat...then dry for 300 secs.... 2nd coat then dry for 300 secs.....3rd coat or final shine - then dry for 300 secs. I am also an amateur at doing my nails but I must say my nails are 100% passable as being professionally applied if you don&#x27;t stare too hard.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!!! My Daughter and I have never done gel nails but really wanted to try. We just did them tonight and they came out BEAUTIFUL. This is a very good UV Light! I read that most Salons use a 36 Watt light and was very impressed that this one is a 54 Watt for such a great price! For anyone wanting to try Gel nails themselves you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this!!!</li>
    <li> I received the nail dryer. It looks very nice aND professional. I was very pleased. I purchased Harmony Gelish polish to use with this unit. I have only used it once but the results have been long lasting just as if I had gone to a salon. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Love my light, and use it every manicure.  It really sets my polish and great for that top coat... you do need the two - three minutes per coat. But then you know it is set firmly. I also would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> The lamp works great and is needed for proper curing of every layer of gel nail polish</li>
    <li> I had a smaller lower wattage lamp before and the shellac would peel after a few days.  With this lamp, it stays on for 2 weeks!  AND u can do ur nails in half the time!!</li>
    <li> Works so fast on regular nail polish too! I love it!</li>
    <li> Great buy.  I gives my regular and gel polish a nice professional, hard and shiny finish.  I can now finish my nails quickly because this little dryer will dry them in 2 minutes.  Big enough to use on my feet too.</li>
    <li> Works great! ! My nails look just as good as if they were done in the salon!</li>
    <li> Purchased this at an incredible discount for my daughter.  Works great!  Make sure you follow the instruction or the paint will peal off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v got the defected bulbs, but they sent the right ones soon.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this it&#x27;s easy to use and has a great price and saves my wife money from not having to go to the nail salon all the time</li>
    <li> Big enough for hands or feet and cant beat the price!!</li>
    <li> Very professional and heavy duty unit. It works great. I was so impressed, at this price I was pleasantly surprised. You can not go wromg with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My wife and three daughters use this every week or so and it has worked perfectly for a year. It has more than paid for itself.</li>
    <li> We bought this item before, after few years it quit working, so we bought another one, the person who we gave it to loved this item, she used a lot, and when it quit working she wanted the same one again, she loves to be able to do two hands or feet at the same time, it does a great job. When we got this one the box looked a little wear on it, we opened it. It looked as if it had been return, the condition was good not like new, which it was suppose to be. It does work, she was still happy with it. If your looking for a nail light and like to cut down on time doing your nails, this is the best for time and money, I got it in with in a week of ordering it, I give this company 4 stars on this item sent, 5 stars on buying it and shipping, I would order again. This Item is great for anyone who loves doing there nails or even a little side business for extra cash.</li>
    <li> Thank you I love it! Great price, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift and it doesn&#x27;t light.  The giftee didn&#x27;t try it for a while and when she found out it didn&#x27;t work it was past the time to return through Amazon.</li>
    <li> It is so easy to assemble, has such a pretty and professional look to it. I am beyond thrilled with my purchase and can&#x27;t wait to buy more shellac and gel polishes for myself, my daughter, and my friends! Thank you! I will have awesome professional looking nails without having to go get them done.</li>
    <li> This is Big salon size machine. Both hands fit in. I didn&#x27;t know so it was surprise when I got it. But works great.</li>
    <li> Great light I just love it. I plan on getting a couple more of these for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> this light was much larger than I had envisioned, so storage of it was little bit harder than I expected for home use. I used it with Gelish products and it worked great, if you have space to store it, you can do two hands or two feet at once with this, and the controls are very easy to use</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter and it works really well</li>
    <li> This light works great and has been so much fun! I use it for my feet (gross I know but it is MINE alone) and my hands. The only drawback is the polishes are a bit pricey. But I love the Gelish Brand.</li>
    <li> I really really love this dryer.  I got my nails done for a year prior to ordering this, but due to how spendy it is I decided to go DIY, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I do gel polish, so I don&#x27;t do anything too crazy.  I wanted a product that wasn&#x27;t too expensive but that does a good job (as with all products), and this one does an excellent job.  Love it.  It&#x27;s super easy to use.  First I add the base coat, and then I cure it for 90 seconds, then I do the color.  How many coats of polish I do depends on the color, but I cure it for 160 secs (two mins) with the color.  Than I add the top coat and cure it for 160 secs as well, and viola! Perfect nails every time.  My polish really lasts for 2+ weeks, holds up realllllyyy really well.  I can use any brand of polish with this machine and it all lasts the same (I&#x27;ve use Gelish, IBD, and another brand I found on sale at Sally&#x27;s).  I would recommend this to anyone! It&#x27;s an excellent price for how well it works.</li>
    <li> Just received today and box has apparently been previously opened. &amp;#34;Authentic&amp;#34; tape that seals box has been opened and cord it not wrapped as it would be if &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.  Extremely disappointed as this is a gift for Christmas and I hate to take a chance that it does not work right.  Was hoping I could just exchange it for a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; one but the only option is to return and then repurchase.  The price is now $15 more than when I bought it.</li>
    <li> When I first opened it I could not believe how big it was, I have only used it once, and it worked great!!  Love the variety of timer settings and the optional fan, I did not think that I would use it with both hands in it at once but I do, and it is convenient!!</li>
    <li> the product is great that it works the way it is supposed to, but one of the lightbulbs constantly falls out of place.  i put the machine away when not in use and every time i take it out im afraid the lightbulb is going to fall out and break.  i dont think its the lightbulb, but the socket that is defective.  when the machine is on, the lightbulb stays lit, but just a little bump will knock it out of the socket.  its been like this since the very first time i used the machine.  if it wasnt defective, this would be a really nice product.  its not worth returning, but the product could be built a little better.</li>
    <li> Light works great.  It&#x27;s very convenient to be able to cure both hands at the same time due to the size.  This light was extremely affordable and is helping me save money by doing my nails at home.  This light also works wolith CND Shellac.</li>
    <li> Bought this lamp after reading the reviews and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Came quickly and works great. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
    <li> Works great! No longer have to pay ridiculous amount of money at the salon...for the ladies to use the exact same machine!</li>
    <li> Love this lamp you can do both hands at the same time! Would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants to save money on shellac nails.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great price. Works wonderfully. Would recommend it for every need.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! I have used it for my hands and feet. Love that i can stick both hands and feet in it, cuts time in half. Only thing is is tgat by the 2nd or 3rd cure you can really feel the heat so apply a sunscreen prior to using. All in all im very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I really like this machine.  While I have a LED machine as well, this machine allows for both hands to be cured with plenty of space.  You don&#x27;t have to cure your thumbs separately.  I highly recommend.  Shipping was fast and it is a great machine.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Now I can have salon quality nails with out the salon price!...</li>
    <li> I read marvelous reviews on this but when my grandaughter opened it for her 14th birthday, it did not work. Her mom and dad helped her trouble shoot everything but had to send back. I do not know the outcome because my daughter has an Amazon account so she called directly and they told her to return. They are in Texas and I am in Fort Wayne, IN. I  dont know yet  if my granddaughter decided to try the same thing again or pursue a differnt brand. I know it was disappointing for her because she was all prepped to do her nails on her birthday after putting it all together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not going to put a star rating but it made me before I could submit which if it worked we would very well star differently</li>
    <li> This works amazingly! My gel nails look great. Well worth the money. Easily fits both hands in slide to cure quickly.</li>
    <li> I love that I can fit both feet at the same time. I&#x27;ve used the gelish LED dryer as well but this one is nice because it has a fan. I&#x27;m planning on getting the smaller gelish one for travel purposes though. This one is the size of an old VCR and requires light bulbs.</li>
    <li> This dryer works great!  Although it is a little over kill unless your having a nail party or someone else doing your nails...there is plenty of room for both hands, but doing my nails myself, I can&#x27;t do but one hand at a time, so a lot of wasted space and lighting.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect! I&#x27;m happy to but it. Arrived in the time that was supposed to.</li>
    <li> I love the reflective interior, fan, and aesthetics of this lamp. It was super easy to assemble... and my gel polish nails look awesome and cured completely!</li>
    <li> Amazing!! I researched before I bought this one and I am extremely pleased. I love the timer options and fan.</li>
    <li> Packaging was great and on time.&lt;br /&gt;Quality perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is awesome best price for a 54 Watt UV light &amp; dryer period.  Glad price went down from 79 &amp; 99$.  I paid $ 54.&lt;br /&gt;Im impressed it  works great with Gelish, IBD 1 min base &amp; 2 min for color &amp; top coat.  Finger paints from Sally&#x27;s beauty Takes a min longer to cure black.. Going to try Opi Gel next.  Went to wholesale shops last few days &amp; shocked they were 150-300 for smaller one hand rinky dink UV lights.  Buy here ..polishes, everything is same price or way Cheaper than CosmoProf &amp; wholesale shops!! Got it in 3 days.. Very pleased so far.</li>
    <li> Good product - I&#x27;m happy with it.  Can put both hands in at the same time, including thumbs.  Could easily do feet, although I haven&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> My sister loved this birthday gift! She said it was very upscale!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, dries nails super fast</li>
    <li> The 54 Watt Royal Nails Professional UV Light Gel and Acrylic Nail Dryer by Royal Nails is a great nail dryer for a reasonable price. The dryer allows for both hands or feet to dry simultaneously…I use it for any gel polish and to help speed up drying time with the use of regular nail polish…Would definitely recommend this dryer!</li>
    <li> This was a great product to have for a home salon. after three 300 second runs, my nails were dry enough to put water on them without ruining the polish. I finished in no time, so I did my pedi also. Great buy</li>
    <li> This lamp is perfect and exactly what I was looking for. It was easy to install the light bulbs and very simple to use. You just choose the light or fan option (or both I guess) and then press the button until you hit your desired amount of time. It dried my gel nails perfectly and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It feels sturdy and I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s the same exact model as what my salon was using before I decided that I could do it on my own!</li>
    <li> Woww  love it, little bit big but better for both hands ;-)</li>
    <li> Had mine about a month and no problems so far. The only complaint I have is that the fan doesn&#x27;t really seem to have an effect. It&#x27;s very quiet, though, but you can hardly tell it&#x27;s on. Other than that, it works great and it&#x27;s easy to use!! Now I just have to figure out how to carry it from place to place.....</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, finally used it and I love it. Great seller, would totally order from again, got product on time and before Xmas which was nice. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Greatcproduct and well priced.</li>
    <li> My daughter had this at top of her Christmas list.  Her and her sister are raving fans.  One said she wants to have her own nail business when she goes back to college.  Dad likes that! :-)</li>
    <li> So far so good. I was not expecting it to be so big, but you definitely can put both hands / feet in, without being scrunched in.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Better than salon results. Used on several friends and all are happy with it.</li>
    <li> For a granddaughter who loved it.</li>
    <li> The Royal Nails UV dryer is great and works perfect for doing your own Shellac/Gel manicure at home. Large enough for both hands. The vendor was responsive to my emails and sent me 2 extra light bulbs (no charge) because 2 of mine were damaged when I received the product. I was pleased with the service I received.</li>
    <li> Great product.love it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this dryer, but it is doing what I needed it to do.....curing gel polish......I like the fact that both hands or both feet can be cured at the same time.</li>
    <li> I love this light it is wonderful being able to do both hands or feet at same time.  It SAVES time! However one light was burnt out and I sent a email and no one has returned my complaint??  This is why only 4 star rating.  Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> product came quickly and was packaged very well. There were no surprises from the description. This product has also paid for itself already. My gel manicures last as long as the salons. I can fit both hands inside at the same time which saves me a huge amount of time. I would and have recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> Love it since now I can gel polish my nails at home with ease. Nice since you can put both hands in at once too.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Great product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes it possible to do gel nail at home. Easy and lasts three weeks. No chipping or peeling.</li>
    <li> My teenage girls have had lots of fun with this machine.  It&#x27;s not quite salon quality but for teen girls it&#x27;s great!!</li>
    <li> Four girls in the household x $35/appt. &#x3D; hundreds of dollars we&#x27;ve spent on our nails. I never considered buying my own uv lamp because I was told they don&#x27;t work as well as the professional ones. Then a friend visited and had a much cheaper one. It worked better than expected, so I did some research and found this one. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. I can do hands and feet, fits both hands or both feet at the same time. Everyone thinks I still get my nails professionally done! Wonderful product. Highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping to get a machine as similar to the one my former nail tech used as possible and I hit a home run!!! This machine is SUCH a great value! It is large enough to dry both hands or both feet at the same time, the built in timer function is especially handy when doing gel nails! The built in fan is barely perceptible and you can easily continue a conversation or speak with someone on the phone without it interfering!! Would highly recommend this for any one looking for a dryer to use for their home based business or just looking for a great value!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great! It&#x27;s big - you can put both hands or both feet in there at once. It&#x27;s a professional salon quality UV light. You can set it to 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300 seconds. There&#x27;s also a built-in fan for drying normal colors. It worked really well on my OPI Axxium gels &amp; my RCM gels - very easy to use, you don&#x27;t even have to read the instructions. Would definitely recommend this product! It&#x27;s a great price for what you get.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! The only thing I would change would be that the internal fans that moved faster or made some air movement..I don&#x27;t know that they actually do much help in nail drying. But, either way, this thing gets the job done quickly, it&#x27;s sturdy, and my favorite new thing. Shipped super fast, felt like Christmas.</li>
    <li> I received my nail dryer damaged.  There are two latches on the bottom and one of them was broken.  But because the damage was on the bottom of the unit and I live overseas, it was just too much of a hassle to return PLUS it doesn&#x27;t affect functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a generous sized unit which I really enjoy.  The fan feature was one of the key selling points for me, but that turned out to be a big disappointment.  It took a few drying cycles using both the light and fan to dry my nails (using conventional polish), and it was still faster and more efficient than my previous dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this would be a fairly sound purchase.  I&#x27;m happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because I received it damaged.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and think it is awesome.  You have tons of room for your hands and feet without having to worry about hitting the sides or top and smudging your nails.  I like the dial for time on the top that allows for several different amounts of drying time.  I especially like the cooling fan on the unit as well, very nice feature.  I have used 2 other types of nail dryers and was not happy with them because they were too small or I would smudge my nails.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> cuts down the time I used to take by doing one hand at a time or one foot at a time.  Quick and easy to assemble.  Definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used the lamp once and so far I am very happy with my purchase. So happy that I&#x27;ve recommended it to a friend of mine who already ordered it as well. On stores I&#x27;ve found a 10W lamp for one hand at the time for over $80.&lt;br /&gt;I consider I&#x27;ve made a smart purchase going with the Royal 54W.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all the great reviews. However, my experience has been quite different. This dryer does not dry the nails well even on the longest time setting. The sephora nail dryer works much better in 30 seconds than this one does in 2 min. I&#x27;ve even tried drying every coat 2x and it still didn&#x27;t work. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great product professional results. I would reccomed this product to all buyers who use gel nail polish at home or in a salon</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter!! We both love it!! Plus, the price and quality are exceptional!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a one-handed light since I&#x27;d be using it for myself, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw how big it was.  This is the size of what you&#x27;d find in a salon, definitely large enough for two hands/two feet.  I&#x27;ve been using it with Gelish paint.  I do 1.5 minutes after each coat and it lasts for about 2 weeks.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed when my light came in. Not only was it fast to arrive but easy to assemble. Not being the most proficient at home beauty products, it was so easy to apply my gel nail polish! The first time I applied it dried well and quick! Love the fan option! Now on my second application, I feel like I got the hang of it. A friend came over to try as well and was impressed with the quality of the light. Needless to say, I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time. I could easily fit both hands or feet if I wanted!</li>
    <li> Directions for opening bottom was included,  performs perfect gel manicures,  very happy with fast delivery too</li>
    <li> It seems incomplete I thought there would be more to it. For example instructions and or additional item to make it a complete Salon experience at home as advertised. I was deceived I believe</li>
    <li> This is such a nice UV Light.  I like the large size since there is less risk of bumping your fingernails while drying.  Plus, when I polish other people&#x27;s nails, they can easily put both hands in at one time.  I like the different time settings, too.  It has a nice fan &amp; alot of light.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I really like how fast the dryer works but when I got it the fan did not work on the dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so I cannot comment on the workings of it, but I love the appearance......and the packaging was great!  I&#x27;m confident that she will love it!  Thanks, Amazon for making shopping so easy. Approx. a year ago, I purchased (thru Amazon), a similar product for myself and was totally satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Looks and works just like the lights at the nail studios.  THe timer and fan features are an added plus.  My 7 year old loves getting pedicures but we only do it for very special occasions.  Having the light at home is a great way for us have fun together with out the salon price!</li>
    <li> This UV light for gel polish came promptly and is everything&lt;br /&gt;the other reviews said.  Easy to use and large enough for&lt;br /&gt;both hands.  Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> The light that was sent had a short. It did not work at all.</li>
    <li> Whenever I order a product for the first time I always mentally prepare for slight disappointment, however in the case of the \\&quot;Royal Nails Professional Nail Dryer\\&quot; there was no need!  With this dryer you receive so much more for your money and it really is salon quality.  It doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made, its large enough to fit both hands (or feet) comfortably, it has 5 different timer settings (90-300 seconds) and shuts off automatically when the timer runs down.  I completed my first at-hom/DIY gel set manicure last night and love the outcome (now my sister wants me to do hers, lol).  Great Buy! The one&#x27;s in the store cost about the same and are smaller, less wattage, and cheaply made so this is definitely the way to go.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT woul buy it anytime again,Thank You!!!!!</li>
    <li> I do not have any complaints about this product. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Purchased this and decided I could do just as good a job as the professional nail salons I go to about once a month.  When it arrived, I was excited to use it and set aside an hour to get my nails done.  Read through the instructions and proceeded to prep my nails.  After about two hours of tedious painting and &amp;#34;curing&amp;#34; in the light system I discovered some things about myself.&lt;br /&gt;1. I paint like a five year old&lt;br /&gt;2. I&#x27;m basically lazy and not as detailed minded as I orginally thought.&lt;br /&gt;3. I have no patience&lt;br /&gt;4. I like being pampered&lt;br /&gt;5. Those folks at the salon are very talented and deserve every tip I give them.&lt;br /&gt;This product works well, but nothing is EVER as easy as it seems.  Making an appt. tomorrow to fix this mess I made.  :(</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  It is everything I was hoping for and more!  I love being able to do my nails at home and have professional looking nails! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> After having a few shellac manicures done at the salon I realized #1 that I LOVED this idea and #2 that I was nearly certain I could do this myself at home! After doing a little research and comparing different lights I decided to purchase this UV light and I&#x27;m so glad I did!! This light is HUGE, you can fit both hands or both feet in at once, it has multiple settings, it comes with the bulbs and they are easy to install and (most importantly) it works!!!! I used this light with CND products and have successfully been doing my own shellac manicures! Don&#x27;t listen when the product companies tell you that \\&quot;each product needs the product-specific light in order to cure properly.\\&quot; NONE of the salons I&#x27;ve been to have product-specific lights for each different gel they offer...In fact they don&#x27;t have ANY product-specific lights, they just use a UV light! You do want to be aware of the minimum wattage necessary for each product and this is definitely the biggest and highest wattage for this price. I&#x27;ve already told multiple girlfriends about this product and will continue to do so!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my sister who loves doing her nails, but has to paint them several times a week due to the all-to-natural chipping. Once I received the Royal Nails Professional Dryer &amp; Curing machine, I wanted to test it out so I knew all of the gear she would need in order to use this the moment she opens it on Christmas Eve with the family. The machine is amazing! My manicure &amp; pedicure stayed PERFECT for 2 whole weeks! A great product &amp; worth every penny... I cannot wait to see my sister&#x27;s face on Christmas when she opens this fantastic gift! (Rachel, ND)</li>
    <li> Not for normal nail polish just gel</li>
    <li> This thing is great!  I love it.  I&#x27;ve read some of the other bad reviews and for those of you saying your nails are sticky, they will be until you wipe them with a clean cloth that has rubbing alcohol on it.  Find directions online in how to do a gel manicure and follow those directions.  I do a base coat, gel polish and then top coat.  Directions say to do two coats of each before moving on.  Once finished, wipe clean.  I love this thing and hope and pray it doesn&#x27;t break on me.  I&#x27;ve had it for several months and my nails are lasting over two weeks.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this unit. I love that I am able to do BOTH feet at the same time! Love it!</li>
    <li> This lamp comes well secured in its box and is very easy to put together.  It doesn&#x27;t contain any real instructions for assembly (maybe because it was so easy) or correct cure times but that was easy enough to find online.  It&#x27;s a bit large, which is not unexpected since it is meant for 2 hands or feet at a time.  I finished my manicure in less than 15 minutes and it looks just like the salon service.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I feel like it takes forever to dry. Or maybe I&#x27;m not doing something right. But how hard could it be</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price. We are very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> It is big! But it works much better than a previous smaller one we tried. Quickly dries the product and makes it possible to not have to protect the nails quite quickly.</li>
    <li> Work very well pro grade. Feels like I am at a nail salon only much cheaper:) I love it!! Thanks</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this UV Light! Was easy installing the lights and have been using it for over 2 months and get the salon results!</li>
    <li> Love! Was able to stop paying to get gel manicures every two weeks. Now I can do it at home whenever it is convenient for me and not have to pay someone to do it for me. I was never in my life able to do my own nails before using this product. This makes it so easy!</li>
    <li> Reviewer alert! I have not used this for my nails! I am an artist and I use this to create an indoor solar alternative. Now I can get the effects of the sun in a controlled environment even if it&#x27;s the middle of the night. I made sure I got the highest wattage for my needs and I can expose the jacquard solarfast products in minutes. You&#x27;ll be limited in the sizes of pieces you can expose but this enabled me to make a gallery installation deadline without being limited to daytime hours. Win-win!</li>
    <li> I was tired of paying $60 - $75 every two weeks (some times more) getting my nails done.  I even started buying Groupons &amp; Living Social deals to avoid paying the over $120 a mth.  After watching nail techs do my nails over the last few years, I figured, hey, I can do this myself.  Soooo, I ordered the lamp based on the reviews &amp; I have to say, smartest thing I&#x27;ve done in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my nails today &amp; they look Fab.U.lous! The machine is super easy to use &amp; is just like the ones I&#x27;ve seen used in the salons.  I followed the same steps done in the salon (and given in some of the reviews) and it took me all of 30 mins to do both my hands &amp; feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it only last me a week, I&#x27;m super happy to be saving money.  Plus it will give me an excuse to try a new color. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polished Used:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those wondering, I ordered the Gelish base &amp; top kit which came with the base, top coat, &amp; the pH base.  Of course, the most frequently used base &amp; top coat is CND but I&#x27;ve had Gelish used on my nails with no issues, so had no worries about ordering it. I only ordered one IBD color and am now on the hunt for more colors. I used a glitter China Glaze regular polish on my toes with the gel &amp; it actually made the polish pop.  Happy painting!</li>
    <li> The machine has a great price , but..... is too slow imagine putting your hands on the machine (both hands same time) and wait to almost 5 minutes is a eternity when you can use your hands , then everything itches!! This machine also do not cure the material totally so it will peel off faster than other machines. The price is great and i use it more for my pedicures because i do not care to have both feet there for 6 or 8 minutes, i can read a book while is working, save a little and buy a gelish one is more expensive but few uses will take care of the price by itself,</li>
    <li> Can dry both hands at a time…has good and variable timer and has a fan.  Professional. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Awesome product !!  Daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> had no Idea I was getting something so awesome. can&#x27;t wait to start doing my nails</li>
    <li> The good companies are capable of offering products of exelente quality, in good time and with big expectations. Of this form I describe my experience with this company and the acquired product.&lt;br /&gt;It turned out to be better than was waiting, and now with the product in the hands, I confirm that it should realize a great acquisition, and am very satisfied of it. Thank you very much for his attention!!</li>
    <li> I have used it a few times now and it works great!  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product was put to the test by My grandchild. Just did not go well. There is also a health warning which caused a concern. The product itself falls short and it does not provide the finishing experience as it should.</li>
    <li> Received this gel nail kit in a timely fashion. I have not tried the actual product yet as it will be a gift for Christmas but was impressed with the quick response.</li>
    <li> I bought the product for the nail dryer but the UV light is great. It is a wonderful size. I can get my hand in a spread my fingers. I could probably get both hands in--I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
    <li> Very large nail dryer that can easily fit both hands.  I am glad I purchased it. I have used it to do gel nails at home.  The only problem is finding a place to store it.</li>
    <li> Prepped nails, painted one thin foundation coat and left my nails under the lights for 90 seconds.  Sticky and soft. Added 300 seconds.  Same result. Left under the lights for 30 MINUTES. Even after all that time, the dryer still didn&#x27;t cure/harden the gel polish. I thought perhaps the gel was defective, so returned it and bought another reputable brand.  Exact same result.  What a mess and waste of time and money. Sending the dryer back and would absolutely not recommend anyone buying it.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  I have used it every other week for months now and have yet to have a problem.</li>
    <li> My sister in law bought this same light for herself and recommended it to me.  It&#x27;s worked really well and the price was really good for a full-sized light.  You can fit one or both hands easily without the awkwardness of those tiny lamps!  It&#x27;s nicer than the one at the salon where I got my first UV manicure!!</li>
    <li> A must get. This is wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> Plenty of room for 2 hand drying.  2 plastic latch clips on BOTTOM of unit that must be released to install bulbs.  The lid will fold up and out of the way for easy bulb installation.  Product was factory packaged with warrant information inside.  A must have for gel applications.</li>
    <li> The claims that this product made are all correct!!!!  It is a fantastic product, professional grade.  I will save a bundle now that I don&#x27;t need to go to the nail salon!!!!  I am 1000th percent satisfied with this awesome product!!!!  If consumer reports reviewed this product, I am confident they would give the same review.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife and she likes it. It easily fits both hands and both feet. The downside is that it is UV light (known when I purchased it) which take a bit longer to cure than an LED. The upside is that it will cure all types of gels. Easy to assemble and no issues with the product after 4 uses.</li>
    <li> The machine was huge and the problem wasn&#x27;t even the size, it was very ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a few scratches, which is understandable but the overall quality looked poor.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried using it, it took way longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;The gel polish I bought said 2 minutes, but the machine took forever and never really dried my nails. I had to repeat the 90 second trial for about 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Its already paid for itself!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It arrived on time. I had ordered a UV light from thermal spa and it stopped working after two times. This light works perfectly. No issues at all and it cures gelish and cnd shellac.</li>
    <li> Works great, excellent value!!</li>
    <li> I was happy to receive my UV Gel Light, well packaged.  However, I must admit I think I paid full price for equipment that was used.  The lights were well packaged in bubble wrap; however, the protective film on the bottom of the device was curling up and when I opened it to insert the bulbs, there was a hair sealed in the seal of the device (not mine), and the electric cord was not professionally coiled.  The light seems to work without any noted problems.  Just a little disappointed I paid full price for something that was most likely used and returned.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  It&#x27;s taken me a couple of trials to get used to applying the polish myself, but I have no problems with the UV Light itself.  It was easy to put together and get started.  Watch a YouTube video for some great tips.</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself and loved it so much that I bought another one for my sister for Christmas!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy/durable, and does both hands/feet at the same time!!!  Good price too!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that you can fit both hands in at the same time...I would say my only problem is not knowing how long to keep your hands in for polished nails.</li>
    <li> ...because I am a gel manicure convert!!!! I just did my first gel manicure and it turned out awesome! I may never go back to old fashioned polish.</li>
    <li> I had no idea what nail dryer would be the best so I just looked for one with a higher wattage and low price - this unit is awesome - very quiet - easy to use - dries quickly and was cheaper than most others which were smaller with less wattage !  So far, I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I love this gel lamp!</li>
    <li> Terrible. I returned it because it takes ten times longer than it should to dry (not Mike, btw, his wife). I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I love this nail lamp! I mainly bought this lamp so I could do my own gel polish at home to save myself $32 each trip for a shellac manicure. This lamp cured my gel polish in no time and they were perfect! I even used it for regular polish and it was dry in no time! Also, you can fit both hands in at the same time!!!!</li>
    <li> I had a girlfriend show me how to use the product with the correct polish. This is really key, especially using the solution to finish the nails after the top coat. This solution will turn tacky nails into a hard finish. I&#x27;ve read reviews that people don&#x27;t think the light cures and hardens the polish. This information is FALSE. This exact light is so perfect. It&#x27;s very compact, quick, and works perfectly in 45 seconds as described. I do store it in it&#x27;s original box. It&#x27;s a light so it is fragile. This product is absolutely amazing, I would have paid $80 for how well it works!</li>
    <li> Our eight year old granddaughter absolutely loved it. Kind of a mature gift but Mommy and friends will enjoy as well. Maybe even Grandma. Absolutely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I just got done using this product, and it worked the way it was supposed to.  How often does that happen. I know there are many products out there that can do the same job, but the great thing about this product is that you can cure both hands at the same time.  That was a big plus for me.  Don&#x27;t get worried as I did when I first cured the bottom coat, and they were still sticky.  Do as the direction say, and when you&#x27;re finished with the top coat, clean the sticky stuff off with alcohol, you end up with beautiful nails.</li>
    <li> My wife loves to keep her nails done up and the dryer is great. We take exchange students and being able to do the girls nails saves a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Bought this for cnd shellac. Works perfect!</li>
    <li> I am well satisfied with this UV Light.  It arrived well packaged. Speedy delivery.  The price was right and I&#x27;m very happy for the convenience of doing my own gel polish..a $$$$$$$$$$$-$aver.</li>
    <li> I ordered this machine to do my UV gel nails at home. I felt this was the BEST value for the money because 1) it&#x27;s 54 watts, 2) can fit 2 hands, 3) has a fan, 4) has a timer. I got exactly what I wanted and feel that I will not have to purchase another one anytime soon. I have been curing the BMC brand gel polish with this light and love my results. i switch up my polishes every week. I use the gloves because you can never be careful when it comes to UV exposure. This is the BEST value for the money when it comes to this size light.</li>
    <li> Works terrific.  Exactly what I wanted.  I am doing my own gel nails - using IBD prodcuts.  Very satisfied.  It is not designed for LED gel polishes.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Works great for both hands (or feet) at once.  Timer feature is very helpful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for both regular polish and gel/shellac and it works great! The only improvement I&#x27;d make would be a stronger fan with maybe a low setting to use when doing gel/shellac and high for when just using regular polish, and a pull out tray for easier cleaning, but with that said I really really like it! It&#x27;s a very nice size so that I can put both hands or feet in and I&#x27;m so glad I went with a 36 watt one, from everything I&#x27;ve read to really cure gel/shellac 36 watts is a must! Really good value for what you get and I did my due diligence and shopped around before choosing this one!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift. These are normally soooooo expensive but, they had it at such a wonderful price!! Fast shipping. It&#x27;s wrapped under my tree now.</li>
    <li> Well packaged, easy setup and she loves it</li>
    <li> This light is great! It can hold both hands at the same time, has a built in timer and much lower price than many of the other uv lights I researched!!</li>
    <li> exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> Great product! Shipping was fast and I love the fan and timer option. At first I was suprised by how large this UV light was, but it is nice to be able to place both hands in it. My only complaint is I wish the size was a bit smaller so it would be easier to store, but overall I am very impressed with the quality of the product based on how much I payed for it!</li>
    <li> So far so good it works really good nice nd shiny like I like them&lt;br /&gt;.thnxs and there alot of room I can do two hand nd both feet ;)</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been spending hundreds of dollars doing my nails. Usually i do builder gel to strengthen my nails and then gellish with some glitter flakes depending on my mood. It was really inconvenient as i have a very demanding job and saturdays i had to fit everything in. I started looking at some youtube videos and decided to get this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when the package arrived i was very shocked in a good way! its very roomy for my both hands, my nails dry quickly, it looks appealing and most importantly to me, i now have my nail salon at the convenience of my very own home. another plus is if i merely have a chip i dont have to book an appointment and leave my house!&lt;br /&gt;i even do my mom&#x27;s nails as she always thought going to the nail salon was too time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product and my nails look fab 24/7 without the hassle!</li>
    <li> I am a busy hair stylist and never have time to even get to a manicurist.  I bought this light so I could do my own gel nails at home. It was better than I had even anticipated! So great that the manicurist in my salon ordered one to use on her clients! I am very happy with it and now always have my nails done!</li>
    <li> I absolutely made the perfect choice when buying a UV light for my personal use.  Although there are many varieties of products available, this light has higher wattage (more bulbs) and is wide enough to place both hands or feet.  I use the CND Shellac product and do my own nails at home.  My nails look as good as if I had gone to a salon.  I would recommend the Royal Nails UV Light Nail Dryer for personal use, as well as salon use.</li>
    <li> I love this light.  It is just as powerful as the ones salons use and it was affordable. I am very happy with the way it cures the gel product.  It is definitely salon quality and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about gel manicures for quite a few months now; really, ever since I first started seeing those Sally Hansen ads for the complete kit on TV. But after looking at the actual products in-store, and seeing that I&#x27;d have to shell out seventy bucks for a few tiny bottles of polish and an itty-bitty lamp, I had to stop and think about it. I waited a few months, then mentioned to my best friend that I wished I could get my nail polish to last more than just twelve hours before it started chipping off. That&#x27;s when she told me that her sister - a chemistry teacher - had decided to try doing gel manicures, and had raved about how beautiful her nails looked weeks after doing them herself, even with having her hands in chemicals all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew then that it was time to come to Amazon and start looking for the perfect products to outfit my set with, that I was going to treat myself to something super-girly for my 40th birthday, and gel manicure components were gonna be IT! The top-rated UV lamp that came up was this Royal Nails dryer, and it turns out that the popularity and high ratings are for GOOD reason! This thing is AWESOME!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got my box, I was amazed at how big this lamp is! It really does, VERY comfortably, accommodate both hands or both feet for simultaneous curing, which is vital to keep from spending an hour trying to get your gel nails done, start to finish. Putting the bulbs in was also not at all difficult, once i&#x27;d unpacked the lamp, turned it over, unsnapped the two hooks that keep the bottom closed, and flipped the bottom open (be sure to remove the blue plastic mirror protection film - it&#x27;s vital to ensuring a full, hard cure of the gel polish)! Once that was done, I was ready to go! The control panel of the lamp is at the back, behind the starburst fan vent, and it&#x27;s easy enough to figure out on your own how to control it (even though the unit does come with an information pamphlet). There&#x27;s no 60 second setting - it just goes directly to 90 seconds (1 1/2 minutes), then up from there. Curing my nails for 90, as opposed to 60, seconds has been great for curing them as needed for the foundation coat, and pretty much every other layer needs two minutes, which is the 120 second setting, so the lamp covers all the bases beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the UV lamp on for 120 seconds, by the end of it, my fingers are just starting to feel warmed, as if I&#x27;ve just laid in the sun, and there&#x27;s absolutely no discomfort. To ensure that I don&#x27;t have to worry about too much exposure, I bought myself a pair of [[ASIN:B006L6WNVG ROYAL NAILS ANTI UV GLOVES FOR UV LIGHT/LAMP NAIL DRYER ONLY NAIL EXPOSED]], which fit my hands snugly, keeping the fabric out of the way as I apply my polishes while wearing them. The polishes that I bought to round out my manicure set are [[ASIN:B006FRS9O6 Harmony Gelish Top and Base \\&quot;Set of 2\\&quot; Good Deal!!!]], which have been great, and were the full half ounce size, as opposed to the tiny mini bottles that Sally Beauty Supply stocks, for a higher price than I paid here, even! To go with the base and top coats, I got a bottle each of [[ASIN:B003VMF5S6 Harmony Gelish Uv Soak Off Gel Polish -Bronzed (0.5 Oz)]] - a beautiful, neutral glittery sand color, and [[ASIN:B003VMFITM Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Good Gossip]], a beautiful, sparkly candy apple or ruby slipper red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed all of the steps recommended, both by Harmony Gelish, and various websites, blogs, and in multiple YouTube videos, to successfully do my gel manicures. If you&#x27;ve already done a manicure, the next few steps would be for soaking off the old polish:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A tip that I read recommended filing the surface of the existing gel manicure&#x27;s polish to make it easier for the Acetone-based polish remover to get through the layers of polish. I then soaked the lint-free pads I&#x27;d pre-cut into quarters in standard nail polish remover with Acetone, placed them over my nails, and wrapped them with strips of aluminum foil that I&#x27;d pre-cut, and waited about 20 minutes for the remover to soak through the polish (your fingers will start to feel chilled once you&#x27;ve wrapped your fingers in the foil. It&#x27;s a sign that the aluminum has activated the acetone in your polish remover, and is working as it should).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Once that was done, and the polish was softened and peeling away, I used an orange stick to push off the rest of the polish, then continued prepping my nails, washing my hands thoroughly to begin my new manicure. Once my hands and nails were washed, I used an orange stick to push EVERY bit of cuticle back, and a sharp implement (pocket knife, cuticle trimmer, etc) to carefully trim any cuticle (if you leave cuticle adhered to the nail, it&#x27;ll cause your gel manicure to lift off). I then used a nail buffer - medium/fine side - to buff any sheen from my ENTIRE nail surface (skip this step and the foundation layer of gel polish may not adhere to your nail, and your polishes may lift). Once each nail was fully, but lightly, buffed, then filed to the shape/length I wanted, I soaked a lint-free pad in regular Isopropyl/rubbing alcohol (91% at least is recommended for gel nails), and wiped the surface of each nail clean. Once that&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s on to polish application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Everything I&#x27;ve read online stresses NOT to touch the polish to your skin! Not so much for safety/health reasons, as that, once the polish adheres to your skin, it WILL cause your manicure to lift! Use an alcohol-soaked Q-tip to wipe away any polish that touches your skin before curing, and remember that, until you cure the polish under the UV/LED light, it&#x27;s still effectively wet and movable. The first manicure I did, I applied each layer of polish too thickly - like I would&#x27;ve using regular nail polish (which this is NOT!), so the excess polish pooled around my nails&#x27; edges, and my manicure started to lift on about the 7th day on a few of my nails. My second time around, I made sure to gently scrub the foundation layer onto my nail using the brush&#x27;s short bristles, but with a THIN layer, making sure I got all corners of my nail, but pushing out the bulk of the polish to my nail&#x27;s edges so that each was coated in a thin layer, to the very edge of my nail. After curing, each subsequent layer (which will require a curing PER layer), was applied with an even, thin coat of polish, and each layer was \\&quot;capped\\&quot; by wiping a light layer of the polish used for that layer over my nail tips, to seal the color and polish in - this helps to avoid chips. I did four layers of polish overall - foundation (which I wiped with a DRY, lint free wipe or paper towel, just for a dry clean, as the Harmony Gelish instructions suggest), two coats of color - each cured individually, four fingers first for two minutes per coat, then the thumbs by themselves (to prevent the color from running to the side, as happened the first time I did a gel manicure!), two minutes again per layer. Once that was done, I applied a thin layer of topcoat (just don&#x27;t make it TOO thin!), then cured that for two minutes on my fingers, then cured just my thumbs for the final two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be AMAZED once you&#x27;ve taken your nails out of the lamp after the topcoat layer, and wiped the sticky coating off using a lint free pad or paper towel! The shine and hardness is AMAZING! I&#x27;m still shocked by how fully dry and hard my nails are each time I do a gel manicure, and I LOVE looking down at my nails TWO WEEKS LATER to see that my polish job is STILL just as sparkly, wet-shine glossy, and gorgeous as the day I first did them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did acrylic nails years ago, only for a year, and once I stopped, my nails were TRASHED! So far, my nails are growing out longer with each week, and they look healthy and gorgeous when I soak off my color. With the color on, they&#x27;re feminine and beautiful! I couldn&#x27;t be happier, and I have no doubt that THIS lamp is the way to go!Others may be a few bucks less, but they&#x27;re all smaller, and not strong enough to fully cure your nails for a weeks-long manicure! This lamp looks like one you&#x27;d find in a professional salon, if not better, and works just as well, if not better, than the others out there! This thing is worth EVERY PENNY!!! LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you&#x27;re willing to take a risk, check out ebay for cheap gel polishes from China. The wide selection of colors there is pretty mindblowing, so I&#x27;ve ordered a whole slew of polishes, but I have yet to receive mine, so I&#x27;m not sure how they&#x27;ll compare to the \\&quot;good\\&quot; stuff like Harmony Gelish or Ulta&#x27;s Red Carpet Manicure (which I used to add an extra layer of iridescent glitter over my Good Gossip Gelish polish during my last manicure - it worked just fine with Gelish)! The polishes I got on that other auction site all shipped free, and with 0.5 oz bottles that are about half to a third of the price of what I&#x27;ve gotten here and looked at at my local beauty supply store, for nearly double the product available in local stores, I figure it&#x27;s worth the risk. I believe all of these polishes are made in China anyway, so I&#x27;m willing to risk it to see if they ARE effectively the same! I&#x27;ll update here if I find my Chinese knock-offs are abysmal! Keeping my fingers crossed, though! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve received, and used, my first two (compatible)colors of less-expensive made in China gel polish, and so far, it&#x27;s gone on and cured just fine. I LOVE Harmony Gelish polishes, as they have a gorgeous luster and sheen, and now that I&#x27;ve taken the time to look to see that they&#x27;re made in America, that&#x27;s a little more incentive for me to look for more colors when I really want to splurge (but I&#x27;ll only buy them on Amazon, IF they&#x27;re the half ounce size). My only real problem is getting gel polishes in a wider variety of colors, which is why I decided to try the made in China colors I found on ebay. So far, the sky blue and corresponding clear chunky glitter gel polish that I&#x27;ve received, have cured just as well as my Harmony Gelish colors did, and they&#x27;re doing great sandwiched between my Harmony Gelish foundation and Top It Off top coat. I&#x27;m very tempted to say that the Harmony Gelish colors seem to have more luster and a more intense, glassy sheen to them, but I&#x27;m also being hyper critical of these miC (made in China) soak-off colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*FURTHER UPDATE: Chinese gel removal issues!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chinese gels look pretty decent going on, but the one pair that I used with each other (again, sandwiched between my Harmony Gelish foundation and top coat) hadn&#x27;t soaked off after 45 MINUTES - DOUBLE the time it takes my American-made Harmony Gelish, my new favorite, IBD Just Gel, or my Red Carpet Manicure glitters - I ended up having to SCRAPE them off with my sharp metal MiC cuticle pusher. So, I rescind my previous declaration - I DON&#x27;T think the made-in-China gels are worth the risk (all other Chinese products have been fine, though, except for the pink-and-clear fingertip nail soakers)! Besides, with the Customs restrictions that were put in place at the end of September 2013, it&#x27;s taken an average of about EIGHT WEEKS for me to get those polishes! Other products arrive closer to the claimed time frame, but the polishes don&#x27;t, and they smell MUCH stronger than the higher-priced, quality brands, along with looking inconsistent in the polish texture. I&#x27;ve had polishes arrive looking partially dried up and gloppy, with blobs of polish in the bottle, and the average MiC polish I&#x27;ve received is much thicker overall in texture, with far less of the luster and sheen of my Gelish, IBD, and RCM gels. I&#x27;ve now seen, eight bottles over, that the MiC gels I bought on eBay are another case of \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;. They&#x27;re cheap for a reason!

    <li> Awesome item!  Used it for the first time this weekend and fit both hands nicely. Next ill try the feet.  Just in time for spring.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she said it was the best christmas present she got for this year.  On top of that it saves me $35.00 each time she goes to get her nails all purttied up.  It easily pays for itself.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Good value, many options of settings,had to google/you tube how to use it. Poor direction,not specific enough for how to use and explanation of settings</li>
    <li> The packaging is very nice and professional looking.  The product is cheap plastic, chinese construction with 6 UV lamps.  It works just fine but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is a professional product.  It is most definitely a consumer product.  It&#x27;s plenty big enough for both hands.</li>
    <li> I researched lamps before buying and I am so glad this is the one I bought.  Well worth the extra money to be able to do both hands and feet at the same time. And the wattage is high enough that it only takes 10 minutes to complete a full manicure and its dry and doesn&#x27;t get messed up!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the unit.  Nicer than what they use in the shops here.  Works great.  Easy to operation, very roomy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried others but this one works great and it&#x27;s easy to replace the standard sized bulbs. I use the 5 different timers for the 5 layers I perform with my manicures. Prep, foundation, color, color, top coat.</li>
    <li> This product effective dries your nails and is of great quality.  This product lived up to all the good reviews that I read and is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Simply love this product!  I use it to cure Gelish nail polishes, and it works great.  The result is an amazing shine which lasts for over 2 weeks with no peeling whatsoever. I really do think the peeling/chipping, or lack thereof depend on the quality of the polish used, and not so much as the light.  This product does what it is designed to do, and that is to cure nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product timely, and their customer service is great.  I had a minor issue and they took care of it right away.  I would recommend this product and seller!</li>
    <li> the lights have stopped working and I am very disappointed. Have had item less than 2 months.</li>
    <li> Would not turn on. Did not arrive in original packaging. Had no instructions. No extra bulbs.</li>
    <li> The price is right for this gel system that can be used on hands or feet. Basically you just plug it in, set the time, and it shuts off automatically when the session is over. The polish can be a little pricey but once you build up a stock of colors, you can&#x27;t beat the 2 weeks this stuff last for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product to save you some cash by bringing the salon to your home and doing it yourself.</li>
    <li> This light is far superior to anything else I have seen in this price range!  I have seen less quality IN the salons!  Recommend to anyone looking!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Lot&#x27;s of room.does a great job. Would recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> This is a large device! It&#x27;s bigger than a toaster. ... i Would not recommend it based solely on its size!</li>
    <li> Brought this item for my daughter and she loves it.  When I saw it I was sorry that I didn&#x27;t purchase one for myself.  My sister told me to get it for her for christmas, if I do, she probably will never get it (lol).  Buy this item, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in perfect condition.  Is exactly as described and easy to use.  It was easy enough to figure out how to open and install the bulbs however the directions did not mention how to do this. (no fault of the seller)</li>
    <li> I keep my toenails painted in the summertime because of the weird color. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now, a few minutes a night, and already I can see where the newly ingrowing toenail bed is normal color. Both feet fit easily, yet it&#x27;s small enough to slide under my coffee table shelf when not in use.</li>
    <li> My sister and I purchased this for each other for Christmas.  We love it!  It works great and at a very reasonable price!!  We use it with CND Shellac products and have been very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what we wanted and it works good for all types of nails and polishes. Very professional dryer,.</li>
    <li> Love it. great quality</li>
    <li> This UV light is an excellent product! It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I&#x27;ve had my nails done for decades at a nail salon and this light/dryer seems better than the ones used at the salon. It&#x27;s easy to use and it very quickly dries and cures the gel polish. The cost is what I used to pay for only 2 visits to have my nails done professionally, so I&#x27;m saving money now every couple of weeks! I highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> Make sure that you read all the instructions for your nails...if you think that they are still wet you HAVE to use the topical cleaner to get the tackiness gone.  I honestly think that is where the bad reviews are coming from.  The product works great for both the UV polish and the LED ones</li>
    <li> Thanks, my girlfriend loved this it was a great gift.</li>
    <li> Preferred the smaller size of other dryers. I ordered six and returned all of them  without using.them.</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews and must say this lamp is AMAZING.  It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> I was amazed when I unpacked this unit and took it out of the box.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting the light to be as big as it was. I was instantly excited.  Not only can I dry my nails, but I can place both feet in the unit after I complete my pedicure- how convenient is that?  I have used the light and it works well.  I also purchased the gloves to limit the UV exposure to my hands-love them too. Overall, I can say that this is a great product that will be used often.</li>
    <li> These gloves are the very best. Well made to use during your bi-weekly manicure using a UV light. Good protection against the light that might cause aging of your hands. If you are allergic or sensitive to UV light now you don&#x27;t have to worry . These gloves are just the thing for you and they will quickly be part of your manicure experience.</li>
    <li> I love the lamp. It is very easy to install the uv bulbs and spacious enough for both hands or feet.</li>
    <li> Ok... So this might be the most exciting review I have written in a while! I just received this nail lamp today after doing 2-day shipping because my salon gel nails needed a redo. I have been hesitant about buying a nail lamp because I was a bit skeptical, but I am soooo glad I finally decided to purchase this lamp after seeing all of the positive reviews! Just to be completely clear, I usually gel the Gelish polish done at the salon, so I did get the Gelish starter kit to have everything I needed for this at home experiment. I went through the process of removing my current gel and started fresh with the Gelish kit and the nail lamp. This lamp worked amazingly!! I set the timer for 180 minutes after each step and my gel manicure came out perfect on the first try!! I definitely recommend this lamp especially at this price for anyone who wants to do this at home!  A note for everyone trying this at home: your nails will remain sticky after each 2 minute curing session until you put the top coat on and then wipe it off with the nail cleanser or nail polish remover after you are completely finished. If you follow the Gelish instructions you will be fine! I know this sounds like a lot but it was really easy!</li>
    <li> I bought this item and it takes too long to cure....not only that but it will start to warm your hands enough that you want to stop using it. Takes 45 minutes to dry and still won&#x27;t be dry all the way.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and she said it works great. It will save me alot of money over the years.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, in good shape, works as expected.  (was much larger than I expected, I should have checked the size)</li>
    <li> I just started doing my own nails at home. The dryer is great, easy to use (my 5 year old can help), and quiet. The only thing it is missing is a 10 second drying program for the base coat drying time for Shellac, but obviously that is easy enough to figure out.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter-in-law and she loves it.  She doesn&#x27;t have time to go to a salon and this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this! It works great with gel polishes and builder gels! The buttons are &amp;#34;backwards&amp;#34; since they are meant to face the tech and have a customer&#x27;s hands in the lamp, but it&#x27;s still super easy to use.</li>
    <li> This item came really quick. Solid item and perfect for 2 hands.  Many others are one handed and double the price.  My wife said she loves and uses it every 2 weeks to re-do her nails.  Xaves us $40 bucks every 2 weeks now that she doesnt go to the nail salon.  A++</li>
    <li> I love this product, It&#x27;s very easy to use, we turn the light on and set up the minutes and the fan and when it&#x27;s ready turns it off by itself!</li>
    <li> This lamp was way more than I expected.  The results with its use are outstanding!! Super happy!! I would definitely refer this product my friends! Easy to use and put together!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product, would for sure recommend it. Came very well packed. Just love it. It is very easy to operate and the directions are excellent. Going to buy one for my daugher.</li>
    <li> Read a lot of other reviews before buying this as a gift.  I wanted a large one so that both hands could be done at the same time.  It works great.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! The convenience at home of a nail salon gel manicure.  East fast transaction.  Recommend A++++&lt;br /&gt;Nail salon at home!</li>
    <li> So worth the money.  There is a lot of room for your hands or feet. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for home or professional nails.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  It&#x27;s great being able to do my nails when I want to.  I had difficulty at first, but switched brands of base and top coat and everything is going great!</li>
    <li> This is a great UV light!!! I cant afford going to the salon every 2 Weeks so I do my own nails.. I would really recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
    <li> This was just what I needed. Dries both hands or feet quickly, once I figured out how to use it. Could use better instructions. Good product and will save $$ by doing my own nails.</li>
    <li> I got a defective product, light does not turn on. Going to exchange it and see how it goes. I&#x27;ll revise review if it&#x27;s any good.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this enough to give it a five-star but after using it a couple times, I do like it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this UV nail dryer mostly based on the reviews of the other posts and I am not disappointed at all! The dryer works fabulously and I love being able to do my nails at home instead of paying the high prices at salons! The only issue I had was that the instructions aren&#x27;t very clear as far as how to open the top and insert the bulbs. I figured it out though by reading other reviews. My husband had to open the top because it was too hard for me to push the bottom tabs up to open it but once I got through that - I was very excited and happy! I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but look forward to having nice and pretty nails for a long time because of this purchase!</li>
    <li> Light is exactly as advertised. Great price and great option for do-it-yourselvers who can&#x27;t always make it to the salon...</li>
    <li> Love it am glad i finally got this... great product and it works great.. definitely a must in every manicures home..</li>
    <li> This works very well for gel nails. I have not had an issue with anything drying using the Royals Nails UV Light. I normally do 2 minutes per layer of polish administered.</li>
    <li> I tried this item because of the reviews and love it because its room and quiet and works well. does a great job  wth my regular nail regimen. I was so shocked at how nicely built it is Love it. worth the money</li>
    <li> I purchased the UV light and was so happy when it arrived. It works fast and it is so easy to use. My nails look awesome for a fraction of the salon cost. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> This product exceeds my expectations.  I have never had a professional manicure as I always painted my own nails.  I&#x27;ve only had this dryer for 3 weeks and so far, used it only once.  The quick curing time is amazing and I love the different timer modes to help me keep track.  My nails are just now showing signs that they need to be redone and I will do that tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very reasonably priced and I love the fact that I can put both hands inside with plenty of room.</li>
    <li> this is the best lamp i have ever used. i was really not wanting to buy a 150 dollar cnd lamp and this totally cures shellac</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  Love the timer.  No more spending $40 twice a week on gel nails, doing my nails at home from now on.</li>
    <li> This dryer works great!  It&#x27;s a bit bulky, but It&#x27;s roomy and can fit both hands or feet comfortably.  I can really see a benefit for a nail professional but for do-it-yourselfers you can only do one hand at a time so it may be better to use a single dryer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer for my mom&#x27;s birthday present. She was tired of paying to go to the salon so we decided to buy a dryer and do it ourselves. This dryer is larger that what I see in salons. You can dry both hands/feet at once. There are several different time settings and a fan. We did 3 peoples nails last night so the product has already paid for itself. We were all very pleased and will be using it a lot.</li>
    <li> I had my nails under the light for over 10 minutes and they never dried. Returning this and spending a little more on an OPI light.</li>
    <li> I love this nail dryer(model RN451), after shopping Amazon at great length I chose this model for it&#x27;s wattage. It is 54 watts vs. many in the 36 watt range because it has 2 more bulbs to provice quicker drying times.  It is much like many I have seen in professional salons, large enough for both hands or feet.  While I only do I hand at a time doing gelish manicures on myself, I like the fact it was large enough with more than enough room for my hand.  The unit is turned on with a power switch on the rear, then when drying time is needed, timers are set from five presets on the top for the need curing time.  It also has a fan which I think would be great for regular polishes. After my 1st gelish home manicure, I am glad I took the plunge and bought this dryer and basix gelish kit.  They will more than pay for themselves as I can do my nails at home and save time and money!</li>
    <li> Love it! Both hands fit in with plenty of room! This makes the job so much faster for me now!</li>
    <li> Changed my gel nails for the best.  I was using the KISS LED lamp for the wash off gel nails and every week I had to remove and reapply the gel french manicure, because the polish would chip off the nails big time.  So I tried another type of gel product with the KISS lamp and got the same chipping.  Due to other reviewers, I decided to use the UV light and saw a big difference in the manicure and no chipping.  I am very hard on my nails, I wash my hands a lot and wash dishes. So when my nails go through this much water and chemicals and stay on for more than a week, I am excited.  Also, unlike the KISS LED light, I can place both hands in at one time, which reduces the manicure time.  I would like to rate this five stars, but gave it a four star rating because the box did not have any instruction book on how to change or install the bulbs and how to order replacement bulbs.  I watched a YouTube video to the get the directions.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product!  I had my first shellac  manicure at a salon &amp; was so impressed with the results but I cannot afford over $50.00 every two weeks.  Being a \\&quot;do it yourself\\&quot; person,  I decided to make the investment in this UV light &amp; have had great results with it.  The quality matches any professional salon &amp; it is easy to use.  I would highly recommend it to anyone else that feels that they can \\&quot;do it themselves\\&quot;!!</li>
    <li> Hey Ladies,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Dee in NY and this lamp gets 5 stars! It is very easy to assemble and even easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a free trial of Amazon Prime, so the shipment arrived in two-days flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulbs came individually bubble wrapped and boxed inside the larger boxes. The instruction have some commical typos, but are easy to understand and not really necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lift the lid, remove the blue plastic and insert the bulbs. That is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lamp fits both hands and comes with 5 differnt time sets ranging from 90 seconds to 5 minutes. Just press the timing cycle that you want and set your hands in. You can also use the fan for an added bonus. I&#x27;ve used it twice and love it!</li>
    <li> Got this as a present for someone else.  Have not used it yet..but really surprised how large it is..I mean you could put both your hands and feet in this thing...NO idea why it is so big...the ones at the salon is sooooo much smaller and the salon model would be easier to store and use IMO.  I should return it and get something smaller but not sure they offer something like that for home use.</li>
    <li> Great investment. I love it.</li>
    <li> I just received this unit last night.  It was packaged well, the bulbs have to be &#x27;installed&#x27; and are also packed well.  It&#x27;s easy to use, the buttons are very obvious--you pick 2 mins, 3 mins or continuous.  Doesn&#x27;t get much easier than that.  I purchased it specifically to use with CND shellac.  It works well with this shellac.</li>
    <li> This produced has worked well for me. It&#x27;s nice because I can put both hands in at the se time and I can also put both feet in. This saves a lot of time</li>
    <li> I like this alright, but it&#x27;s huge.  I guess I didn&#x27;t ready carefully enough or I would have realized that this unit was almost twice the size of what I really wanted.  I can&#x27;t really fault Royal Nails for that.  When I initially turned the unit on nothing happened and I worried that it was defective.  It did finally come on and worked for my manicure.  If I keep doing this I will want a smaller unit.  This one is big enough for me to stick my foot in.</li>
    <li> works fine great tool</li>
    <li> Love it! Works wonder for me.</li>
    <li> This uv lamp is amazing! I have had  an old dally Hansen lamp for a couple years now and was never impressed with shiny factor. This uv lamp is excellent!!!!! Easy to set up, and nails are very shiny when finished. The lamp looks like it belongs in a professional nail salon, my husband even said that it looked fancy and asked the price- he was blown away at the great price point as well. Highly recommend this uv lamp!</li>
    <li> Had to return no directions came with</li>
    <li> I have to run the light cycle at least 5 times which is 4 minutes to get my nails almost dry.  They&#x27;re still tacky and sticky.  I also received this with a broken bulb.  Might as well just go to the salon for as often as I get to have a pedicure.</li>
    <li> This light lets me do my own nails and keep the $$ in my pocket!  Read the reviews and follow the directions and say goodbye to high salon costs.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife who&#x27;s a gel nail freak.  She loves this thing.  I purchased it for her as a gift, based on all the hot reviews.  They&#x27;re true.  Go for it ladies.  :)</li>
    <li> Works great. Dries nails super fast. The large capacity inside keeps my customers from smudging there nails. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Great quality--its actually better than the one my nail tech uses at my salon. Does great for all gel polish I&#x27;ve tried it with. Bulbs are long lasting and easy to install. Was a little skeptical due to price--but this is a great deal. You get way more than you pay for!</li>
    <li> I am overly happy with this new nail dryer.  It is everything I expected. Thank you</li>
    <li> 5 star rating its just that good..&lt;br /&gt;Pros: drys both hands at the same time easy to configure and the added fan is a plus. My wife loves it.. and for 56 bucks cant beat it.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None so far.&lt;br /&gt;My wife highly recommends this light for home use or professional use especially if you are just starting out</li>
    <li> Love that it cures both hands less time for faster service....works great on all products it is bigger better and the price is great...</li>
    <li> OMG I TOTALLY LOVE THIS GEL LIGHT! ITS THE BEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPEND TO MY LIFE, THANK JESUS FOR MAKING THIS SUCH A CONVENIENT ITEM, AND IT WAS BARGAIN, MAKES NAILS LOOK 100 TIMES BETTER YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
    <li> I really do like that I can put both hands in at once.  I&#x27;m still on the learning curve about how long I need to set it for.  I think I&#x27;m doing it too long so I&#x27;ve been experimenting.  Of course, I only need to do my nails every two weeks (amazing)so it might take a little while to figure it out.  It always feels tacky until that top coat is cured (I&#x27;m using CND Shellac)and wiped off with alcohol.</li>
    <li> This item seems to work good, only used once. Gelish came off early, need to figure out what I did wrong.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t figure out if it has a timer, and if it does, how to set it</li>
    <li> This light works great and I love that it is large enough for two hands or two feet! I also like that I can set the cure time myself</li>
    <li> Arrived wuickly and works perfectly with OPI Axxium polish. Very easy to use. Large enough to fit both hands or both feet. AMAZING quality for such a low price.</li>
    <li> This dryer is easy to use and gave me great results. There&#x27;s not much information enclosed but all you do is release the bottom of the unit (don&#x27;t force it; push in the \\&quot;tabs\\&quot;) to insert the lightbulbs and peel off the blue protective coating on the mirror. Start by prepping nails to remove oils. Nails are cured in 2 minutes each for base, color and top coats. Wipe nails with plain alcohol (IPA) to remove stickiness and you&#x27;re done. I only did one hand at a time but you can definitely fit two if you prefer.</li>
    <li> seems used? a bit  disappointed there&#x27;s scratches on it, the inside has a piece that seems chipped...</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have had no problems with it.  So easy to use.  I would highly recommend this product. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other uv lights and have found this product the best. It has multiple timing, a fan, can fit Both hands at a time and can fit your feet. Thanks for a Wonderful product</li>
    <li> Great quality for the money.  Works quickly, lightweight, portable and big enough to dry both hands at once.  Very nice quality, better than what is used at most salons.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this lamp. Its huge I can easily fit both hands or feet. Super easy to put in bulbs. Works like a dream. I just started doing my own gel nails this is the perfect lamp. Has easy to use timer and a fan. The price was perfect actually better than perfect for the quality you get. I&#x27;ve used it a dozen times with no problem.</li>
    <li> Great product! works with all types of nail color products including gels and shellacs. Also works with nail color that says you need a led lamp.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know anything about UV lights before buying this product but after doing some research, this seemed to be the best deal with the best reviews!  I am extremely satisfied with the product and it worked just as described.  My nails now look fabulous and I can do it right out of my own house.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a reasonable UV light for gel nails.</li>
    <li> I am very happy that I purchased this professional UV light.  It came well packaged, and is large enough to put both hands or your feet in at the same time!  It has different timed settings, and seems to work very well.  I used this with the Gelish nail gel polish, and cured my nails for 180 seconds each time.  For the very first try at doing my own nails at home, I was quite impressed.  Tip:  Make sure that you use thin coats.  This hardens well, and you really don&#x27;t need to put a lot on.  As far as removing the nail gel, I think using a small glass custard bowl will work better than wrapping cotton/foil.</li>
    <li> I love this UV light dryer.  I have used it 6 times now and have had fantastic results every time. I like that the machine is large so I can fit both hands (and thumbs!) or feet under at the same time. Many of the smaller machines on the market require you to do your thumbs seperately which adds extra time to the process.  It is a fantastic investment that allows me to do my own gel manicure/pedicures in the comfort of my own home. The machine offers different timed settings so you can choose the time you want to cure and it will auto shut off when time is up.  No guess work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, can&#x27;t beat the price and excellent customer service offered by Blue Novelties.</li>
    <li> I have beautiful shellaced nails! The light works perfectly and well! I haven&#x27;t had any problems with its performance or function.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product!  It is large enough to fit both hands/ feet into it for curing at the same time and with a toddler, this is a real plus for me!  The fast curing time is great too, it does exactly what it says it does.  So glad I finally made this purchase and it is no longer just on my \\&quot;wish\\&quot; list!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s about the same time as sitting at the salon. To start out, for each application I use the longest timer x2for each app. . This is my process; first, the base, then the color, then the color again and then the base coat. But after the base coat drying is finished, I take a small artists paint brush (like a toddlers size) and dip it in nail polish remover and then apply it to all the nails and then go back in the machine for a 2x cycle again. We have found if we don&#x27;t do that, the top coat remains sticky. And, if you notice, they do that at the salon too.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s 25.00 for toes for gel nail at our strip mall salon, so 2 times, its paid for !</li>
    <li> The only downside is the size of the unit, but that&#x27;s inevitable for a double hand uv curing light. Works great!</li>
    <li> My wife, God bless her, loves doing her nails.  She loves to do them so much that she always seems to do them when we are ready to go out.  \\&quot;Hey baby, it&#x27;s 7:55, we need to be there before 8:30, ready?\\&quot;.  Her reply is ALWAYS , \\&quot;In about 20 more minutes, I just need to let my nails dry.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution:  This 54 WATT ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL AND ACRYLIC NAIL DRYER!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This UV Nail Dryer is AWESOME!  Easy to set up and then ready to go (simply insert the included UV bulbs &amp; then plug it in).  The included instructions are easy to read and simple.  PLEASE make sure you remove the fine film that is on all of the reflective surfaces inside that look like mirrors(Do this while you are putting in your bulbs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Googled \\&quot;Gel Nail Polish\\&quot; and actually bought it from Amazon as well ([[ASIN:B004SSRSRS B004SSRSRS]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, PLEASE NOTE that you HAVE TO HAVE a base coat applied before applying your new Gel Nail Polish, and THEN you need a Top Coat.  I purchased a Base Coat/Top Coat kit for her here on Amazon too ([[ASIN:B005MG86TY B005MG86TY]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER:  After you cure the Top Coat it WILL BE TACKY!!!!  You MUST remove the top coat with a non lint cloth and some isopropyl alcohol (You simply swipe the alcohol pad/cloth over the nail, removing the top thin coat).  Sounds weird, why would you have to take it off after you just put in on?  Well, it helps cure your nail coating and looks shiney and beautiful after removing it!  Again, plenty of YouTube videos showing you how to do this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember Google is your friend, and so is YouTube.  There are a ton of videos on how to do all of this yourself, if you don&#x27;t already know what you are doing of course.  I&#x27;m one of those guys that likes to research everything I purchase and learn how everything works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s nails look absolutely AMAZING.  They look like she just walked out of a professional nail salon.  This UV Dryer/Curer dries them evenly and FAST (1-3 minutes per coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is HAPPY, which makes ME happy, and we save a lot of $$$.  Did I mention that her fingernail polish looks brand new 3 weeks later????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the other reviews as well, some great tips posted on here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I 100% recommend this UV dryer!FAST (1-3 minutes per coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is HAPPY, which makes ME happy, and we save a lot of $$$.  Did I mention that her fingernail polish looks brand new 3 weeks later????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the other reviews as well, some great tips posted on here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I 100% recommend this UV dryer!</li>
    <li> I love this nail dryer. It works as advertised.  Dries nails fast and the product is bigger than what I expectected; but you definately have room for both hands.  I have not tried putting my feet in there yet; but there is definately room!  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. It is nice and big so I don&#x27;t have to be concerned with hitting my nails on the side. The added fan feature is great for doing regular polish. I love how easy to use this product is. For anyone unsure how to use gel nails make sure you use the cleanser at the end to remove any stickyness and give that shiny glossy look.</li>
    <li> The cheap build on this model resulted in 3 of the 6 bulbs failing after the first use.  A loud pop and burning plastic smell accompanied the outage.  I&#x27;m not sure I would trust this model enough to get another one.  It is a shame because they seemed well rated.  Sad as this was a present, which now has to be returned.</li>
    <li> I love my PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL AND ACRILIC NAIL DRYER!!  It&#x27;s an excellent product, looks very professional and has so much room to use on both hands and feet as well.</li>
    <li> The item I purchased looked used. The fan barely works. The timer doesn&#x27;t work at all. The light does what it&#x27;s supposed to and I am able to do my nails.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product and seller. 100% satisfied. I like that I can have my hands or toes side by side at the same time under the light.,</li>
    <li> I love it. First time ever using a nail dryer. Worked very well and quick. Great results too. I have not tried the gel application. It worked terrific on OPI nail polish. I used it with 4 coats total. It definitely toughens up my nail polish results. No peeling because it got to thick and dry enough between coats.</li>
    <li> Perfect for at home gel nails</li>
    <li> This is a great UV nail dryerI received this light for Christmas, it arrived very quickly and in an undamaged box just like the one shown in the picture. It included 6 bulbs packaged in cardboard inside of the dryer. I plugged in the lamps and powered it on with no problems. There are three buttons, a power button to turn on the lamps, a timer button to select how long you want the lamps to stay on, and a fan button to turn the small fan on and off. The dryer is large, about the size of a show box and on the heavier side, but has plenty of room to cure both hands or both feet at the same time. So far I&#x27;ve used the lamp with OPI GelColor as well as China Glaze Gelaze polish. All colors both glitters and cream polishes have cured with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;A few tips I have from assembly and use:&lt;br /&gt;When inserting the lamps, press inward on the two tabs on the bottom and the whole top will lift up on a hinge in the back.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you remove the blue plastic covering from all surfaces and then press the top back down firm and carefully until it clicks into place.&lt;br /&gt;I use the typical 1,2,3 method wit gels. 1 minute to cure the base, 2 minutes for each layer of color, and then 3 minutes for top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read through some negative reviews stating it did not sure their polish. A UV bulb will cure all UV gel polish if it is applied correctly. There is something called a dispersion layer that will rise to the surface of each gel layer. This is a sticky film on the nail surface and should be wiped off with alcohol at the end of the manicure. No matter how long you cure your nails that layer will not go away until you clean it off. This does not mean that the light it defective, you have just failed to do your research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I recommend this nail lamp/dryer for personal use with UV gels and even regular nail polish to shorten dry time. I give it 4 stars for price power and functionality, if it were a bit more compact and lightweight it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!e perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Why 5 Stars?  I always end up polishing nails late at night.  No more sheet prints or gouges.  This works well on normal polish and super on shellac.  Outstanding!  One negative however.  One bulb arrived broken, so obviously need to send in request for a new one.  I know this seems minor, however, one of my biggest pet peeves is having to spend time correcting what wasn&#x27;t any fault of mine.</li>
    <li> This UV light is probably the best buy you&#x27;ll find.  It is large enough for both hands at once.  Others are to small and  you must do one hand at a time.  It has 54 watts which is  used by professionals. Compared to the other lights out there, this one wins hands down!  The price was excellent.  I am new to shellac polish and have found it easy to do using this light.  Try it you&#x27;ll love it.  Compared to nail salon fee in my area of $50.00, this purchase was a \\&quot;no brainer\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Was delivered in a very timely manner and works like a charm!</li>
    <li> After making the decision to attempt an at-home gel manicure without ever having had gel nails done, I had no idea what to look for when buying the supplies. The reviews for this light made me decide to give it a try. I&#x27;m very happy with it. This light came lickety-split and set up took less than 90 seconds. I have used it twice (the first try needed a do-over) and I am thrilled with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have never had my nails done, I did not know there are machines that dry one hand (or foot) at a time or both hands (or feet) simultaneously. This is the latter. Both hands go in together so it cuts curing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using this light for a long time now and have never had any problems. My daughter asked for a light for her birthday and I bought her this same one. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Works as advertised.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Thought I would love this, and I did for one use- the second time I tried to use it, only one half of the lights worked. Cannot return it, because I missed the cutoff- by one day!</li>
    <li> So far my girlfriend loves this, this was a great surprise gift &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Got it for my daughter for Christmas and she would not stop talking about it. All her girlfriends love it and want one of their own.</li>
    <li> So Happy I Have this!!!</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this light along with the OPI gel base coat, nail polishes and top coat so I could do my own manicures at home. I&#x27;ve owned the system for about 2 months and have done my nails and friends&#x27; nails about 10 times so far. Love the light - nice to have the width to cure both hands at once. The fan is also good for pulling in fumes. You have the option to cure in 30 second increments, up to about 4 minutes. I typically cure each coat about 90-120 seconds and the final coat 180 seconds. I love being able to change polishes for color or to avoid the grow-out look. It costs about $80 to buy the light, base &amp; top coat and two polishes - basically the same as 2 manicures so I&#x27;ve definitely saved money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes less than 30 minutes for me to paint nails. With removal, trimming and shaping, it&#x27;s about an hour long process. Make sure you read up on the polish you use - for example, make sure you wipe over your nails with alcohol after the top coat cures. This final step is what hardens and shines the polish completely. I use the foil method for removal - works great for me. Some of my friends find they can peel off the polish easily once it starts lifting in a corner. I&#x27;m not really able to do so. I guess there&#x27;s a difference in nail texture for some people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m saving so much money doing my own nails and this dryer is better than the ones some of the salons I tried use!  It works great.  It&#x27;s a little big but you can easily fit both hands or feet into it to dry polish.</li>
    <li> I was using the Red Carpet UV light from Ulta, and I had no idea what I was missing! This UV light is amazing! My nail polish stays on for easily over 2 weeks and the best part is that you can put two hands in the light at once! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Ladies, if you want to continue paying $40 - $50 per Shellac manicures--go for it.  But you do not have to!  I bought this gel lamp, after careful research on all of the lamps available and this is incredible.  The first time I did my Shellac manicure, it looked professionally done.  I am not a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; nail polisher, but this lamp and the Shellac products work equally well at home as in the salon..  My lamp did come with instructions, which were very easy to follow.  The only thing you had to do was install the bulbs, which was extremely easy.  Ready to go in literally minutes.  I love the  wide opening, allowing me to cure both of my hands at the same time.  Good bye, high salon bills!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife for Christmas.  She used to pay $85 a visit to have her nails done.  She does them herself now using this gadget which she absolutely loves.  It paid for itself one and half times the first time she used it.  She&#x27;s sold on it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product ! Highly recommend for professional use! Bought 1 more and the other nail tech loved it! Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase again!</li>
    <li> The 54 watt Royal Nails UV light is great, better than the ones used in nail salons and at this price I can do my own nails and save a fortune in new nails and fill-ins.  Highly recommend this unit!  It is plenty big to put both feet or both hands at once.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my daughter-in-law for her birthday.  She is very pleased with the quality and enjoys using it for a quick cure for her gel nails.  If you are short on time (and who isn&#x27;t?), it is so much simpler to do your nails at home -- especially when you can get professional looking results.  Get it!  You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my 54 Watt Royal Nail UV Light.  It is professional grade.  Really like that it is large enough for both hands.  Have worn gel nails done in a salon for several years but get tired of having to find a time to go in to salon so now don&#x27;t have that problem.  Received my light in a very timely manner.  Very happy with my purchase and the service provided.</li>
    <li> I love this UV nail dryer...its perfect b/c I can fit both hands under the lamp to dry when I am doing a gel set. Its easy to use and does a great job drying them!</li>
    <li> Love this!  I am new to gel nails and I wanted something that would do both hands at once!!  This does both hands and can do feet too!!  It is great!  I love it!  If you are going to buy a UV Light, this is the one you should get!!!  Seriously it is the best!!  You can&#x27;t beat the price either!!  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> When i received this item i put all the bulbs in the proper way...but one of the bulbs didnt even work which is very disappointing...also there were a few scuffs and scratches on the top of the plastic which upset me...i thought i was buying a new item not a used one!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase!!! Fast shipping, ease of use, good product quality, I love that you can dry both hands or feet at the same time.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product!! I was a little worried, given the price, but it&#x27;s AWESOME!! I just started doing my own shellac manicures at home. I use CND products with this light and it comes out better than what I was getting in the salon, at a fraction of the price!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE...may buy another as a backup!</li>
    <li> It looks so classy.. It has a fan which most models don&#x27;t and you can fit both hands comfortably has various timer settings and it has not broken or given me any problems!!! I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> First nail dryer was DOA. However, I returned hassle free via Amazon and ordered a new one. The second one works great. I&#x27;ve used several time for manicures and pedicures with OPI, shellac and gellish polishes. Love being able to do gel nails at home and for much less money!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I did not like the high cost of having shellac or gel nails at a salon.  We are having so much fun doing this together at home.  Directions are minimal at best, but Internet or YouTube have very detailed instructions.</li>
    <li> This light has worked fantastic and I like I can put both hands in to dry also. I would tell everyone that this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I have just recently started doing my own gel / shellac nails at home.  I shopped around for a UV light.  I think this one was the best by far for the price.  I see them in stores with half the Wattage and double the price.  It arrived in perfect condition, each bulb was safely wrapped and protected.  Easy to install the bulbs.  It&#x27;s kind of bulky but you can fit both hands in there at once if you like to do it that way.  I like that it also has a fan option.  It is quiet and so far very reliable.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is just like the ones at the salon.  A bit big sometimes so if you are thinking of just sitting in bed and doing your nails, that&#x27;s not going to happen.  Big enough for two hands at a time. Perfect for salon manicures at home.  Arrived perfectly, too.</li>
    <li> Product arrived just as advertised and works fine...Purchased for wife and daughter and both love it.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just got a call from her and she finally got a chance to do gel nails at home for the 1st time last night.  She LOVES it.  The only complaints both of us have about this machine is that the control buttons are &amp;#34;backwards&amp;#34; - instead of the print facing you, the print faces away so you have to read it upside down.  Also, its hard to remove the casing to get the bulbs in, but the actual bulb install is very easy.  For the price tho, what an extremely good deal!</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the fine lines on it, but when I received it, I was shocked at the sheer size of the machine.  I&#x27;d never seen one this large, not even at the nail salon.  And as far as it working, it worked less well than the $10 Kiss UV curing light I bought from Walgreens.  I ended up going back to the cheap one.  It&#x27;s small and works better.</li>
    <li> My 15 yr old granddaughter asked for Santa to bring her the Professional Gel &amp; Acrylic Nail Dryer. My daughter was the one who told me so I immediately looked on Amazon.com and there it was...your site with a fabulous price.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to click the box, easy, easy..it arrived in enough time for Christmas..I have heard over and over from my granddaughter how happy she is with my gift.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend your site and thank you for the great Customer Service &amp; excellent quality merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;Jo-Ann, San Francisco</li>
    <li> Built well and has many time options, use it at home for my own gel nails.  Can&#x27;t be happier.  Was a great price too!</li>
    <li> If you are picky about your nails, this is IT!  It works perfectly, gives a beautiful result; better to me than some salon operators who rush through your manicure.  You do need to purchase the gel base, color, and top coats, but these are available in drug stores for less.I am very happy with this, will be doing my mother&#x27;s, sister&#x27;s nails as well as my own. Very good product, I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I Love this light. It&#x27;s the best light on the market for the price. I use it for all things Gel and Shellac. It cures them all along with gel nails. And does both hands or feet at the same time. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> After a couple of years of acrylic nails I could no longer afford the monthly expense.  Ordered the 54 WATT ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL AND ACRILIC NAIL DRYER along with CND brand gel nail system.  I used the dryer exactly as directed by CND and my nails turned out perfect!  This is going to save me SOOO much money in the long run.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail dryer, but be warned-it&#x27;s huge! It&#x27;s large enough to fit both hands or feet in at the same time. But it&#x27;s very effective and nice looking.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect gift. My daughter fell in love with it and uses constantly. She has nothing but praise for the dryer!</li>
    <li> My wife wanted one of these to complete her home spa package. She loves having friends over to pamper themselves, and this was a great addition. She loves it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas present fro myself and am extremely satisfied. It works exactly as was described and I love my nails! Plus I don&#x27;t have to pay a ton of money to have them done!</li>
    <li> My wife was very happy to receive this for Christmas. Said she finally got what she asked for for Christmas. Usually I wait till last minute and she ends with gift cards lol. Yeah so now we have spa days with the girls now. Yes very satisfied with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I went for this instead of the cheaper one.  This machine pays for itself in 2 manicures and is probably one of my favorite purchases of 2013.  It looks identical to the machines in salons, and works just as well.  I read a blog post before I used the machine for the first time, and it&#x27;s perfect and very detailed - google lulu and sweet pea DIY shellac manicure.  The machine has different timer options, so I cure each coat for 90 seconds except the topcoat, which I do for 120 seconds (totally arbitrary but it makes me feel like it&#x27;s \\&quot;set\\&quot; better).  I bought the Gelish foundation and topcoat (separately, not the \\&quot;starter set,\\&quot; since the nail prep thing they include in that is just 99% isopropyl alcohol, which you can get for $3 at the drugstore).  I&#x27;d recommend Gelish over drugstore brands, I tried a Sally Hansen gel polish (with my Gelish top/base) and it&#x27;s the only time my mani hasn&#x27;t lasted perfectly for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This works great! I like how you can have both hands in the dryer at one time. Its light weight, yet durable. Im going to buy another one for my friend. Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> this machine works extremely well. Every nail tech should have one. I love it!! Dont search any further, buy now!</li>
    <li> Works great. Drys your nails quick. Does work for regular polish but not as well. If you wear gels this is a must have. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a cheaper model. This one is more money for a reason \\&quot;Quality\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Easy to set up. Came quick and packaged well.  I&#x27;ve used with several different brands of nail polish and it works well with all of them.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. It looks good and works well and both the clients and manicurists love it.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly in perfect condition.  Used the same day it arrived.  Fits BOTH hands at the same time.  I did not read the size of this thing as it is something you need a place to store.  Larger than the ones they use at the salon!  Many different time settings and it works great.</li>
    <li> I been using it for 2 months now, and I love it so far! I like that I can put both hands at once! You can also buy the gloves to protect your hands from the uv light since is not a LED light.</li>
    <li> This dryer is huge but works really well. I&#x27;ve used it with shellac, finger paints gel, gelish hand ProFx and it&#x27;s worked great. With lighter colors and French manicures I cure every layer for 2 min and haven&#x27;t had any trouble. For darker colors and top coat I cure for 3 mins. I read other reviews about installing the lights (I had no problems at all). I really love that you can dry both hands (or feet) at the same time; what a time saver. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I would totally recommend it but be warned it is a really large light.</li>
    <li> Love it. I was tired of paying 30+ to have my nails done professionally only for them to peel or chip in less than a week. So far I have no complaints and I&#x27;ve even been able to use my regular nail polish along with the gel base and top coat. The light sets the polish timely. Takes longer to soak the polish off than to put them on!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely perfect and well worth the price. I Also purchased the OPI gelcolor starter kit and it works great with these. I feel like a professional when I do my nails! After shopping around, reading reviews, and reviewing prices, the was definitely the best buy I could find.</li>
    <li> I chose this UV Light because it was in my price range (around $50) and it didn&#x27;t look cheaply made. It is a lot larger than I expected it to be, but I have no complaints.  There are a variety of time settings you can choose from and I have never had any problems with it.  My nails cure well and stay on for weeks!</li>
    <li> Been using this for weeks now and have had no issues with it.  It does the trick and I love the results.</li>
    <li> I have been scanning the internet for a couple months now to find a uv lamp that would suit my needs and wants at a resonable price. This product does that!!! This UV lamp is GREAT! Large enough for both feet and hands, has a fan to help keep it cool and didnt cost me too much!!! I LOVE this lamp and would recommend it to anyone wanting to do their nails with gel polish.</li>
    <li> I love this product because I can do both hands at once and the UV gloves are awesome as well!! I do all my friends too!! Thank you</li>
    <li> This UV curing lamp is wonderful.  The price is fantastic as I have been looking for a top quality lamp at a reasonable price for a while, and this exceeded my expectations.  It works great and is easy to use.  The wattage is perfect for a lasting shellac manicure.  I am so happy with this purchase.  I also like the fact that I can do my toenails in this and have both feet in at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to shellac, but my friend who has hers done at the salon was impressed and now wants to do her own nails.  I told her that she needed to get this lamp as it was the main reason that my french manicure looks so good. The right equipment makes all the difference.  You will not be disappointed in this product and the seller is highly recommended.  Thanks for a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My newbie tips are to cure the last top coat for 3 minutes as that seems to work best for me.  I use the UV gloves on my hands and do one hand at a time from start to finish.  I also put the cream puff tip color on after the base coat and cure for 2 minutes.  I then put on a coat of clearly pink and cure for 2 minutes and follow with the top coat.  Hope these tips help some other newbie take the plunge and do their own shellac nails.  If you do, this lamp is a must have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great for a regular manicure as it has a fan only option that my daughter raves about.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this with CND Shellac and gets great results. Service from this seller was great and on time even during this past super busy holiday season.</li>
    <li> I have been extremely pleased with this product.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it is large enough for both hands (or feet) to dry at the same time.  It works well.  I use the gelish nail products with it and dry for around 1 minute.  The manicure will last me an entire 2 weeks.  I was so impressed with the product that I purchased another light to give away as a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lamp/dryer for about 4 months now and absolutely love it.  It works beautifully for gel nails.</li>
    <li> Use it for like second year. It is big and works excellent. You can put both of your feet or hands under it at the same time. Besides it has several options. And has a fan. Love it.</li>
    <li> Size works great for quickly finishing Hands and Feet Gel polish application. I recently removed fake nails and tips so my nail beds are very tender when exposed to the UV light so I will stop using until I can get them healthy again.  It is great to have the Nail Dryer built in while I use regular polish instead.</li>
    <li> The product works fantastic! Love my nails.  The only thing is, it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions! Had to look them up on U tube!</li>
    <li> this nail dryer is amazing!  it cures nails in minutes and does it perfectly every time.  I had a smaller machine previously that just didnt match up to this one.  HTis one is especially great bc i can fit both hands in at the same time, so it cuts the time in half!</li>
    <li> Worked perfect for a month. Then the timer stopped working and a week later the fan stopped working. The lamp still works (which is most important) its just a bummer the other features no longer work :-(</li>
    <li> Really great light. It does dry out my hands if I use it more than 2x a week. Its great because I can do both hands at the same time.</li>
    <li> The best investment ever! It&#x27;s so easy to use and it saves you so much money in the long run. I would definitely buy it again if I had the choice.</li>
    <li> No instructions on length of time to dry each coat, so I had to guess and rely on other people who left opinions.  It seems that it takes a LOT longer for each coat to dry than stated in other reviews.  I have been drying each layer from 3 to 5 minutes and it still feels tacky to the touch.  So far, I have tried Sally Hansen, CND and SensatioNail.  The only one I have had good results with is the Sally Hansen Brand.  The other two chipped and peeled the very next day. I am blown away by so many 5 star reviews based on the experience I&#x27;ve had so far.  The nail polish is not cheap and who wants to try a brand again if it wasn&#x27;t successful the first time? Especially when you consider spending up to 5 minutes for each of 4 coats times both hands.  Plus the time it takes to prepare your nails and apply.  Sucks to spend 45 minutes to an hour on your nails and end up with bad results.  If I had it to do over,I would not buy this product.</li>
    <li> My best investment ever! Doing my own gel nails has paid for this machine ten times already! It&#x27;s so big tha even my feet fit in...so now I have gel pedicures too!</li>
    <li> I have used the dryer twice now to cure my gel nails. I like that it has a fan as well as the UV lights bulbs because sometimes I use regular polish with gel nail base and top coat. I turn on the fan to speed the drying time when using regular polish and it works great. I also like that the bulbs are all above your hands and out of the way. My mother has a UV dryer as well but the hand hole is much smaller and you are constantly bumping your nails on the clips that hold in the UV bulbs. I also like that the timer ranges from 1.5-5mins. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great and has many drying options.  I love that it can be used as a dryer and to dry the gel polish as well.  It&#x27;s big enough to fit both hands which is a bonus!  Overall it&#x27;s a great product and works very well.  Easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy to use and convenient to dry both hands at same time.  Unit was packaged well and arrived on time. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product is just what I wanted.  Lamp is large enough two hands/two feet. It didn&#x27;t come with any instructions, but was pretty easy to figure out. The Lamp works just as well as the one in the salon and is super easy to use.  I am very happy with my purchase, awesome product for a very affordable price, have done two manicures and already got my moneys worth plus some. I would highly recommend this lamp if looking to buy a gel nail curing lamp.</li>
    <li> For this product I rated it with a five star because it came on time and was exactly what was advertised on Amazon. The product is a great product with a great price. The product was packaged very well for both security and protection in shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I just received this dryer and have only used it one time. It did a great job of curing my shellaced nails. I used it with regular nail polish on my toes. Within an hour of finishing my toe nails, I put on socks and shoes. I was afraid that I would have the typical sock imprints on my toe nails, but that did not happen. The polish was dry! Also, be careful when you put your feet in the dryer - make sure your feet are on the floor and slide them in without lifting them up. I bumped one of my toes against the top portion of the opening and had to reapply that polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t count the number of times that I&#x27;ve applied regular polish to my nails and ruined them hours later because the polish was not fully set. The Royal Nails dryer has eliminated that problem. Even if you don&#x27;t buy this to cure the UV polishes, it works great for regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product photos do not show the location for the operating controls. The timer and fan controls are just behind the starburst on the top of the dryer. The on/off switch is on the back side of the dryer. Also, the outside measurements of the dryer are 14\\&quot; wide x 10\\&quot; deep x 7\\&quot; high. The lid is hinged and opens wide for the bulb installation. The timer settings (in seconds) are: 90, 120, 180, 240 and 300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shopped around for days trying to make my mind up about which dryer to buy.  This dryer had the highest wattage for the best price.  The quality of the dryer is good, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this machine!  I&#x27;ve used it on hands and feet- it is great!  I use Gelish products and I&#x27;ve had no complaints.</li>
    <li> It works great and is easy to use.  I use it with just gel polish and it works great. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> After paying $50 per manicure, I decided that I didn&#x27;t have much to lose - and to buy this. It&#x27;s amazing. Easy to use, easy to set up. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She loves it, says it works as good as the ones in a salon. This was delivered quickly and very well packaged. Would definitely buy from seller again.</li>
    <li> The product matches the description - easy to set up, easy to use and dries gel nail coats in two minutes.  Very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my mother.  She absolutely loves it.  I also purchased with it CND base coat, polish and top coat.  The combination with this machine is perfect she says.  She tells everyone about her new nail dryer.  Thank you.  The Perfect Gift.</li>
    <li> This is a large uv dryer; big enough to fit both hands or feet it. It has several time settings or you can just leave the light on with no timer. It is also equipped with a fan that you can leave off or turn pn. It does an excellent job with drying my gel polish.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone in need of a uv light nail dryer.</li>
    <li> What a great product. Large and spacious! Built in fan, multiple timed levels with auto turn off, makes for the perfect UV drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a breeze to use and I was finished much faster since all five fingers can be cured at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the one you want for sure!</li>
    <li> I got it home, opened box and gave it a try. It worked great. Never going back to the salon for gel and I saved $35.00&lt;br /&gt;Twice which has paid for lamp.........</li>
    <li> We purchased this for use in our salon and spa.  It worked as well as a way more expensive one we purchased when we opened.  Ordering two more today.</li>
    <li> It is everything the reviews said and I am thrilled with it!  You should see my nails now!  Ya baby!</li>
    <li> Have used it twice and it works great.  It&#x27;s large so you can fit both hands or both feet in at once and has a fan option.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been going to nail salons for years and this product is as good or better than the professional brands that cost a lot more.</li>
    <li> This light is gorgeous &amp; I thought it would be the bomb - -I wasted my money.  I have used it two times and it doesn&#x27;t cure the polish.  Both times it slid right off.  The fan - to air dry, it might as well be a ladybug blowing as hard as she can.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I did.</li>
    <li> Great gift idea for the price!</li>
    <li> Loving this dryer so far. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it is easy to use! I am not quite sure how long the bulbs last or where I can buy more to replace...</li>
    <li> Works great! As a nail technician at a salon it works flawlessly</li>
    <li> Does not dry or cure at all! I had my hands under it for over 20 minutes and almost no drying or curing occurred.  I went to bed with sticky nails that were collecting lint. Wasted time and money</li>
    <li> Works PERFECTLY!  Great value, excellent price; much more cost-effective than other models.  Shipped very well so that product arrived un-damaged.</li>
    <li> Love it! It paid for itself the first time I used it!</li>
    <li> I actually purchased the nail dryer as a gift for my daughter in law.  She loves it.  I know she has used it many times since Christmas, and says it works great.  The price was very reasonable for the quality of the item.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to use and set up.  My nails look great, polish stay good, only reason for changing color is because of re-growth.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the shellac polish! I don&#x27;t have to paint my nails every other day anymore, it&#x27;s great!! This dryer is perfect!</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time last night with Gelish polish, base, and top coats.  I loved it!  I thought I was doing it wrong at first, as it felt like the polish wasn&#x27;t setting, so I actually kept my nails under the light for much longer than I needed.  But I figured out by the time I got to the polish itself that it was working according to plan, and I ended up with a great at-home gel manicure!  Use rubbing alcohol to wipe down your nails once you&#x27;ve applied the top coat or else they&#x27;ll feel rubbery/sticky.  This is definitely worth the investment if you like gel manicures (and pedicures) but don&#x27;t like paying $60+ each time you go to the nail salon.  This will pay for itself in just two or three uses!!!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Bought two units. The first one quite simply does not cure gel nail polish - I have tried all sorts of curing time combinations with Gellish nail polish but it won&#x27;t work!.&lt;br /&gt;Set up the second one to try and it simply wouldn&#x27;t work - the power button would not even come on. I had my electrician confirm that the fuse and all were intact - the unit simply won&#x27;t switch on.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing rip-off to say the least.</li>
    <li> Bought this back in the summer. Its great for shellac or gel. Although I will say, I like shellac more than gel, it lasts longer. The light works great and I love that it has a timer. Easy to put together, easy to use, easy to store. Works like a charm. Save your money going to the salon, if you keep your nails short, buy this machine, a few shellac polishes and look like a million.</li>
    <li> My husband got me this as a Christmas gift this year.. He was assembling it as I was prepping my nails and applied the first base coat to be cured. Turns out the lights don&#x27;t turn on, and three of the bulbs arrived to us broken. The machine itself had a few visible scratches and was dinged up in a few locations as if it was used? We are very confused because we were under the impression this was a NEW product. Soooo disappointed!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech. I bought  this uv light for my salon  just used today  I really like it try fast and good price. Thank you</li>
    <li> This product seems to work really well.  It has a much higher wattage than what I have seen while reviewing other products.  My wife seems very happy with the UV light.  She enjoys the fan, multiple timer settings, and the reflective internal surround.  The only improvement on this product would be to place the the extra two lights on the side instead of on the top with the others.  But, due to the reflective surfaces on the inside the placement of the bulbs does not greatly affect the performance.  This light works really well, and was great for the price!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and good price. it has a fan inside can dry regular polish. And the machine ia big that i can put two hands in together.</li>
    <li> I love this UV light! It works wonderfully and is professional quality at a great price. My sister is a licensed cosmetologist, and she said it&#x27;s a great light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s large enough to fit both hands in at a time.</li>
    <li> I do my own pedicure, and I recently changed to the gel system (shellac).  I love how easy it is to use this, and the fact that it is big enough to put both of my feet in.  Leaves my toe nails shiny!</li>
    <li> I have used this 3 times so far, and am quite pleased.  Have used with CND Shellac gel polish, OPI Gel Polish, and just plain old regular nail polish.  It effectively cures the gel polish, and dries regular nail polish quickly and makes it last a bit longer than normal. The large size is great, I can fit both feet under it at once for quick and easy drying of toes! Very pleased with the light, was easy to learn how to use, and shipping was prompt.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I went in together to purchase this UV Dryer and could not be happier.  The price was great and splitting it two ways made it even better.  We are both enjoying doing our nails at home now with gels and the CND Shellac.  What a savings to be able to do our own and on our time schedule. We would recommend it to anyone thinking about getting one.  My daughter loves the fact that she can dry both hands at the same time.</li>
    <li> I received my Royal Nails Professional Light less than a week ago and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it! The light was in perfect condition upon arrival and works as stated in the product details. I really like the automatic timer because I can set it for the length of time my nails need to dry and it automatically turns off when complete. In less than a week I&#x27;ve done two manicures and a pedicure with this light and it produced salon quality results each time. I used it with OPI and Gelish products. I own two smaller, hand held UV lights that are difficult to use and left me frustrated with the length of time it took to dry the nails. Compared to these lights, the Royal Nails Professional UV light is a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is rather large but I knew that when I purchased it so that isn&#x27;t a problem for me. I would suggest keeping the original packaging and storing it in a closet or cabinet when not in use. The benefit of the large light is you can easily use it to give yourself a gel pedicure. Both sets of toes easily fit in the light at the same time which is great. The one small thing that isn&#x27;t a big deal is the product instructions don&#x27;t specify that you can open the light from the bottom. I only knew that because I read other reviews before purchasing. Overall I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this purchase and the seller (Blue Novelties). I would recommend this UV light for anyone that wants to look like they just left the salon.</li>
    <li> This 54 WATT ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL AND ACRILIC NAIL DRYER is great. I was tired of paying over $45 every 10 days for a shellac mani so decided for my birthday to purchase the dryer and the polish. Yes it is expensive, but after 4 or 5 manicures it is paid for. I opted for the larger dryer since I was higher wattage. Hopefully it will last a long time!</li>
    <li> works but flimsy construction</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this UV Light! It is fast, efficient and fits nicely into my mobile case. Satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I want to follow up with previous review. The company contacted me immediately and made it clear they do no deal with preowned products and was very sorry this happened. Amazon fulfillment ( this has happened three times before me) where Amazon has put returned/damaged goods back on the shelf, instead of \\&quot;defect\\&quot; bin. I am so impressed with Blue Novelties, with their professionalism, honesty and business ethnics. It&#x27;s refreshing for a company to stand up for their product and customer service&#x3D;reputation. I received a new one apprx week later.&lt;br /&gt; I am sorry this has happened to them as well, as it must be frustrating to count on a fulfillment center, only to have them send faulty product. They count on it for their reputation.&lt;br /&gt;So, this review goes from 2 stars to 12 for the professional manner of blue novelties and their nail dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this today really looking forward to my new \\&quot;gel experience\\&quot;. Opening the box, the label was broken, no instructions and inside the dryer was a chip, scratches, feeling I received a preowned, returned item. No bueno.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed for the price, going to return it, when I receive a NEW dryer will give a more detailed review....I will get back to you!</li>
    <li> Wow! This dryer works great. Perfect size to fit both hands or feet. Easy to use and came within one week. Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of money</li>
    <li> This unit is fabulous and does a better job curing shellac than the units at my local nail salon.  There is plenty of room for hands or feet and it seems to be well constructed.  I am extremely happy with the purchase and the unit will pay for iteself in just 2 months.</li>
    <li> I purchased this so I wouldn&#x27;t have to go to the nail salon and could save money.  It does a good job, but, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me, the nail polish or what but the nails don&#x27;t last as long as when I had them done at the nail salon.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, looked around locally, and decided to make this purchase, I do not regret it. This is an awesome lamp, it has everything to dry gels, and a fan as well. Definitely, worth more!!!</li>
    <li> Love the machine and loved buying from this company.  Great deal.  Cures nails perfectly and I feel like I&#x27;m doing a salon style polish every time!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item after getting tired of going to salons to get my nails done and dropping $30-$40 per service, at a time! I thought it would be much more economical to do it myself! My daughter also gets gel done on her fingers and toes, and so far, this UV lamp has already paid for half of itself! It is super easy to set up and works really well! It gives you the option to do 1 or 2 minute rounds, and has a sleek design.  This one allows you to put both hands or both feet in for curing at a time. It is a really great product, and I am so glad I invested in this one! Your nails will look professionally done, every time. And the best thing, is the savings and the creativity of doing it yourself!</li>
    <li> IT looked like the box had been resealed. Gave it as a present for Xmas to my daughter.  when she tired it for the first time it didnt work sending it back</li>
    <li> This lamp was bigger than I expected but it works great and dries my nails super fast.  Would highly recommend for at home gel nail application, just make sure you have a place to store it!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for my daughter for her birthday.  She loved it so much that I ordered two more .......one for myself and one for my other daughter.  We all love this dryer and now will be saving a lot of money on manicures!!  You can even get your feet in this one!!  My toes have never been prettier.</li>
    <li> I bought this light to use with gelish and CND products.  I used a gelish base (30 seconds), gelish color (2 min.), and CND top coat (2 min.).  Worked perfectly with all! Just clean with rubbing alcohol and you&#x27;re set to go.  No more need to go to the salon.  It was easy to assemble (yes, you have to put in the light bulbs - just tug on the top to pop it open).  This will pay for itself in a couple of months with the money I&#x27;ll save on manicures.</li>
    <li> I recently started doing Shellac myself and this product is awesome. I recommend this curing unit as it makes the process faster. From the tine I ordered the unit, tracked the package, received it on time, put it together, and used it. I love it ans this company for having it avaliable to me. Thank You So Much!!!</li>
    <li> This product work great, I have had other nail dryers that didn&#x27;t work at all this is very good. Professional drying.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was trying to be frugal so I originally bought a nail dryer that was less expensive than this one. It simply did not work so I returned it (thanks Amazon for the awesome return policy!!!). When this one arrived, it was so much sturdier and better made. It is worth it! I have used Gelish, CND and OPI and it cured all of them in no time at all! Best of all, I gave my daughter a mani/pedi and both of her hands or both feet fit comfortable at the same time. There are numerous lamps inside to cure evenly and the timer works great, too. If you are looking for a budget-conscious and well-made product, buy this lamp! It will pay for itself after one mani/pedi!!!</li>
    <li> Great dryer, very easy to set-up. The UV lights pop in easily and aren&#x27;t too hard to get out. It came as new, wasn&#x27;t opened, nothing was broken. Has different timer settings from 30 - 180 seconds, you can also turn on a fan to help dry nails faster. For Gelish polish, I&#x27;ve been drying for about 180 seconds (I&#x27;m overly paranoid about the polish setting) for each coat, including base and top coat. If it&#x27;s a darker color, I&#x27;ll usually zing the color coats twice at 180 seconds. We&#x27;ll see if it hangs on through a full year of usage, but so far worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I shopped around for weeks looking for a UV lamp that was not super expensive and still sturdy built.  I came across the royal nails one and for the price and the features, I decided that this was the one that I wanted.  I received it and used it right away.  I use both shellac and gelish on my nails and it cures them both just fine.  It has great features.. timers and a fan that you can turn on so that it doesn&#x27;t get to hot with your hands inside.  It is wide enough for both hands or both feet to go in at once.  I was a little worried that it not being rounded that the sides of my thumbs would not cure, but I have not had that problem, there is enough space that I can put my thumb out to the side and get everything cured.  I am really very happy with this light and am glad that I got it over some of the other ones because it&#x27;s so roomy. All in all very good and worth the money! Defiantly recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lamp it works wonders, I&#x27;m a former manicuring student so I knew a bit about UV gel nails but you don&#x27;t necessarily need any experience. The directions are usually on the bottle, I use this with my ibd uv builder gels, and I will soon try with uv polishes! I love it! Ps. If the gel burns, it&#x27;s not the lamp but keep a spray bottle of 70% alcohol to spray on nails when it burns then place hand back under lamp then you&#x27;re fine.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Works fantastic. I can even use the fan when not doing shellac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must remember to wipe your nails off with nail polish remover when fully finished painting them with shellac. A gal earlier post how the product doesn&#x27;t work because your nails are still sticky. You have to finish the whole process by cleaning them with nail polish remover at the very end and they turn out perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine came to my house in a very timely manner and works flawlessly. Was very easy to set up and use. My children and I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Works quite well! Shipped quickly! Would recommend to anyone!  You have to install the bulbs when you receive it, which are included.</li>
    <li> This item arrived very quick.  It is larger than I had expected but meets my needs very well.  You are able to put two hands or feet in at the same time.  High quality product, I&#x27;d highly recommend for home or salon use.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome nail dryer!  Bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter who is a great nail technician!  She loves it!  Everything works just as described!  Both hands or feet fit comfortably in the unit and dry quickly to a hard and durable finish!  She said she would recommend this dryer to anyone that is serious about doing quality nails for themselves or others!</li>
    <li> I had a formal event that I had to attend unexpectedly, and my nails were NOT in good shape for it.  I went to a nail salon that my friend recommended and got a set of gel nails.  The nails looked great, and I was thrilled with the way mine were able to finally grow out with the extra strength the gel adds, but knew I would not keep them up at a cost of $40 every couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I googled the name of the polish the salon used (Gelish), and saw the products were available online.  I then started reading reviews for the UV lights, and this one had great reviews.  I decided to pull the trigger and buy the lamp and gels and try them myself at home.  I am NOT a nail tech, have absolutely no formal training, but am pretty handy at figuring things out.  The lamp arrived, I watched a couple of youtube videos of how to apply the gels, and jumped in.  I AM THRILLED WITH MY RESULTS!!!!!!  This UV light is awesome!!!!  It is big enough to fit both hands in at once, has several \\&quot;timer\\&quot; options for how long you want the light to run, and also has a fan you can turn on at the same time.  It looks great, seems solidly made, and I kid you not, my nails looked just as good as when I left the salon my first time!  I was so excited with how they looked that I had to go show my husband and teenage sons as well : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things I&#x27;d point out, they might be obvious to a professional, but for the other newbies like me, here they are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The bottom of the dryer swings open for ease in inserting the bulbs and removing the blue film.  I didn&#x27;t realize this until after I inserted the first few bulbs, MUCH easier with it opened up!&lt;br /&gt;-The instructions said to remove the blue film covering the mirror sides on the inside of the dryer.  I emailed the seller (Blue Novelties)to see if this also meant the \\&quot;floor\\&quot; and \\&quot;roof\\&quot; of the dryer or just the sides, they responded right away and said to also remove it from the top and bottom mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;-When using the foundation gel, I cured for 1 minute, that was enough&lt;br /&gt;-When using the lighter color (\\&quot;Glamour Queen\\&quot;), I cured for 2 minutes; when I applied the darker shades (\\&quot;Samuri\\&quot;, \\&quot;Black Cherry Berry\\&quot;) I cured for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-When I applied the shiny clear top coat, I cured 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-I used rubbing alcohol and a scrap of cotton fabric to remove the tackiness at the end, no need to purchase special lint free cloths or special tackiness remover. If you skip this step, your nails will not feel like they are cured, but they are!&lt;br /&gt;-To remove the nails, I just used 100% acetone (drugstore brand), put it on a cut up cotton ball and held to my finger with Grafco finger cots I ordered from Amazon.  This worked great, I didn&#x27;t want to soak my fingers in the acetone as it seems it would dry the skin out that way.&lt;br /&gt;-I did not use any special nail oils, just put lotion on my hands when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;-At about 10-12 days the nails start to show the unpolished area where they are growing out.  I just put a coat of regular nail polish close in color to the gel over the entire nail, and get an extra 5-7 days wear before I have to redo them.  I&#x27;m redoing the nails about every 3 weeks this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now done 3 sets of the nails over the course of 9 weeks, and I am THRILLED that I bought this!  No more trying to get an appointment that works with my schedule, and I&#x27;ve already saved enough to cover the purchase price.  I can take the nails off one night while watching TV, and do a new set right away or the next night while watching another show.  The lamp is quiet, looks great and works as promised.  It may not be the cheapest lamp out there, but I truly believe you get what you pay for, and this light is worth every penny. It gives salon quality results for a fraction of the price, and it saves you a ton of time, because you can cure both hands at once between coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this UV Light, and definitely this seller.  I always appreciate a quick reply to my questions if I&#x27;m not sure about how to use a product , and they replied right away.  I&#x27;ll try to post pictures of how my nails looked after doing this - I FINALLY have nails that grow out, and without the big \\&quot;ridge\\&quot; that the old-style acrylic nails left when growing out!uick reply to my questions if I&#x27;m not sure about how to use a product , and they replied right away.

    <li> This dryer works very well. It was easy to install the bulbs.  It&#x27;s easy to use also.  I am very pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it to do shellac nails at home. Works really well, really easy to use, nice results</li>
    <li> absolutly LOVE this !!!!  its much bigger than I thought and it works great.. I&#x27;m saving a lot of money now that I can do mine and my daughters nails.  Thanks !!</li>
    <li> Never really worked.  No help online.  Foolishly discarded the box, so couldn&#x27;t return it.  There are much better lights out there, read reviews very carefully.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed</li>
    <li> THis works great and dries the gel perfect.  I felt the price was reasonable and it wasn&#x27;t hard to figure out how to use it. This dryer is so big it&#x27;s hard to store but it works very well.  I&#x27;m looking forward to saving money and doing my own nails.</li>
    <li> This product enables me to do my own nails at home with a salon professional look.........I save a lot of money.</li>
    <li> The product was only used, three times, and needs a few new bulbs, already.</li>
    <li> Love it. Very good uv lamp I will recommend it to whoever needs a uv lamp. Nice nice uv lamp</li>
    <li> Works great! Has different timer settings, works awesome for doing my own gel polish at home! Great deal for this thing, it&#x27;s a monster! The size works great for when I want to do my toes too.</li>
    <li> I have used this several times since I bought it. It is simple to use and works perfectly&amp;#34;&amp;#34; love it. I am currently wearing a lacquer French Mani I did 2 weeks ago. Looks amazing. Only have to redo because growing out. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! I have recently got into this new Gel Nail Polish and YOU MUST use a UV Light for gel nails.  It works! Works quickly at that! I have had no issues with this and I have had it several months now.</li>
    <li> The different setting give you several choices. Why pay for a manicure in a salon when you get the same results with this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. It arrived on time, in great condition, and working properly. It is very affordable and convenient. Also pretty easy to travel with considering it&#x27;s weight. I strongly suggest anyone in need of a UV light purchase from this private carrier.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this product to work with my OPI Gel manicure polish. It&#x27;s easy to use, includes several different time settings and it&#x27;s large enough to fit both hands/feet.</li>
    <li> Worked great and she uses it to have the nails she likes at a fraction of the price. Good product</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my purchase of this light. Works perfectly for my in-home gel polish applications. I would highly recommend not only this product, but the seller as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, easy to operate and does the job. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I tried it for the first time last night and it worked great!  I love having my nails done with gel polish than regular polish because they always look shiny and professional which I could never do with just polish.  The dryer itself is easy to use and it dried my nails in no time.  I am so glad that I bought this dryer, it is everything they said it would be.  I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was hesitant about buying this UV lamp, but so far it has worked perfectly with my CND shellac colors. I&#x27;m very impressed and love that you can fit both feet or hands in at the same time. Also, the bulbs were a breeze to install, and the lamp started right up with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great quality product for doing shellac at home.</li>
    <li> This was the best investment ever!  I get a professional gel manicure without the cost of the salon prices!  Seller provided within timeframe and it was perfect!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great light, but it&#x27;s much heavier and larger than I expected.  Read the specs.</li>
    <li> The dryer works perfectly and it&#x27;s a great price. Would definitely recommend to those trying to save a few bucks doing their nails at home!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this nail dryer its large it dries relitavitley quick. It has a pleanty of room for both feet. (or hands) works great!</li>
    <li> I was worried about the lack of instructions when I opened my Nail Dryer. No need to have worried. This could not be simpler. Plus there a tons of videos to explan the application process. I&#x27;ve never had gel nails so I was a total rookie. My first time out the gate was a total success. My weak nails won&#x27;t know what hit them. I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll get tired of the color before this manicure wears out. I love being able to put my entire hand in the dryer. Saves time doing thumbs separately. Actually, both hands fit comfortably. This was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for a couple weeks now and I&#x27;ve been using it for myself as well as friends and family, I have no complaints whatsoever. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and it cures my gelish polish excellently. I love the timer options for how long you want the light on, there&#x27;s also a no time option where it just remains on and there is also a fan. It&#x27;s big enough so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about a tight space and you can use it for a pedicure if you so choose.</li>
    <li> This dryer is awesome I just received it this morning after only waiting a day. Its big, easy to clean. Great use for home and professional. Great performance definitely worth it best one I have used so far.</li>
    <li> I found this item to provide the ability to dry nails as promised.I liked the product and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I was confused reading completely different 5star &amp; 1star reviews... anyway, i bought it. I tried &amp; came to conclusion that 1stars are correct: it doesn&#x27;t dry the nails!!! but I researched &amp; found out that me &amp; all those who didn&#x27;t write good reviews just don&#x27;t know how to use it...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m putting 4 stars only because this lamp doesn&#x27;t have instructions with it, which would make it perfect &amp; everyone would be happy! because it has no instructions, many people use it in a wrong way &amp; write bad reviews or return the product.&lt;br /&gt;I will just give some instructions but u can search the web &amp; youtube &amp; find the right way to do shellac!!!&lt;br /&gt;1. have clean nails.&lt;br /&gt;2. put the base coat &amp; put your fingers into the lamp with the regime 120-180 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT!!! don&#x27;t touch your nails to make sure they are dry cause they are not &amp; it&#x27;s NORMAL!!! just CONTINUE with some patience!!!&lt;br /&gt;3. put the color and again dry with UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;4. put another layer of color to have better results with rich color and dry again.&lt;br /&gt;5. put the top coat &amp; dry again.&lt;br /&gt;and only now,&lt;br /&gt;6. put some alcohol on a cotton and wipe your fingers to remove the sticky thing.&lt;br /&gt;&amp; only now&lt;br /&gt;7. touch your fingers &amp; enjoy them!!!</li>
    <li> Shipped on time, arrived intact and well boxed.  This is a quality lamp.  We cure all types of gel with this lamp.</li>
    <li> This lamp is large enough for both hands and works well. I use with the Gelish system and my nails turn out hard and shiny every time. Price was competitive, product came quickly.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what was advertised ~ it arrived very quickly and I am most happy with the results I get when using it.</li>
    <li> i love it. it works awesome and is a descent size for my age since i am only 10 years old</li>
    <li> Great salon quality product.  It pays for itself after a few uses!  I love that it has a fan as well as the UV light, so I can use it even when I&#x27;m not using gel polish.  I received it quickly with no hassle. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Lights were easy to install, arrived on time, works well,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could use a 10 sec position on the timer but heck who can&#x27;t count to 10 .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large enough to do both hands or feet at the same time , bigger than most drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fan is so quite that you have to look at it to see if it is on. ( you can only see the blades when it is off  )</li>
    <li> The Royal Nail dryer now works great. When we first tried the dryer it would not work. After I checked the power cord and the fuse, I had determined that the fuse wasn&#x27;t any good. After going to several places I found a fuse, came home and put it in and turned the unit on, it worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;  Frank E. Fasolo Sr</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 17 year old daughter to use with Gellish products I also purchased on Amazon. We had no trouble installing the bulbs, although I was surprised there were no instructions in the box. So, we used the instructions on the Gellish kit. My daughter did her nails and mine. They came out beautiful! We have both received many compliments and I am very glad I chose this product!</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother, grandma and I to do our nails and save $. But my grandma is old fashion and likes talking to the nail person, and my mom felt it was too hot for her hands (thats normal btw) on all gel. I decided not worth it to keep for 1 person when we have no space to do our nails etc etc. But it works great btw. Powerful and Fast.</li>
    <li> This light is nearly identical to the one used in the nail salon I used to go too. It is very high quality, easy to use, and a great product for the price. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Not working properly !xxxx. Xxxxthe timer is not working properly,  I&#x27;d never buy this brand again,  not worth it period.</li>
    <li> I love this nail uv light.  It makes a manicure and pedicure lasts for 2 weeks beautifully and takes little to no time at all above regular polish.  I wished I had bought more for gifts!!!</li>
    <li> My order came quickly, in great shape and easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t compare to a salon manicure but so many advantages to doing it at home and not losing two hours at a salon.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it had good reviews. This is a larger sized dryer. All bulbs are included. They are easy to install. I have used it about 10 x and have not had any problems. It dries fast, but do follow directions for correct gel nail use for best results. The seller is trustworthy and I would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I enjoy getting my nails done but find it gets expensive.  I got this and in two uses I feel that I have gotten my money back in non salon visits.  It takes a little work to get the right amount of gel polish on but this light does a great job.  It has a high enough wattage that I do not have to sit for more than 90 seconds between coats of polish and it comes out just as durable as a salon visit.  I am extremely pleased with this dryer.  It was a little tricky putting the bulbs in but other reviewers gave me the tips I needed to accomplish it.  I have been using Gelish polish and it works very well with it.  I also got the uv protective gloves.  Since I have had to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my nails more often than every two weeks (while I was getting the hang of the amount of polish to use) I am glad I also got them.</li>
    <li> This is all that it promises.  Can easily put together.  Cures gel well. Easily put both hands under lights.  Easy to figure out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve used it 10+ times now, and it gets even easier and better quality as we have more experience with the polish (not getting it on skin or puddling it, not putting it on too thick). Also, we had to figure out that the stickiness after &amp;#34;curing&amp;#34; the nails is to be expected--don&#x27;t keep putting your nails under the lamp to remove the stickiness :)  The stickiness removes at the end with rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad we bought this particular product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It works very well and saves me a trip to the salon!  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift. She loves it, and as a young college grad just starting off in her career, she appreciates the money she saves by doing her nails at home.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice unit. It fits your hands and toes and works really well with my gel nailpolishes I&#x27;ve used (Fingerpaints and Gelish). The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because there was a bit of scratches on the inside of the unit when I got it. The damage wasn&#x27;t bad enough to make me send it back, but yeah, maybe it was a refurbished item I got, not sure. Good product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this same UV nail dryer for myself before Christmas and I love it. That said, I also know that when I received mine, I had to install the light bulbs and it came with an Owner&#x27;s Manual. I purchased this one for my sister in law&#x27;s birthday and when I received it, the sticker sealing the box looked tampered with so I opened it up. The light bulbs were already installed and there was no Owner&#x27;s Manual. So...is this one used? I am not sure...and I am tempted to return it...buyers beware!</li>
    <li> Bought this because of the reviews. Reviews were amazing and the price was awesome. So nice you can do both hands at once.</li>
    <li> She loves the nail dryer, and is able to do both hands at the same time. She is a nail technician and she uses it on her customers and they are very pleased with the results and the ease of use.</li>
    <li> If you love gel nails from the salon, this is for you! This takes five minutes to dry your nails and they are good to go for two weeks! My teenage daughter loves this and will never go back to traditional nail polish. If you love to have fingers and toes polished, get this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I am new to the gel nail process and bought this as a birthday present.  I really like it and have found it easy to use. I&#x27;m still learning about gel nails, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was getting.  I read other reviews and found them helpful in making my decision. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase the gel system to do myself rather than go to salon but it was the best decision. Everyone thinks I still go to salon yet I do it myself  out of the convenience of my home at my own time. This dryer is the best by far, even better than the salon one. NO REGRETS,,,,and you won&#x27;t  have any regrets either if you purchase from this seller!!</li>
    <li> I bought this UV light because I was tired of paying a salon to do it for me. All in all, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this light. I just wanted to point out a couple things about this light for those considering buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This is a UV light. Some gel polishes are made fo UV light, and some are made for LED. That said, UV lights are supposed to be able to cure most types of gel polishes regardless. I&#x27;ve tried OPI, Gelish, China Glaze, and Sensationail&#x27;s gel polishes with the Royal Nails UV light and found that it will cure them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Be aware of the size. This is a double sized light so that both of your hands, or both of your feet can dry at once. It&#x27;s much bigger than the single sized one that you might be familiar with from the salon. This isn&#x27;t a big deal to be but if you want to take it with you anywhere it&#x27;s a bit clunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Although UV lights are supposed to cure in about 2 minutes I have found that this light takes a little longer than that. I typically have to leave it in for about 4 minutes for it to cure properly. I&#x27;m not sure why but if I only leave it in for 2 minutes my nails tend to be left feeing a little tacky.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this product I would definitely recommend this item for anyone who is interested . In having an excellent product at a great price!! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grown daughter and she is very pleased with it. She can dry the polish on both hands at the same time in about 15 minutes. I&#x27;m going to get one for my granddaughter for her birthday.</li>
    <li> Works very well with the gelish brand top foundation and nail polish. Yoh can do both hands at a time, it&#x27;s big enough for 2 hands</li>
    <li> I like the dryer, but after doing manicure a couple of times, I wish I went with a smaller one hand nail UV polish dryer like I see in the salons (Essie and OPI). They both have touch sensors inside so when you put your hand back in, timer goes on and you can see the seconds count down on the display on top. Drying 2 hands at the same time is not a good idea, since gel polish doesn&#x27;t set until you dry it for 60-90 seconds under the lamp so you simply cannot apply gel polish if your other hand nails are wet. Also when you turn your hand, polish tends to run to the side of hand which is pointing down. I discovered that it is best to put your hand flat the entire time until gel or shellac is completely dry, which is best done one hand at a time. I this dryer is a good product when you have a friend doing your manicure.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Better than the one used at my nail salon. Whisper quiet. Easy to use and setup.I have only done one set of gel nails but they came out perfect! I used one coat gelish 90 sec cure, 1 coat Gel Color 90 sec and 1 top coat for 180 sec( for good measure) and it cam out wonderful! Its kinda big because it is able to accommodate two hands or two feet. Wonderful unit.</li>
    <li> I left my nails under there for an hour and they still were not dry. Just gave up. Hope they air dry.</li>
    <li> I use fake nails on my right hand as I am a guitar player.  I started with a small 9 watt system, but found it inadequate for my needs.  It took 30 minutes to cure the nails.  I purchased the 54 Watt Royal Nails Professional Dryer device.  It cured my nails within 2 minutes.  I like the fan feature as it keeps your fingers cool while the intense heat from the 54 Watts does the curing.  The device offers various time settings.  You could easily place both hands in the oven at the same time.  You could do the same with your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it twice now with very good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.  I accidentally ordered two kits.  I sent one of them back.  The customer service was excellent.  They immediately reimbursed  me.  The return process from Amazon is efficient.</li>
    <li> Salon quality nails at home. I love this!!</li>
    <li> The product seems to be well-built. I love the fact that I can cure both hands or both feet at the same time -- cuts time in half.  The bulbs are easy to insert.  I&#x27;m really happy I chose this product instead of the others I researched!</li>
    <li> Love my new uv light.  A great investment I would recommend this product to future buyers. I&#x27;ve already used it more than a dozen times.  Thank you</li>
    <li> The size of this was great to fit both hands at once but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the uv bulbs...the nail polish kept smearing maybe it was just me but it was not for me</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it!! Works great. Saves me so much time and money. Note: base coat for shellac only needs 20 Seconds to cure. Other coats only needed two minutes! Someone else wrote tips that helped tremendously. I used her suggestions and this is all I have to add. Great product 👍👍</li>
    <li> Big enough for both hands comfortably! I wish it displayed the time so u know how much time is left  but over all, love it</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised.  My polish lasts longer and looks better and takes less time to apply.  Love this!  Be sure to buy the UV gloves.</li>
    <li> I can get both of my hands in it at the same time which saves me a bunch of time.  It feels light and a little cheap but that doesn&#x27;t matter as long as the lights keep working.  I have already used it about 10 times and so far so good.</li>
    <li> Works great for gel.  I have been using Red Carpet products and cures perfectly 3 min each coat. It&#x27;s also nice that I can do both feet at the same time too!!</li>
    <li> This product really does the job of drying nails quickly and also allows you to do both hands at once. Great product and thanks for the accurate description.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic!  I&#x27;ve only had a few manicures and love the gel manicures but I honestly just hate paying so much.  I bought this and wanted to see how it worked before writing a review but I am already sold.  I painted my nails two weeks ago today and I don&#x27;t have one chip.  I type a lot every day for work and could not keep my nails painted without having to touch up daily.  This is so, so easy and I did both hands and toes in no time.  I use the base coat, two coats of gel and the top coat.  I found written instructions online for the best way to do a gel manicure and followed their advice.  I would encourage anyone that is thinking about buying this to do so.  Two weeks and not one chip?!  Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Nail dryer works very well, haven&#x27;t come across any issues so far and I&#x27;ve used it twice now. The fan moves slower than expected, but this is my first UV nail dryer so I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I was expecting. The lights are Very bright!! (Must wear UV protection glasses and finger-less gloves!! - from the two uses without gloves I feel like my hands have aged). Love the timer options, and Speedy delivery - arrived within 2 days! Will purchase from this seller in the future.&lt;br /&gt; As long as you know how to paint your own nails, then this product is absolutely worth the savings from a nail studio. I also bought a UV gel base and top coat pair by Gelish for about ~$21. You don&#x27;t need to spend money on Gel nail polish, just use your own between both Gel base and top coats. Make sure all layers are fully dry otherwise the top coat will shrivel the underlying nail coats if they&#x27;re not fully dry - ugly results! So, Use very minimal applications of paint/gel.</li>
    <li> Great light, I received the light within one week. It was in original packaging. I have on &#x27;ll y used it once, but it worked just as expected!</li>
    <li> Just wish there has been instructions on how to do nails as thus was new to us. YouTube instructions helped.</li>
    <li> now my nails look like I&#x27;ve been to the salon.  Paid for itself in 2 uses. now I can do my nails at home and save some money,  Like the fact that if needed in the future,I can get replacement UV light replacements.</li>
    <li> I do like the Royal Nail UV light, works for me each time.</li>
    <li> Not happy the machine is no good does not completely dry nails. Paint does not stay on nails fall of with in minutes</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy setup and a quick hassle free dry. Looking forward to saving money and doing my own nails!</li>
    <li> well they do. I go this one because its cheaper, and I though why would the brand matter, whats different about 54 watts in one brand or another, well this didnt cure my polish even after 5 minutes (rather than the 2 that are required by directions) got the CND one and it worked exactly like it should.</li>
    <li> Works great for gel/shellac nails - a lot cheaper than going to the salon every couple weeks!  Received the package promptly and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy and satisfied with this uv lamp it cures&lt;br /&gt;My nails in the amount of seconds it says&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this uv lamp</li>
    <li> Love It.  My polish dries in no time.  I use it for regular polish, gel polish and gel extensions.  Love that it fits both hands at same time.  Saves me time and money from going to the salons!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because, compared to some other products, this one seems REALLY big - bigger than it looks, like a small toaster oven.  It works really well and is easy to assemble and use. It&#x27;s really great if you have the space. I put a towel over it during use to keep from staring at the UV light coming out of it.</li>
    <li> Thanks to the info/tips I read in the reviews, I was able to pry open the clips on the  bottom to insert the lamps which went in easily. There is room for improvement with the clips as they are very hard to move. The instructions for operation are minimal so again I referred to the info on the reviews which helped. I tested it and it seems to work.  This should dry faster than the old one I have now that still works. Had great communication  with the company.</li>
    <li> works very well, bulbs were easy to install once I read the directions and opened the unit, you can do both hands or both feet at once and the mirrored interior makes it so you can do your thumbs and other fingers together.  My friends love it too, great for gel nail manicure parties.</li>
    <li> This lamp is large enough to fit both hands at once, which I appreciate because one bulb did not work when I received it (this is the only reason for 4 out of 5 stars). The large size allowed me to still use the lamp with no problems until I was able to purchase a new bulb (reasonably priced at local beauty outlet).  Cures quickly and just as well as any professional lamp.  I was very nervous about making this purchase without direction from a professional, but have been very pleased with my purchase. Would absolutely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and fast delivery. As soon as it came. I opened the box and used it right away. I am very pleased at the quality and excellent results i have had. I highly recomend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Terrible light. Used the products recommended and followed directions. Didn&#x27;t dry nails right and just left a slimy mess</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;texpecting much for the price but they proved me wrong. It&#x27;s quite and has a fan with a light. I love it:-)</li>
    <li> After trying Gel Polish manicures at a salon I decided I really liked the product. I didn&#x27;t want to pay the $25-$30 every two to three weeks though. So I decided to investigate purchasing the products and doing my nails at home. When I saw this lamp on Amazon I thought WOW, What a Deal! It has five different time settings, plus a fan. I really like that I can cure both hands at the same time! I&#x27;m thrilled with my purchase. It&#x27;s a high quality lamp at a GREAT price too! It&#x27;s much better than the lamps at the salon! If anyone is on the fence about purchasing this lamp, I highly recommend it. The top does open for easy installation of the bulbs. There are tabs on the bottom of the lamp that you push that allows the lamp to open. Install the bulbs, remove the blue protective coating &amp; you&#x27;re good to go! You can have the look of beautiful nails without a trip to the salon and without the additional $.</li>
    <li> I love this lamp!! My mini took forever to cure my nails but with this it took less than 30 minutes to do my nails. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely happy with the size of this nail dryer! I no longer have to do just one hand or just one foot. I can put both my hands or both feet in at the same time. You can either use it for gel drying or just drying regular nail polish! It has 6 UV bulbs that equal 54 Watts for the same power you get at the salon!! I can now do the same thing they do at the salon for less money and no wait ;)</li>
    <li> Great Gel light. It is bulky but works great!</li>
    <li> I love that I was able to buy it for the price I did.  I have used it several times and find it works great!  I am very pleased with the buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp to use with the ibd gel nail polish, and I&#x27;m so happy beause It really works greaT!!! the only thing, it&#x27;s huge!!! for both hands and feet...... good thing about it, you will finish quickly.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the purchase!&lt;br /&gt;I like the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> We received the product in a timely fashion with all parts included. I was pleasantly surprised with the alacrity of the order. Excellent job! keep it up!</li>
    <li> I have an issue I still haven&#x27;t heard back.  Two of the bulbs are broken out of the six. Everything else works how can we fix this.  I just need two bulbs replaced that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> This light works just as expected. I used it with the gellish nail polish and it cured the polish just fine. Big enough to put both hands or feet in.  It&#x27;s a little larger than what I had pictured, but seems to function great.</li>
    <li> I received this nail dryer on Monday and couldn&#x27;t wait to do my nails. It did an excellent job curing my shellaced nails. I was so pleased with my result that I spread the word among my gals and we arranged a girls night. Needless to say all 5 of my girlfriends left home with shellaced manicures. The nail dryer worked great without interruptions and the fan is a great feature for times when UV light isn&#x27;t needed. I see many girl nights in my future :)&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who, ONE -wants to have nice quality salon like nails and TWO -save money. .. Personally, no more pricey nail charges for me. The sky&#x27;s the limit  with no charge on how creative I want to get with my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad that I read and compared MANY reviews on different nail dryers and I am pleased to know that I made a great purchase</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it says it works with CND shellac. I&#x27;ve tried several times now but the shellac never cures.</li>
    <li> Got the light within 3 days of ordering it. Supe easy to assemble and use. Slightly larger than expected but overall a great product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s huge but I love it - I really like that you can use it to cure several different types of nails and polish so no worries there. So Far I have used CND - Creative Nail Design Shellac and Harmony Gelish Polish and I used them together once - fine just different timings. Both my feet can fit in at the same time - It&#x27;s wonderful! So nice to have great looking nails ALL the time! I feel more professional and put together. It makes doing your nails worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I usually go to the nail salon every two weeks to get my nails done and redone. I was so sick of spending money every time I wanted my nails done so I bought this. I am so excited about this machine. It works so well and my nails look just as good as they would if I went and had them done in a salon. This is the best thing anyone who loves their nails could buy.&lt;br /&gt;I use Sally Henson gel polish and it works great with this dryer.</li>
    <li> Does the job well, and it didn&#x27;t cost all that much. I definitely recommend to someone wanting to do their own gel nails at home.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great size, works wonderful. Large enough to do my toes too. Never go to the salon anymore. Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Good price for this product. It worked well. Used it as a gift for my wife. Good idea for her guys.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my friend an early Christmas present. She couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. It is large in size, big enough for both feet to easy fit comfortably. She loves it!!! There are cheaper models out there but in this case the few extra dollars are worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Wasn&#x27;t sure at first if I want an LED or a UV Light so happy I went with this Light!</li>
    <li> This item is salon quality and exactly as described. My daughters and I will defiantly get many good uses out of this product.</li>
    <li> Did research when my wife and daughter wanted to do at home gel polish and shellac. I saw a lot of good comments about this unit and decided to purchase. Well, bottom line, they both love it. Product works exactly as advertised, they relly like the size allowing both hands or feet, and the uv lights are powerful enough to use whatever polish they choose!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this and I read the instructions given by someone else who also bought this product and I am so happy I did. I am a Cosmetologist and I also love to do nails but its a challenge and I started doing gel nails but did not have my own UV light so I looked at the reviews and ordered it and now I have increased my sales and I have only had this product less than 5 days as of date! It does not have instructions but is large enough to do Both hands and Feet. I am glad I made the choice to buy this product and I HIGHLY Recommend Everyone to buy this! You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I have been doing nails for years, this is the second light I have purchased from royal nails, not because it was broken but it almost just as cheap to get a new light rather than replace the bulbs. Light works FAST, QUIET and very BIG. Best light I have ever had. Worth much more than what I paid. You will not find a better quality light for a better deal. I have had many many other lights that broke or didn&#x27;t work very well so have lots to compare it to. I had tried to order another one a few months ago but they had to stock in and my heart was broken! So glad they got more in!</li>
    <li> I purchased it as a gift for my daughter and she loved it. She has the gel polish and extras to go with it, and raves about it.</li>
    <li> This item is great!  I use it all the time. I can do both hands  at once shortening the time.&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Great vendor!</li>
    <li> Works great. I was paying $60 every 2 weeks to get my nails done. Now I do them myself. Save so much money</li>
    <li> There is an unbelievable number of these nail dryers on the market.  Most of them are no good and have to low a wattage.  This Royal product works great with 54 watts and fits two hands at once.  The UV light bulbs were easy to install.  It is like a professional model and better than they have in nail salons.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and daughter. Wife seems to like it. Works better than air drying. Did what we thought. Probably better for acrylic nails. Novelty for us.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try doing my nails at home because I hate paying to go to the salon.  This nail light works great with the Gelish system, which I also ordered.  The results are fabulous!  My nails have never looked so good and it is so easy!  This will definitely pay for itself after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> The machine is a monster and after all, it does not cured the nail polish.  It was a waste of money and time. Don&#x27;t buy this headache, the box is the prettiest thing it has.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer a few weeks ago and absolutely LOVE it. I&#x27;ve used it a few times on both my hands and feet for no chip gel &amp; shellac polish. The dryer is large enought to dry both hands or both feet at the same time! It&#x27;s easy to use, very quiet and works perfectly. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a professional grade machine. It comfortably fits both hands or feet inside it.  You have to clip in the bulbs on your own but it is very easy to do so. Just don&#x27;t forget to take off the blue layer on the mirror. Flip the device upside-down and you will be able to pop off the bottom, take off the blue film and easily place in bulbs.</li>
    <li> This dryer works great. I can put both of my hands, including thumbs, in the machine at once. Dries nail quickly and thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an amazing value! Nail crazy daughter LOVES it!</li>
    <li> I really like my royal nail dryer &amp; curer. The product is very easy to use.  Worth the price. Putting on the shellac takes pactice, but the nail dryer has a large open area for hands or feet.</li>
    <li> Love this item, works well, great price!  I work as a nail technician and thought because of the pricing it would not work as well as the expensive lights/dryersm, but I was wrong, this product exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this light. I puchased a Gelish top and base coat. I used a regular nail polish. After I ran the last light cycle they were still tacky to touch. I decided to try a different tactic so I got my acetone nail polish remover and an it over my sticky nails and it took all the tacky away and left a super shiny depth of color. Very easy and quick with this light. Easy to use and understand. Choice of time and the fan works well with my regular polish.</li>
    <li> I am having so much fun using this!!  So far I&#x27;ve bought a lot of Gelish polishes and they work great.  I haven&#x27;t tried any other gel brand yet.</li>
    <li> Pleased with purchase and product function as expected.  Very good product, description, ship and overall transaction.  Thank you and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
    <li> I love this light! IMO it is too many time options. Really 3 minutes should be good for each coat but I love this light for when im rushed and need to do 2 hands at a time</li>
    <li> This item last night was for $49 and  there were a few others to choose from around same price.  Was going to buy it and gloves, was getting late and I was tired and had to get up for work, so got on to order today after work and says and says its now  $148 and the only one left. WOW, is that a rip off or what. Do I have STUPID on my forehead, maybe they thought I would just add to cart and not notice. Too bad, was going to buy it today along with the gloves for daughters b-day. Guess I will keep browsing - PRETTY SHADY and JUST WRONG to try and do people that way.</li>
    <li> Received first machine that didn&#x27;t work and looked used.  Returned the first and ordered again because of the reviews.  New one works great and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> a real professional machine. just like the ones used in nail salons. love the timer and fan. lightweight so easy to move around.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what it was said to be, works great. Plenty of room for feet or your hands. You will like it.</li>
    <li> Good quality uv light and I wish it could dry faster and nicer then it would be better for my nails</li>
    <li> First one that was delivered was totally broken. Every lightbulb was cracked. Glass everywhere.  The unit itself was scratched and looked used.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement unit was in good condition and works as stated.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST INVESTMENT FOR MY NAILS THAT I COULD OF EVER MADE!!! I SAVED MYSELF MONEY DOING MY NAILS ON MY OWN, AND THIS UV LIGHT IS THE BEST!!!</li>
    <li> excellent! i feel like a pampered princess when using this right in my home. i hate air drying my nails; i always end up with dents in them but this drys them well and i didn&#x27;t have that issue anymore. thanks :)</li>
    <li> LED lights are so much faster and easier to use!  This took 4 to 5 min per coat.</li>
    <li> This UV light works great. It is just like what you would be using at a salon. Very very impressed!</li>
    <li> This light is awesome! Doing my own nails at home has saved SO much money - its so worth investing the $100 for all the supplies after three times doing it yourself it pays for itself. Definitely have nail polish remover and watch YouTube tutorials though - really helps to learn how to best do them</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is awesome.  Works very well and I recommend it to anyone in the market for a nail dryer.</li>
    <li> This lamp is saving me money on my manicures.  I now do my own nails at home, get better results and I also don&#x27;t have to endure the chatter and wait times in the salon.  I like that I can put both hands in to cure at the same time saving even more time. I would recommend this product over and over.  The only thing that was missing from the instructions was how many minutes to use but a quick search on You Tube gave me full instructions. Very good purchase.</li>
    <li> When following instructions correctly it works great! It took me a few tries before I got the hand on it, and now I am happy with the money and time savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the detailed reviews that helped me perfect the process!!</li>
    <li> Just like at the salon!</li>
    <li> I used to go to the nail salon to get gel polish for my nails every two weeks and it costs $40 (plus the tip).  This Dryer is great!  But remember that the bottom of the device will open so putting the lights in and removing the cover on the mirrors is very easy.  I&#x27;ve done my nails several times and they look just as good as if I went to the salon!  I don&#x27;t know if the machine has anything to do with this but I&#x27;ve found that Gelish polish products don&#x27;t work with well with Opi base and top coat.  But using Opi products together give you a wonderful outcome.  My nails cure quickly but you have to cure at least 90 seconds for EACH step.  And like another buyer&#x27;s statement that your nails will feel wet between steps is correct so don&#x27;t touch them until you&#x27;ve cured the top coat.  Then just wipe with alcohol and your nails will be dry, shiny and beautiful.  A great buy for the money and fun to do because you can afford to change your polish more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a few weeks after getting my machine.  I really wanted to come back and add my experience with Blue Novelities.  One of my bulbs blew so I sent them an email out to ask about how I could get replacement bulbs.  A few days later, I receive a box from them that contained two brand new bulbs! No cost for the bulbs or shipping!  Now, that&#x27;s exceptional customer service.  I also got a follow up email asking about my satisfaction.  Blue Novelties deserves a thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This dryer leaves my gel nails so hard and smooth that they stay for weeks! I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Instructions WERE included in box. Four or five steps all spelled out and diagramed for you. Super easy to put together. Took no more than a minute it get it up and running. Buttons are self explanatory and took 15 seconds to play with to figure it out.  I can&#x27;t believe people are asking operating and installation questions.  It is pretty darn big but I enjoy being able to paint both hands or both feet then dry together. Saves time!!  Using CND shellac base,color,and top coat on hands and regular polish on toes. Light worked great for shellac. Used fan for toes.  It&#x27;s a nice quiet gentle fan that does not give those nasty bubbles you get when doing your nails and the house air or a ceiling fan is blowing. My nails look better than when I had them done in salon.  I am sure it is a combo of this excellent light and the freshness if the CND Shellac I just got off amazon as well.  The salons manacures were looking very thick and watery ripples were on my nails.  I thought perhaps my nails were ruined because of multiple shellacs and the acetone or filing required on your nail, causing waves/uneven surface on my nail bed. NOT the case. It was totally the product in the salon being either old or too thick....also those bottles are opened over and over for use on various people. They will get older faster than mine will.  Back to the light: I see nothing wrong with it. It seems very high quality.  And the light feels strong and intense on your skin.  Concerns me a bit about the uv light on my hands. I think I&#x27;ll get some of those fingerless gloves you see while shopping for supplies to shellac your nails.</li>
    <li> About 2 months ago, I purchased this after I got my 1st shellac manicure at a local nail salon.  My nails are thin &amp; peel.  I don&#x27;t like the thickness of acrylic or solar nails.  This product allows me to have nail polish that lasts for 2 weeks (and I work in the yard &amp; garden).  This product works as well as the one in the nail salon.  I&#x27;ve very satisfied with it &amp; would recommend it.</li>
    <li> i purchased this back in January and I have to say this is by far the best lamp I have had. I have used the sally Hansen light and that takes entirely too long to do a gel manicure because only four fingers can go in at a time. With this lamp u have a fan which u can use to dry your regular polish. I love love love this lamp!</li>
    <li> Love it . Its a great product, trust me you&#x27;ll like it too. Try i .</li>
    <li> I loved the machine its big and easy to use but the problem is the light burned out way fast it only lasted me a month and so upset and the lights are expensive but loved it over all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this light for gelish because i was tired of using 2 36w lamps and it works just perfect! I also use ibd uv gel and It only takes 1 min to cure. Very good lamp id recomend buying this for any salon. Ive even got my co-worker to purchase one the following wk.</li>
    <li> it is really worth the money, looks very profesional good for home or hair salon. i am really enjoying it.</li>
    <li> This curing light is awesome! I have only used it on regular color so far and it hasn&#x27;t even chipped on my very weak nails. I can&#x27;t imagine how long the gel color will last. The strength is the highest I have found for non-commercial grade, although I think it&#x27;s what my salon uses anyway. I bought this one right away because of the strength and the price. It is cheaper than the weaker one I had that I didn&#x27;t like as much.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product I would recommend this to any one who does nails it is awesome!  Priced right also, thank you!</li>
    <li> The product worked as described and was easy to use even for me a beginner like me, I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after I got a regular manicure at a salon but they had me use a similar dryer between each coat of polish.  It made my manicure last several days longer so I thought why not try this at home?  I prefer doing my own nails anyway for cost savings and regular color changes.  Overall it is a great product - fan could be a bit stronger but it gets the job done.  I plan on getting one for my sister for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Fits both hands or feet. Bulbs go in easily because the top is hinged. Has a timer and fan. Only bad thing is that the shortest amount of time on the timer is 90 seconds.</li>
    <li> I am just beginning to do my own gel nails at home. It is well worth the investment! My daughter and I both do our nails now and we are definitely saving a lot of money. Initial investment in products required  may seem high but when all is said cost is the same as regular nail polish. Wish I had done this sooner!</li>
    <li> Nice to have salon nails at such a low one time purchase price! This is a great machine and does the job superbly! It is nicer than the ones I have seen in the salons. Super smooth transaction, would recommend and would use again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> When this arrived we found broken glass in it. The mirrors were severely scratched. The unit itself was gouged. We got a full refund and threw it away as it was going to cost more to replace the missing/broken bulbs than the unit was worth.</li>
    <li> This came in today, and there weren&#x27;t any pictures or videos that I could find to show what it looks like. It&#x27;s so smooth. It is a white rounded model with a very large opening for hands or feet but not so large that you lose a lot of light. And the fan is cut out of the top in a very unique slit design that only adds to the look. This dryer is the best thing that I have found for under $300 but I went to their website and they normally sell for $269.51 USD so this is the best of the best all around and best cost! It&#x27;s also one of the most powerful at 54 watts. To give you an idea, the Gelish mini uv battery operated light that I originally bought was 9 watts and it was over $20. I&#x27;m so excited to use this for years to come. That other junk light I have (as I found out later it was my light, I thought gelish polishes were junk) wasn&#x27;t curing all the way. So, I would take about 2 hours to put on a set of gelish only for it to look less than desireable and it would start falling off in whole pieces the next day. This dryer should take care of all that for me. This light is professional grade and I am so lucky to have found it. Where I live, the average gel set for hands or feet runs about $35.00. That means three salon trips cost DOUBLE what this dryer does! I know not everyone with this dryer uses Gelish because it&#x27;s also geared for acrylics, regular polish, and different shellac brands but my polishes run about $10 a bottle on here, and who knows how many manicures I will get with those bottles and this light. I&#x27;ll probably save thousands of dollars a year now. Also, this has cut hours and hours out of applications. Ladies, if this light is in your budget DON&#x27;T MISS OUT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;I was finally able to use this light with my gelish set and it made all the difference. I had previously thought gelish was junk because it would peel off after a day and some of it would wipe off with the final cleanse. This light completely cured it and I must honestly say I&#x27;ll be using this light along with shellac forever. No more damaging acrylics and awful polish! I love my results and if this one dies I&#x27;ll be ordering another.y I&#x27;ll be using this light along with shellac forever. No more damaging acrylics and awful polish! I love my results and if this one dies I&#x27;ll be ordering another.</li>
    <li> This product is great!!!&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price spent! Will recommend this product to anyone, whether it be any individual doing their own nails at home, or professionally!!&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use, and very convenient. Not to mention it is very wide, fits both hands or both feet well at the same time!!&lt;br /&gt;Clear buttons to specify how long the light and/or fan stay on as well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++++ ITEM!!</li>
    <li> This dryer is like that of a salon quality, packaged well with the bulbs wrapped seperate to ensure that they arrive at your doorstep safety. Dryer is easy to use for anyone in the home even if you are doing your own nails. Many timed options, includes a fan setting and is simple to set up. So glad I did my research on this product. It cures my Gelish nails and gives them a great shine! I wouldn&#x27;t have gone any other way with ordered, you cannot beat the price. It is a STEAL compared to those salon prices or other similar dryers online. Gelish wanted over $300.00 for their dryer and the others in this price range are not nearly as nice- with this many options- and can do both hands if you&#x27;d like. Plus this shape enables you to do feet if you like!!</li>
    <li> This works amazingly! It&#x27;s fast and effective...my girls love it! We were able to not only do one hand but both at the same time! Same goes for the toes!</li>
    <li> This was a gift but the product is large enough to fit both hands or feet in at the same time. The wattage is also very high for quicker drying. Product works well!</li>
    <li> Very good and professional looking. Very easy to use. Perfect for gel  nails. Love it. Save time comparing to small.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my twin teenage daughters and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. They love doing their nails but don&#x27;t have the patience to let them dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was the answer! They have used it almost everyday on their hands and feet with great results. We don&#x27;t use gel polish, just regular nail polish and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw several other products like this, but chose to go with this one because II wanted salon quality at home...and i truly believe that is what we got..or better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth the price. No cons here for us.</li>
    <li> Excellent company to do business with! This is a great product! To be quite honest, I was even more impressed once I opened the item. It is high quality and more then a satisfying purchase. Furthermore, it exceeds my expectations, which I was reluctant (Initially)due to it being such a good price. I would definitely recommend to anyone who does nails for a living or even someone who&#x27;s trying to save money and do their own nails at home. This is a great product that saves you time, which is priceless!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for at home gel manicures.  It&#x27;s worth th emney to get one that can fit both your hands.  I&#x27;m finished with my gel manicure in 15 minutes or less.</li>
    <li> By now I have given myself 3x &amp;#34;gelish&amp;#34; manicures and get better than salon results thanks to all those online tutorials. They last easily 12 days and I change it only because the nails grow out too far or I might have chopped off some edges while cooking. ;) Very pleased with the lamp so far in combination with the gelish products. Only thing is that the size is a little overkill for me. Both hands (or feet) would fit at once and I only paint one hand after the other. Oh well,...looks impressively professional when everything is put in place on the table. ;) I would definitely recommend it, but next time I would look for the same power with half the size for my home.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lamp because i saw that it was one of the top rated on Amazon.  I got an amazing deal on it right before the holidays and feel like it was steal for the quality.  I think initially, just looking at the advertised picture, I though this thing was going to be for just one hand at a time (therefore pretty small).  But, it is a lot larger than I thought and you can put two hands in it at a time.  I purchased the Royal UV protection gloves separately and they are nice to use with this.  Did an amazing job drying my nails, I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to do my nails at home and it does a great job, a bit bigger than I expected, but it does do both hands or feet at once!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, the preset timers are self explanitory. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and it works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this to save time &amp; money by doing my own gel polish. After noticing my job didn&#x27;t last near as long as my salon I was told by my nail tech that LED lamps are the best which explains some issues I&#x27;ve had with this uv lamp. Also, removing the polish is a huge nightmare but worth it to me since my nail salon charges $10 to remove gel polish. If I need my nails to dry fast and look nice for a few days I will use this otherwise I don&#x27;t bother because I never get close to 2 weeks like I do from a professional job.This was a good price for the product but I will most likely sell it and purchase the OPI LED professional model only because I like to do my nails and if I&#x27;m going to use gel which is hard on your nails I want the polish to last which is why I use it in the first place. This isn&#x27;t a bad lamp just OK. I also want to note that I use all OPI gel products, the base coat, top coat and color (funny bunny is my fav).  Hope this helps for anyone on the fence.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item back in April. I wanted to wait at least a month after use before I wrote my review. I love this nail dryer. I&#x27;m able to do my hands and feet and be done with my nails within an hour. Which is really good because before I had the nail dryer to make sure my nails were COMPLETELY dry I had to sit down with my hands and feet propped up for at least two hours. This dryer saved me time and stress. Now I can polish my nails and not worry about assuming that my nails are dry and go on about my everyday activities with no mess ups. The only thing that caught me by surprise was the size of the dryer. Imagine, It&#x27;s like the size of a shoe box( for men shoes) so it would be bulky to travel with. I guess....</li>
    <li> Bought this to do Gel Polish at home.  I have had no issues with the machine, I can say I am not sure what all the bottons do, I just found the one I need for setting my polish.  Going forward I would probably get a LED just because of the UV exposure issue.  Arrived timely and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This light does not work! Nails do not dry.</li>
    <li> Excellent nail dryer for 1/4 the cost of the same quality dryer I purchased for my daughter...thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I bought this in mid April and it is now June 3 but one of six bulbs is totally dead and a second is flickering out. I only use it once a week on myself so the use is minimal. Added to that, when it arrived one of the two clips on the bottom that hold it together was broken upon arrival.</li>
    <li> worked great the first few times, but now three of the bulbs are burned out. Seems like they should last longer than a handfull of sessions!</li>
    <li> This is not some wimpy little lamp that you have to cure each coat for 6-8 minutes, this is the same lamp they use at the nail salon. Cures each coat in 2-3 minutes, works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had for over a year.  No problems.  Make sure you keep the package for the light bulbs.  I&#x27;ve not had to replace, but they look like they would be difficult to find.  I use with the CND Shellac.</li>
    <li> It seems to live up to the good reviews I read online. I have only used it once but it seems great.</li>
    <li> I was suprised at how large this item is. It works well to dry both feet at the same  time,and i like that.&lt;br /&gt;The only dissapointment for me is that there are no instructions for how long to dry gel or shellac nails.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it is great!</li>
    <li> Love it....there is a learning curve....I found it helpful to have cuticles REALLY healthy and apply THIN coats!!</li>
    <li> Product works great. I didn&#x27;t realize how large it is. I was hoping for a smaller salon size one. This one does both hands at the same time but I don&#x27;t need that feature doing nails myself but otherwise works great.</li>
    <li> Received quickly and as described - very pleased</li>
    <li> I stopped acrylic nails years ago because they wreck my natural nails, which are pretty flimsy to begin with, if you will pardon my dangling participle.  Since I work so much with my hands, my nails are constantly getting snaggly (is that a word?), so I succumbed to a few gelish manicures after reports that it doesn&#x27;t affect your nails.  Good news, bad news, is that it doesn&#x27;t wreck your nails as much as acrylics, but it does affect them.  Nonetheless, they look fabulous in the meantime and I no longer have fingernails that could model for a scraping-out-of-a-buried-alive-box from a B-movie. I just did my first at-home gelish manicure with this lamp, and it works great.  Other than being old and shaky and having to do a bit of edge cleanup, I did a pretty good job.  And I do feel more secure in cleaning the edges with a manicure stick as compared to the girl that preferred using her long, heaven knows how many other nail beds it scraped, fingernail. There are some very good tutorials on youtube. I followed the one by Sally Beauty supply, but was able to do my whole hands at once, rather than doing the thumbs separately as they suggested.</li>
    <li> Once cleaned and prepared gel polish is easy, professional looking, and quick. No more pitched applications... almost, go lite and avoid polish getting on cuticles and around nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to do touch-ups in as little as 10 minutes, and know they are done, is a big plus. Gel also is harder and holds up longer, so glad I invested in this to get started.</li>
    <li> I have had this nail dryer for a few weeks now and so far it works great!! Sets nail very quickly and the fan is a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on the schedule date and has saved me a lot of money in the long run. It works very well and is easy to operate. After reading some reviews I thought it was going to be a task to install the light bulbs but it was fairly easy. Overall satisfied with my purchase and will recommend to family &amp; friends.</li>
    <li> works great!!!... now to master the gel polish.. I used it with the jamberry decal nail polish.. worked awesome, and then I tried the gel polish with the base coat,paint, top coat.. all I got was a sticky mess.. most likely operator error..lol, but the light itself is great!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to save money and it has done just that. I can change my nail color as often as I want.&lt;br /&gt;and my nails look good all of the time. I have had no problems with the unit. I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The polish takes a longer time to dry than what it says.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bigger in size than I expected it to be but it does fit both hands at the same time very well (or both feet). It works well and was a reasonable price. I would definitely recommend if you are looking to save time by curing both hands at the same time. I sort of wish that I went with a more compact UV light because it&#x27;s easier to store but the smaller ones only fit one hand at a time so they both have pros and cons. If this is what you&#x27;re looking for, then it&#x27;s a great option.</li>
    <li> I love it! Yes it&#x27;s big, But that&#x27;s one of the things I like.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it. I have used it twice in 2 weeks, only because I wanted a polish  color change. Easy to set up &amp; use!</li>
    <li> This drying is really great - the quality is perfect and has tons of settings.  I didn&#x27;t realize however that it would be so big.  I can easily fit both of my hands inside, but because I use this at home I really only use one at a time.  Finding a place to store it is the only pain but the set up is easy, changing the lights (the bottom pops out of place) is simple and the timer options are super handy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She really enjoys doing her nails and it save her money not  having to go to a salon. She also wears gloves with this product without the finger tips since it is a UV light. I feel we have got our moneys worth out of this. Great product.</li>
    <li> I really like it, it was easy to set up, it works well, but it is definitely bulky.  It is bigger than I realized, but I love it!</li>
    <li> I have owned two other lights prior to this one and the others even though more expensive doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this product!!! I use this light for the CND Shellac and it cures it perfectly! I wish I had saved money from the beginning and just bought this light to start with!!</li>
    <li> Hi llike the product, but one of the UV  lights went out the 2nd time I plugged the unit in. I&#x27;m hoping the rest of the lights last longer.</li>
    <li> Love this nail lamp/dryer!! It makes doing my nails so much easier and fast since both of your hands or feet can set at the same time.  Love that you have different time options and it has a fan! Great product, great price, shipped fast!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the product, was as advertised, delivered in a timely fashion and most of all directions where easy to follow. You do have to place the light bulbs, but very easy to do.</li>
    <li> The fan and light combo is good.  It still takes time to dry.</li>
    <li> Great light!  Have had it for 2 years now and use it every 5 days and still has all bulbs working.  Bought 1 for my mom as well and she loves it also.</li>
    <li> Ok, I do like this- I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but it worked just like it should! I bought a set of base/primer coats and with those it had instructions on how to do the whole process which is quite involved. I&#x27;m sure it will get quicker once I use it more and know what I&#x27;m doing! But when they say don&#x27;t get any of the polish/gel on your cuticles or skin they mean it! I got a little bit on my skin and once under the light oh boy it burned!! So be careful. But my nails look great 8 days after- only problem is that my nails grow really fast so they gel polish starts to peel up a little bit once your nail grows. Not super noticeable though.</li>
    <li> I love the nail dryer.  It works great!!!!  And, the price was great!</li>
    <li> Amazing value, we use it weekly, great product</li>
    <li> I love my nail dryer , enjoy using it if you love gel polish buy this dryer and start doing your own nail it is easy.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer so much I actually also bought one for my friend!  Well worth the money I would definitely recommend!  You will never have to pay to have your nails done again.</li>
    <li> Three of the bulbs on one side didn&#x27;t work. Problem is not with bulbs but with unit. Sent back for a full refund</li>
    <li> Works great. Big enough for both feet!  Does the job without spending a lot of $$.  Very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> This is awesome. I love being able to do a gel manicure in my own home, on my own schedule, and without spending a fortune. Thank you for the great service, fast shipping, and excellent price!</li>
    <li> We bought this dryer for a niece who likes to paint nails and wanted to become more professional.  Her first jell manicure was near perfect, and friends are waiting in line.  The machine came with clear directions and is quite beautiful. So everyone is impressed..  It is early days and there is more to learn but the product arrived promptly, works great and we would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!!  The reason I picked this UV light was because it can be used with all gel polishes.  I am glad i picked this light and dryer.</li>
    <li> Well constructed. Just like the one at the nail salon. I did the better half&#x60;s nails 2 weeks ago, still looks great.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews on nail dryers,I decided to buy this one for my daughter. She is very pleased with it,saves so much time when you can fit both hands in the dryer.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my 22 year old daughter.  The is in the cosmetology profession.  She has used it several times, and it works pretty good.  It does exactly what she expected it to do.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this uv light to do my nails at home and love it!! the only thing I would say negative about it is it&#x27;s big and the timer settings is in seconds rather than minutes.  But all in all..does what I need for the price.</li>
    <li> Dryer works great! I didn&#x27;t realize it was as large as it is....but it would be great for toes, too....:)</li>
    <li> I have only used the light once so far, and it worked well.  I have the CND shellac products, the only thing I noticed is that it seemed to take an extra minute or two per coat to cure.  It is a large size easily accommodating both hands or feet at once.  I used the light/fan to help dry my daughter&#x27;s regular polish and she loved it, more for the fun of it though I think!  Fast shipping and good packaging!</li>
    <li> works very well and the manis last at least 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> The polish I purchased may be good but I&#x27;ve tried it once on my fingernails and I&#x27;m not certain it is the polish, me or the nail dryer.  Typically, it is better to rate a product after one has it and has used it for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be redoing my nails in the next day or so to see if it comes out better.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Does exactly what is advertised and was delivered in a timely at!</li>
    <li> It works better than professional salon!  Lots of time settings!  It has lots of room! The fan is a extra nice feature!</li>
    <li> This product works great! It came quickly, and very easy set up. I have used it about 3 times and so far so great!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! So much faster than my old LED lamp! Large enough for both hands or feet. High enough so you don&#x27;t have to worry about touching a bulb with your hands or nails and deep enough that your nails won&#x27;t touch the back of the dryer.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as the lamps used in salons. Big enough to put two hands in at once.&lt;br /&gt;All around long term time and money saver. Allowing me to do shallac manicures at home on my schedule, and will be paying for itself verses salon prices in no time.</li>
    <li> This works very well and I am happy with it, however, I would like to warn other users about one thing.  If you are doing your own nails ONLY and not using this on another person, it is larger than necessary.  I can only do one hand at a time (so would most people) so a light this large is &amp;#34;overkill&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Quick and easy to use. Saves ton of money by not having to go to the salon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done at least 10 gel manicures with this light since I purchased it, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Its easy to set up, simple to use (the fan feature is great, especially in the summer), and does a fantastic job. The price is wonderful, the shipping was super-speedy, and every time I go into a local salon and see one of the dinky little lights they use there, I have to smile, because mine is so much more roomy and powerful. This is the light you&#x27;re looking for at a price that can&#x27;t be beat, so stop reading reviews and buy one :D</li>
    <li> Excellent product! This product is the best value for your money. The curing chamber is big enough to cure both hands at once, cutting down time to at least 50%! It is also big enough to dry all ten toes at once! The chamber has mirrored sides to ensure light is reflected in all directions to cure all nails evenly. This product also has a fan for quicker drying, and a timer that turns off the light when your time is up. This timer allows you to divert your attention elsewhere besides the slow, slow second hand of a clock! I have used this product many, many times to do my fingernails and toenails and it has never failed me. This product is excellent and I am very happy I bought it here!!!!</li>
    <li> Cosmetology student must buy, sister in law enjoys this product and price. Already was helping with her practice on nails for future customers.</li>
    <li> IS A GOOD-LOOKING MACHINE AND WORKS GREAT. LOVE THE ROOMINESS WHICH ENABLES ME TO DRY BOTH SETS OF NAILS AT THE SAME TIME.  EVERYTHING ADVERTISED ABOUT IT IS TRUE.  ONE OF THE TWO I ORDERED WAS FOR A FRIEND AND SHE IS VERY HAPPY WITH IT TOO.  AM CONSIDERING PURCHASING ANOTHER AS A GIFT.&lt;br /&gt;JUST FOR THE MANUFACTURER&#x27;S GUIDANCE, MY MACHINE ONLY HAD ONE PROTECTIVE BLUE PLASTIC SHEET ON THE BOTTOM OF THE MACHINE; MY FRIEND&#x27;S HAD THE PLASTIC COATING TOP, BOTTOM AND SIDES OF THE INTERIOR.  ALSO, THE BULBS FOR MY MACHINE WERE WRAPPED IN PROTECTIVE BUBBLE WRAP BUT HER BULBS WERE NOT WRAPPED AT ALL..&lt;br /&gt;SO FAR I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS MACHINE AND IT WILL SOON PAY FOR ITSELF WITH LESS NAIL SALON VISITS.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> Wonderful light! Absolutely salon quality. The 120 second timer is perfect for curing OPI gelcolor. Great value for the cost!</li>
    <li> I have saved so much money being able to do my nails at home! I recommend this to all gel and acrylic nail users! Fast and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Extremely pleased with this Dryer. Works excellent and is going to save me a fortune on having my nails done at a nail shop.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I&#x27;m doing nails for other friends and family now.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for this home unit.</li>
    <li> I got this one because it was the best price and I wanted to try doing my own nails because I have a hard time getting to the salon without my kids. I have used it 20 or more times and I show no signs of wear on it at this point.</li>
    <li> It had been opened before I got it. The bulbs were mostly out of their packages and the bubble wrap was missing. It would not cure my nails. I think the bulbs were worn out, likely exchanged out by the person who had it before me. I tried everything to get it to work without success.</li>
    <li> I do like that you can do both hands at once but It does take a little longer to cure the nails. Otherwise a great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Great transaction, came before expected. This is big enough for both hands or feet, dries the nails efficiently. I am using it for Gel Nails, and although it has been trial and error, love the effects, and you absolutely need the light to cure them. This one is strong, well made, and the different time options are easy to manage, even with wet nails.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my nail artist granddaughter as a Christmas gift.  So far, she is very happy with it, although still learning all of the intricacies of gel polishing.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found one with the right wattage!! It works phenomenal!! I hope this one lasts me and I won&#x27;t have to buy another, but I would buy this one again if I had too. The bulbs were easy to put in and it was easy directions on how to use. I would like to be able to know when to turn my bulbs over and how to clean it. but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I love this UV light for my gel nail polish. I really like how I can fit both hand and feet in it at the same time. I also like how quickly it seems to dry my nails. Since Im not a patient person and also seem to smudge them some how this makes it worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this Royal Nails UV light.  I bought it for my own personal use, and it has been much more than I expected!  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; which came with this unit leave a lot to be desired. I contacted the seller and they spent a good bit of time working with me through emails, including pics, and more detailed instructions. All in all I have to rate this transaction five stars!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mom for Christmas and she has used it a few times already and been very happy with this dryer.  We assembled it together on Christmas day and, though one latch was a bit sticky at first, really had no problem putting it together and she was testing it out a few hours later.  Overall, very happy with this purchase and the seller.</li>
    <li> I got this as a present for Christmas and it is perfect if you like to do your nails yourself and really quickens drying time. I liked it so much that I bought it for my mother for mothers day. I would def recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present in December for a family member. I was happy with how fast it was shipped out and how quickly I received it. My family member LOVED it and was thoroughly overjoyed with the product. I would buy again from this business without a second thought!</li>
    <li> This works great, easy to use and has multiple settings for drying times, also fits both hands which is a time saver.</li>
    <li> UV Nail dryer was delivered in perfect condition with clear directions on bulb installation!  So happy with product!  I bought two...one for me and one as a gift.  The recipient of the &#x27;gifted&#x27; one was thrilled with it!  The money saved from salon visits when you&#x27;re ready for a color change not necessarily because nails &#x27;need&#x27; to be done is worth it!  It also makes for a fun &#x27;nail salon day&#x27; with friends.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it!!! I had a bulb burn out within a month and they immediately shipped me 2 bulbs at no charge! Very impressed!!</li>
    <li> love! works great but had 4 bulbs burn out within less than a month of buying</li>
    <li> This is a professional UV lamp. I use different brand of gel, gel polish and polish under this lamp and it does the job. I can use the fan itself for regular nail polish or the UV for gel. I&#x27;m able to turn the fan on or off with the UV light on/off. That&#x27;s what I like about this lamp. It also have another button for the UV timer which can be used with the fan as well. And the lamp has a power switch on the back. The lamp is big enough to put both your hands in or both your feet in it. I carry this lamp around sometime and when I use it on my friends/clients or when people see it they ask me about it and they love how it works.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these for my salon and it barley last me 6 months. The bulbs in the machines doesn&#x27;t all light up. I bought new replacement bulbs thinking that was the problem and it wasn&#x27;t.  I try resetting it and it wasn&#x27;t. I try switching the bulbs around it wasn&#x27;t. Sometimes when you have it turn on for a long time......then it might light all up. Sometimes you have to pound it a little. But I gave up and bought a different kind THERMAL SPA brand. This is a terrible UV Dryer. DO NOT BUY!!!! If you buy get the Thermal Spa UV Dryer they are way better and has not given me issue. And the dryer drys the gel faster and much more evenly. Do not buy this ROYAL UV dryer. NOT RECOMMENDED and I am a nail salon owner.</li>
    <li> I live in a tiny little town. An oil boom town. Nails are so expensive here and at most places you need to get on a waiting list and hope someone cancels. I can now do my own nails. This light is awesome.  It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Purchased this gel/acrylic nail curing dryer in my attempts to start doing my own shellacking application.  I am totally in love with it, it does exactly what it is supposed to do and the results are wonderful.  I followed the advice of many others that reviewed it and really appreciated the help since the device did not come with directions.  I used CND products with it and even though my first attempt did not turn out the way I&#x27;d like (a little streaky), I know I need to work on what constitutes a light coat that the products recommend.  No fault of the machine at all.  Very pleased with it overall, and can&#x27;t wait until I get the knack of the shellacked nail experience!  The machine pays for itself after the first one or two manicures.  It is a fantastic bargain when you think of what you&#x27;ll save by doing it yourself.  I got mine at a good sale price so that was a huge bonus!  Very happy with it, no complaints:)</li>
    <li> I am using this with regular OPI polish, not the gel polishes.  I figured I&#x27;d give it a try with the regular stuff since I have so many bottles of it.  It works good, just takes a few more drying cycles than what they claim is needed for the gel polishes.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to stop paying the salon $25 every 2 weeks and is willing to do their nails themselves.</li>
    <li> I just received it last week and used it over the weekend and have no complains. Excellent product, does the job really fast. I just</li>
    <li> I bought the Royal Nails lamp with enough time to receive and do my mani/pedi before leaving for vacation and was so excited when it arrived. I unpackaged it all, got my polishes all set up, plugged the bulbs in, and turned it on- it didn&#x27;t work. Rearranged the bulbs, flipped them around, etc- nothing.  The fan was operational, and so I know that the motor worked at least- so it was the lamp itself.  All of the bulbs were \\&quot;clicked\\&quot; into place as directed (shoddy directions, btw.) Amazon said we had to ship it back and do a full return, and could buy another outright if I wanted to \\&quot;exchange\\&quot; it.  Royal Nails has what looks like a link for returns on their site, but it&#x27;s plain text and does not go anywhere, and there were no instructions or troubleshooting areas to check.  There wasn&#x27;t any time left at this point to get another lamp before my trip, and I wasn&#x27;t willing to keep paying for return shipping for a defective product, so I bought an ASP lamp from Sally Beauty which I&#x27;d heard great things about.  I still would have loved for the Royal Nails version to work as expected, as the ASP isn&#x27;t large enough for both hands.  However, I&#x27;m now on my second week of gel manicure with the ASP lamp and am loving it!</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely fantastic product, and has worked even better than I expected. I use it with CND shellacs, and my home manicures have lasted around 2.5 weeks even though I work with my hands a lot. I gave up on regular nail polish a long time ago because I&#x27;d only get one or two days without bad chips, even with salon manicures. I also love having this light at home because if I do get a chip in the shellac, I can just re-do one nail (I uses the UV protection gloves pulled up over my other nails while in the light), and still get another week or more without having to re-do the entire manicure. I follow the CND shellac application instructions exactly, except I will sometimes cure the second coat of a very dark color for a bit longer than two minutes (I noticed this is what the salon did). I&#x27;ve also learned to trust the second color coat- the first coat needs to be thin, and may look a bit streaky, but with the CND shellacs, once you add the second coat, it all smooths out and looks perfect. With a little bit of practice, my manicures now turn out better than what I&#x27;ve got at salons, and for an initial investment of about two salon manicures, I can have long-lasting nail color anytime I want. I also love that the nails are rock-hard as soon as they come out of the light- I used to try so hard to let my nails dry, and then I&#x27;d accidentally hit something hard with my hand and end up with a bump or scrape in the polish.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend that does her own nails ... not gel or acrylic just regular French manicures.  The product description said it works just as well on regular polish.  It works okay.  Her &#x27;dry time&#x27; has been cut down but she has to use the dryer 3x on the 3 minute setting to get them to dry so if your purchasing for that reason I would take that into consideration.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and it worked for about 35 minutes before breaking. Checked all the bulbs and the fuse before finally returning it for refund. I&#x27;d say this is a cheap Chinese pile of junk..my only positive comment is Amazon is a great company and refunded the full amount</li>
    <li> At just a bit higher cost than some of the other lights on the market - this lamp is worth it!  It is much larger than I expected; being at least 14 or 15 inches wide and 8 inches tall...by about 9 inches deep.  I could fit both feet in at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;Works like a charm; well put together.</li>
    <li> I love to get my nails done, I always tried to do them at home and they never looks as good as when the nail tech would do them. I saw this and thought that if it works I will save a ton. I bought this and the MB nail color three piece set for like 11 I was amazed at the results. I have use it once every two weeks just as if I had to go be for, but I&#x27;m not paying for anything but nail polish !!!! THX great price, great product, and fantastic savings for a life time!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I don&#x27;t want to pay salon prices to get my nails done.  I haved used the nail dryer approx 3 x so far &amp; it has done wonderful.  After years of nail biting, being able to do my own nails &amp; have them grow and not waste money @ local nail-shops has been wonderful.  Thank You.  I highly recommend your product /store !</li>
    <li> I love my Royal Nails UV Light. It&#x27;s easy to use and actually better than the one that I&#x27;ve seen them use at the salon. Both hands or feet fit in perfectly. I used to never be able to wear polish on my fingers because it would come off the same day. Now I can wear it and it&#x27;ll stay on for at least a week. One thing I was really concerned about was getting the polish off because in the salon they soak your nails and then scrape it off and I didn&#x27;t want to have to do that. But I was pleasantly surprised to learn that with this (and perhaps it&#x27;s the polish I&#x27;m using) I&#x27;m able to just peel the polish off with my fingers. No soaking or scraping necessary. It&#x27;s worth going this route just for that!!!</li>
    <li> Great product for drying your nails.</li>
    <li> I used this for the third time today and I am convinced that this product is very poorly made. The first try was perfect, but second time it malfunctioned and third time, I figured out that it&#x27;s not completely defective and found a work around. It works well when it works, but the timer stops responding after 3 minutes of use and the whole unit overheats quickly. When this happens, nothing works and there is no way to turn it off but to unplug it from the power source. After hours of trial, I realize that the key is to keep the unit from overheating. A fan is integrated into the unit and it does keep the unit cooler when you turn it on, but does eliminate the malfunction. You just have to allot extra time to wait between hands (if you are using it on your own) to allow the unit to cool down. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular brand.</li>
    <li> It works ok. I have to leave my nails longer than usual in order for them to be completely dry.</li>
    <li> The UV Light has meet all my needs.  Great purchase.  Really works as told and provides a great finish to your nails.</li>
    <li> I love this system. I can do my nails (actually my husband does my nails) when I need them done and not on an appointed scheduled time that may or may not work for me. I used to have acrylic nails and could not stand how thick they would get. I love the look of the gel nails and the colors I get with OPI.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many times with cnd shellac and opi and gelish and it never stays for more than a day. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works great. I have used a smaller unit with fewer watts that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this one. Worth the little extra cost to get a professional quality product.</li>
    <li> I was tired of paying 35 dollars every 1-2 weeks for a gel mani, so I purchased this lamp. I really love it. I never write reviews but I promised myself that if I love the lamp then I&#x27;ll write one. So here it is ! I get many compliments on my nails and my nails last 7-10 days. It is nice to have this at home and not having to pay so much money at the nail salon. Really great product!</li>
    <li> I love this lamps, I work doing nails and this is the  best lamp I used in long time, big, strong, with  6 lamps dry the gel super fast, very professinal. I love it! and excellent price too. super fast shipp.Excellent seller!!</li>
    <li> Love this dryer. My first dryer of this kind and it works great for my needs. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas (2013). She&#x27;s big into nail art. She uses it for herself, my wife&#x27;s nails, and her friends and it works fantastically!</li>
    <li> Awesome! It works great! And the fan feature is neat cause you can use it to dry regular nail polish too. Papi made a wise choice!</li>
    <li> I actually need a rating lower than one star for this one.&lt;br /&gt;Its a scam!!!&lt;br /&gt;China made cheap product that has electricity problems and can actually cause a safety hazard in your home.&lt;br /&gt;The device started making strange sounds the minute i plugged it in first time and started smelling smoke.&lt;br /&gt;I had to leave it for a while and try again. Second time it came on nicely but suddenly BLEW UP when i put my hands in to dry!!!&lt;br /&gt;I got such a scare and needless to say it didn&#x27;t come on again!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so upset cos i ordered it from abroad but I really need to find a way to send it back!!!</li>
    <li> I love this UV light! I have given myself several gel manicures and pedicures since purchasing and it has works perfectly! For a first timer, like myself, it was easy to use and well worth the $$$.</li>
    <li> The product I received did not work. After installing the bulbs according to instructions and turning the machine on, the bulbs never lit.  The fan worked properly, but I tried every time setting for the lights with no luck.  I was very disappointed that I had to return this product, especially after all of the positive reviews.</li>
    <li> I like this lamp for many reasons, but the main reason is because it gets the job done.  This is the most professional UV lamp that I have had, it is not of cheap quality, and it shipped really quickly.. I used it 3 times so it&#x27;s already paid for itself.. My mom loves it so much that she actually wants her own... If you&#x27;re looking to purchase this for personal or professional use you will not be disappointed with the execution, however I&#x27;m not to happy with the timers, they&#x27;re not working... But it does have a working fan...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record most professional nail salons who advertise Gel manicures haven&#x27;t mastered the art of doing the job properly, however I managed to find a salon that has and I pretty much follow their routine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After filing shaping and cleaning the cuticles...&lt;br /&gt;1. Buff Nails (lightly).&lt;br /&gt;2. Wash hands thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply  a thin layer of a Gel Prep Coat (Cuccio brand preferably).&lt;br /&gt;4. Cure nails for 1 min (Royal 54 watt UV).&lt;br /&gt;5. Apply a thin layer of a Gel Base coat (Cuccio brand pref).&lt;br /&gt;6. Cure nails for 5 min.&lt;br /&gt;7. Apply a thin layer of the first Gel color coat (Cuccio brand pref).&lt;br /&gt;8. Cure nails for 5 min&lt;br /&gt;9. Apply a thin layer of the second Gel color coat&lt;br /&gt;10. Cure nails for 5 min.&lt;br /&gt;11. Apply a thin layer of a Gel Top coat (Cuccio pref).&lt;br /&gt;12.  Cure nails for 5 to 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;13. Saturate a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and use it to clean the film off each nail.</li>
    <li> This product dries the gel polish quickly and works well.  I like the different time settings.  I&#x27;ve used it three times and feel like I&#x27;ve saved money over going to the salon.</li>
    <li> I just got this product yesterday and I am in love with it. I hate giving out $30 each time to get my nails done and have always wanted to do my toes too and now I can!&lt;br /&gt;At first when I did my nails, I had an Oh No moment when they were sticky - then I took some nail polish remover and whipped the tops of the nails and they were perfect! I forgot that the nail salon did something like this as well and I was just not paying attention.&lt;br /&gt;My nails are perfect and will last long now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got OPI to go with my nails. Just be careful and put thin, even layers on. Great machine!! Love it :)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the 54 watt Royal Nails professional UV light! Extremely easy to put in the bulbs and operate. Love that you can cure both hands at the same time. Having the ability to \\&quot;schedule my own appointment\\&quot; and have perfectly shellaced nails that last for two weeks is a dream!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a professional uv light to cure gel nails, look no further.  This is a winner.  It&#x27;s big enough for two hands, has a fan and a timer.  I also use this lamp to dry my nails when I use regular nail polish.  It really works!!!  Best of all it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
    <li> I read lots of reviews prior to purchasing and definitely a great decision...  Easy to use, love the timer and ability to cure both hands at the same time!  Vendor shipped promptly, good packaging.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend had pointed this out to me a few months ago as something that she would love to have and save her some money, to boot.  She tried it out and was very satisfied with the results!!</li>
    <li> Love this it has a fan, timer, light all you can use or not use but need or want. It&#x27;s very big and very nice looking. Opens from bottom to easily put lights in can use for your two hands or to feet. Very good for the price! Most have this same thing in lest wats for way more all over $100 bucks and some as high as $179 not going to put the store on blast but it starts with a S and ends in ally&#x27;s lmbo</li>
    <li> Product works great, quick shipment, and a great price. The light is easy to use. My friend who is a manicurist says it&#x27;s better than her professional light!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to try the DIY gel with this light...  My mani looks like I spent the afternoon at the salon!!!  Several compliments, and they all could not believe I did it myself!</li>
    <li> I have a salon. I needed a professional light and this is it. the order arrived when expected.  I was a brand new light with the light bulbs, it turned on with no issues right after  I put the lights.  I work with CND SHELLAC.&lt;br /&gt; I am pleased and  I will order from them again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product right before I left on vacation, so I have not had the opportunity to use it yet.  I was really surprised at how big it is (I am really happy about that!) I will report on its use later. Really happy with the price, however.</li>
    <li> I love the convenience of doing my own nails at home. My light has already paid for itself! Works well with gel polish, although I did find a difference between drying time using gel designed specifically for UV and those designed for LED. LED gels did set, but it took considerably longer to do so (3-5 minutes). A small price to pay for such huge savings, in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Great product it works better than CND or other uv lights I&#x27;ve used. Currently I&#x27;m using this light with shellac, gelish and other gel polish and sculpture gels it works great. Also the blue novelty is really reliable company and they communicate before and after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT SERVICE.</li>
    <li> It says it works with opi gel polish, but it did not dry the polish.  When I got it it was scratched.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago and love it.  I have done my nails with shellac polish and it cures it really well.  I love that I can cure both hands or feet at the same time.  The different timer buttons are very convenient; I use the shorter times for the base, top, and lighter colored coats, the longer times for darker colors.  I am very satisfied with this item.  I have not had to replace the bulbs yet so I cannot comment on how easy or difficult that will be.</li>
    <li> What a deal!  My boyfriend saw how disappointed I was when a local shop owner sold her business and the quality of the gel nails went down hill fast.  (Nails done on Saturday and pealed on Tuesday.)  When he found out how much I paid, he decided to buy the equipment for me to do my own.  This was a little more expensive than some other devices but worth every penny.  Can do both feet at once.  (Both hands, but not that coordinated.)  Bulbs easy to change.  Fan great.  Variety times on lights.  Would definately recommend.  Might cost a little to start but paid for itself in a month.  Less than a month if you do pedicures too!</li>
    <li> The best I have bought so far .5 stars</li>
    <li> This unit is large but works well.  You can do both hands or  both feet all at once. Convenient timer.  Fan is very low power and I can&#x27;t tell it it&#x27;s moving very much air bit the lights work just fine.  Cord is a little short but workable.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product!  My nails look great always -- both my hands &amp; feet.  Couldn&#x27;t be simpler to use and the results are truly amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this product.  It has worked well, with all the of different nail polishes that I have used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a year now, and have saved literally hundreds of dollars doing my own gel nails. It&#x27;s sturdy, easy to use, and the bulbs are still going strong. Works with any gel polish, and there&#x27;s a fan if you want to dry regular polish. It also is wide/tall enough for feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> very nice ,very very good price</li>
    <li> its big can fit hands and toes, it better then the ones they use at the nail salon well worth it.</li>
    <li> Machine seems like a great product.  I have only used it once so far and it worked perfectly well.  I received the item very quickly, well packaged and as described.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK ON SHELLAC, GELLISH, CUCCIO, OR VENEER PRODUCTS IT SAYS IT DOES IT ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT! ONLY GOOD FOR STANDARD PEDI/MANI JOBS USING ONLY STANDARD POLISH, OR ACRYLICS WHICH DRY NATURALLY ON THEIR OWN. IT IS UDDERLY USELESS!!!!</li>
    <li> This product has already paid for itself.  My finger nails look as though I went to a salon.  Item large enough to fit both feet or hands in at once.  Professional results!</li>
    <li> Bulbs blow quickly but I really like that you can do two hands at once.  This does gel and shellac nails really well. I use CND with it and i&#x27;ve never had a problem.</li>
    <li> After numerous trips to a salon for gel mani/pedi treatments costing upwards of 90$, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try at home. with so many lights to choose from &amp; so many mixed reviews on other products, I picked this one based off the amount of good reviews, after receiving it in the mail relatively fast, 3-4 days I recall. Axiously waiting, I was pleasantly surprised, with not only the quality but how nice the light looks. It&#x27;s a more luxurious size, two hands or feet fit very comfortably with room to easily place or remove hands without accidently smudging. Cures fast and very effectively, with practical timer options, and easy assembly I would purchase as a gift for sure! So far I have used the light with gellish, shellac, light elegance and have been more than satisfied with results. I am extremely picky, and rarely pleased with the nail technicians work due to uneven cured gel, this light cures fast! Giving me a flawless finish!</li>
    <li> I have bought on Amazon for years and never felt the need to jump in with my opinion on a product... but I need to sing this dryer&#x27;s praises.  The bulbs go in easily if you take the back off.  Also while you&#x27;re at it take off the blue film on the bottom, side and top.  I used this dryer to cure my Gelish nails.  My nails still like salon fresh and I did my house chores (yes including washing dishes), computer work and kept up with the grandkids.  In fact you can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the when I got them done at the nail salon.  The only additional step I would take is to run the dryer a couple of cycles right before you start to cure your nails as the dryer gets hotter the more cycles you run so it will cut down on the cure time.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this. It cures very well I have no complaints with the lamp. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> i would definitely recommend this product!  it works great and my nails look like they were professionally done.  i have brought my nail light into work and a few of the girls have used it and all of them were pleased with the results!  for the price it is worth it and i have already sent an email to several people showing where they can buy this!  very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> I received my UV light in two days and it met all of my expectations.  I have used several brands of gel polish and they all cure perfectly with this light.  I recommend this product to anyone doing nails at home.  It&#x27;s bigger then some of the other lights but you can&#x27;t beat the price and if you want to do toes they fit without any trouble! Great purchase</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten to use yet BC its for my new shop but everyone who has this said its awesome.. Update later. Great pricing for sure</li>
    <li> It is just like being at a salon, only now I am saving money by doing my nails at home!</li>
    <li> I recently started using the CND Shellac nail manicure and this product is great for it.  I&#x27;ve used it several time and each time it works wonderful.  The best thing is that you can do both your hand/feet at the same time.  A little bigger than what i expected but its worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works great! A great value too</li>
    <li> My  complaints are the size of the item...it&#x27;s huge. Secondly I don&#x27;t like that the opening is so large and there is nothing to keep the UV rays from escaping. I put a towel over the opening.</li>
    <li> I purchased this uv light several months back and it has worked great. I use it with OPI Gelcolor and with Sensational. It sets the gel color with no problem. I would absolutely recommend this light to someone looking to do at home gel color.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  It came exactly when they said it would.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love, Love Love this product!! It&#x27;s the best. It&#x27;s easy to use and your nails are professional looking... Actually Better!! Buy this product!</li>
    <li> It does absolutely nothing. I tried it a few times without any results. Was not sure if it is me or the product. Asked my mom to try it- same result- no result. Sending it back. Overall when you open the box it looks good and promising, which makes it even more disappointing when does not work as expected.  I did not like that it was very bulky and needed lots of space to store. Also all buttons were on the other side from inserts- like someone else supposed to push them for you. It did arrive on time and was well packed.&lt;br /&gt;It happened to be third item I have to return to Amazon this month which unfortunately turns the status of this item from &amp;#34;disappointed&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;pissed&amp;#34; </li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how huge it was!!! It saves me time from not doing just 1 hand but I can place both hands in. Doing my girls nails are so much easier &amp; faster:) A great buy!!!</li>
    <li> Original order arrived and didn&#x27;t work. Seller was quick to resolve the issue for me. Would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister, and although it takes a little getting used to we love the gel manicures.  The light works great and dries each coat in about 2 minutes.  It takes about four coats total to finish the manicure, and you have to use the light for each one.  Great product, would recommend it to a friend!</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer as a present for my Daughter and Granddaughter.  The larger unit allows them options for both hands or both feet.  They are having a ball with it.  I know nothing about it - so my feedback is the product works, delivery was excellent, everyone is happy.</li>
    <li> everything was fine.....my friend girl was very pleased.</li>
    <li> Works well and easy to use. However, there are some potential health concerns with the broader issue of using gel polish. Hence 4 instead of 5 stars. Do a lithe research and find out what is right for you.</li>
    <li> This item far exceeded my expectations.  I watched a quick online tutorial on how to turn it upside down and open the case to put the lights in...Very well packaged, easy to assemble, and works well with Gelish polishes.  I personally found the 180 second setting to set it a bit better....just 3 presses of the button and it automatically turns off when the time is up.  I am uncertain how I lived without this for so long and am glad I found it on Amazon for a great price! Would make a great gift for any girly girl.....</li>
    <li> I was really happy that my order arrived quickly and well packaged. There was no instruction manual included with the lamp, however there were many positive product reviews on Amazon that featured helpful information regarding its use. I am very happy with the results I am getting, and my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t purchase one earlier!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product. It arrived on time, in perfect condition. This product has decreased my service time, which saves me money. I would not hesitate to use this seller again.</li>
    <li> This product is really great. I love the fact that both hands can fit as well as the fan option with or without the UV lights. This is an essential tool for the nail professional or even non-professional!</li>
    <li> I LOVE it! I have used it many times over the past months and I have not been disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to set up and use! Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Bought this and the Top coat, base, and polish and after 2 uses has paid for it&#x27;s self.  I love that I can do my nails whenever I can, no appointment necessary.  Easy to use with great results.</li>
    <li> The machine works really good and my girlfriend really enjoy this as a professional . Her clients really enjoy from this too</li>
    <li> Works great!Very satisfied.Delivered very quickly.I would highly recommend this product!It is large enough for both hands.it looks nice and is lightweight.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase. I love this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and works great. Very happy with it. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> The dryer is large and easily accommodates both hands at once. It is easy to use and performs well. The price was very reasonable and the unit is well made.</li>
    <li> I loved the price of this product until I received the product then I loved the product.  It cures my nails in the correct time and is big enough I can cure both hands and both feet at the same time.  This saves me time each time I shellac my nails.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as a gift to use with cnd shellac polish. Works perfect without the huge cost of other lights.</li>
    <li> This light is super easy to use and works like it&#x27;s supposed to work.  AND pays for itself very quickly.  The trick to having a great gel nail manicure, I believe, is getting the right shellac product - well, and this light.  I tried a base coat and colors that my nail tech purchased for me and got a terrible end result.  I am just coming off having acrylic nails (again - sheesh, I feel like I&#x27;ll never learn) and my poor nails are now recovering.  I&#x27;ve had several gel/shellac manicures over the last few eyars and love the way they hold up and how shiny the finish stays for the entire 2+ weeks but I don&#x27;t have a reliable place to get them done in my town PLUS I don&#x27;t really want to pay $35+ every 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer gave a great suggestion that I&#x27;ve just tried - putting on the base coat, drying for 90 seconds, then putting on the top coat and drying for 3-4 minutes, using alcohol to remove the tacky layer and then polishing with whatever color you choose.  I&#x27;ve so far just done the base and top coat (use CND) and will be putting a color on today for New Years Eve.  I&#x27;ll see how this works because this great reviewer said that when she wants to change the color, she just uses regular remover and the shellac base and top coat are left untouched.  Then she files down the little ridge at the cuticle grow out, redoes the base and top coat and she doesn&#x27;t have to remove w/the acetone.  I love this idea and will try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this light for regular polish and it helps the polish set up nicely.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased (especially at the great price offered here on Amazon.com - a great value for the price) and the seller ships promptly w/good packaging.  Follow the directions offered by other reviewers for a perfect shellac manicure - 90 seconds for base coat, 120 for first coat of color, 120 for 2nd coat of color, 180 or 240 seconds for top coat.  Don&#x27;t forget to spray w/alcohol and wipe off the tacky layer left after drying and you will be super thrilled with your nails.  I&#x27;ll repost after I try the technique I described above and let you know what I experience.per thrilled with your nails.

    <li> Great product!  I especially like the fact the timer controls face me and not the client.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work.  After going through 2 cycles at 3 minutes each time, my polish was still very tacky.  I thought about purchasing a more powerful nail dryer, but quite frankly, after having 2 dryers that don&#x27;t work (the other one was a CND dryer), I&#x27;ve put it in the recycle bin and will give it to the Salvatio Army.  I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy to put the bulbs in. Love it! Much cheaper than other stores, and love that you can cure both hands rather than waiting.</li>
    <li> The larger sized unit fits both hands at one time... or both toes!  Has both UV lights AND air dryer for both types of polish.  Includes a timer, as well - with incremental settings.  Not cheaply made - very sturdy.  Removed the blue film from the inside; inserted the included bulbs; plugged it in; ready to go.  EXCELLENT.  As I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve figured out already... I am VERY pleased. As one previous buyer wrote, don&#x27;t hesitate on THIS one.</li>
    <li> My mom bought this for me as a birthday present because I wanted to save money going to the salon every 2 weeks. Wow!!! Want a deal and the lamp is awesome. Easy to assemble and I love the built in fan. My hands don&#x27;t feel hot at all. I never liked that they sometimes burned in the salon lamps.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t give a time break down for the curing but here is what I did and it set perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I used all Gelish products first off so if you are using that this will definitely help you.&lt;br /&gt;Foundation 90secs&lt;br /&gt;Color 120secs (because I used a very dark color)&lt;br /&gt;Top it Off 90sec&lt;br /&gt;Wipe off with alcohol and done!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife along with a bunch of different Gel Polish items.  She was very happy with this. It worked well and was easy to use. She kept remarking how strange it was for the nails to be totally dry so quickly.</li>
    <li> works really well, easy to use</li>
    <li> It works like a charm. I had no doubt in my mind that it wouldn&#x27;t. Came on time...easy to use.</li>
    <li> I had been chewing my nails for almost 30 years then do to a work injury on my hand it was to painful to continue chewing. After so many years with no finger nails I decide to go to salons twice a month. With brittle nails the shellac was my best option. Then of course men can&#x27;t figure out we like to look nice and whined about the cost (even tho he wasn&#x27;t paying). So cutting the monthly cost of the salon was the next best thing. I bought this product and love love love it!! Beautiful nails done at home now I&#x27;m sure he will complain about everyone over getting their nails done :)</li>
    <li> The product looked like a beautiful light. It&#x27;s larger than the 36watt light I had before, but that&#x27;s because you could put both hands in at the same time side by side.  Unfortunately, the light I received would not even turn on. Also, it looked like someone had maybe played with it before, because the protective plastic on the mirror board was picked at, and things like that. They were small details that I actually didn&#x27;t mind about, if the product had worked at all for me. Yes, my outlet was good, the fuse on the product was good, and the product switch was powered in the &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34; position.</li>
    <li> The product was great! The light bulbs that it came with though did not last very long. Maybe a month. I was disappointed in that. The bulbs in a 4 pack are around $40. So to buy this product and then turn around and have to fork out another $40 for bulbs when it came with some was really disappointing.</li>
    <li> Works fine however two bulbs take a while to warmup. Switched them around and it isn&#x27;t the bulbs - it&#x27;s the machine. Been using twice monthly for 6 months and it&#x27;s fine. Just hoping it doesn&#x27;t short out anytime soon!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the UV light!  My nails look great and I&#x27;ve saved so much money vs. going to the nail salon.</li>
    <li> Works well and seems well made. Have only used a handful of times but is running fine. Does the job!  No complaints yet!</li>
    <li> Just used this for the first time and I love it!!! My nails turned out great. I used the Gelish set and polish.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister. She loves to do her nails.  She has used this unit several times since it arrived.  She loves it. Her nails always look nice and her nail polish dries really hard so her manicures last much longer than usual.</li>
    <li> arrive in perfect condition, easy to insert the bulbs, and for a novice on how to use the dryer, it is very easy.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  I followed the step-by-step tutorial on you tube the first time - so easy!  It really is everything it is advertised to be.  I highly recommend it for anyone that doesn&#x27;t have the time or money to have their nails done professionally! Fast, beautiful and flawless results!</li>
    <li> Great company and product, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well but attracts dust and anything floating in the air...static cling!</li>
    <li> All the products I ordered arrived in a timely manner and now I just have to learn to use them correctly.</li>
    <li> Amazing....thank you!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  I used CND polish, up to 3 or 4 coats.  It cures perfectly with this lamp.  It is also as roomy as advertised.  It is actually a bit larger than I anticipated - much larger than the ones I&#x27;ve seen nail techs use in salons but this is for both hands/feet instead of one at a time like I typically see them do.  I also use it to dry regular polish on top of gel (for when I want to change color without removing the gel).  It does seem to dry hard quicker with the lamp</li>
    <li> This light is awesome!  I live how big it is an how quickly it works. However,  after owning this light for a year something went wrong. I think it is blowing a circuit inside or something, it rarely turns on now and when it does it will randomly shut off on its own. This is a great product, I just wish it was made with better quality.</li>
    <li> The machine is great and allows me to change the shellac nail polish anytime.  Saves trip to the salon and with a few nail changes the price of the machine is paid.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Easy to use and durable.  It comes with lightbulbs (which I haven&#x27;t had to replace) just snap them in and you are ready to do your own nails.  The easy timer settings make it simple to use.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift.  Now my wife can do her gel nails at home, quickly instead of taking hours and chancing messing them up while they dry.</li>
    <li> I bought as a gift for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. If you are thinking of buying it,  do it!</li>
    <li> They both love them and have both started doing their own nails instead of going to the salon. The products seem to be very well made and are as nice or &amp;#34;nicer&amp;#34; than the salons use. They are now using a product that is not being used my other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is that they are also saving money by not having to go to a salon!</li>
    <li> I gave it as a birthday gift to my daughter and she and her twelve year old daughter love it.</li>
    <li> Good purchase.  I bought this nail light as a gift for my daughter.  It works great and is easy enough for a child to operate.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it is a bit bulky &amp; takes up a lot of room in the bathroom closet.  But, I would rather have a big light that gives professional results than littly dinky light that doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> My daughters friend had a less expensive one and it did not work. This one i working well for her.</li>
    <li> Love this, great machine for a great value. It&#x27;s a tad bulky and lacking in instructions, but if you get any gel polish started kits they will lead the way.  I especially like that there&#x27;s multiple timer settings and the fan can be turned on or off as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen A LOT of reviews here about this light not giving an instant dry nail, but I&#x27;m not sure these reviewers know that gel polish leaves a sticky residue that needs to be removed with a solution (you can buy it, or you can just use rubbing alcohol). I have NO problems with not having an instantly dry nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love love love this and have recommended it to many friends!</li>
    <li> I quit polishing my nails because I always woke up the next morning with &#x27;sheety&#x27; nails. I received this dryer for Christmas. I followed some of the recommendations given. I dried each layer and when I completed my layers of polish I dried my nails for about 25 minutes longer. I was so excited the next morning when I awoke with NO sheety nails. I love this dryer and will finally be buying more and more colors of polish.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for Christmas, and she found out a few days later that she was pregnant. So, she has not used it. Therefore, I am only assuming that it is a wonderful product, however, it will be close to a year before it will be used. She was excited to get it, tho!</li>
    <li> Got as a x-mas gift. My Wife loves it. Got a great price for it. Her friends were impressed for the price and in awe she had such a great light. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this seller.  One of the bulb was blown when I received the initial shipment.  When I informed them of this they promptly mailed me a new bulb.  I have used the lamp many times and I am very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Lisa</li>
    <li> Gave this product as a gift.  The recipient does like it but offers this suggestion.  Without having any instructions accompanying the product, it was trial and error in using it with certain nail products.  She needed to go on line and read what others had to suggest.  Knowing you supply the product to dry the shellac  polishes, it would be helpful if the polish retailers inserted their specific instructions with your product.  Drying times vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, she was very pleased with the gift and it arrived in perfect condition from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Really like this dryer and 2 hands could fit in although I don&#x27;t do this. Very quiet and works for most UV gels. Wish Leds were cheaper.</li>
    <li> Nail dryer works well.  Box was very damaged,  but product was ok.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I purchased this over a year ago and it still works like new.  I am able to do both hands at the same time.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Easy to use and the double hand feature is amazing!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my gel polish even though I leave it in there the longest time available.  It will eventually harden during the next hour, but that doesn&#x27;t help when you are using your hands.</li>
    <li> Light works well for my at-home gel nails. I use CND products. One bulb did burn out after about 3 months of use - maybe 10-15 manicures worth. My gel manicures last about 10 days with this light (on my friends too!).</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my daughter, who spent lots of time &amp; money at the nail salon.  Polish holds up very well, easy to operate.  Great for manicure and pedicure as well!  Would definately reccomend.</li>
    <li> This UV light seemed perfect I loved the size and fact that you could place both hands in at the same time.  The problem was that we couldn&#x27;t get the 3 lamps on the left side lit.  The 3 on the right side did work.  THANK goodness because I had already started the application when I realized that it wasn&#x27;t working properly.  I&#x27;m really disappointed that I had to return it because the size was perfect, it seemed professional enough and good quality, I would rather have received another unit  just like it but they don&#x27;t have a replacement policy.  I did receive the unit quickly so I ordered another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 5 days I had already received my 2nd light and received credit for the first one.  This one works perfectly I tried it as soon as it arrived, It&#x27;s Great..Works Great.  Love the timer, the fan and the size of this unit both hands fit perfectly..I trust my nail salon days are over since I am doing really well myself and in my own home.  I&#x27;m using the Shellac brand which was also available at the nail salon.  I use the UV Light for 3 min. after each application ( base coat, 2 coats of polish and 2 coats of top coat. 15 min total curing time) then I clean with alcohol and I&#x27;m done.  The only negative to gel nails is removing them but at least they last for 2 weeks. Love the Royal UV Light and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to do gel nails from home.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it is supposed to. TONS of room to put hands in.. As my boyfriend told me &amp;#34;A Yeti could fit it&#x27;s hand in there!&amp;#34; Used the lamp yesterday with Harmony Gelish, used the 180 second timer for each of the layers, and it cured perfectly. I&#x27;m a newbie to gels and this made it super easy for me, it&#x27;s very simple to use. Hands down (pun intended) BEST purchase I have made in a while, and I really researched before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heads up for anyone having issues.. a lot of the reviews on here say to remove the blue film before using the lamp.. mine did not have a blue film, but it was pinkish/clear and VERY hard to see. So if anyone got the lamp with no blue like me, there is STILL a film there, make sure to take it off!</li>
    <li> This is the GREATEST product. I have had it for  three weeks &amp; already I have great gel nails.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use.  This machine is a super product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. It does everything it says it does!</li>
    <li> This light works great with gel nail polish. Easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone. You can do both hands/feet at once.</li>
    <li> These gloves are the perfect protection from the harmful (cancer-causing) UV rays that are necessary to dry the popular gel and acrylic nails.  Before I found these gloves I was applying sunscreen to the back of my hands before every manicure &amp; gel polish, these gloves are so much easier!  Love them!!</li>
    <li> The Royal Nail Professional Dryer delivers great results.  I&#x27;ve used it on both hands and feet with different types of nail polish and am pleased with the results.  No need to blow and use my breath to dry my nails.  I am glad I purchased this item.</li>
    <li> Great item ... The price was very good ,we use it everyday in the salon and have had no problems.</li>
    <li> This is as nice if not nicer than what they use at the salon, I have been wearing gel polish for over a year and this really made a big difference in my dry time.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. It works great and it is big enough I can do both hands at the same time. You can even do your toes with this dryer.</li>
    <li> This uv lamp is amazing and it works so well and so fast!  I use mine for gel nails and acrylics,  I am always impressed :)</li>
    <li> This nail dryer works great. I&#x27;ve had no issues with it. It is very large and you can definitely fit both hands in it, and feet, too. I haven&#x27;t tried my feet in there as I am not that coordinated with the foot polish, but my feet would fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes about 2-3 minutes to dry my gelish polish the way I want it. Nails come out very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend. Shipping was fast and satisfying.</li>
    <li> Best investment ever!!! will save hundreds of dollars a year not having to go to salon for gel polish!!! I may even start doing my friends nails and make some extra cash!</li>
    <li> works great but it&#x27;s HUGE.  you can fit both hands in at the same time which is not usually how you do your nails.  Takes up a lot of room on the desk.</li>
    <li> this is a very nice product with large space, but be careful!!! this operates at 110 Volts and it requires a power converter (220-110V) in case the product will be used out of the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that the seller posts the same notice in product description in order to avoid client disappointment.</li>
    <li> POWERFUL LIGHT WORKS WELL AND MY GEL POLISHES DRY HARD AND I HAVE A HOT MIRROR FINISH UNTIL I TAKE IT OFF. BOTH HANDS AND FEET FIT IN AND EASY TO CHANGE BULBS, ITS HINGED. GAVE 4 STARS B/C ITS BIG AND BULKY AND PLASTICKY AND KINDA CHEAPO,BUT IF IT DOES THE JOB,ITS ALL GOOD.</li>
    <li> I love my new Royal Nails UV light and shellacs.  It saves me time by not having to make an appointment to GO somewhere to get my nails done.  I also like it that if I have a chip and need to repair a nail, I can do it myself instead of having to rely on a nail technician.  I accidentally left my first light machine and gels at our vacation home in Colorado, so as soon as I got home, I ordered this set.  Now I own TWO sets and don&#x27;t have to transport the machine back and forth!  I would recommend, however, that you also purchase the Royal Nails UV protective gloves.</li>
    <li> I like this light.  It works great so far.  It is large and I like that you can put in two hands or feet at once.  Saves lots of time.  I did not give it 5 stars because I felt it was used prior to me receiving it.  There were some scratches on the top.  Inside, where the protective liner was, you could see where it had been scratched, like someone had removed it and tried to put it back. I was upset because I did paid full price for something that was either used or refurbished. However, I contacted Amazon about this and they offered solutions to correct the situation.  So overall I was pleased with the product and customer service.</li>
    <li> This is a well constructed and quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Been used in my salon for a while without any problem, the product itself is very beautiful and well built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it have fan and light and timer fully working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would recommended to anyone that need this type of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product itself is a little big, so do some research on the size.</li>
    <li> heavy, bulky....&lt;br /&gt;too many gel Lacquer not work</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  I asked recipient and she says she absolutely loves it!!!  Thank you for inquiring about this review!</li>
    <li> Works great. Good customer service</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a christmas gift for my girlfriend who wanted to start shellacing her own nails.  No other deal on amazon could beat this price or quality.  I save $200 dollars off of the retail price, and my girlfriend LOVES IT!  My product was shipped in a timely manner, was fully functioning upon arrival, does exactly what it was designed to do.  If you girlfriend is into doing her own nails I would highly reccommend this.  This nail dryer makes all of her friends nail dryers look like a puny joke.  On top of my product satisfation, the company who sold it actually reached out to me to make sure I was satisfied, and offer to make anything right if I wasn&#x27;t.  More companies need to be like this.</li>
    <li> I use this for CND shellac polish, I like that the size accomodates both feet when painting toenails.  Affordable and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This machine is amazing! I was so worried about the gel not drying properly. I got OPI gel polish and it turned out better then the salon! I won&#x27;t ever pay someone else to do my shellac again! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Does not work! Does not set the nails even though bought the gel polish they recommended.Would not buy-my daughter was very disappointed!</li>
    <li> For my daughter, she is thrilled with the product. She said it meets her needs and expectations and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Makes polish last longer because it is dried all the way through quickly.  Smart purchase.  Highly recommend it for anyone who does their own nails.</li>
    <li> Works great, very happy and pleased with this product. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who uses nail dryers.</li>
    <li> I did not do my due diligence in looking at the size dimensions of the product.  It was much larger than what I had in mind.  I am only using this as a personal product vs. professional.  I really had no room for the machine.  I never actually used the product so I cannot comment on it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> I love that it has the capability to also fit my feet and it is very simple to use. It does a great job at drying the polish.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  They will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter for Xmas, we are thrilled to be able to do a great gel manicure at home now! I am picky about how my nails look after the salon, since I am paying so much for the treatment. Now I can be truly pleased, every time. Dryer works perfectly! Shipping was very fast, even though it was Christmas time.</li>
    <li> This is one awesome machine! Less expensive than others on the market. It is large enough to put either both hands or both feet in it at once. Simple and easy to use. I would recommend this to others!!</li>
    <li> Decided to do shellac nails myself to save money so I bought this UV gel dryer, it works great. I still need some practice but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be doing my nails like a professional soon.</li>
    <li> It exceeded my expectations even after reading all the reviews. I checked several online and retail stores looking for a nail dryer. I wanted to start doing gel nails myself because I wasn&#x27;t impressed with how they were being done at the nail salon but I really like gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the excellent reviews on this but what ultimately got me to get it was a. the competitive price b. the fact this was much bigger than most dryers so you could put both hands in it (or feet) and c. it has a fan and can be used with regular polish so I can still use my favorite colors that I have around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I was presently surprised when I opened the package. It is so much bigger than I thought. It is definitely a salon grade dryer. I&#x27;ve also checked this one other sites, and the price about $20 more than it is on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I got this. For anyone who is looking to do their own nails, especially gel, this is a great investment. Also I used it as soon as it came in the mail. It was fool proof to put together and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some reviews were people complained there were no directions or it didn&#x27;t work. It does come with assembly directions but as far as nail drying directions that depends on the nail polish manufacture. Some have have a base in it, some don&#x27;t and this affects the process and drying times. So before you chalk this up to a loss on how it works or complain about it not having directions on how to do your nails, please take his into consideration. I followed the directions given to me with my polish and had no problems at all. Def worth the investment.</li>
    <li> ...but I hear that it works great and she loves it!  She is thrilled with the appearance of her nails.</li>
    <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve used this nail lamp (?) twice and in two more uses it will pay for four weeks of shellac manicures. The best part: I don&#x27;t feel so damned guilty about picking off my nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan is to share my lamp and products with my lady friends and save our girly fingers from high salon prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the person who posted instructions here. I printed them!</li>
    <li> Bought as a present and was as described. fast shipping and all worked just fine.  Had it about 2 months now and no issues.</li>
    <li> You can easily fit two hands or two feet in this light. It works great - you just put the lights (all 6 included) in and peel the protective tape and it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
    <li> Love this uv light system. Dries my gel nails fast!</li>
    <li> I purchased this light for my daughter and we both love it!  The LED polishes work with this UV light although it takes about 3 minutes per coat to cure.  I had an issue with one of the bulbs and it was taken care of immediately.  The customer service rocked with making everything right!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this UV light a few months ago, and I LOVE IT! The quality is amazing! The bottom does un-clip for easier access to insert the bulbs, -cures Harmony Gelish gel-polish, UV gel - Brisa, IBD, &amp; OPI without a problem! Dries regular nail polish, has a little fan to keep hands cool under light, and the timer is perfect! GREAT BUY! Definitely worth the money!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome uv light with fan for nails !!  AAA+++  Highly recommended, easy to use and drys nails well.</li>
    <li> This is a really great professional nail dryer. However, after just 6 months of use the dryer quit working. It works off and on but not consistently so I am not able to use it in my business. If it is for use it would probably be okay. But for a lot of use you should probably look at another brand. You cannot return items like this after 30 days, so you are out the money regardless.</li>
    <li> Nails last a minimum of 2 weeks without chipping.  Easy to use.  Was a Christmas present.  I use CND polish.</li>
    <li> This is high quality, at a great price! I use it every two weeks and my manicure looks better every time, as I get better and better at applying gel polish. Cures in second!</li>
    <li> Great price for this excellent product</li>
    <li> Professional size...fits both hands and both feet.....at a great price!! I am loving it!!!</li>
    <li> All my bulbs are not working where can I get the replacement urgently</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding value.  It is a big item, both hands will fit into it at the same time.  If storage is an issue, this may be to big.  For me, it is wonderful.  I have been using it for a couple of months, and it works beautifully.  It was well packaged, the bulbs all worked.  I am not a professional.  This was bought for personal use.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this UV light to do Gelish nails.  I have never used one before and I am amazed!  My nails came out great at the light worked beautifully.  It is large enough for both hands thereby cutting down on manicure time.  The price was better than anything I found online, even the small one-hand versions.  I would highly recommend this product and the company that I bought ot from.  Great value!</li>
    <li> If you are interested in saving a TON of money by not paying the through the roof prices for gel nails at the salon, then THIS is your ticket!  I purchased this light last week, along with the start up \\&quot;gelish\\&quot; gel nail kit.  The shipping was amazingly fast!  There was virtually no set up, just peel off the protective liner, insert the six bulbs, plug it in and BAM, you are ready!!!  The extra wide size and the high wattage were what attracted me to purchase this particular UV light.  A good friend of mine works at a salon and recommended that I purchase a light with a 36 watt or higher wattage. For the money, this 54 watt light was the best deal out there!!!  This friend was just over for dinner and when she saw the light she commented, \\&quot;Wow, that&#x27;s nicer than the one we use in our salon\\&quot;!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light and easily stored in my cabinet when not in use.  Takes about 1 minute to cure gel and shellac polishes.  I would HIGHLY recommend this light!!!  Within a week, I have recouped my money by doing friend&#x27;s nails.  It&#x27;s fun, easy and you will save yourself and all your friends an enormous amount of money in those salons!!!</li>
    <li> I requested this light for Christmas and used it the next day. Very easy to use. I used Sensationail polish primer and top coat with it. I know the verdict is still out on the safety of gel nails, but I&#x27;m gonna go for it . I stopped painting my nails a long time ago because I can&#x27;t stand how fast regular polish chips. Getting this done in the salon every two weeks is not a good use of my money, so this is a viable option for now. It has the light with timer options and a regular fan option. I think people should be aware that even though this is LED, it is still UV. It all depends on what spectrum cures the polish you are using. I use the protective gloves (sold separately) and sunscreen when I use it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s awesome......Love it!</li>
    <li> Works good. I love how big it is. Have only tried gelish brand and works good with it.</li>
    <li> This lamp gets the job done for sure! I like being able to put both my hands or feet in there at the same time.</li>
    <li> This is my first uv nail dryer, but I love it!!! The ability to dry both hands/feet at once is great! I&#x27;m learning more and more about it! I believe the key to these dryers is to use good products!</li>
    <li> great product have used it a few times with no problems</li>
    <li> This lamp is GREAT!!!  I love that u can put 2 hands in it and has settings from 90 seconds to 300 seconds.  The only thing I&#x27;d change about it is that each setting had its own start button and it showed how many seconds are left.  So glad I I bought this though.  We&#x27;ll worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I can even use it on my feet.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer works great!  I am so glad I purchased it!  It&#x27;s just like the professional dryers in the salon.  The best feature is that I can put both hands or feet in at the same time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and daughter, and they both love it. My daughter even takes it to her friends&#x27; house so she can do their nails as well. They say it was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Nail dryer is well designed.  Only problem was two lamps were broken when received.  Was able to substitute one bulb from my old dryer but it&#x27;s shorter than other bulbs and older so will probably fail soon.</li>
    <li> Received item as described, professional nail dryer for doing basic manicure, the fan on it is a very low speed fan&lt;br /&gt;I feel it&#x27;s not a quality item, will give it to someone as a gift</li>
    <li> The UV light dryer is exactly what I need for my nail obsession.  I have had other dryers in the past and had issues with all of them this product has resolved all of the issues I had. It is big enough to do both hands (feet) which cuts down on dry time (big plus) timer with auto shut off and a fan make this the perfect at home nail studio.  Love It!</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery, beautiful shape, wide yet light enough to be portable, has gotten much use. Cures correctly every time!</li>
    <li> After several uses the machine will no longer turn on.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I use this with my Red Carpet manicure product.  Can fit both hands or both feet at the same time.  Saves a ton of time.  Wish it had a setting for 30 seconds other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> Item arrived very quickly and has worked beautifully!</li>
    <li> Proffesional in use . The best what I bought for my nails !</li>
    <li> Good machine. Works good , as promised.  Wife likes it.  It takes couple times to learn how to do  the nails, but then - it is just as good as professional salon quality. Saves money.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. She uses it a lot and it hasn&#x27;t broke yet.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this lamp! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble, works perfectly. Can&#x27;t beat this price (purchased with prime on Amazon). Would recommend highly.  My only concern would be where to get replacement bulbs.</li>
    <li> Unfortunattely, I had to return this item due to loss of income due to my brain injury. Hopefully, I will be able to order in the future.</li>
    <li> This light is clearly amazing for a UV light, holding at 5 stars with a whopping 500 plus reviews. I decided, before ordering it, to find replacement bulbs first, because I have read that UV lights require occasional replacement bulbs. I found the right bulbs, each nine watt, and to order six of them for this 54 watt lamp, my order for bulbs cost as much as the lamp itself. So I held my finger over the &amp;#34;Place Order&amp;#34; button, here on Amazon, completely convinced that this UV lamp is absolutely NOT A MISTAKE purchase. I always research before I buy, and I am still convinced this light is one of the best UV LAMPS AVAILABLE, better than the one my nail gal uses at the shop.  But the cost to replace the bulbs stopped me from pressing to order. I ended up buying a lovely LED light instead, because I should never have to replace the bulbs and end up doubling or tripling or quadrupling the cost of the original light by buying bulbs. That said, I didn&#x27;t want to drop $250 for an LED light, either. I found an LED light for $109, it is awesome, and I love that it cures my gels in 30 seconds a layer!  BUT, and it is a big but, I was able to pay a little over 50 bucks more for the LED light, and many gals don&#x27;t have that option. I worried that I had made a bad choice, and maybe my fabulous LED light will break on me. So far, I&#x27;m in love with the super fast cures. I am too much of a klutz to paint all my fingernails on both hands to cure all eight fingers at once to save on curing time. So LED ALLOWS ME TO DO QUICK BETWEEN-layer cures. And I love that. HOWEVER, if I had purchased a UV LIGHT, this was my choice, and I recommend it to friends AND RELATIVES who can&#x27;t afford to drop over $50 more for my LED. REVIEWS TALK!  All these customers who have this light swear by it, except for a dismal few who had bad experiences, for whatever reason. If you can&#x27;t afford an LED, I truly feel this is the best buy out there.  If I hadn&#x27;t been able to step up to LED, I would have this light and probably love it. I really like that it has a fan, plus the light, to dry regular nail polish fast. I talked with a nail tech about &amp;#34;gelly sandwiches&amp;#34; which begin with gel bonder, the gel base coat, regular polish, and a gel top coat. This allows you to use your stash of regular polish for fun colors. I have so many colors that I love in regular polish!  My LED may help dry them faster, but probably not. So though I will save on replacing bulbs with my fab LED light, maybe I will regret that my LED doesn&#x27;t dry regular polish. And, hello, to replace all my regular polish with gel colors would be very costly. In short, did I make a smart choice?  This light rocks according to reviews. I was more concerned about time spent doing my nails. 30 second cures between layers means a lot to this busy lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, in all these fab reviews, I&#x27;ve seen references to heaps of very expensive gel polishes. I use IBD GEL  from base to top, and they are fabulous for so much less. Durable, great color selection, and I am in love. It is the brand my nail tech put on my nails, so I knew IBD WAS GREAT!  I ordered Good Gossip from Gellish, at a bigger cost, because i found it online as as a true ruby slipper color, one of my favorites, only to discover that the Cosmic Red from IBD is the same &amp;#34;ruby slipper&amp;#34; color. Now I have two ruby slipper bottles. I will send one to my niece. First I will compare the durability of the two brands, but with my IBD COLORS WEARNG SO WELL, I will never pay the much higher price again. Hello?  Why would anyone pay dollars more for another brand?  I don&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I am not an IBD rep. I am a novelist who is busy and needs to do her nails at midnight, or whenever I find time. Appointments?  For my hair and doctors, only. Going to the salon takes at least three hours to get my nails done, including driving time. I don&#x27;t feel pampered; instead I feel stressed. At home, it is a treat, and IBD gels, or probably the more expensive gels as well, lend my fragile, chipping, peeling nails strength. With gels I have gorgeous nails, and this light would, I feel certain, give me just as good a cure, taking longer. Not here to sell anyone on anything. I think this light is a great buy, just research the cost of replacement bulbs before you hit &amp;#34;Place Order.&amp;#34;  And find out how often UV bulbs must be replaced. I don&#x27;t know. If they last for two years, how much will you save by doing your own gels?  And, with this light, you can also do &amp;#34;gelly sandwiches&amp;#34; faster because of the fan and heat. Do your math for your wallet. I think this light is stellar, above and beyond most UV lights, and I nearly bought it.. Don&#x27;t know yet if my LED  will stand the test of time..

    <li> Great  product!! I dont want to let anybody know..  because its so~~ nice! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price, Great quality, just worked like a charm to me.&lt;br /&gt;I work as a professional.. strongly recommend. !</li>
    <li> I have been going to salons for over 20 years getting acrylic nails, and I read up on gels.  I was interested in buying a \\&quot;home system\\&quot; and after doing some research I bought this machine, which has tons of great feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NO EXPERIENCE with gels and my first attempt to do my nails came out perfectly!  They look great and it was very, very easy and took less than 10 minutes.  The machine is very user friendly.  Pop the lights in, peel off the blue plastic protective sheet inside, and you are good to go!  It is very spacious - plenty of room for both hands to fit in easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails look absolutely beautiful and no one would guess they were not done at a salon.  The machine basically paid for itself in one use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is they are not quite as \\&quot;hard\\&quot; as acrylics but it is not a problem or issue for me.  And I suspect my nails will get healthier too as time goes by - from what I have read gels are kinder to your nails than acrylics, too, which is another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great service and I will be recommending this to my girlfriends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor was great to work with - I had a question and they got back to me very quickly.  THANK YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: just want to be clear that I removed my old acrylics before starting fresh with clean nails :)</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the item I purchased.  It is not super high quality, but for the price it seems a pretty good deal.  I have used the UV light dryer once,&lt;br /&gt;and it worked really well.  Hopefully it will last a long time.  It comes with a one year warranty, which seems fair.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails because I would always leave the nail salon upset. Before purchasing the nail dryer I would not use anything to dry my nails and would wait for my nails to dry but would always mess them up because I am impatient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This nail dryer came very well packaged from the seller  and worked like a charm.  It is big enough for the both of your hands, and I also love the fact that it has a fan attachment.  To speed up the drying time I apply the Insta-Dry drips to my nails and my nails are dry, literally, in 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> It was larger than expected but works great. Would recommend to any one that wants a nail dryer that is excellent</li>
    <li> I liked the product just fine but..it only worked 4 times!  On the fifth use, so max 4 hours, 3 of the five lights burnt out.</li>
    <li> Love this gel light! I had received a different one as a gift but this one is much better. Being able to fit both hands or feet cuts your time in half. I also love that there are so many time settings and that it has a fan. Great for when you are using regular polish to cut down drying time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this uv light to use with my cnd polish system. It worked prefecture from the start. I&#x27;m excited about how much money I&#x27;ll save using it. My nails always look great now. And they look like a professional did them.</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice and love it so far.  I will certainly recommend this to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Great, fast and easy to use. Big device but light. It takes longer than the leds devices but so much cheaper...</li>
    <li> It was used and I bought new.  It&#x27;s about as big as a toaster oven.  Not worth it unless you have an extra room to store it.</li>
    <li> Works great ... Super fast service!&lt;br /&gt;Nails look Awesome!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Excellent professional quality product. It is made with quality and works fantastically well with any gel polish.  I have saved so much money doing my nails myself !!! I love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a birthday present for my wife and even though it says with it works with all kinds of gel nail polishes it did not work very good with some of the off-brand polishes that she bought.  However when she bought the gelish brand of polishes the light worked flawlessly and gave her the results she was looking for.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced, dries nails in short time (1-2 minutes per application of gel polish). Can use to dry both hand nails at once. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This light works great and is just like what the pros use. I have money by doing my own nails. The product arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Everyone in the family loves it... Well, I love it because my wife loves it. Thanks for everything</li>
    <li> What a great deal! I am so happy..feels like I am at the salon. Really fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> Grand daughter was thrilled to receive this</li>
    <li> I looked around for days trying to find what would be the best UV light to get the job done and this is it. Does everything it is supposed to do and keeps my nails looking great!</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use and it saves me lots of time and money. The results are every bit as good as having my nails done at the salon. My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is a small one. I had to Google the curing times for the different layers of polish since no instructions were included.</li>
    <li> Took a really long time for my nails to dry!!  Wouldn&#x27;t reccomend.</li>
    <li> Works great! Just like at the salon, the tackiness left after the last coat must be wiped off with isopropyl alcohol. I love that for the price of one mani/pedi at the salon I now have what I need to do it at home.</li>
    <li> Worked great at first then the Light went out after a few uses, sent a email to the manufacturer and no response!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works great!</li>
    <li> I like it very much, but a smaller one would have done the job just as well.  I do my own gels at home and could have purchased a one handed dryer.  This is great but it takes up a bit of storage space.</li>
    <li> This lamp works wonderfully.  It&#x27;s HUGE though.  I am just using it for my home use, not professional, so I don&#x27;t need to be able to fit both hands/feet at a time.  I had a tough time finding a place to store it.</li>
    <li> Works great with my Shellac nail system!  Plus it is way bigger than I thought can do both hands at the same time! Great product!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Price was great.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer over a year ago and it still works great. My daughter and I do our nails together every two weeks and the dryer is awesome. We have used different brands of gel polish and all did great. I am buying a second one because our schedules will now not give us time to do our nails together.</li>
    <li> I just bought this unit. It&#x27;s big, far larger than the type used in salons. I left it one for about 1 minute to dry the gel polish. As a first time user I may lack some skills, but indeed my gel is in place and is holding. I used Sally Hansen polish, but will try the types indicated such as OPI, etc. It does work, lights are bright and you can do both hands at the same time.</li>
    <li> Fast professional service. Great buying experience!</li>
    <li> Wifey loves it....!!!!  The fact that it drys gel &amp; acrylic is a major plus. definite hubby points for this gift....!!</li>
    <li> a gift for our daughter - as requested by her; she was very pleased!</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price! :)</li>
    <li> I was expecting the dryer time to be faster.</li>
    <li> It is bigger than I expected, but it works very well and does what it is designed to do. The bottom of the lamp is held in place by 2 little plastic levers that are hard to move and could potentially break easily.  That made it difficult to open the lamp to install the bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;The size of my lamp is perfect also for curing resin finishes on the polymer clay jewelry I make.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Just like the one at the spa, only now I can do my nails while drinking coffee with friends, we have a girls night and the kids just love it as well. Safe, quick drying, just as it says. Thank you for the quick ship!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my daughter for Christmas.  She was excited to try it.  She and her daughters LOVE this product....and they save tons of money not going in for manicures.  My daughter uses it with schellac polish and my granddaughters use regular polish.  Their complaint was always that they got smudges waiting for the polish to dry when they did their own nails.  Now it never happen using this nail dryer.  Super product</li>
    <li> i have no idea how i ever did my nails before this - works amazing with gelish (the only brand i&#x27;ve bought) and i also purchased anti uv gloves to help with my skin (i&#x27;m fair skinned).  works as advertised and is wonderful. would buy again without a doubt.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product!</li>
    <li> good and fast shipping</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter love this.  They use it all the time.  I love not paying the nail salon tons of money.  ;)</li>
    <li> great product at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> Love this light, big and easy to use. Is not a full 5 start because the light bulbs didn&#x27;t stay on place very easy, they even fall out after I close it but I managed to twist them into place and work like a charm. Two big thumbs up. If you are think to do your own gel mani/pedi this is a MOST. Totally recommend it😍</li>
    <li> Works great!!!!  Shipped fast, very reasonable price.  I have 3 daughters so it saves us a ton of money to do-it-yourself at home!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance as a birthday gift and she loves it. She uses it probably every other week and loves the fan and timers on the light. Great deal.</li>
    <li> This UV Nail Dryer works very well for the gel polish. Highly recommend for anyone looking to do their own manicures. My daughter and I are having so much fun doing our own nails!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome. It&#x27;s even better than some of the salons I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Excellent UV light.  Size is perfect for curing both hands or both feet at the same time!  This cuts down on the time to do a gel/shellac manicure in half!  Timer settings are excellent.  Item arrived exactly as described, packaged well and in pristine condition.  I definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Came On Time. Works As It Should. No Issues. Good Buy!</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is awesome:) I am super happy with it:). It is big enough to fit two big hands and then some! Also works great. Drys the gel nails in two minutes.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  It is very big, so be aware.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as part of a gift basket for Breast Cancer Awareness.... EVERYONE wanted to win this basket. Super pleased with the product and the item came very quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome I recommend it</li>
    <li> What a great product! It is very well made and works great. I feel as if I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth! Don&#x27;t be fooled by smaller imitations. This is the real deal and is big enough for both hands to fit in simultaneously. The fan is great and I did not experience any discomfort due to heat,</li>
    <li> Item was purchased for my wife.  Without any prior knowledge of dryers such as this, I used other reviews to make my choice.  I am glad I chose this dryer.  My wife loves it and uses it often.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, my daughter loves it and it has become quite a hit with her friends!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this nail dryer:&#x27;) I have never been more happy with a purchase. Thought I wanted the OPI one but after purchasing this one I told everyone at school about it. THANKS for a good buy!!!!</li>
    <li> This product works very well, no problems. I think I could have used a smaller light, I don&#x27;t need that big one but that is my fault for ordering the big one. I don&#x27;t  have all the paperwork or box so cannot send it back for a smaller light. Again though, it works great. I have read info on the LED light and do wish I would have bought an LED light b/c the wait time is so much shorter. The polish is great, no problem with those.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this company.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This item is big so you have plenty of room for your toes and fingers.  It made my gel polish application fast and easy!</li>
    <li> This product is a joke.  It does not do what the description states that it does; i.e., it does NOT dry/cure gel polish.  I don&#x27;t have the vocabulary to accurately describe how disgusted I am w/Royal Nails Professional UV Light.  For starters there are no directions.  I gave it two attempts, and had the same terrible results both times.  After several minutes under the light, my nails were just as sticky as they were when I first placed them under the light.  For heaven&#x27;s sake, do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t even think about wasting your money on this piece of garbage.  I guarantee you will be sorely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I resent having to provide even a half star for this loser!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Just received this and it does not work. I tried using different outlets, took out the bulbs, put them back in, looked at the fuse - nothing. I suspect it was a returned product in the first place because the bottom was partially open when I went it took it out of the box.</li>
    <li> I purchased this light to use with the Shellac, and Gelish Nail polish.  This item arrived on time, in excellent condition, and was as described in the review.  It will accomodate two hands/feet at one time, speeding up the drying process.</li>
    <li> The Royal Nails UV light is a large product, but awesome.  It&#x27;s easy to set up and easy to use.  I love the different timer settings and the fact that it has a fan.  The fan makes it comfortable to cure your gel polish and it also allows you to use it to dry regular nail polish.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  You get a lot for a little price.</li>
    <li> In comparison with the CND UV lamp, this one is twice the width, has more wattage and 2 more bulbs, and about $100 cheaper. It&#x27;s built a little cheaper, but for the price you pay, I think it&#x27;s well worth it. Some annoyances are that you have to set the timer each time you turn the lamp on, and the fan needs to be turned on separately. There is no digital timer that counts down the seconds, and the fan stays on after the lights time out. These are minor things that take some getting used to after using the CND lamp. I cured my base coat after about 10-20 seconds (no timer so I just guessed) then cured the next coats at 120 seconds, then the top coat at about 160 seconds. I used all CND shellac and it worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> There is enough room for two hands!!! Very roomy my nails look amazing! Couldn&#x27;t believe how Affordable this uv gel light was!!! The individual bulbs went in very easy! Love the multiple timer options. Most other lamps only have two options. I love my lamp and recommend it! In fact I told my girlfriend about it and she bought one for her daughter for Christmas!</li>
    <li> This works great, but even buying it new, there were a few little dings and scratches in the reflective metal inside. One of the lights it came with was slightly bent, but it still works. So visually, the inside looked a little roughed up, but I imagine that is because they stored the plug inside the dryer during shipment. Works amazing though! Cured all my nails perfectly, no matter the brand of polish I used (Red Carpet, Gelish, etc.) in very little time. 90 seconds, if you put on thin layers, is enough time. I used 300 seconds at one point, but that long is completely unnecessary. Love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent, everything I expected. The Royal Nail Dryer is a great product. I already recommended this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> It was just as I expected.  It is compariable with the professional lights.  I love not having to paint my nails daily with regular polish.  The best solution on the market to do at home.  Yes I am not a professional, I do it at home for myself.  I can&#x27;t see paying for someone else to do my nails when I can do the same at home whenever I want.  I hope you enjoy your new uv light when you get it.  You will not regret it.  Have fun changing your nail color when you are ready.  NO APPOINTMENTS</li>
    <li> This product will do both hands at the same time if you choose. The timer is great and there is a fan if you choose although the light does not get hot. I was amazed after looking around at products of the same quality with pricing between $300.0 and $400.00. This was more than I expected for what I paid. I would most definitely buy this again. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I love that the top opens for easy placement of lights and easy cleanup. I also like that it has a fan. I&#x27;m a true novice at shellac, and found that my nails still seemed wet.  But not to worry, that is typical with shellac. All you need to do after the top coat has cured is smooth your nails over with isopropyl alcohol!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I bought 54 Watt UV Light and Nail Dryer because I&#x27;ve always been more of a do it yourselfer and manicures every three weeks is a tad expensive. I really like the fact that it has a dryer.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful!!!! I love it!!! It is big enough for both hands at one time. It has a lot of settings for what ever you need to do with it. I am very happy!!! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this light! It definitely exceeded my expectations! I can fit both my hands in it, I love the fan and different settings for the timer. It dose an amazing job curing them, and not to mention the price is a steal for this product. I was also very pleased with how fast it got to me. I would definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;  Michelle</li>
    <li> I recently got this for my wife after she found out about gel nail polish. She used to get her nails done at a salon for $50-60 a pop, now she does it herself and save us $ and her time going to the salon. She loves this UV light dryer esp how it has a fan. She says it easy to use and dries the nail polish quickly. All I have to say is--- Happy wife&#x3D;happy life! Enough said.</li>
    <li> I used the product on natural nails with regular nail polish.  It dries and hardens the polish and has made the polish last longer.  I have very little patience to sit around and not be able to do anything with my hands while polish dries.  This unit lets me cut that time down, and get on to other things.  I love it!</li>
    <li> my mother gave me this for Christmas and the funny thing is between her and my daughter i do they&#x27;re nails more than i do my own but still a great product</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for a professional,  full sized UV gel nail curing lamp! I didn&#x27;t know at the time of purchase that this is NOT one of those &amp;#34;at-home&amp;#34;/personal sized versions so when the giant box was delivered,  I was a little surprised. But I was pleasantly surprised! I love that it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; because it works wonderfully! I&#x27;ve already used it on myself and friends/family many times and it worked beautifully each and every time. It never failed! The only thing I regret is that I didn&#x27;t do enough research prior to purchasing a UV lamp vs an LED lamp. There&#x27;s been news circulating about the harmful effects of the UV rays emitted by these machines and is linked to skin cancer. It is advised to apply an SPF sunblock on your hands and skin around your nails prior to use or wearing gloves that have the tips cut off. I haven&#x27;t done either of these things because I&#x27;m too lazy so I do wish I had purchased an LED lamp, not becuase they work better, but because I&#x27;m too lazy to take the advised precautions. However, LED lamps cost considerably more than UV and it&#x27;s harder to find a decent one for purchase. But if you are looking for a good UV lamp, this one&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> Received this in the mail today, and was very disappointed. After I inserted the bulbs, it would not turn on. Tried flipping them around and still nothing. When I opened the box, it looked like it definitely had been returned, all the boxes were opened etc. I wouldn&#x27;t have cared had it worked. Also there were no instructions on how to insert them properly. Other than that I would be more than happy to leave another review on a working unit. Until then though this will have to do. Was looking forward to doing my nails today, guess I will have to wait until next week.:(</li>
    <li> This is a great UV lamp! It is big enough for both hands but more importantly both feet as well! I do one hand at a time so that I can answer the phone or deal with anything else while the other hand is curing but I do both feet at the same time and its great! They are done in 10 minuets!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if is the uv light lamp or or  if I am making the processes correctly with base, top coat and nail polishes. I bought because the price, reviews and size. Maybe is great and the colors not . I am going to give a second chance with shellac base, top and colors</li>
    <li> Works great, I cured each layer for 180 seconds...just to be safe...don&#x27;t forget to do the last step--You need to use nail polish remover to get rid of the sticky residue from the polish!</li>
    <li> Works very well,  easy to use and set up.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully well. I have used it about 10 times and have had no issues. The only complaint I have is that it is rather large which makes storage difficult. For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, professional quality.  Came well packaged and easy to use.  No assembly required other than putting in bulbs which was easy.  Can easily fit both hands or feet.  Simple do use.</li>
    <li> Will make a great gift.</li>
    <li> Professional salon results! Had to run a few times, to get the bulbs going as I expected. $ave time and money doing myself. Just need the time to sit down in a relaxed state to do a good job. Worth the compliments I get though. Down side is this unit is really large &amp; I don&#x27;t like having to make room to store it. I can only do one hand at a time, so the large space to fit two hands isn&#x27;t necessary:/</li>
    <li> Love this! It is nice to be able to do both hands at once! I do two minutes for base coat and each coat of polish. Then 3 minutes for the Final coat. Works great my girls love it as well. Also, great for doing your toes :)</li>
    <li> The lamp works great. My nails look fantastic and it was much easier to do than I thought it would be. My only complaint is that I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to set the timer so I used the timer on my phone</li>
    <li> This UV dryer works very well with the CND nail shellac products.  It has automatic timing settings which are very helpful.  I was surprised at how large it is - can do both hands or feet at the same time.  I think this was well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This Item goes above and beyond expectations! Not some small cheap light! This was good size and does both hands or feet! A cosmotologist also suggested this item!! Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I bought this UV Gel Nail Dyer for two reasons: one I was tired of paying for the work being done at the salon and two because of the great ratings I have read on the product.  I was not disappointed and you will find the item to be professional grade.</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time and love how easy it is to use with its  built in timer.  I was able to quickly install the bulbs and was ready to go in no time!  It is a big machine, but I love that I can save time by doing both hands at the same time.  The thing that sold me on this one is that it had a dryer as well so that I could use it to dry regular nail polish if I don&#x27;t want to do shellac.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This UV lamp is excellent! it dries my gel very fast and the fan works great for drying my regular nail polish as well! Also, the size of this lamp is awesome! I can to put both of my hands and feet inside of this lamp at the same time! I&#x27;m displaying this lamp at my room and all of my friends love it!</li>
    <li> Had to send first one back as it did not light up. The fan worked. Just received second one and it did light up but the fan doesn&#x27;t work! Daughter has one and it works great. That is why I ordered one.</li>
    <li> Good product, dry very fast.</li>
    <li> This light was everything I expected it to be! Works great and allows me to give myself a salon gel manicure just as nice! I&#x27;ve used it multiple times with the polish brand Gelish, and with a job where I wash my hands a million times a day, it actually stays on for about 2 weeks!! Finally found a way to keep my nails in shape and healthy! Easy to use and convenient for your home! Great product - Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend who is always doing her nails and struggling to make them last.  She is raving about how much longer the polish holds after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Plus I got plenty of brownie points for getting it for her as a gift. :)&lt;br /&gt;Guys, buy your woman this product.</li>
    <li> Works great with pretty much any gel nail polish, is large enough for two hands/feet, and has several settings. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have a CND UV lamp that I paid 150.00 for and it only does one hand at a time and is very small. I received two of these today, easy to install liht bulbs and you can do both hands at once comfortably, I was amazed at the quality for 50.00 each, they look very professional and will be so great to work with! Shipped fast and were vwry well packaged! LOVE!!!!!</li>
    <li> Seriously! I will never pay to have my nails done again! This thing is great! This is the easy bake oven for nails! Stop thinking and just buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for use by my daughters and I.  We have only used it once as we just purchased it, but found it to be great.  It has excellent power and plenty of room for two hands or feet. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Iwas amazed when I got this product -54 WATT ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL AND ACRILIC NAIL DRYER &amp; CURING.  I had been using a smaller setup that required a much longer curing time. This one is much larger.  I found it big enough to put both feet or hands into it cutting down curing time.  It also has a timer which I found to be a big help.Overall the product is great and a terrific value for your money.</li>
    <li> This is an affordable, elegant machine.  It has all the bells &amp; whistles.  Love the timer &amp; fan features.  The bulbs popped in very easily &amp; the icons make this machine very user friendly.  Great value.</li>
    <li> Have only used once, think I had gel on too thick and took a long time to dry.  I hope will be better after practice.</li>
    <li> I had heard from friends about how cool shellac nails are and how long the polish lasts on them. I decided to get the stuff to do it as a gift for my daughters (and myself!) for Christmas. This light works great, and it is SO nice that it&#x27;s big enough to do both hands or both feet at the same time. Saves a ton of time! I love the shellac - my older daughter did my younger daughter&#x27;s nails about a week and a half ago, and it still looks perfect...not a single chip! I&#x27;m totally sold on it. The light is very simple to use - pretty much self explanatory. We just went on YouTube to learn all the tricks for doing shellac nails, which was very helpful. You will not regret buying this light and switching over to shellac.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It&#x27;s saved me a lot of money by not going to a salon.  I wish I would have tried it sooner.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny I spent on this gel light unit.  Might have been able to get by with a smaller unit, but so glad I spent the extra money for the larger unit.  I have no worries I will bump into the sides or top when sliding my hand or foot into the unit, nicking the gel.  Gel is the only way to go and now that I&#x27;m doing it myself at home (and for friends, if I want), this unit has already paid for itself with the savings from salon prices.  Just watch a couple of tutorials on You Tube and you&#x27;re ready to go.  Easy Peasy!!  Also, the seller was great, delivered and billed as promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product new and when I received it, the seal was broken and there was nail polish all over the inside. BUYER BEWARE!!!!! WHAT YOU PURCHASED IS NOT WHAT YOU WILL BE RECEIVING!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this. It works perfectly and is saving me tons of money that would have been spent at a salon. Fan keeps everything cool. Plenty of room for  hands and for feet.</li>
    <li> Yes love this !! Really important that you use the rubbing alcol after top coat.. I used even a Q tip .. But cotton ball or cotton pad will work also !!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lamp for a gift to use with Shellac nail polish. I looked for days to find a good dryer with a fan and timer.  I am told that this dryer is awsome and works great.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> I really like my nail light and the price was awesome...</li>
    <li> This lamp works great. Four stars due to one bulb being broken on delivery. You can easily put both hands, or feet inside.</li>
    <li> Beyond expectations.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Works good. A little bulky in size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in total love with this ligjt.. worth buy it..</li>
    <li> i feel like for 54 watts It doesn&#x27;t fry as fast as I&#x27;d like but it gets the job done! Just takes longer!</li>
    <li> This UV gel light came quickly and included whatever was in the description. I am a former nail technician and I bought this for personal use. I use Gelish polishes and it drys the layers very well. for myself I like to use a few extra seconds at the end just for assurance. I do gel for my mother, it stays on her nail for two weeks or more, my fingernails are very picky on any polishes, nothing would stay on them, my previous light I could keep the polish for 2-3 days. this light kept it for a week almost perfectly I just took off the polish because I wanted a different of the color. Gelish with this light stays well on my toes. Dont apply polish too close to cuticle.</li>
    <li> This is a full size UV light.  It is easy to use.  I didn&#x27;t want a small device where you had to cure your 4 fingers first, then you thumb separately.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and works great...glad I made this purchase and so reasonably priced and much easier than going to the nail salon and waiting I get the same results and now I save time and money.</li>
    <li> I have used  my 54 watt Royal nails twice and am highly satisfied with the product. This is larger than most dryers. It will accommodate both hands at once.</li>
    <li> This item is wonderful, works very well. Has multiple timer settings. Bulbs are easy to place in the machine. Able to fit both hands in at same time with plenty of room.</li>
    <li> I am not a faithful nail user...but so far this has extended the life of my home manicures.  Big enough to fit both hands (or feet) inside, quiet operation.  Would give 5 stars if there was a timed button on it, but I just set the alarm on my phone and relax until it buzzes.  Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a manicure since I bought this six months ago or so. I love that I can put both hands in at the same time and get the job done. That said, it&#x27;s a BIG unit, so if you&#x27;re looking for space-saving, this is not your model. I haven&#x27;t yet had to change a bulb, so I can&#x27;t speak to the ease of that, but I chose this one partly because the bulbs are easy to come by. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I watched the you tube video on the correct way to put in the bulbs. every thing worked perfect. did my nails with the soak off gel polish the first day I got it. &amp;#60;this was also the first time I have ever done soak off gel polish..&amp;#62;  I like the size. I put both hands in at the same time. saved a lot of time. Didn&#x27;t know what to expect after reading some of the neg reviews. Not sure what happened to them. ??  I guess things can get damaged in shipping. But mine is working just as described that it would. It is larger than the single hand units, but Hey!! lol, I expected that. haven&#x27;t done my toes yet, but looking forward to doing that when my toes need to be redone. If you want a two hand uv light this works great. I would say get it. If you happen to get a damaged one threw shipping. Amazon is good to exchange for  another unit. Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the sellers fault. More of the shipping.  which could happen to any unit that is shipped.</li>
    <li> This product is everything it says it is. I can do both hands at one time. It drys your nails fast. I usually go for 2 minutes for gel nails, but have done them in 90 seconds. It&#x27;s easy to use. The bottom flips open to easily install the light bulbs.</li>
    <li> I really like this UV light nail dryer. I had looked at several before deciding on this Royal Nails, and I&#x27;m glad. It is very easy to operate, light weight and it is an attractive dryer. I use my computer lap holder to work on my nails it makes the process smooth. Dries fast and there is a fan to speed up the drying. My nails look just like the salon manicure and lasts just as long.</li>
    <li> I love this machine! I based buying a gel machine off the reviews from customers and this machine stands true to the reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already used once and so has a friend (it&#x27;s already paid for itself)!! The gels came out amazing and lasted! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This UV lamp exceeded my expectations.  I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it.  I have used it twice so far to do my own Shellac manicures at home.  They came out just as good or better than when I had them done at the salon.  Thank you for offering such a great, quality lamp!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my daughter for a Christmas present.  It is larger and nicer than I expected.  I gave this product 4 stars because I am waiting for my daughter to use it and let me know what she thinks about it.  I believe that she is going to love it.</li>
    <li> Before I started using the Acrylic Polishes along with the nail dryer, my nails were very brittle - but after using the products I can honestly say that my nails look healthy &amp; beautiful all the time without the expense of the salon!!</li>
    <li> This UV light works great, and has different time options to help cure gel polish that needs longer than 120 seconds. This product is great quality and has 56 watts that make curing even better and faster. There is also room for both hands at the same time with out bumping into each other. I highly recommend this product to professionals, as well as newbies because the product is so easy to use. One suggestion however, make sure to remove the bluish film from the top before installing the bulbs, and the bottom before using the light. My box did not come with instructions so I was unaware I needed to do this until I read someone else&#x27;s review. Luckily I had not attempted to cure my nails before I read the review, don&#x27;t know what would have happened! Lastly, I am in awe everytime my I look at my nails because they look great. No more acrylic for me, I am hooked on gel. I also purchased my light from Amazon at xmas time for 52$, so if this item is not on sale think about waiting if you want to save money; usually most items go on sale approx every six weeks.</li>
    <li> I had two problems...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- I read a review that mentioned how easy it was to install the lamps and pull out the blue film out of the dryer ONCE YOU OPENED THE TOP. The problem was, the instructions that came with the package had NO information on how to to that. (And I was afraid to force it and brake it) I contacted the seller and they answered me with the NEW instructions on an e-mail (during the holidays). It&#x27;s true... It is MUCH easier to to all of these when you open the TOP.  (In case yours come without those instructions too, I&#x27;ll tell you at the end of this review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- When I finished my nails I thought it didn&#x27;t work. (I&#x27;m a beginner).  I finished and sprayed them with 99% alcohol (Like the girl at the salon does) and washed them in the sink and they were still tacky. THEN when I was trying to remove the polish to start again, they were perfect. One thing NO ONE TELLS beginners like me is... They are Tacky at the end. You MUST rub them with the alcohol and wash them intensively in the sink with soap.&lt;br /&gt;I have so far done 2 manicures and they turned out perfect! I followed some other review and I leave 120 seconds on base coat and each gel coat and put the max. 300 seconds at the end (Just to be sure). But It probably can be done with less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO OPEN THE DRIER:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flip it upside down. There are two plastic wholes with some plastic hook in each. You have to slide the plastic hook out of the whole and lift The BOTTOM up. Mine came kind of crooked so I needed my husband&#x27;s help for strength to open it.&lt;br /&gt;Even with the force applied, it did not brake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS DRYER IS GREAT! And great priced too. GET IT.</li>
    <li> This uv nail dryer is wonderful! It has so much room for both my hands or feet without bumping them in to each other.</li>
    <li> I am a professional nail tech and this lamp works as well as my $300 one.  Not sure how long it will last but for now it&#x27;s doing the job and doing it well.  :)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas who was spending $40 every other week to get her nails done. She has quit going to the salon because this product is so good.  Her nails look just like a professional salon stylist did them.  Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome UV nail dryer.  I found it easy to set up and super easy to use!  So far I have only used it with regular polish but I plan on using it with shellacs!</li>
    <li> Use the directions on gelish.com and the light is excellent!</li>
    <li> I originally ordered a cheaper product and I got what I paid for. Product was cheap and didn&#x27;t work. Paid a little more for for this product and it was well worth it.  Easy to put the bulbs in. Worked perfectly. Has several timers on it along with a dryer. Plenty of room in it for both hands. Really a good professional model and I got it very quickly. Company has contacted me several times to ask my opinion of how I liked the product.</li>
    <li> Awesome light cured my gel polish so fast, looks like I went to the salon! Both hands fit very fast shipping, don&#x27;t second yourself order this light, very well priced for such a great product</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to attempt to do my own nails not being able to afford to get them done on a regular basis. The previews were rated excellent so I decided to purchase.  The item arrived on time as stated and was packaged very well. The bulbs were easy to insert as I lifted up the compartment which I learned from reading a preview.  I did my nails for the first time.  The lamp worked very efficient.  My nails came out very nice.  I am very happy with this product.  I also used it on my feet with regular polish, dried quickly.  Glad I purchased the product.</li>
    <li> Performs exactly as expected. I love that I can fit both of my pampered pedi feet in there for a faster curing time to cuteness :)</li>
    <li> Great lamp. Make sure that you use 90% or higher alcohol on your cotton swabs as your last step. Otherwise, your nails will be sticky and you will think the dryer didn&#x27;t work. I was pleasantly surprised that the lamp worked so well considering the low price tag.</li>
    <li> been using it twice a month for the last 3-4 months, works great.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my girlfriend. She couldn&#x27;t believe the price I got it for. Most beauty stores locally have similar items, less than half the size for this exact price, or a few more dollars. She used it the night she opened it, and loved it. It was a homerun gift. Excellent quality and the price was incredible.</li>
    <li> Much larger than I expected!  I can easily fit two hands in it at a time.  It has a fan and UV bulbs that can be changed.  I got this one because I had previously purchased a cheap smaller one handed light but it was not strong enough to cure the OPI pastel colors.  This light works great!  I love the timer options too!</li>
    <li> Had a cheap, small, portable UV light which had served its time (not long, you get what you pay for). So when that one died, I decided to spend the money and get a real one. This is it! My days of professional expensive manis and pedis are over.  I do a regular mani/pedi for myself anytime it suits me, for pennies. The big trick? A clear top coat called Seche Ultra-V which I buy at my neighborhood beauty supplies store. (Not sure if Amazon carries it.)  Finish my mani and pedi with this clear top coat, then cure under the SUPER UV light, and voila, it&#x27;s like instant gel nails without the high cost of gel polish and professional processing. The end result is similar to spray paint with a clear lacquer. No chipping, no scuffs, no scratches, no fading. So no need to invest in gel polishes. On the one hand, they are expensive, and on the other hand, the color choices are limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the best part of all? When you feel like a change of color? It comes off like regular polish. No need to soak off gel polish. My days of professional mani and pedi are done! Yabbadabbadoooooo!</li>
    <li> It came quickly, looked really nice. Wouldn&#x27;t work right out of the box....sent it right back. Had to go to a beauty store and purchase one. It was the 2nd one I bought on line within 3 Weeks neither one worked. I guess some products need to be purchased locally to avoid all the shipping and returning.</li>
    <li> I use it frequently.  It&#x27;s awesome!!!!  I have saved at least $100 per month by doing my own gel nails. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the high reviews and the fact that I thought I could save a bit of money by doing my own nails instead of going to the salon.  If you are looking for a product that works like the dryers at the salon, this is absolutely not it. I have tried using it several times and it just does not dry my nails at all.  Most recently I did my toes and between each coat I let my feet sit under the fan and the lights for five minutes. My nails were still sticky when I finished the top coat, so I let them sit under the dryer for an extra 20 minutes. I never have to sit that long at the salon, and when I leave the salon my nails are perfectly dry.  Every single time I have used this machine I have ended up with smudged, messed up nails, because it quite simply does not dry them. Much as I would have liked to save the money, the volume of time it takes to mess with this machine and the fact that it totally doesn&#x27;t work, ultimately just costs me far more in productivity than any I would have saved.</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> My friend loved hers. The instructions are none existent in regards to the polish. Very nice and its really roomy.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is absolutely in love with it. If there was a fire in the house, she&#x27;d rescue this thing before waking me to get out of the house. I kid you not.</li>
    <li> My order came in two days!  I love this UV light because you can cure both hands at the same time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my daughter who is currently in beauty school.  She absolutely loved it.  She has taking it to school and all the other student wanted one.  This price was marked as as 75% savings on buying from others.  This was a great buy!</li>
    <li> Works great, good product, performs as advertised.  After about 4 uses it paid for itself in savings over getting my nails done at a salon ever again.</li>
    <li> The machine worked great!! Loved it..  I purchased the nail products (Gelish Basix Kit) was a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t work..  after I was done, it looked like I went to the salon and had my nails done!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is VERY easy to operate! I pulled it out of the box, installed the bulbs, and was using it within minutes!! It works very well, and very quickly! I was surprised at how large it was, but it was a pleasant surprise, and it allowed me to dry both hands at the same time. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent price. This was a gift for my girlfriend and she simply love it. Well constructed and durable.</li>
    <li> Royal Nail dryer.I love it. It works great. Easy to use.Can do both feet at one time. Saves time. Very easy to put the bulbs in and your ready to go.</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised and works great.</li>
    <li> It is nice, you have to hit the timer more than once to get it to start.&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve in the proper nail painting technique to get the best result.</li>
    <li> I researched and read many reviews before purchasing and this product has lived up to the reviews.  Works great for gel nail polish and so much more affordable than many other versions.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. It&#x27;s pretty much what I thought it would be. Bigger than I thought.</li>
    <li> Wife / Kids love this thing.  it works great and we have not had any issues with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these for Christmas presents and they arrived very quickly and were well packaged. Only one has been opened so far and the giftee is thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> This Royal Nails Dryer is wonderful. It really does what it claims. It cures/dries the thickest of polishes or lacquers. No more ruined nails - thinking they are dry enough. I love the size, very roomy. I can do both hands which really cuts down the time. The unit is pretty sturdy. I am very satisfied. I have not had it for that long....so I am not sure about the longivity of the UV Bulbs. So far so good.</li>
    <li> This was requested by my Step-daughter for Christmas so I ordered from Amazon.  It arrived super-fast and my step-daughter says it works wonderfully well.  The price was great too.  A great transaction, thank you.</li>
    <li> Wish it had 1 minute intervals instead of a minute and a half, but still works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the positive reviews here on amazon.  I&#x27;m new to Shellac nail polish and wanted to make sure I did it right. The dryer works just as it should. It has convenient controls and the fan is nice. My nails came out very well!  They look great! I would recommend this light. The only feature I miss is a timer that counts down the time so you know how much time is left. Other than that, it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 4/29/13 To the seller: I have left this review as requested, yet you are still contacting me to leave a review and receive a pair of UV Gloves for doing so. You have a nice product, but don&#x27;t promise something &amp; then not follow through. Today is the third time you&#x27;ve requested I leave you a review. Please stop.</li>
    <li> This dryer is very nice.  It has room to place both hands or feet comfortably in it, saving lots of time.  It has a nice appearance and keypad. It has several timers which is convenient.  However, the instructions are very lacking and did not have information on operating the keypad, how to install the lightbulbs and the fact that you can open the bottom by pushing on the two catches located underneath, which became apparent while trying to install the lightbulbs because one side came undone and partially opened.  Once that was discovered, it made the bulb installation go very easily and it will be easy to keep clean.  So far I really like this dryer and would highly recommend it.  My comment to the manufacturer would be to include better instructions!</li>
    <li> The only drawback to this unit is the size as it takes up a large amount of counter space.  But the unit is lightweight and stores easily.  All and all, I am very pleased with this purchase.  Wish I could find a deal on the polish.</li>
    <li> I received my order on the day it was promised, This was my first time too do gel nails , I did my toes &amp; was able too dry both feet at the same time this was very easy too use my nails where completely dry &amp; smooth with a nice shine . next the hands , If you are thinking of making a purchase don&#x27;t hesitate !</li>
    <li> I received this product on time. I was excited about trying this product at home. I am currently taking a  Nail Tech course and wanted to be able to use a lamp that would work with more than one gel polish and with this product I&#x27;m able to do that. I have used this product several times. I like the fact that its big enough to place both hands or feet inside of the unit which saves me time. I highly recommend anyone who is looking for a lamp that cures gel polishes that are to be used with any a uv light or led light. It works for any of them.</li>
    <li> THIS UV LIGHT TAKES A LONG TIME TO BAKE WITH OPI I FIND. SO IT TAKES OVER 15 MIN JUST TO DO ONE HAND.  IF YOU DONT LET IT STAY IN LIGHT LONGER IT PEELS RIGHT AWAY.. NOT A GREAT PRODUCT WITH OPI</li>
    <li> this lamp is awesome!  both hands fit with ease.  the bulbs were easy to install, but be sure to remove the blue film before you install them.  i love the ease of selecting 1, 2 or 3 minutes for curing and there&#x27;s even a fan if you prefer to have one going.  the lights shut off after the selected time so you don&#x27;t have to watch a timer.  it has made doing my gel manicures so much easier than when i only had the 1-hand LED light. before i had to cure 4 fingers at a time and then thumbs separately.  now i can cure in less time and i have never had gel polish that didn&#x27;t cure properly.  I love this lamp and i paid the same price for this professional lamp as i did for the very small LED light (about $55).</li>
    <li> i bought this for a family member along with the shellac products for christmas and this honestly works great! the price is really good.  i would say this is even better than what they have at the nails salons just because it dries up quicker and you dont have to worry about any smudges as when you&#x27;re leaving the nail salon</li>
    <li> This light is perfect. My shellac nails look better than they did when I had them done in a salon. I love that it is big enough that both hands can fit without fear of bumping on the side or top. Shipping was great too. I ordered on sat and received this on Monday.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations. Large enough to easily fit both hands/feet in at the same time. Prompt service with no hassles. Dries/hardens quickly and multiple settings makes everything that much easier. Would absolutely recommend! ~Sara</li>
    <li> Great product for the $$. Works like a charm. Timer is great for doing someone elses nails as well as your own. Very user friendly. Easy to change the bulbs.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this for my wife, because she has been wanting to get into doing nail art and just isnt happy with the lackluster nail polishes. We bought the Royal Nail UV light and were extremely happy with the ease of setup and that it was up and running in ten to fifteen minutes. It was shipped out immediately and came within two days; a full day before estimated delivery. It is a sturdy machine, of better quality than some you may find in the parlors. Very roomy and large design; I should know my size 14 mens feet fit side by side and still dont touch the walls or mirrors. Overall, we are ecstatic to have bought this product and will never hesitate to recommend or buy from this seller ever again!</li>
    <li> I have had this UV light for about a month and I really love it! I tried it on my friends and they love it as well. I am not a professional and I just cannot afford to get it done at a salon every week, however, I love doing my nails at home and this UV light is AWESOME! My nails dry quicker than ever and it works well with the Shellac nail polishes that I ordered from an online website. I read a lot of reviews before ordering this product, and I must say, I am so glad I decided to make this purchase.If you are thinking about getting a UV lamp, make sure to look into this one first! The packaging was great (best I have ever seen), shipping was super FAST, and the product looked new and in great condition! It works well straight out from the box and still does. I will continue to update my review about this product since it is just incredible!</li>
    <li> I have had three of these, this one was the least expensive, worked as well as the most expensive. Nice size, easy to use. I would recommend it, am very happy with mine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 2 weeks now and I love it! Arrived nicely, just had to pop the bulbs in, and I got started right away! This is by far, way better than using traditional nail lacquer. I&#x27;ve used Sephora by Opi with this and the results were great and my toes still look great after two weeks. I&#x27;ve done my nails three times on the hands, just because I wanted to try different colors. Sephora by Opi is great, worth the extra money. I&#x27;ve tried Finger Paints gel polish and I was NOT happy with the results, so steer clear of that brand. I&#x27;ll do an update a few months from now, but so far.. this is a GREAT BUY! Nice quality, works great, and totally happy!! I researched A LOT of different options before settling on this one - this is the one to buy!!</li>
    <li> I received this fantastic product from a friend for my birthday. I used it right away with some other products I received (Shellac) and gave myself my very first Shellac manicure. This UV Light is fantastic - very easy to use and does the job perfectly. The best features of all are the fan, built-in timer and the ability to cure both hands at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVED this gift and know I will use for a long time.</li>
    <li> Love it, it would have been wonderful if directions telling of the approximate seconds that would be needed for the different phases of gel application...I am still guessing, but the machine is wonderful!</li>
    <li> works great and was shipped fast.</li>
    <li> The nail dryer is way better then expected. It is phenomenal and at a reasonable price. Love that it has a fan and can fit both hands perfectly fine. It is amazing and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This light is a must have for beautiful gel nails and gel polish in a hurry.  It cures polish in less than a minute and you can be on your way.  I would recommend it to anyone who prefers doing their own nails over sitting in a salon.</li>
    <li> I adore this dryer, I wanted to be able to do my own gel nails at home and needed a functional yet reasonably priced dryer and this fit the bill.  Once it arrived I was already impressed as it was larger than I expected, it can easily fit two large hands or moderately sized feet inside at the same time.  This can came in very handy when in a time crunch with your toes, or perhaps doing nails for your friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer has multiple timer settings on it, starting and 90 seconds and going up from there.  It also has the option to just leave the light on constantly.  The built in fan keeps it from over heating which is also a nice feature.  It has a sturdy design and easily cures my Gelish polish in no time.  The only issue I had was initially getting it open to install the light bulbs, but that was more me not wanting to mess up my current manicure at the time.  A little help from someone without a pretty manicure and it all was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m able to do my nails at home for a fraction of the cost of going to the salon, and even for my friends!  Sometimes they even let me try out different colors and designs on them.  Why not?  When you have the ability to change it yourself.</li>
    <li> I ordered this UV light as a Christmas gift for myself and my daughters. Since I already had the gel polishes, I was ready for a mani on the 26th. I am very pleased with this light so far. We&#x27;ve only used it once but I can tell this light will be popular. It is easy to install the supplied light bulbs and to essentially figure out the timers; however, I do recommend reading the instructions for use before doing your first manicure.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Did mine and my daughters nails, already half paid for uv light itself. Hope to save tons doing them myself!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves her new nail dryer. The product works as advertised and we have not had any problems. The difficulty is with applying the gels and polishes. In time.</li>
    <li> Great Value for your money.  The wattage is higher than other products for the same money.  It is a little bulky but this dryer lets you put both hands in at once.  I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails since purchasing and this product has paid for itself.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase. Exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> I love this UV light and nail dryer!  I know I will get better at painting my nails, and I stand to save a TON of money doing this myself at home.  SO EASY!!!  Super clear directions, well packed - it all arrived in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> I have used this a few times and feel it was a great value for the money. I like the timer feature and the fan to circulate the heat. It&#x27;s big enough to use both hands or feet. I use it with CND products and have saved $$$ instead of going to the salon.</li>
    <li> Worked as described. Use for gel nails and works perfectly w/o spending big money...just follow instructions properly!!</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This light works perfectly. It&#x27;s very large but very decent for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product came fast great space</li>
    <li> Love it! Does a great job with gelish and shellac.</li>
    <li> I should have invested in this years ago! I love at home manis and pedis and prefer to save the money from the salons on shoes and handbags instead. Well with this light, I&#x27;ll certainly be saving trips to the salon. Now with gel polishes, I indulge less often but am glad I can do it at home</li>
    <li> Love my new uv lamp! I&#x27;ve been using it with the gelish polish and it works perfect.  My color has been on over a week and no sign of lifting, peeling or chipping.  Great light at a great price!  Lights were very easy to install,  read directions to open bottom, makes installing so easy.</li>
    <li> It appeared to be &amp;#34;new in box&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely have fallen in love with this product. It dries Gelish,Shellac,regular polish,etc within a couple minutes. It has a built in fan. I love that it dries both hands or both feet at once. I have several friends that purchased the uv light you can only dry one hand at a time &amp; they wish they had went with this type. I love mine &amp; have no complaints! I would also recommend this seller! Very quick &amp; easy transaction!</li>
    <li> I bought this after my cheapo one from Groupon crapped out. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the light to be as big as it is. I can fit both hands into it easy, I think I could probably squeeze a foot in there too if I was flexible enough. Easy to assemble and use, just pop open the bottom hatch, insert the lights, then turn it on and select the timer you need. Cured my CND nail polish thoroughly and quickly. I highly recommend this light, for the wattage you get, and being able to paint all your nail then have them cure at the same time without bumping into the roof of the device, and it has a fan to assist in drying or if the lamp heat is getting to you.</li>
    <li> This was very easy to use.  You just need to put all the bulbs in and take off all the plastic protective covering.  My nails turned out great!  Now I don&#x27;t have to spend $30 every to weeks to get my nails done.</li>
    <li> I bought a similar light at a professional beauty supply store and it was $150.00. I saw this one on amazon and I bought it for $55.55 plus shipping and its just a good as the professional one....So I saved $100.00 by getting this one. I have been using it alot doing my  nails and my friends and it is a great product</li>
    <li> The machine was quite a disappointment; it does not work properly, the space between the hand and the lights is too wide, so if you leave the lights on for too long to dry out the nails it burns your hands.  The lights do not do the job properly, so it takes a long time to dry and still it does not dry very well.  I tried to ship it back but the time to return had expired.  I would not sell it on Amazon anymore, it is of very poor quality!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!! Great product overall, light weight, and very easily portable!</li>
    <li> This lamp is perfect. Has cured both my cnd and gellish products correctly. When I first received my lamp one of the bulbs was shattered in packaging. Emailed seller and they were quick to respond sending me a new bulb right away free of charge. I am a nail tech. For those who are not satisfied with this lamp, make sure it is not YOU with the problem. Know how to use product and equipment correctly. This lamp is great, exactly as described. Very satisfied!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure I would really like the gel or shellac nails, but wanted to try them at home.  This nail dryer works very well for drying regular nail polish (you don&#x27;t have to turn on the UV light), and with my UV top coat.</li>
    <li> I am so Impressed with the quality AND love the money I&#x27;m saving by doing my own nails!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> When I first recieved this order, I was devastated.  The machine was dead.  I was upset, but the seller contacted me immediately to make this situation right.  The problem did not originate with them.  They are wonderful to work with.  I reordered the same machine since it had the best reviews.  Very glad I did.</li>
    <li> Love it thanks. Does everything i need it to do. Better than my old &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; light.</li>
    <li> I love this UV light. Definitely worth my money. If I knew what I was getting I would&#x27;ve payed more for it, but thank God I didn&#x27;t. My clients love it too</li>
    <li> Sooo good! I bought this based off of other reviews and I am VERY happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s easy to use and the very first time I did my own nails with it they turned out great! I got the geliish starter kit and some gelish polishes to go with it. As easy as it is, I&#x27;ll be doing my own nails from now on and saving tons of money in the long run.</li>
    <li> Well, almost 5 stars. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and it is still a learning experience for me.  The unit itself is good quality and you can fit two hands or feet in together.  I only wish it had a 30 second and a 60 second timer.  The shortest is 90 seconds.</li>
    <li> Great fast delivery. Can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> I am using my dryer for few weeks already, it works great! In the very beginning I thought I will return it because my top it off coat was tacky, I didn&#x27;t know I have to clean it with alcohol. I looked online to see why is it so, and my problem was solved! I am glad I didn&#x27;t return it!</li>
    <li> this is a very nice unit. it drys my gel. polish in to time.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday present for my 16 year old niece.  She LOVES it.</li>
    <li> This is a great multifunction gel dryer and I love it and I want to marry it probably!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Good price. Very hapy</li>
    <li> I love the size of this light.  I can fit both hands or both feet in the light at once.  It was easy to &amp;#34;assemble&amp;#34; and get started.  So far I have used it with OPI and CND polishes and it works for both.</li>
    <li> perfect!! can fit both hand at the same time, that saves so much time when doing the gel polish.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a good quality nail dryer and this one hasn&#x27;t let me down. It was easy to set-up. Great product at a decent price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and needed an updated machine. I didn&#x27;t feel like spending $200 on one because gels are not my primary business. This machine works awesome,  I&#x27;ve had no problems</li>
    <li> This is a gift for a friend. It arrived in good condition and I know she is going to love it.</li>
    <li> The UV light is great.  I am not a nail professional and have great success with my nails.  The light is simple to use.  Ordering from this company was great - they were prompt in delivering.</li>
    <li> I am overjoyed with this purchase! The drying time is quick and effective. The set-up is fast and easy. I only wish the cord were longer.</li>
    <li> This product works great and does a good job curing my nails. I would buy this product again and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very active as a swimmer/runner, but it&#x27;s scrubbing dishes around the house with my fingernails that really does them in. I got into gel nails a few months ago to try and protect my nails from breaking and look professional when I go to work. So far, the gel system has worked really well and I love the durability. I bought this lamp when assembling my kit and here are a couple of things I wish I&#x27;d known about gels in general and this lamp in particular when I was getting started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This lamp is really big. It takes up an entire shelf in my bathroom linen closet. If you do your nails yourself as I do, you&#x27;re only going to need to do one hand at a time anyway. A smaller system would probably have fit my lifestyle better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The lamp is sturdy, well constructed and the little fan is nice to move the air as it can get hot under the UV lights. The buttons are easy to push -- which matters when you have wet nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Gel polish is viscous and moves when it&#x27;s wet, so you aren&#x27;t likely to do a whole hand and let it sit there before you put it under the light to set. Thus far, I&#x27;ve only managed to do a finger or 2 at a time before needing to cure it. Especially when building a nail with the base coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. That being said, Gel polish cures in 30 seconds with LED lights and in 2 minutes with UV light. That means, using a UV light like this one, it takes 2 minutes, minimum. Per finger. Per coat. Every. Time. So... a base coat, plus two coats of color, plus 1 top coat (doing two fingers at a time per application) is 24 minutes under the UV light PER HAND. And if you are building a nail with 2-3 base coat applications, add to that. Perhaps it is faster if doing someone else&#x27;s nails -- where you can manage a whole hand at a time, or after I&#x27;m more experienced at it. But I wish I had known the difference in curing times between LED and UV systems and had had a better idea of the length of time it took to cure before purchasing my system. Keep in mind how much time you have to devote to your nail process before deciding whether to go with an LED or UV system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Gel nails take a long soak in acetone to get off. I did my toes when I first got the kit... and love the look. Which is good, because I haven&#x27;t mustered up the courage to soak my feet in acetone long enough to get the polish off... Somehow getting the polish off my hands (by soaking cotton balls in acetone and wrapping the nails in tinfoil doesn&#x27;t seem as hard as doing that to my toes. I love the fact that this kit is big enough for both my feet, but I&#x27;m thinking that i may stick to regular polish on my feet in the future and keep my gels for my hands where the durability is really needed. But to each her own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. I gave this a 4 star rating because I truly like the lamp. It feels really durable, was super easy to assemble (put the lights in the lamp) and works! It may be more lamp than I really need, but it&#x27;s giving me the nails I want. Super!em.

    <li> The best UV nail dryer! I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Sleek design, and a fan dryer that keeps you from feeling baked, but is hardly audible.&lt;br /&gt;As a beginner with gel polish, this product is straightforward and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product that gives you more than your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> This is my first uv dryer. I do like the different time setting and it cures evenly. What I dislike about it is it is very big and bulky. I find it hard to do pedicures with. If the bottom was removable it would be better.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to see the uv nail dryer when I received it as it is definitely big and looks good. Went and bought sally Hansen base and top coat and the nail polish.  Spent more money than I would have at the salon. I followed all the directions, even you tubed videos on how to do gel manicure at home but my nails just wouldn&#x27;t dry. I used the light for 120 sec with base coat , 5 mins with polish and again 3 mins with the top coat. It was wet for hours then I finally used Sally Hansen instadry top coat which dried it right away. I was still happy. But today is day 2 and nail paint fell off completely from the nail. So disappointed with this product.  The good thing is I could just peel off the nail paint from the rest of the nails so they are not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I would not suggest buying this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! You get the same quality of gel nails as you would from a salon &amp; the machine pays for itself very quickly. I bought this when it was on sale for $50 (a steal!!) but it&#x27;s totally worth the full price. I can&#x27;t get over how HUGE it is! There&#x27;s room for both hands at once which saves even more time. I haven&#x27;t needed to cure anything longer than 90 seconds but there is a timer with multiple settings. I got the gelish starter kit and some opi gel polishes and it looks amazing! My friends want me to do theirs (and will pay) so everyone wins! Those who rate one star need to do their homework &amp; look up how to apply gel polish and in what order (there&#x27;s a lot of bottles, it can get confusing) but the last step is to wipe the nails with a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol to take the tackiness off the top! Nails are instantly dry after this. Seriously, you will not regret this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this Royal UV Light for my daughter for Christmas. There are now several in our family who go to her house for our manicures.  It works very well! The instructions are detailed and accurate.  I ordered it just a couple of weeks before Christmas, and it arrived in plenty of time.  I would highly recommend this product and the Blue Novelties vendor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this UV Light so I could start doing my own shellac mani&#x27;s. The instructions are vague but there are only 3 buttons which makes the machine super easy to operate. I polished my nails for the first time 2 weeks ago and my polish is still on. Some polish did peel off close to the cuticle but that was a result of me not cleaning the polish off of my cuticles first (hey, I&#x27;m a rookie at this polishing thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was getting a one hand UV Light but this bad boy is large enough to put both feet in there! Assembly was a breeze; pop in the lights, remove the blue tape, and plug it in and get to work.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine. No issues at this point.</li>
    <li> Works really great.  Can put on floor an slide in toes for the gel polish too.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter.  The order was delivered quickly and she said it works great!</li>
    <li> This is a great lamp and it worked well with my OPI gel products.  I have only done one set of nails and i am still learning.As constructive feedback I would say it would be nice for the company to develop some instructions to come with the lamp.</li>
    <li> I loved it Im so amazed really happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s 18th birthday.  She is extremely happy with the product!  Her nails look like they came straight out of a salon.</li>
    <li> **Use rubbing alcohol after curing polish to get the perfect salon feel- not sticky nails! **&lt;br /&gt;Cure time is 2 minutes for every coat. Make sure you buy the base &amp; top coat to go with your color polish.  I purchased all CND products and worked perfectly the 1st time.  Unit is 13&amp;#34; long x 10&amp;#34; width. This gave plenty of space for my hands to cure. My nails didn&#x27;t get super hot, and fan in unit wasn&#x27;t really necessary (but I suppose it may help cure regular polish faster). I would recommend to anyone, super easy to use!</li>
    <li> Love love love this!&lt;br /&gt;Was very easy to use. Would recommend for women who want to do their nails at home. Very affordable.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Took a few times to get hang of it but I love my nails now!</li>
    <li> Awesome product and ultra fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Works great. It is large. Can put 2 hands in it at once. Wish I would have got a smaller one. But have nothing bad to say about this light.</li>
    <li> works great, each time I do my nails it gets better.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me.  We were in the process of packing up the house for a move.  Once we moved and I was ready to use the dryer IT DIDNT WORK!!  AT ALL!!  All during the move I kept it on the top shelf in closet.  It was not disturbed or manipulated at all.  Now the return window on amazon is closed I will try to contact the manufacture tomorrow.  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> very good product for a very good price</li>
    <li> Great UV gel light! Works great on gels and shellac.</li>
    <li> Great and Fast Delivery! Got this for my Wife and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for her birthday. She&#x27;s used it twice now and she was not disappointed. Very easy to use and her nails look great! She loves using it. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad after much research I chose this lamp. Its first of all very beautiful. Its spacious, sleek and lightweight. I love the control panel. Theres a very effective fan I turn on while curing gel nails. There are multiple times you can pick to cure. Since its so powerful I haven&#x27;t had to go over 90 seconds to cure gels. This is by far the nicest lamp I have ever had. The price also makes me feel like I got the best deal around!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice item.  I did not read the description well enough to note that it is a large unit - both hands or feet will fit in it, so you need a pretty large space for storage like a shelf in a cabinet.  You can&#x27;t tell from the picture how big it is.  I&#x27;m happy to have a unit large enough for both hands; I just didn&#x27;t realize I was ordering one that large.  So if you want a unit for one hand at a time,  you don&#x27;t need one this large.  The unit works fine and has several settings for how long you want the timer to stay on.</li>
    <li> I received my light yesterday..it is bigger and better than i expected..shipping was also very speedy..would defiently recomend  this product to anyone who is looking is looking for great guality and affordable at the same time..Would highly recommend this company for your purchases.</li>
    <li> I became tired of paying for clear gel nails ($30)and bought this along with a gel nail starter kit.  I am so pleased with this machine-you can place both hands in it and not worry if it was cleaned by people who run some of the cheaper salons.  The kit and machine are easy to use and the nails are dry in a snap. This has paid for itself already.</li>
    <li> I spent many hours on the internet studying all of the choices, as I wanted to buy the best machine for the $.  This machine has super wattage...much more than most other machines, and is large enough so that you can cure both sets of hand nails at once.  It is also dually purposed, as you can use both for gel applications, acrylics, and as a dryer for regular polish as well. The seller responded very quickly to order placement, and it was a very good \\&quot;buying\\&quot; experience for me.  Would highly recommend this product and seller![[ASIN:B006I8YFU4 Royal Nails Professional Uv Light Gel and Acrilic Nail Dryer &amp; Curing Rn541]]</li>
    <li> It work pretty good so far since I got it in early July. Hope the lamp would last longer also.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews on many lights I finally chose this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my choice!! It cures my Gelish polish perfectly, light bulbs are easy to put in and replace and the light has so much hand room! I was so sick of hitting my nails on my old LED light but I don&#x27;t have to worry about that with this light. If you&#x27;re looking for a good light to cure gel nails this one is a great choice!</li>
    <li> This light is large enough for both hands or both feet and strong enough to cure the nails to a HARD finish. Great light especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I purchased the larger, more expensive light from Royal because it looked better made in the picture. Sure enough when it arrived it looked just like one that was used in a salon I went to. I had purchased another brand elsewhere first($26.99) when it arrived it looked very cheesy,didn&#x27;t work and had to be sent back. It goes to show you get what you pay for. Yesterday was the 3rd time I used the Royal UV light. I love it because there is lots of room to move around and even put both hands in if you want to.  Haven&#x27;t done my toe nails yet but this unit would work well for that too. This light is definately the best return on my dollar.</li>
    <li> I love this nail dryer, probably my favorite amazon buy of 2013, no lie!  I bought a cheaper $20ish nail dryer and it stopped working in 5 months.  I do love pretty nails, so I had to order a new one.  Found this one with rave reviews on amazon so I bought it.  This dryer easily pays for itself by not having to visit the nail salon to have my nails done.  Big enough for both hands to fit inside comfortably.  Additional TIP:  I use a pair of weight-lifting gloves when using this dryer so that my hands aren&#x27;t exposed to a lot of UV rays, just my nails are basically exposed.</li>
    <li> My daughter received this for Christmas.  After reading many reviews on these products I decided to go with this one.  Many more watts for the price.  Hopefully she will have beautiful nails for years.</li>
    <li> Beauty behind measure.  Wonderful company. Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Before having this, painting my nails was something that I never did, because I would always mess them up before they were completely dry.  Also, if they did survive drying, the paint was chipping off in a matter of just a few day.  With this dryer, my nails are dry in 2 minutes, and my manicure lasts at least 10 days.  I highly recommend this.  Having three daughters, this has already paid for itself (I did get it on sale before Christmas.)</li>
    <li> This UV light is amazing and since its a higher wattage than most, it cuts done the curing time about 30 seconds. Love it! The delivery was super fast since I have Prime but I ordered it around 8pm on a Sunday and I received it on Tue. That&#x27;s 1 day shipping FREE because I have Prime!</li>
    <li> Very nice nail light/dryer. Its large enough to put 2 hands in and to do feet to. User friendly and works very well. Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Very great product.  Item was shipped and received very fast.  The quality and price is great.  I did my nails with shellac and it was just as if I had them done at the salon.</li>
    <li> The Royal Nails Professional Dryer; is a wonderful unit, it does everything you need to do your nails. It has a wide opening where you put your hands or feet in to dry. That is very important so you don&#x27;t smug the polish. When you use the gel and dry your nails, the polish will be still wet. So take a cloth and put rubbing alcohol on it and rub a nails one at a time it will set instantly.  For regular nail polish it will dries fast, and very easy to uses.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for me and got one for my Aunt for Christmas. :)</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law, so I wanted it to be a nice product, not a piece of junk.  Even in this  busy season the order came very quickly. My daughter-in-law tried it out first thing Christmas morning - she was so excited. The manicure lasted 2 weeks &amp; probably could have been longer, but she wanted to change color. Can&#x27;t say enough about this company &amp; product. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order from them again.</li>
    <li> Works well, and it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
    <li> Have paid lots money to get nails done, but no more! This has already paid for itself in 3 manicures! My manicures have never lasted so long, I do think it should have instructions though. The bulbs are easy to put in and will be getting some for Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> This product works great! Arrived on time, and I use tit all of the time! It came with everything I needed in order to get the job done!</li>
    <li> Asked for refund, but label would NOT print, even on friend&#x27;s computer, and Amazon blocked me from any further help or phone calls on this item. BIG GRADE F for Amazon. This dryer is HUGE and BULKY. H 6.5&amp;#34;, W 14&amp;#34;, D 11&amp;#34;. Big enough for 3 feet. This has a 90 second setting, 120, 180, 240 and 300 seconds. I set it on the longest, and still my polish (Orly and one other brand) doesn&#x27;t dry any better than in the pure air. I love the sheen on Orly. With Rimmel 60 second dry polish, it works fine, but then just save your money and invest it in the 60 second dry polish. I can&#x27;t tell a difference from just using my regular &amp;#34;fan&amp;#34; (Vornado) and using this high-priced and bulky item. Where to store it (?)  Who will bother to use it (?) Probably no one around here. A BIG disappointment, in many ways.</li>
    <li> Agree with others - appears it is refurbished, definitely not brand new, but for the price, I&#x27;m fine with it.  Arrived all in tact, full working order - nothing broken.  I&#x27;ve been having my nails done at nail salons with gel polish for quite sometime and needed to save money, so I bought the supplies to do it myself.  You have to know what you are doing.  Tacky nails has nothing to do with this light - you need to wipe your nails off with alcohol at the very end of the process, just like they do at a professional nail salon.  I can&#x27;t paint my nails nearly as nice as a professional can.  I find the gel polish watery and tricky to use, but this light does dry them just as well as the dryer at the salon.</li>
    <li> Love it makes doing my own nails so much easier and faster</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it.  Saves her both time and money now that she can do her own.  Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> The product works great and would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downfall was that instructions do not tell you how to open. It opens from the bottom so that you can easily install the lamps.&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is a piece of blue film on the the top and bottom inside that must be removed for it to function properly. At first I thought that it was not working properly but once I removed the film it worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps other people that buy this product.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It is all that I expected.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife and she loves it uses it @least twice a week great for the price She recommends it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She is saving a lot of money doing her nails herself. Works great.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister who loves gel manicures. We tried it out a few days later, and she has used it multiple times since Christmas. The machine works exactly as it should. We followed directions for gel polish- using a base coat, color coat and top coat. Our nails looked fantastic, and lasted weeks. She has tried several brands of gel polish (Opi, gelish, and a couple cheaper brands that she ordered online). All have been very good.&lt;br /&gt;My aunt also commented that this is a really nice light: higher wattage than other UV light nail machines, able to put both hands or feet in at one time, and seems more durable.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had with the light was one bulb did not work. Normally, I would take a star off the rating for that, but when I called the company, they were very understanding, easy to work with and sent a new bulb right away. They also offered to replace the entire machine at no cost. (By the way, we used the machine minus the one bulb several times, and it worked just fine.)</li>
    <li> This was received so quickly and packaging was perfect and the product is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gave it as a Christmas gift to my daughter and she loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  It looks like it will be a great addition to her nail collection.  I will post later how she likes it and how well it works, but for now it looks pretty cool.</li>
    <li> I used this as soon as it arrived (and it arrived really fast ) and I really love this dryer.  An amazing price for an amazing product</li>
    <li> Great dryer at a very good price. It works! Dries fast and saves me time. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Amazing packed.  Love it</li>
    <li> I bought this machine to do my own nails. The uv machine works perfectly, its easy to use and has different time zones for drying. The only timezone it does not have is for the first base coat of Shellac which requires 10 seconds. Also, the size is for a two hand or feet job! Which makes it faster for me...</li>
    <li> Recieved on time EVEN before christmas with late order! Amazed and happy! Product is on par with salon quality, thx!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Great buy! Perfect for people who like to do their own nails. I bought it for my friend and she bought gel polish from Wal-Mart and has been using it ever since! It is also big enough to hold two hands or feet at the same time so it cuts down on drying time for the person. Great buy and price for a professional nail dryer!</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome product.  I love this nail lamp.  I tried to buy another one just recently for my daughter and they are out of stock.  I hope they come back soon.  I really like having the fan as well as the lights.  It allows you to use regular nail polish or gel.  The size is so great.  Good for both feet or both hands.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancee for Christmas. She loves to get her nails done and it usually costs a good amount of money each time. I bought her the OPI Gel nail set and this UV lamp. I could not justify buying the OPI uv lamp which got terrible reviews. This unit got good reviews and seemed nice. She used it the day after Christmas and fell in love with this UV Lamp. This product works perfectly she said. It is very easy to use and works exactly like it should. I actually think this one is more powerful than the other ones for sale. It really tried her nails in seconds. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to do professional looking gel nails at home. Great Product!!!</li>
    <li> I love the uv light. Great product. Great for gel nails. So quick and easy. I&#x27;m glad I bought this. Now I no longer need to go to the nail salon.</li>
    <li> I was using one of those small handheld lamps before this, and it worked okay, but I wanted to be able to do both hands at once and with a stronger wattage. I was fortunate enough to buy this when it was a little less expensive than what it is listed for right now. I am completely happy with my purchase. All of the bulbs worked right out of the box. The only thing that I was a little weird about was the fan. I&#x27;m thinking the fan is purely to keep some air flow going and to maybe keep your hands cooler under the light (not that they get super hot or anything) because it surely doesn&#x27;t blow enough air to aid in drying nail polish. Not a deal breaker for me though, so it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this only for curing a gel top coat. I do not do a gel base coat or gel polish. I prefer to change my nail color every week and removing all of those gel layers would be a pain in my opinion, even though there are methods to make it easier (see YouTube). I also own over 150 bottles of regular nail polish that I do not want to replace with gel polishes. Yes, I am addicted to nail polish and even built my own rack to store them! My current favorite way to go is to use CND Stickey base coat, any polish (even really cheap ones and always two coats), and Red Carpet gel top coat. I believe the Red Carpet directions say two minutes under the lamp, but I do three. With a bit of pressure, rub each nail with a cotton pad soaked in alcohol after they are cured. Mine come out super shiny and last the whole week looking perfect. I don&#x27;t know how long they last after that because I like to change things up and do a different color. To remove, I lightly file some of the top coat off and then wipe with acetone. It usually comes off pretty easily. I don&#x27;t have the patience to soak off three or four layers of gel, which is why I do things this way.</li>
    <li> awesome transaction and awesome product!</li>
    <li> I love it! Gets the job done quick!</li>
    <li> Love love love this lamp ;)</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> We have really enjoyed this product!! It is very easy and fun to use!</li>
    <li> Excellent value.  It seems very professional and allows you to dry both hands at once.</li>
    <li> I received the product timely and it was packaged well.  It was easy to assemble and works just fine.</li>
    <li> THIS MACHINE IS GREAT.  IT DRIES MY NAILS IN HALF THE TIME.  I LOVE IT.  SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT SOONER</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS MACHINE :)  I can now give myself professional looking manicures.  This machine works &amp; I am glad I spent the extra $.  I use all kinds of nail polish and now even use gems &amp; 3D decorations because I can dry my nails successfully with this machine. I am not a professional, but this machine dries my nails so my mani pedi&#x27;s last a long time and look good!</li>
    <li> Now I can save money by applying my gel nails at home!!!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent lamp and value!  Love it!  I use Shellac and the drying times are the same with this lamp.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Great product.  Works perfect.</li>
    <li> No instructions on settings.Used it once yesterday(12/19/2014) n it appears to do a really good job.</li>
    <li> Merchandise received swiftly and in good order.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I use 90 secs for base coat, 120secs for color coat and 180 for top coat. As long as you cut your cuticles, clean your nails properly and apply a ph balance on your nails, your color will stay on fabulously.</li>
    <li> I just rreceived my gel light and have only used it once. It did come with a  little instruction page, telling me how to remove the blue film and to put the lights in.  The box and lights may have been previously opened, bc the boxes were damaged and open, and the top of the lighted part was a little scratched. But that not the important part. All of the  parts were there and perfectly functional!  Ive only used it with opi regular polish, as I havent made it to my professional store yet to get the gel. As a hairstylist, I  hoping to get a discount?  But I used the fan and the bulbs fo180 seconds per polish, and I have the  best mani ive ever had!!! It dried them almost completly in just a few min per layer!!! It was super shiny and I didnt have to worry about ruining them all night. I cant wait to try gels!!! My friend referred me to this product, and im so glad I got it!!! Its big enouhg for both hand at the same time, and feet at the same time!!!</li>
    <li> I received tha order as promised.it came in perfect condition and it works very well with the gel nail and it has a fan to so it all  good...I would recommend royal nails uv light nail dryer</li>
    <li> Prefect for at home gel manicures. It heats up quick and cures the polish rock hard. Defiantly recommendusing the gloves with the peek a boo gloves because it gets hot.</li>
    <li> I got this UV light after having to \\&quot;break up\\&quot; with my manicurist.  I just can&#x27;t afford to get my weekly manicures and monthly pedicures from her anymore.  I bought this so I can continue to do them on my own and save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this light for both Gelish and regular nail polish, and it works fine for both.  The Gelish cures much, much faster, which is the only real difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this light with regular polish I have to use the maximum time setting for each coat (5 minutes), or else run the risk of my polish not being solidly set and getting messed up (you gals know what it looks like when you think your polish is hardened, only to find out later it&#x27;s not -- it gets pushed around, wrinkled and \\&quot;dented\\&quot;, and you can be left with imprints of fabric.  Ugh.)  Because of this, it does take a long time to do a manicure on myself with regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for doing pedicures, the opening is large enough that I can stick both sets of toes in there at the same time, and I have Sasquatch-sized feet so most people shouldn&#x27;t have a problem doing the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this lamp and believe it was a great purchase!</li>
    <li> I have used this a couple times now and it seems to be working well. It came packaged good and all the light bulbs went in easily. I have figured out the timer and it works very well. I love that it has a fan for drying regular polish as well. Both of my hands fit into the system. I noticed that the wattage on this one is higher than the one at my local salon. I feel this is a good product.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous. I received it within days and it is great for a professional salon or for home. I use it with CND Shellac and it works great!</li>
    <li> The Royal Nails UV light is everything I hoped it would be.  I can get professional looking nails at home which will save me money in the long run.  Well worth the expense.[[ASIN:B006IBM21K 54 WATT ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL AND ACRILIC NAIL DRYER &amp; CURING RN541 WORKS WITH CND, SHELLAC, OPI, HARMONY GELLISH, IBD GELAC, ETC.. FOR DOUBLE. HANDS OR FEET.]]</li>
    <li> 54 WATT ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL AND ACRYLIC NAIL DRYER and ROYAL NAILS ANTI UV GLOVES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dryer is great! I looked for a long time debating which one to buy. I read all the reviews on every one and this product stood out. I even asked my friend what she thought by reading the reviews she said it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how I can use the dryer and the UV light to dry my regular nail polish also and the results are fast and neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to get it, you wont regret it. It is big enough to dry both hands or both feet at the same time with still lots of space to move around. I use it every week since I got it and nails dry fast and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the gloves to use when I use the UV light. It is comfortable and nice and fitted. No regrets on either purchases.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what I wanted it to do. My mails come out beautiful and smudge-free and smudge-proof. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn&#x27;t think the dryer was working when my nails felt like they were still wet. My manicurist said my nails would feel tacky, but I didn&#x27;t realize this was what  she meant. The instructions could be more explicit about this. Aside from my ignorance, the dryer works great and I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first timer to the gel nails scene and am loving it!  I love that it does the both hands and feet at the same time.  Unit is a good size and accommodates both hands and feet comfortably.  The set up for the unit is pretty intuitive once you open top.  Unit is very quiet to operate even with the fan on.  I learning that less is more when applying gel polish to cure. Four stars given because I wished the UV gloves were included with the unit because the light does dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> This works great for my needs.  Easily can dry both hands at once with lots of room.  I don&#x27;t generally use for 2 hands at once but works great for toes as well!</li>
    <li> One review I read had me worried, because after curing several time it still \\&quot;felt tacky\\&quot;... well you have to wipe the tacky film off and the polish is perfect underneath! I love how I can do both hands &amp; both feet at the same time...saving a ton of time in my opinion. Wish I would have made my decision sooner to purchase this. My nail have never looked better! 100% professional results...at home.</li>
    <li> Love it! So glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Factory seal was already broken and ac cord was already unfolded with the twist tie thrown in the bag. Have not hada chance to use this item that I rwc&#x27;d 3 days ago.. will review when it has been used.</li>
    <li> Was leery because I have no experience with these except what I see (and hardly notice) at the salons.  I absolutely LOVE this machine.  It is big enough that you can put both hands which is great if you&#x27;re doing someone elses manicure.  I&#x27;m not talented enough to do mine at the same time.  Ha!  But, it&#x27;s perfect because I don&#x27;t feel like I have to be super careful about touching the insides with wet nails.  I would totally recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> love this thing. cant wait to use it!</li>
    <li> Heck yeah, for the price of a gel manicure, we have a light. It is better than the ones in my salon, and it works great.</li>
    <li> The fact that my girlfriends borrow my nail dryer speaks for itself.  Love the dryer and so do my friends.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail dryer! I had no problems with it or installing the bulbs I ised it the day I opened it and it works great. I am very happy with this dryer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong but this does not work for me. After each coat of gel polish I would have to use the 300 second time and my nails are still tacky. After a total of 30 minutes my nails are still not dry. I followed the instructions and other tips I found on here. And that was just for one hand! Not happy. Sending this back!</li>
    <li> Work great. Love it !</li>
    <li> It is much larger than I was expecting and I love it!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Takes half the time of the small ones since you can fit both hands. Sister ended up buying this because hers only for 1 hand.</li>
    <li> works great, high quality, better than salons!</li>
    <li> I received my UV Light very promptly and have been using it for the past 5 weeks.  It works well and I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> This is actually a Christmas gift for my daughter, I have no reason to believe that it isn&#x27;t wonderful.  All reviews I have read were excellent</li>
    <li> So easy to use. Just make sure you have all the required polishes. You NEED a gel base, gel polish, Gel top coat, and the cleanser to wipe the tacky residue from the top coat after curing the last time. I got the Harmony Fantastic Four that also had a ph bond and a cuticle oil that was a GREAT price. Here is the link for it:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FXXS37G/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend a cuticle oil.&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the directions, and read some helpful reviews. I did my kids nails and it was so quick being able to do both hands at once. Then right after doing their nails, they did laundry and dishes without a mark on their polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself and save a TON of polish heartache and time. Get this lamp!</li>
    <li> My wife has had this for several months and she loves it. It is a really nice UV light it works extremely well. I would recommend this machine.</li>
    <li> Does a great job for shellac! Very pleased so far with the light and also has a fan.</li>
    <li> love it and received it quickly</li>
    <li> So far so good. I only used it once. Worked fine for shellac polish. Like that both hands fit at same time. The only con is there isn&#x27;t a 10 second button for the base coat.  Time starts at 90 seconds so you have to time yourself.</li>
    <li> I love all the features of this nail dryer! Love saving money on doing my own at home.</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> Awesome! Great product!</li>
    <li> I used my lamp right when I got it and it works great! I&#x27;ve used it only once so hopefully it lasts. My nails cured in a short time (120 seconds for each coat to ensure they&#x27;re done) and I was ready to go about my day. Super happy with it so far and pumped to use it again soon!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lamp for the price. I can do both hands or feet at the same time. It&#x27;s large but if you have space to store a slightly larger than a shoebox size lamp, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> The gloves look and feel as though they are of top quality. This factor is important to me because one would know how well the anti uv gIoves are working until you get hand skin cancer or not. Therefore, I&#x27;m going to do my best to protect myself and I think these gloves are just what the dr ordered.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure on doing the whole gel curing thing myself and how to choose the best light. With the existing reviews on this product, it made it a no brainer and my gel curing experience has been a great one!</li>
    <li> Got this because it has a higher wattage and a timer function.  It works great but my only complaint is that the timer (well, actually all of the buttons) are set as if someone else was doing your nails.  Wish they were in the center as it would be easier for personal use.  Not a huge problem, just a minor annoyance.  Would definitely reccommend this product.  It arrived as described and quickly.</li>
    <li> It works well. My friend had one and I was itching to get mine. It has plenty of settings for different jobs. Great product and exactly as the seller describes.</li>
    <li> This is my first time ever with a shellac manicure.  This is by far amazing and so easy to use.  The first time was trial and error, I did not realize the importance of a base coat and top coat.  The first time I used it, I did not use the BC/TC and put CND Shellac Fedora on.  It came out horrible, it shrunk and did not coat the nail evenly.  So I quickly removed it, went to the store and purchased the CND BC and TC and voila, so nice.  There are a few important things to keep in mind though. First and foremost is to shake shake shake the bottles up. I cannot stress this enough, I think that&#x27;s why Fedora was so horrible on my first try (as well as the lack of basecoat).  The next thing is, to cure the base coat for 10 seconds only.  Trust me, that&#x27;s all it takes.  Then proceed as usual.  The last important thing is to use 99% alcohol to remove the tackiness.  Don&#x27;t use anything less, I thought the 97% alcohol I had would be fine but no such luck.  It dulled the manicure and made it look horrible.  I purchased the 99% and it was like glass.  Perfect.  I can&#x27;t wait to use this again.  I highly recommend this item for your shellac/gel mani/Pedi&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is better than the ones they use in nail salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should have something in the box about the film that has to be removed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of room for both hands.</li>
    <li> The Royal Nails Professional UV Light Dryer is nicer than the ones at my upscale salon, and was merely the price of two gel manicures. It arrived quickly and in wonderful condition.</li>
    <li> Love it so far, used it twice!  Came in great shape but took longer to come than the other things i ordered at the same time which surprised me but was still within the window they said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I got the two handed one for pedicures and my daughters nails. I can only do one hand at a time on me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****update April 2015*******&lt;br /&gt;I think my machine has had a short in it for a long time. It still worked but only sometimes. Last night it started smoking and popping and shorted out pretty dramatically. Probably looking for a different brand to replace it.</li>
    <li> Overall I am very pleased with this purchase! It shipped and arrived on time in great condition. I used yesterday for a shellac manicure and it worked great! I used the CND polishes if it helps ;) and yes you can fit both feet/ hands at the same time! I would definitely, and have already, recommend this UV light to my friends and fam!</li>
    <li> I was so excited and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. I immediately put it to the test and was disappointed because I thought it did not work, but after watching a video on YouTube I realized I was missing a step at the end were you take the sticky film off with alcohol. Once I figured that out it works PERFECTLY!!! I used opi gel shine;-)</li>
    <li> Having gotten tired of waits and prices at salons, my daughter and I decided to treat ourselves for mother&#x27;s day and invest in this UV light and the polish.  We were both skeptical that we, as amateurs, could produce satisfying results, but we were wrong.  The machine is great; drying time is quick, and if you follow the instructions that come with your brand of polish, you&#x27;ll have a professional mani/pedi in no time.  The machine provides several settings to accommodate different polishes, and while it is rather large, it does fit both hands or both feet at the same time.</li>
    <li> Great item and so easy to use. I can&#x27;t stop doing my nails!! Recommend from beginners to experts!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> The polish says it takes 2 min to cure under light , and I have to leave it to cure for 15 min for each layer. Makes a 10 min process and hour long.</li>
    <li> Before I found these my hands would get extremely warm when doing my nails. Now that I have these it is much more comfortable to give myself manicures at home!</li>
    <li> I was shopping for a uv light on multiple sites and multiple brands. After reading the reviews for multiple lights I decided to buy this one. GREAT DEAL and GREAT PRODUCT!!! Easy to use ! Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this light/dryer in order to begin doing my own gel nails at home. It works fantastic! Bulbs come separate and fit in to unit very easily! Once that is done just plug in the unit and you&#x27;re ready to go!!  Price is great! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Received the lamp for my wife&#x27;s birthday, had it set up and ready to go within a couple minutes.  This thing seems to work just as well as the salon lamp, the wife is extremely happy with her gift.</li>
    <li> so far it has been working great, great deal! Larger than I expected. I could not believe the price when I researched, took a chance and glad I did.</li>
    <li> This UV Lamp is my new baby. I cover it up to protect it, did I tell you I&#x27;m over protective of it. I have 1 1\2 inch natural nails. And my nail polish and nail art has to be redone about every four days to look presentable. But now that I have this wonderful lamp, I can put a UV top coat over my nail polish and art work and it will last around two full weeks.</li>
    <li> So happy with the product! Receiving it a day early was an added bonus :). I use IBD gels as well as do gelish manicures and this UV light is excellent! All my sets and manicures have been turning out phenomenal.  I couldn&#x27;t be more happy or excited about my purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this light for about 10 gel polish manicures now.  The light works great.  I&#x27;ve mixed up combinations of shellac base n top coats, gelish color polishes, and finger paints gel polishes.  Cured each layer according to the manufacturers directions.  10 seconds for shellac base coat.  2 mins for color polishes (gelish or finger paints). 2 mins for top coat (shellac or finger paints brands).  even though finger paints&#x27; instruction only says LED light, but you can use it with this light.  just use the same times as gelish.  key is to apply thin layers, or your polish will bubble or wrinkle.  The light is also big enough for me to do both hands at the same time, then cure at the same time.  same goes with my toes.</li>
    <li> This is my first go at using gel nail products.  I read great things about this light and the price was very good.  I don&#x27;t know how they got it to me so fast! The light is quality and works great!  I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my order from A-Z.  Thank you</li>
    <li> This 54 WATT ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL AND ACRILIC NAIL DRYER &amp; CURING RN541 is the best FINGER NAIL--DOUBLE HAND--DRYER that I have ever purchased and used.  It is incredible!  It cuts my time by more than half.  It dries nails remarkably fast and both hands (or feet) at a time.  I love it.  It is also very quiet when the fan runs. It looks great and is very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;This company is wonderful to work with.  The products were just what I was looking for and also very good quality helps. The shipping was oh so very fast.  The seller is Blue Novelties/amazon market place. I will always go to this store first every time I shop.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You so much for everything you do to please the customers and ship the products out as fast as you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS NAIL DRYER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--CUSTOMER&#x3D;LKL---</li>
    <li> I love everything about this nail dryer!  I only gave it 4 stars because the bottoms of my fingers start to burn a little when I get to drying the 3rd coat of polish.  Also, the included instructions for use don&#x27;t go far beyond how to install the UV bulbs and how to turn it on.</li>
    <li> Quickly received my nail dryer and I have been using it ever since!!  In one month, between me and my daughter, it has paid for itself!!  Dries quickly!!!!  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I had my daughter 4 months ago and up until then I was able to get my nails done regularly. When I had her, the upkeep &amp; maintenance was too hard between no sleep and a newborn. I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist and always keep new trends and items close, however I only had a 6 watt lamp that only allowed 4 fingers at a time and thumbs separate. It also didn&#x27;t cure unless you set for double the time listed, if not longer. I planned on only purchasing a 36 watt lamp, but came across this one. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it! It&#x27;s already paid for itself after doing two manicures and lasting well over two weeks. I get bored with colors so I like to change at least every 2 weeks, but I am sure that the Mani would last even longer! I love that I can do both hands at once, making the times cut in half, which means when my baby girl is napping, momma can do her nails without an interruption and in a quick time. Not to mention that I was ecstatic when I removed the \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; top of the gel, my color didn&#x27;t wipe off in strange areas as it did before with my little 6 watter. I have shared this with friends of mine and told them how well it works. Again, I&#x27;m sooo happy with it!</li>
    <li> Love the wide style that can cure nails on both hands at the same time . What a time-saver! Item arrived on time &amp; packaging protected it during the long trip to Hawaii. Looked &amp; worked as described.</li>
    <li> I have had this nail dryer for a couple of months now and I am really not sure how to rate it. I don&#x27;t think that my nails dry faster than air drying when using this dryer but logic tells me that it has to aid drying time at least a little because if I don&#x27;t use sunscreen it&#x27;ll dry my hands out. I should note that I do not use gel or shellac products because I like to change my nail polish frequently and I tend to put on many layers of polish. I do a lot of chores with my hands so my nails get beat up a lot and I have to do them about twice a week to keep them looking nice. The dryer is very big and both hands fit with room to spare. I thought this was a good price (54$ and change) and a good value but I can&#x27;t compare with nail salons because I have never gone to a salon to get my nails done, I have always done them myself. Would I buy this again? Probably not but the product itself seems very nice and lightweight and easy to use. No problems with the packaging and nothing was broken. It came in 2 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing gel nails for a few years in the salon. I have to say, I was skeptical about an in-home system that was so reasonably priced! Nails came out awesome and it&#x27;s a lot bigger than I thought; you can definitely fit both feet at the same time(and I have big feet)!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend... she was WWOOWWEDD haha She loved it :) According to her. Excellent product... works very well... and speeds up the process of waiting for the nails to dry. Her customers love it too :) Fast Easy and Professional.</li>
    <li> I can now do my own &amp;#34;salon Nails&amp;#34; at home! Along with my shellac nail polishes I also needed a nail dryer so I ordered this one and it works great!</li>
    <li> I was using a Gelish UV lamp that would not dry my gel nail products.  With this light, I can do all 10 nails and dry them all at one time and it only takes 3 minutes!  I love that I can change the timer depending on if I am drying gel, or nail polish.  this lamp is a great buy.</li>
    <li> This item arrived in a timely manner and in good working condition. My daughter loves it because it dries her nails very quickly. The only downside is that it would be nice if both hands could dry at once, but that is a manufacturer issue that has nothing to do with this vendor. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works great with gellish products! I can now do my own gel nails at home! So happy i got this uv light versus some of the others bc you can cure two hands or feet at the same time which saves alot of time!!! Simple to use and high quality!</li>
    <li> I work in a salon that does nails. We use the O.P.I. lamp which is very expensive. I bought this lamp for home/personnel use, and I have to say I think it works even better than the O.P.I. lamp! For the people that give it a negative review saying it didn&#x27;t dry or cure your nails, your probably doing it wrong. Each gel polish manufacturer has different curing times so you may want to check that out. Also your nails will always have a sticky wet feel to them after you&#x27;ve successfully completed and cured a set of gel nails. You need to take NON acetone nail polish remover or a product like nas99&lt;br /&gt;(I think o.p.I. sells it) and wipe them off one at a time with a decent amount of pressure until the tacit feeling is gone. I just use soap and water and a wash cloth and am able to get the same result. Using an acetone. Remover will make them look dull and starts to remove the gel polish. Lastely most gel polishes have a required base coat and top coat that you also need to cure. I hope this helps anyone having issues with their gel sets and I encourage everyone to buy this lamp. The only thing I cant say for it yet is the longevity of the lamp since ive only had it a few months.</li>
    <li> Very easy to set up, had to place bulbs into light also very easy to use, I would highly recommend this light.</li>
    <li> This lamp works better than the Ikonna UV lamp because it has one extra bulb (54 watt vs Ikonna&#x27;s 45 watt).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price?  Well the Royal costs 1/3 less than the Ikonna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Royal UV lamp is easier to handle because it is lighter.  The light weight helps tremendously if you don&#x27;t have a UV station and don&#x27;t want to move your clients to a UV station and want to cure the gel at the the station where you work or move it to a station next to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Royal UV lamp has an &amp;#34;on demand fan&amp;#34; to dry your clients&#x27; nails polish before applying the UV gel for curing without activating the  UV lights, this avoid your clients from unnecessary exposure to ultra violet (UV) light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Royal and the Ikonna has 5 minutes limit timer which is fine if you have a fixed curing time.  However, with the Royal you have the option of keeping the UV bulbs to stay on until you deactivate it.  This helps tremendously for those who works with liquid gel (builder gel or special art works involved liquid color gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;&amp;#62; --&amp;#62; ONE IMPROVEMENT FOR THE ROYAL UV LAMP IS TO PUT THE VENT(S) ON THE SIDES TO PREVENT THE LIGHT FROM EXPOSING TO THE GEL AS IT IS BEING APPLIED. &amp;#60;-- &amp;#60;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to all nails tech.  A GOOD UV LAMP DOES NOT HAVE TO COST AN ARM AND AND A LEG.  I APPRECIATED IT.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Saves a lot of money doing it myself and it&#x27;s really easy to use. I bought the Gelish base and top coat and they all work great together!</li>
    <li> anybody that wants to do their own gel nails... or somebody elses, needs this light, to cure their gel nails. It works awesome. Has a little fan feature too, just in case it gets to warm in there. Timers for different cureing times very helpfull. Easy access to change light bulbs too. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used this once, but it was just like others had said. It worked perfect. Much larger than I realized, but installing bulbs and using was a dream. No messed up nails from trying to get your hands in a small unit. I did have to adjust time on darker polish. Found that 2-3-3-2 min was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Would remind everyone to be sure and get polish off of cutical and from under nails.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it and said it works very well. Shipping was quick and the item was just as I expected.</li>
    <li> This was the big hit at our house this Christmas.  We followed some online video demos and achieved great results. We used CND Shellac base coat, polish, and top coat, then wiped the nails with polish remover to take off the sticky residue. The manicure lasted the same 2-3 weeks as the salon results. This light appears to be very substantial and well made.  The opening is wide enough to cure two hands or feet together, but if working alone one would typically paint one hand, cure it under the light, then paint the other hand.  There are timer buttons, so the light goes off at the correct time without your having to keep track of the time.  We would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have used the dryer several times and it works great for me.  My nails look like they were done by a professional and now I can save on the professional fee.</li>
    <li> The product lives up to my expectations.  Easy to assemble - takes less than a minute.  Nails are dry and fabulous.  Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I just recently tried this product for my nails and I loved it.  Highly recommend and your hands don&#x27;t feel like they are burning under the lights as there is a fan to keep the unit cool.</li>
    <li> I received this nail light for Christmas and absolutely love it!  I was able to easily set it up, and the cord is long enough that I don&#x27;t have to sit right next to an outlet.  The customer service team at Blue Novelties responded quickly, via email, to a question I had concerning the product.  This really helped seal the deal on the 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This product came on time for Christmas even though I ordered it late. The instructions on how to use it are perfectly clear and it is already saving my fianc&amp;eacute;e and I money! If you like to get your nails done but feel like it costs too much this product is a must buy!</li>
    <li> this light was larger than i expected and works great! my mom and i use it for a great gel nails.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift so can&#x27;t really speak to the product, but she seems to really like it and it arrived quckly</li>
    <li> I ordered this dryer about a month ago and have used it several times, it&#x27;s very convenient as far as being able to put in both hands or both feet in. For the price and wattage, you won&#x27;t find better! I love it!</li>
    <li> I am in NO WAY a professional but I&#x27;m getting better. This light has saved me so much money. Its a great investment. I have friends that have paid so much more for other UV and LED lamps but are not as satisfied as I am. BUY IT</li>
    <li> Love the convinence of doing my nails at home. This light works great! It was bigger than I even expected. Can see why others give it such a high rating. So happy I made the purchase and bought this light! It will be well used and saves me $ not having to go to salon as often.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my home use, this works great and at such a reasonable cost. I would recommend this to others. Fast shipping was a plus.</li>
    <li> I received this product and of course had to use it immediately! It was a lot bigger than I had expected even though I knew it could two hands I wasn&#x27;t expecting the size it is. With that being said, it&#x27;s perfect for both hands with room in between them and between your hands and the sides and front, it&#x27;s not like your having to be very careful when their in the lamp as to not let your hands touch! Also it has the fan, light, and 4 settings for time limits which is more than u need but good to have I suppose! I use the gelish products and this works really well with them. Also, when changing out bulbs or installing them the whole top lifts up for easy access to install or replace them which is nice, no fighting a small space to do this task! Overall it is a really good product and functions just as it says it should, I have had it for about a month and a half and I&#x27;ve used it about 4 times, not because I had to because the gelish doesn&#x27;t last but because its something new and I wanted to keep changing the colors!! Lol so of all the times I&#x27;ve used it no complaints!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she absolutely loves it. She uses it multiple times a week and has gotten to hang out with her girlfriends while doing their nails. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is such a fun thing to have at home! It&#x27;s like getting your nails done at a saloon, at any time you feel like it. Construction seems solid, packaging was appropriate and it arrived in perfect shape, instructions were clear, everything works great. Did you know you can use this to dry regular polish too? It has a little fan that helps, with the lights, get the regular polish dry within 5-10 minutes (instead of an hour). You can fit both hands in at once, and toes too! Absolutely love it. High end appliance somehow made affordable.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer/curer is wonderful. Well worth the price. I would highly recommend it. Shipping time was pretty quick. If you are using gelcolor by OPI, you need to cure the base coat 1 min. the second and third coat for 4 minutes and the top coat for 4 minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed Cosmetologist and I don&#x27;t have time to get my nails done at my job by the nail technicians. So I bought this lamp so I could do my Shellac Mani/pedi it works great!. Super fast shipping and it works with normal nail polish as well I recommend this product for people who just don&#x27;t have the time to go out and get their nails done. I would definitely recommend this to other people(:</li>
    <li> This UV light is great for do it yourself Gel nail setting. It is big enough to fit both hands and the easy to read buttons make the process very simple!</li>
    <li> The instructions are terrible.  It turned on, but then only did one cycle before it quit. It took over 1/2 hour before it would turn on again.  Amazon gave me a full refund.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is large enough to accommodate hands or feet. It is very powerful with 54 watts of uv bulbs.  I have already used it and I love it!</li>
    <li> By using this product I have been doing my nails at home. It has saved me a lot of money already. I used to not care much about my nails because I hated to spend time in the salon. Plus I felt like my nails became weaker. But doing it at home actually improves my nail strength. You don&#x27;t need to use that nail file they have at the salon. This product is great for opi color and cnd shellac. I prefer the cnd shellac. It lasts longer. But the opi colors are just beautiful. The fan is especially important in this product because the light is hot at times. Plus, I use it just as a fan to dry my daughter&#x27;s nails without the UV light.</li>
    <li> This light works great! I have the Opi gel and it works awesome with it! Worth every penny. Buy this one!</li>
    <li> Worked great saving money too!</li>
    <li> I had no problem at al setting it up and using it. I like that it&#x27;s lightweight and easily fits both hands at the same time (haven&#x27;t tried feet yet. The instruction were clear, controls on back easy to use, and was shipping fast. My first manicure came out great!</li>
    <li> Perfect..quick shipment.  I am retired, and I do my nails at home.  I would recommend, this unit to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was surprised when the package arrived to see how large this unit actually was.  easily accommodating both hands or feet.  Actually, nicer than the one&#x27;s used in the salons I have visited.</li>
    <li> Extremely happy.  Great investment!!!</li>
    <li> Great item! Does what it is supposed to and keeps my nails for 2 weeks. Great price, great item!</li>
    <li> Unit is much bigger than I realized (I could have just read the dimensions, duh) but this is a good thing!  It is very sturdy and works well.</li>
    <li> I love that both hands or both feet can process at the same time. In about the same time it takes to schedule a nail appointment, I am finished and they look great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so bewildered. The lamp appeared in perfect condition and was easy to assemble, but it didn&#x27;t do a damn thing. I bought this to cure my CND shellac polish. I followed instructions precisely. I&#x27;ve had my nails done at salons before, so I know the process. I attempted to cure between each coat, starting with the base coat. From the beginning and further, NOTHING WOULD DRY. I think that the information is totally misleading and it is not meant for shellac polish. This is crap.</li>
    <li> This I feel was the best deal for the money at the time of purchase. It is performing well and cleans easy with an easy set up.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this product, It arrived on time, neatly packaged.  I waited for the rest of the items to arrive and was so jazzed to start.........but the machine wouldn&#x27;t!! We installed the light bulbs per the (very skimpy and non explanative) directions, and the fan would work, the unit powered up, but the lights would not come on.  Read other reviews to see what I was doing wrong, one review said they had to e-mail the seller to find out how to remove the \\&quot;blue film\\&quot;..........Blue film? My unit didn&#x27;t have any! I was sent a return!!  After reading the \\&quot;one star\\&quot; reviews, I found I was NOT alone......I am beyond disappointed, I am FURIOUS!!  Amazon should fire this vender!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I posted this review, the seller contacted me, and asked that I let him ship me another unit. He had been having problems with the FBA shipping out returned units, and was very apologetic. I gave him a second chance, as he seemed sincere. I received a new unit (plus a free gift) and I works beautifully, I am happy and satisfied. If you are having this issue, contact the seller directly, they really seem to care. Many thanks, Blue Novelties!</li>
    <li> This is oddly fun and a terrific value (saves a lot of time waiting for an appointment and fitting gels into your schedule).</li>
    <li> I love this thing, it is very quality, and worked on the first try with perfect gel nails at home. I always went to the salon and spent lots of money, so I decided to give this a try at home and I got the same exact results, if not better doing it myself. This thing is huge, and can fit both hands or both feet in at the same time. Great purchase, came extremely fast.</li>
    <li> I waited a couple of weeks to use the dryer.  I had to install the light bulbs and found it easy to do.  I then proceeded to plug in the device but it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I decided to look over the instructions only to find our there weren&#x27;t any.  I thought by turning the light bulbs around I may fix the problem, but that didn&#x27;t work either.  There is a power switch on the back, so I made sure I turned it both ways with the light bulbs facing up and then turned around (the label).  Nothing worked.  I have a brand new dryer that never worked.</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX!&lt;br /&gt;FUSE DEFECTIVE AND REPLACED, POOR DOCUMENTATION OF INSTILLATION OF THE BULBS.&lt;br /&gt;THE SWITCHES FOR THE FAN HEATER DOES NOT WORK ALL OF THE TIME, MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO GET IT TO START.&lt;br /&gt;PHYSICAL APPEARANCE IS IMPRESSIVE, LARGE UNIT YOU CAN PUT YOUR FEET IN.</li>
    <li> Does the job very well but I had to watch a U tube video to get it right.  Michelle</li>
    <li> Works great. Was easy to set up and is easy to use. Has different timers that are easy to set. Only wish it had a countdown for how long is left.</li>
    <li> Item does not work have to send it back.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Doing my own gel ails is fun and I do my daughter too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this once so far but I love it.  It has plenty of room for two hands with room to spare.  I took the advice of another review and popped open the underneath to insert the bulbs and it was a cinch.  Most of my gel nails require a 60s timer and this only goes as low as 90s, which isn&#x27;t preferable but it&#x27;s not an issue.  I used Sensational brand top/base coat with a Sally Hansen Gel and removed the stickiness with rubbing alcohol and my nails look great!  I also like the little fan inside because it can get a little hot, obviously.</li>
    <li> Came on time. But when taking off the bottom to insert bulbs it was difficult. It&#x27;s cheap plastic clips that you have to push in to release the cover and one was already chipped. My fingers hurt getting it off but i guess the bulbs are suppose to last a long time so I shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it for awhile. It works great so far.</li>
    <li> Love it..I was tired of paying for shellac nails at the salon,this fits the bill..highly recommend</li>
    <li> I started to add Gel Polish to my salon service. After doing my research, I googled \\&quot;best UV curing light for gel polish\\&quot; and this popped up. I read the reviews for this product and decided to order one to try on myself and my employees before using it on my client. It&#x27;s been about two weeks now and I have had nothing but positive results. The only thing is the timer is set on seconds, rather than minutes but it goes all the way up to three minutes (which is converted into seconds). This curing light is very strong and you can definitely feel it while curing your nails. I have been a salon owner for 10 years and I would say this is the best UV curing lamp that I ever purchased. On top of that, it is super reasonable. I used to spend $200 on UV curing lamps that is nothing compared to this one... I hope this review was helpful.</li>
    <li> I bought this item with the intent to alleviate the high cost of going to a nail salon.  I bought the products I needed for my nails from a Beauty Supply store to use with the nail dryer.  The first attempt was very successful.  Thanks to the Royal UV Light.  You can put both hands in the dryer and the results are amazing.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product to anyone.  It&#x27;s certainly worth the price!</li>
    <li> This product worked great! I was always a bit skeptical about purchasing a UV light &amp; doing a gel manicure myself, simply because I know I don&#x27;t have nearly as much experience as the professionals do. That being said, I have to say, this product was relatively easy to use, and my nails came out great! (I&#x27;m already 4 days into my first DIY gel manicure, and there is not one single chip!). It can definitely be a little scary doing your own gel manicure for the first time, but once I got into the motions of following each step correctly, I found it to be pretty simple (I googled a few DIY gel manicure tutorials, which really helped with the process). And, what was an even more pleasant surprise was the fact that it didn&#x27;t take much longer for me to do it myself than it would in the actual salon. Overall, the product is easy to figure out (only 3 buttons: power, light timer &amp; fan); the bulbs are strong, fan works wonders and my manicure has been shiny &amp; chipless for days already. I highly recommend it for beginners &amp; pros alike!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Anti UV gloves as an alternative to putting sunscreen on my hands before using the UV lamp.  I am not a nail technician, but I do my own gel nails at home using a UV lamp, probably every two weeks when I change my polish. Although my hands go under the lamp for short periods of time, I still want to keep the majority of my skin covered.  The gloves are definitely the way to go, in terms of time and comfort. It eliminates having to take the step of removing any suncreen residue from the nails and surrounding nailbeds, and my hands aren&#x27;t left feeling sticky or oily from the lotion.  They fit well, easy to take on and off and they do not interfer with polishing the nails. There is enough room between the glove end and the nail so nothing could get smudged. Gloves also clean up well.  Nice alternative to sunscreen. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about buying one of these lights but I thought that if I really didn&#x27;t like it I could always sell it on ebay. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it though. I now have nails that last up to seven days instead of just one or two and thats with regular nail polish. I could never get polish to stay on for more than a day unless I had fake nails but the light drying makes them last so much longer. I have since gotten a UV top coat and it not only makes the polish last longer but it also makes my nails harder so they are growing longer than I have ever been able to grow them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK so the only down side I have found is they can be kind of hot. make sure you use this on a hard surface and I would try getting the uv light gloves. Oh one more thing, you should take your rings off before you use this as it can make them hot and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short I would definately recomend this for any at home nail person. It&#x27;s easy to use, wide enough for both hands or feet at the same time and it makes my polish last way longer than without the lights.</li>
    <li> Great size, you can put both hands in it at the same time! Extra long timer! Works great!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product, it is a great value.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.  Works great</li>
    <li> Nice product. Super quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cure the gel polish as hard as I would have liked. The manicure lasted for about a week.</li>
    <li> Broken bulb upon arriving. But worked fine.</li>
    <li> Big, great unit, drys quickly</li>
    <li> She wishes we had bought her the LED type.</li>
    <li> Have used this for myself for about a year. It is great.</li>
    <li> This item was a gift to my babysitter and she happens to do nails professionally on the side.  In the past, I think I got her some pretty cool presents but I don&#x27;t think she was more excited when she received this item.  She used it right away on a client and quickly sent me a thank you text because it worked so well.  I don&#x27;t know what I will do next year to top this gift.</li>
    <li> I love the look and it does its job if I do the alcohol after but not sure if I understand this!&lt;br /&gt;Is it suppose to be blinking the whole time?</li>
    <li> I LOVE this dryer!!! I need to tell you though, I was a little afraid it didn&#x27;t work at first.  I used the dryer for the 180 second timeframe after applying the gel base, I touched my nails before applying the first color coat to make sure they were dry and my nails were sticky/not dry.  I did another cycle for 180 seconds with the same result.  At this point I was so frustrated I just continued painting my nails and curing in between.  After I put the top coat on and used the dryer for the 240 second timeframe twice, my nails were STILL STICKY.  So I took my nail Polish remover on a Cotten ball and tried to take off the color.  After I did that, my nails were perfect!!! And DRY!!! So don&#x27;t be alarmed by the &amp;#34;stickyness&amp;#34; just continue painting and curing until the end!!! Good luck!</li>
    <li> I find that it dries natural nails within 5 minutes and acrylic in about 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these for a gift last Christmas.  This year I got one for myself.  It is easy to install the bulbs and get up and running.  It does a great job on my nails.  No more trying to squeeze into a little dryer and creating smudges with my nails hitting the sides.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed useing my UV lamp to obtain nails that are scratch proof and look great all the time.  Along with the lamp you must buy the Royal nails anti UV gloves.  I was using suntan lotion to protect my hands from the rays.  If you go to the beauty shop you will find that they do not use anything on your hands.  That&#x27;s why I got my own lamp and gloves.  I am protected and can have professional nails at the same time.  You will save a bundle too.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product and seller, recommended this item to all of my friends. Used with CND shellac, better than the salon in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does exactly what&#x27;s expected.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for sister in law she loved it.</li>
    <li> Love this product especially for the price. Plus shipping was very fast and came when it said it was going to! Haven&#x27;t got as much use out of it as I would like to... But love it so far!</li>
    <li> I use this dryer for regular nail polish.  I have not tried any other polish.  I bought this dryer, not expecting it to be fantastic, but I was mistaken.  I previously owned a battery operated $10 fan type device that only blew cold air on one hand at a time.  Even spending an hour drying my nails (several coats of polish), left them tacky and invariably ended up with many &amp;#34;dings&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with this professional dryer, I can do four coats (one base, two color, one top coat) in approximately 20 minutes (two hands at a time!) and no dings or tackiness.  I am extremely pleased.  I would think I would have to spend much, much more money for this result.</li>
    <li> This UV lamp is quite big - you really could put both your hands in it to cure. I have been doing my own gel nails for a while. I originally bought a drug store LED lamp which is very tiny. With LED, you cure for less time 30-60 secs vs 120 sec for UV, but this lamp is so large that you don&#x27;t have to cure 4 fingers, 2 thumbs, 4 fingers like I did with my LED lamp. So this is a time-saver for me. Buy some gloves and cut off the tips to protect your hands from the UV rays and you are good.</li>
    <li> This product worked great!!  It&#x27;s big enough for two of even the biggest feet.  My nails on my fingers and my toes look professionally done.  I would definitely recommend this.  I used the Gel II by Reaction.</li>
    <li> The product arrived earlier than I expected, in perfect condition.  It cures the shellac just like its supposed to.  I like that it has different time settings for cure time.  It allows me to customize the times.  I also love the fact that I can cure both hands or both feet at the same time...dramatically cuts down on the time it takes to do my DIY shellac.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time. It worked perfectly as soon as I turned it on. All the bulbs worked.&lt;br /&gt;Works great with Opi and gelish gels (those are the only ones i&#x27;ve tried yet). Also, you can use the ventilator to dry regular polish of your nails.</li>
    <li> I love this UV light/dryer.  It is powerful and easy to figure out.  I love doing my own gel manicures at home!</li>
    <li> Loved the product! Cured great. Lasted for about 2 weeks. Have to remember that you can&#x27;t wash a lot of dishes :-)</li>
    <li> This product is awesome and it&#x27;s such a great value . I strongly recommend this seller and nail light to anyone who wants to have a professional gel manicure for so much less than going to the salon. This product did an awesome job on my nails and I can&#x27;t wait to use it again and on my friends nails too. The Royal Nails nail light was so easy to use and gives you professional results in your own home. I really liked that it is bigger than most other nail lights out on the market .With the bigger size you can do both of your hands at once and it&#x27;s much easier to do a pedicure . The seller was great to do with and the shipping was very fast. I plan to be doing my nails with this product for years to come.</li>
    <li> i use it often. probably once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only concern to give it a 4 start is that it IS a uv light.&lt;br /&gt;LED is more environmental friendly and no need to worry about uv exposure but is IS more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe i should&#x27;ve invested in a LED light, but so far, this product does it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;big enough for both hands and both feet.&lt;br /&gt;love it!</li>
    <li> I brought this product a few weeks ago. Easy to install lights. Its nice that you can fit two hands &amp; feet when doing your gelish. Works fine. Its huge. It was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Great product, dryes nail quickly.  Very nice product to use for fast drying for both hands or both feet.  Recommend to buys this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome, love it. Dries fast. It is bigger than i was expecting but works excellent. Thank you so very much</li>
    <li> This works great! I use the gelish products and it works perfectly! It&#x27;s big enough for both hands. I&#x27;m every happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for; large enough to fit both hands at once and just as powerful as the ones at the salon. There are three buttons that allow for you to either turn the light on and leave it on (which has the added benefit of lighting the area where I paint my nails -- it&#x27;s that bright), use the timer presets, and turn the fan on or off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part? In two uses this little powerhouse more than paid for itself!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but based on the reviews here I have followed the following steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using OPI brand gel polish&lt;br /&gt;-Base coat, cure for 3 minutes&lt;br /&gt;-Gel polish layer one, cure for 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;-Gel polish layer two, cure for 3 minutes&lt;br /&gt;-Top coat, cure for 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all of this (well over the specified timing) the nails are still not dry and will smudge if rubbed on something. Can&#x27;t figure out what I am doing. INSTRUCTIONS WOULD BE NICE!</li>
    <li> Mega, MEGA upset. Mine was clearly sent back from someone else. It was beat up and the name &amp;#34;Royal Nails&amp;#34; on the front was smudged all over. The buttons in the back all the plastic around was coming up. At first I thought it had a covering on it to protect the buttons that you peel up. Nope, was not the case it is the actual covering on it and its just so poorly don&#x27;t. I want a new one and WILL be sending this back. SO SO SO upset.</li>
    <li> The 54 watt Royal Professional UV Light nail dryer it was what I was looking for and was easy to find.</li>
    <li> My job is very hard on my nails.  For years I have avoided any nail polish other than clear because by the end of the first day, the polish was either cracked or, at the very least, worn off of the tips and looked terrible.  I have tried acrylics but they required too much maintenance and my nails were in awful shape when I removed them.  Because of that, I stay away from any products that have to be soaked off.  I ordered the nail dryer just to use with regular nail polish.  I used it to dry my polish over the weekend and every day that I have worked, my polish still looks fresh.  The girl that works with me has looked at my nails at the end of each day and can&#x27;t believe they aren&#x27;t worn at all.  I am very pleased with this dryer and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it! I am very pleased with this product, very well built and easy to use. Have had and used others that do not compare to quality and ease of use. Makes either gel or enamel coloring stronger and last longer and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time.  Can do both hands or feet at same time, no waiting for one to get done, to do the other. Thank you for producing such a quality product.</li>
    <li> The condition of this product was better than the first one I bought.  It actually looked new.  Haven&#x27;t tested all the lights to see if they work, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be just as satisfied as the first uv light that I bought.</li>
    <li> Great product - Great price!</li>
    <li> This light works great.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My wife now does this while I play video games. Best gift ever!</li>
    <li> As a professional cosmetologist, I occasionally do hair, makeup or nails for clients in my home. I unwisely chose a lesser quality dryer [[ASIN:B006QO4BRM Salon Edge 36W Nail UV Lamp Acrylic Gel Shellac Curing Light Timer 36 Watt Dryer With Slide Out Tray]] for economical reasons, which proceeded to quit working after about 10 uses, necessitating the purchase of this nicer dryer and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the quality construction of this product straight out of the box. I love that you can service both hands or feet simultaneously, the fan keeps it cool while operating quietly, and the higher wattage product has produced longer-lasting manicures for my clients and for me! You can&#x27;t beat this nail dryer, for your home or salon, and I appreciate you offering it at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! We loved it so much we bought a second one to give as a gift!</li>
    <li> It came on time and was exactly what it said it was.</li>
    <li> Surprised at how big it is. Only problem was how hard it was to get open to put the bulbs in. Shipping was fast. I love it !!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I used it several times and with regular and gel nail polish in less than 3 minutes , it  dries fast and no long waiting to dry. How I wish I bought it sooner. It saves me money and time doing my nails.</li>
    <li> My sister loves getting her nails done at the salon but often time she complains about the wait is too long or it&#x27;s a hassle to get them touch up every couple of weeks.  So I got her this light as her birthday present and becomes her all time favorite present.  It&#x27;s a bit bulky but she loves how easy it is to use and now she can do her nails whenever she wants.  She also loves how it saves her a lot of money from going to the salon.</li>
    <li> Very nice and quick order.  Came exactly as described! Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing.  Use one a week bc the gels come off my nails easy and now I don&#x27;t have to pay $30 for a manicure and not be able to touch it up.</li>
    <li> Works great with regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> Great Product for doing nails</li>
    <li> If you are partial artificial nails and prefer the polished look that a professional manicure provides but want to be able to create that look at home this is a perfect UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is priced reasonably, was exactly what I ordered and was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I am a salon owner.  We have recently expanded our nail department and needed a new light gel nail dryer.  I was impressed with the looks, the size and the watts of power this unit has.  We have had it in the studio now for about 3 weeks amd the results of our nail applications has been without any problems.  Our nail techs like the idea you can use it for two hands and toes as well.  I also like the price and when you compare it to the CND unit, which i am quite happy with, you can&#x27;t beat the Royal unit.  I will replace other units as I need to with the Royal nail dryer.&lt;br /&gt;You will not go wrong by purchasing this product.  One thing you must remember...there are no instreuctions with this dryer as there are so many different manufacturers who have so many nuances of how they want their product applied, it would be impossible to add application instructions.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> I love this lamp! Great product at a fantastic price!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have a quality manicure that has lasted 2 weeks and of course I am saving money. It was very easy.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Can cure in little as 90 seconds with a thin coat.  Can do both hands and feet at the same time - no complaints!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my gf for Christmas she was expecting some dinky cheaper version of this from target. so happy i bought this one instead this thing is perfect. she loves it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is big enough to do both hands or feet at the same time and its so convenient to do it quicker.</li>
    <li> Purchased specifically to cure CND shellac and it does a tremendous job with CND shellac.  Complaints you see about shellac not drying are due to users not completing the final step in the CND shellac process which is wiping the nails with alcohol after the final cure.  This removes the sticky residue that they interpret as the nails not being dry.  I am completely happy with this dryer and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> As a &amp;#34;newbie&amp;#34; to doing my own gel nail fills at home, I had to buy so supplies. I bought this UV light and could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly. Fits 2 hands at the same time. Is light-weight. Needs no putting together. Just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Has several timers to use. Perfect!</li>
    <li> It seems like a good deal but the machine itself does not dry the gel. I tried to contact seller and got no response. Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the great reviews.  However, I must&#x27;ve missed the part in the description where it said this nail dryer is roughly the size of a small child.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it&#x27;s probably a really great gel nail dryer, but unless I start charging people and running a nail business out of my home, it was just WAY too big for home only use.</li>
    <li> would i really luv about this product is the fan! it adds an extra it to my drying time. &amp; the fact that the timed settings follow almost identically to the recommended times for application (1min, 3min, etc...) of gelish nails is extra helpful!</li>
    <li> The 54 Watt Royal Nail UV Light works just as described; however, I was so excited about the order, I failed to read the instructions. I assumed because my nails were sticky they weren&#x27;t cured-WRONG. The nails are cured after two minutes. The nail cleaner must be applied to remove excess film. This UV light is also great for drying regular nail polish. I love changing colors often; once the gel is cured, the polish will stay on until removed. The width of the UV light dryer is spacious enough to comfortably stretch your fingers out to ensure perfection.</li>
    <li> works great! love it so much and its super easy to use. Definitely would recommend it to anyone. awesome product!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this nail dryer and would recommend it to everyone.  I shopped around for several weeks looking for a new dryer to replace my old one that died. I must say that based on the positive reviews on this product from Amazon I thought what do I have to lose. Enough people make it sound awesome and they are so right on this, you can be a do-it-yourself or the professional manicurist and this dryer is a great little workhorse. You can use Shellac, Gellish and regular polish as well in this unit. I was able to cut my nail time in half with this dryer.  I had a smaller unit that only would do one had at a time and took a full 2 minutes to cure each segment first the foundation then the 2 coats of color then the top coat and only one hand at a time.  I typically use the Gellish and it takes 90 seconds and it is cured both hands at once.  I love that it is big enough to cure my thumbs to as with my other dryer the foundation and topcoat would run to the side and get thick on the edges not with this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually polish my toes because I tend to chip or smear them while drying with this I can polish and dry for 120 seconds just to make sure and I am good to go drying again both feet at one time.  It is quiet and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I found is I had to find a new place to store it as it is larger and does not fit in my nail kit carrier that I have but it is so worth the money and easy to use. It is so easy to install the bulbs and plug in and good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough I love this dryer it is professional grade with the easy of using at home.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006IBM21K 54 WATT ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL AND ACRILIC NAIL DRYER &amp; CURING RN541 WORKS WITH CND, SHELLAC, OPI, HARMONY GELLISH, IBD GELAC, ETC.. FOR DOUBLE. HANDS OR FEET.]]</li>
    <li> I just recently bought all the supplies needed to do my own gel nails at home. I did my research and hardly anyone said exactly what UV light they were using. All that was said was that you need to buy a good one but not over one hundred dollars. The CND brand was recommended a lot, and I really didn&#x27;t want to spend that much on a nail dryer with this being my first time attempting to do my own nails. This nail dryer is amazing, it has different time settings and it looks just like what you&#x27;d find in a nail salon. Another perk the price was just right. You absolutely do not have to spend that much. It worked great with my CND gel products and there is plenty of room to get in and out. Also it&#x27;s quiet because you can turn the fan off and on, which was very nice. I hope this review help the first timers like myself.</li>
    <li> So recently I was looking to purchase items to do my own gel nails. I have been getting them professionally done for about 6 months now. My nails split a lot and the gel really seems to stop that from happening. For those of you who pay to get them done you know that it can get costly. So I know from watching the ladies at the shop that the UV lamp is very important. The better the gel dries the longer my nails would last. I read so many reviews about these UV lamps and after reading the positive reviews on the 54 Watt Royal Nails Professional UV light I decided to try it. I am SO glad I did too! It works great!!! The lightbulbs are so easy to put in which I read the others had so many issues with. It was the EASIEST thing to do. Just pop in the lightbulbs, plug it in and turn on the switch. It is well with the price and not only does it work for gel nails I was able to do my sisters nails with regular polish and it dried in minutes! It has several timers 5 I believe(90,120,180,240,300 min AND a built in fan)and is so spacious that you can fit both hands and feet if your doing your own pedicure. I also liked the convenience of being able to fix my own nails because we all know to go back and fix just one nail is a pain! I have never left a review before but I hoped that I could help someone make their decison a bit easier if your on the fence on which dryer you will purchase. If you want to invest in a great product this one is definately it!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this nail dryer. The larger size is great and keeps me from bumping my fingers or toes against the side and ruining my polish. The seller is excellent and the dryer shipped very quickly. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I never opened the package.  I tried to cancel, but there must have been a timing issue because they sent it anyway.  I found a better product with more wattage, less cost and included all the nail polish.</li>
    <li> My Wife and I researched the options for a few days and chose this one...  Very, very happy with the choice.  The large bay with 54 watts power and multiple electronic timer selections make it top of class for the price paid.  Great value!</li>
    <li> I got this item for my wife, it took forever for her to do her nails and if you are a guy waiting on a woman anything that speeds up the getting ready process is a win. Well this dryer cut her prep time in half, easily. I asked how she liked it and she just smiled, gave me a kiss, and said &#x27;thank you.&#x27; Is there a better review out there than that? ...I don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly she had a smaller dryer before that was just crap and it took forever to dry her nails this dryer is worth the money, don&#x27;t try to get a cheaper model and expect that it will work anything like this one. My wife raves about the combo of UV and Fan.</li>
    <li> Although the item I received looked used, it did the trick. Looks like it may have been a return. I am just a little disappointed in the condition I received it in. For a machine priced this much I wouldn&#x27;t have expected that. Other than that its a great machine and cures my OPI gel polish beautifully and fast.</li>
    <li> I love this UV Lamp. I am heavy set and still able to get both hand or feet in at a time. Most salons don&#x27;t even offer this convenience and I have it all to myself, and my friends!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied.  I used the suggestions from other reviews about timing etc... Lots of fun to do my own nails for free.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer with the intention of doing shellac on my nails. I live 45 minutes out of tow and between the drive and the time it took to get my nails done I decided to try it on my own. I now have finally been able to grow out my nails and they look great all of the time! I love this dryer and plan to buy three more for my daughters for Christmas. It has exceeded my expectations. It was bigger than I thought but I can actually dry both my hands or both my feet at the same time making the process much quicker. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I like this system it is huge and you can fit your toes in it and your hands.  Only suggestion for people if you are going to use this put sunscreen on your hands so you don&#x27;t get skin cancer.</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful and I am 100% happy with it. I am not a professional, but it is easy to use. Also, item was shipped quickly. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this light!  It&#x27;s pretty big since it can do both hands at the same time (so be prepared for that when you get ready to use it!), but I LOVE that I can get one whole hand done at once, rather than 4 fingers then the thumb like you have to do with smaller sized lights.  It&#x27;s actually quite lightweight for its size, so it&#x27;s not too cumbersome to move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some getting used to in order to set the timer and stuff, because the buttons are on the opposite side of where you place your hands - fine if you have someone doing your nails, but somewhat of a pain if you&#x27;re doing them yourself and need to reach over and look at the buttons.  Once you use it a few times you memorize the buttons though, so not a deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely pricier than other models, but I chose this one based on the other great reviews and the larger size, and I have not been disappointed.  I&#x27;ve more than paid for the light in the money (and gas) I&#x27;ve saved by NOT going to the salon every two weeks to have my nails done!</li>
    <li> Excellent Value,&lt;br /&gt;Used as a present for daughter who is a beautician.  She loved it and was very surprised getting it.</li>
    <li> Love this nail lamp.  It&#x27;s easy to use and my nails last two weeks.  It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions but I found a video on YouTube.</li>
    <li> Shipped before expected! Product is nicely packaged. I have used the uv light to cure gel nails and am really happy with it. It is large enough for both hands and feet.  Basic instructions are included for the lamp.  I think if you had problems curing it might be good to look up the product you are using instructions.  Every product has different times for curing and prep steps. I am a professional licensed cosmetologist and love the watts and price of this worked great!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife. She had been using a 9W unit like a champ but I wanted to get her a nicer model. I ordered this model for her and the next day she was talking about getting a better one than what she had. After doing a bunch of research she decided on this model without knowing I had already ordered it.  The look on her face was priceless when it showed up the next day. She has been thoroughly pleased with everything about it.  She&#x27;s done her fingers and toes with no issues. Everything works as described. We checked the timer for accuracy and it was only about 3 seconds off. Make sure to read some other reviews about assembly.  While not difficult the directions aren&#x27;t very clear as stated in other posts. My wife highly recommends this and so do I (great brownie points).  ;)</li>
    <li> Took a chance on this lamp, but it does not do the job. I trusted the great reviews and was sorely disappointed. Guess I couldn&#x27;t have expected much from a $28.00 lamp, but my nails did not dry at all. I even tried leaving them in for double the time. My polish creased and peeled- which should not happen in a gel manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the store it went. Worth it to spend a little more money on something that works.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s a little larger than most but that gives you more room (I tend to hit the back and make a nick in my polish).  Used it at least 20 times already and works like a charm.</li>
    <li> did not harden the polish. wouldnt recommend!</li>
    <li> It definitely gets the job done &amp; fast. Gave 4 stars because the first one stopped working after one use. But exchange was quick and easy...great product with good customer service.</li>
    <li> It does exactly as it says in the add. I like that I can put both hands in at once &amp; be done much quicker. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after doing quite a bit of research online about the gel manicure systems. I discovered that the nail polish manufactures have designed the gel polishes to be system specific, meaning an opi polish has a specific cure time and may need an LED light to cure as apposed to an UV light. Same with gelish, etc... I purchased several of the OPI gel polishes as I had read that these could be cured with an UV light but it would take a little longer. This system was advertised to work for OPI and others so i figured it would be a good system to have, allowing more options for polish colors from different companies.  The lamp turns on and the fan on the unit works. However, one of the bulbs was broken when I received it (I guess you could expect something like this, being that it was shipped). My major issue with it is that it wont cure the gel polishes, even after keeping my hands in the system for about 10 minutes for each of the layers, base, polish X 2 and top coat. It will partially cure some of the colors, allowing me to rub the color right off my nails. I tried another brand of gel polish and the same thing happened. So frustrating! Now I am looking at buying an OPI system, which is what I should have done from the start.</li>
    <li> Got this so I could do my nails at home and skip the pricing salon prices. It works wonderfully. Easy to install the bulbs and work the controls. I like the timer function which I have tested and is accurate. Would highly recommend this UV light for do-it-yourself manicures that look like you got them done in a salon.</li>
    <li> It easily fits two hands or two feet which is what I wanted. The verdict is still out on how well it works and whether it was worth it. I will update this review.</li>
    <li> Great light and works very good.. Light works fast and both hands can be place in to at the same time....</li>
    <li> Very good product. works very well... timer feature is very good and works fine. I would recommend it but if you are using it at home ,smaller one would work just fine.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this purchase.  I did my feet and nails as well as my mom&#x27;s manicure and pedicure.  And, she loves the job it did on her hands and feet.  She is a nurse so she washing her hands frequently, and often times her manicures don&#x27;t last long because of this.  The gel manicure is exactly what she needed so her manicures can last longer.  Also, painting my nails takes literally took 10 to 12 minutes now, whereas before it took 10 minutes in drying time alone. Thanks Royal.</li>
    <li> After falling in love with gel nails at the salon I knew I needed to find a way to apply gel nails myself.  I researched UV lights and kept coming back to this one.  For the price and the quality you cannot go wrong with this lamp.  It is pretty big, big enough for both hands &amp; feet.  I have used all different brands of polishes with this lamp and the 90 sec timer setting cures my polish.  Be sure and apply thin coats of base &amp; top coats. Hope this helps.  This is a great lamp!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I did the research for this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is the same item used in salons.&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
    <li> My daughter and I just tryed this product and we&#x27;re very pleased with it! Our nails were dry in the time it said they would be and we were doing things right away after using it with no messed up polish! I would recomend this for sure. Nice and big too. Can easily fit both hands in it.</li>
    <li> The device arrived in a timely fashion. It works beautifully, as advertised. It is rather large, so it is necessary to have an appropriate space in which to store it. I have done my own nails several times using it, which I would not have attempted without it. If you have the space GO FOR IT!</li>
    <li> This is the catalliac of nail curing dryers.  It worked great and I have salon quality nails that I did at home at my own leisure.  I did each hand separately but could have done both at the same time and saved time.  I bought the CND base and top coat from Amazon and used a different brand colored nail polish and they just look amazing!  I think I will try the toes next.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and I love everything about it except for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come with anything to product your skin (gloves, etc.)from the UV light. Fast deliivery</li>
    <li> I loved this product and it did exactly what is was supposed to!  The design is perfect for doing both feet or hands at the same time</li>
    <li> I really like this item a lot. It will save me a ton of money. It is really simple to use and it does a nice job.</li>
    <li> Works well and looks how it does in pictures. It&#x27;s easy to work with and everyone loves it. I am looking forward to doing business with you again.</li>
    <li> This product is everything I was expecting. I am very pleased this this item!!! I will definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The item is great and it does exactly what it is meant for. It driesand shines my nails very quickly.</li>
    <li> Works great but is about twice as large as you think. Both hands can fit if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into</li>
    <li> I wanted to try doing my nails at home. I enjoy going to a salon but since my move to Tampa I have found nail techs to be too rough on my hands so I wanted to try doing them myself with gel polish. I am very pleased with this dryer. It works exactly like salon nail dryers, easy to set up and put away when not in use. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I use this for home and it works GREAT!  I can also see that it works well enough that I would recommend that it could also be used professionally.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional, but I like to have my nails done and don&#x27;t like to spend a ton at the salon every 2-3 weeks.  This dryer has already paid for itself in savings!  Make sure you know all the correct steps for applying and curing gel nail polish before giving it a negative rating to eliminate user error.  Also, this dryer is very big.  I knew that going in, but it could be a surprise to some.  I could probably fit both hands and a foot in it if I really tried :)  I like being able to dry both hands at the same time, so I don&#x27;t mind the size, but if you are looking for a dryer that takes up less space this might not be the one for you.  One minor complaint that I had is that it doesn&#x27;t come with user instructions, but after poking a few buttons I quickly figured out how they all worked.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Can&#x27;t have polish without this.</li>
    <li> This was my first UV light purchase, so I opted for the two-hand size UV light, not being sure what would work best for me.  Now that I&#x27;ve being doing my own gel nails for a while, I realized that a one-hand size would have been enough.  Still, this is a simple, well made light at a lower price than many others on the market.  There is a built in fan to keep your hand cool, and an easy time-set button.  The two handed size does work better when you&#x27;re doing someone else&#x27;s nails, but if you&#x27;re doing your own, the one-hand size is enough.  I do my sister&#x27;s nails, so it works well for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I received this product in great condition.  The bulbs(lamps) were all fine and easy to insert.  I was a little skeptical when the Royal nails logo was slightly smudged on the item itself.  However, it has proven to be a great UV lamp.  Be sure to apply a UV protection gel on your hands or use a good hand lotion if you use this often.  It will dry your skin. I like the ability to do my own gel nails at home and save $.  With this product, I can do my nails whenever I feel like it.  It is large enough to fit both hands or feet under.</li>
    <li> We ended up sending it back because it was too big for personal use at home.  Sure, you can dry two hands at once...but can you paint both hands fast enough by yourself without messing up to dry both at the same time?  In my opinion, this would best be used in a salon.  We took it out of the box, and it appeared well made and sturdy (heavy), so I&#x27;m sure it will last.</li>
    <li> Arrived per described.&lt;br /&gt;The bulbs are carefully wrapped and you do need to install them yourself, but it&#x27;s easy.&lt;br /&gt;Never will I have to go to the salon again for my manicure!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Works perfectly. I have been using a hellish base coat, then regular nail polish, then gelish topcoat and they last for 2 weeks.  No chipping. They maintain shine. Love this lamp!</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this as a Christmas present. It nice to be able to do my own nails at home without having to pay high price at salon. The dryer is large enough for both hands or both feet to fit in dryer at same time. It is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and granddaughter for Christmas and they are absolutely thrilled!  They received this so quickly that I barely had time to let them know to expect a package.  I would definitely buy from them again.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I purchased and it was a gift for my daughter.  The polish stays on my nails for 2 full weeks if: I put my nails under the light for 5-6 minutes after each coat AND cover the edge of my nails.  It saves me so much time and money.  I no longer have to go to a salon and pay $35 for this service including tips!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had this item for 3 month now. I purchased this lamp fot it&#x27;s functuonality and size. I have a pretty big hands so ordering it I was worried that it would be too tight. Good news is that I am able comfortably fit both of my hands or both of my feet in. Lamp has a good vertical clerance so you shouldn&#x27;t be worried to smudge your nails puting them in or taking out of the lamp. The control panel is easy to read and use, no instructions needed. I also use the top to rest my wrists or hands while working.  Lamp has a great apperance, plastic is very smooth and shiny, does not capture fingerprints easily. The device is pretty lightweight, which makes it easy to move from place to place, also the cord is a surprisingly good length. I use it mostly on my regular nail polish to set it faster, but also on gel time to time and it works great.</li>
    <li> This is great for doing my gels.</li>
    <li> Very nice but i found it cheaper at wal greens but dont know if it is any good.&lt;br /&gt;This one works great</li>
    <li> Got this last year for Christmas...used it all year with Gelish polishes and the gel brand from Big Box RED store.  Perfectly works.  Online now buying two for Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my Wife. The unit was very easy to set up and to use as well. After watching a video regarding gel polish application, she was on her way. She absolutely loves the system so far and would recommend this to anyone wishing to try this for themselves.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this item. I have very long nails without going to the salon to have tips put on. And for the most part, I&#x27;ve been very blessed with the strength of them. But every couple of months, it feels the older I get, the thinner my nails r becoming. So I purchased gel nail polish to give them the added strength plus its a beautiful look. I love how well the machine does its job. I have had so many compliments on them and its saving me a ton of money doing it myself. I am a single Mom to  20, 18, 7 &amp; 5 yr old. I&#x27;m always running and finding time for me can difficult.  Luckily, this machine dries and hardens the nails VERY fast. I am so happy to have it.!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice UV light. Shipped very fast, well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent price, have used it many times, works very well, beyond satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this item. Been so sick and tired of waiting for my nail polish to dry and I end up smudging the nail polish each time I paint my nails. I also use it for the Gel Nails. It dries very quicklly and after I use the gel nails, I use the nail polish of my choice and they dry very fast and no more smuding with my nail polish. If I had to, I would buy this item again. Can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
    <li> Excellent value.  Glad I didn&#x27;t waste time and money on one that would only do one hand/foot at a time.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love it, so glad I ordered it.</li>
    <li> I just started using the gel polish on my nails and I really love it  I wanted something to protect my hands from the uv light, and these gloves are great!  They cover the hands but leave the nails exposed.  They are very comfortable and fit very well.  I would recommend these highly!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received the product.  I did a gell mani pedi right away and I am thrilled with the results.  Before purchasing the product I did research on line and read reviews on machines much more costly.  I actually purchased another line that was the same price and a fraction of the quality.  The Royal UV Dryer can be utilized for both gel and traditional mani/pedi.  I really love that you can do both hands or feet at one time which cuts down the time,  Love the product and it paid for itself with one mani/pedi.  The only drawback is the instructions for opening the dome to place the bulbs could have been better defined,  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this uv light dryer! Speeds up the drying process, and has an awesome fan to keep it from getting too hot. Dryer is bigger then expected and comfortably fits both hands or both feet at the same time. I cant wait to do my nails now! Shiping was fast, and actually arrived a few days early :)</li>
    <li> I have never used one of these lamps before, I bought it based on the recent customer reviews and the fact that it 54 watt which is higher than most in the price range.  I worked great my first time.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. I know I will save money for sure.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp and was super excited to use it for a girls night in... Super disappointed , the lamp would not turn on, and the timer area where you select how many seconds was all scratched up and dingy. Never buying again! If I could put negative starts -5starts⭐️</li>
    <li> This product works great and dries nails very quickly.  I wanted to try gel nails at home instead of salon acrylic nails.  The drier works very well for this, and is amazing how quickly it dries. My nails look like a professional job.</li>
    <li> I am definitely a DIY shellac and gel polish addict!! The first dryer and polish kit I bought was the Sensationail brand (around $50 at Walmart). It worked fairly well with the included polish. I also tried it with Opi for Sephora brand with decent results. It is nowhere near the same quality as the Royal Nails Dryer (priced about the same)! Today I tried the CND Shellac products (Red Baroness color)with my new dryer. AMAZING! My nails cured perfectly in the roomy dryer and the multiple timer settings are great. I am no expert and have professional quality results with very little effort. Love, love, love it!!</li>
    <li> The machine was delivered and the UV lights were missing.This was a gift for my Aunt for Christmas. She couldn&#x27;t use it, I was embraced that I didn&#x27;t check it first . I&#x27;m returning it an ordering a different brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my nails done at two different salons and really liked the finished product of the gel nails. I don&#x27;t have the time or money to keep going back to have them done so I ordered this dryer and am so happy with it. I used it for the first time and, though I need to get better at painting my nails, the machine worked just like the one at the salon. It&#x27;s big enough to do your toenails too. This product pays for itself in a very short time. It is nicer and larger then the ones used at both of the places I&#x27;ve had my nails done, it is very easy to use, does a great job and I would recomend it to every one who likes to do their own nails at home.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! I searched local stores, online stores and this seemed to be the best deal and it is!! It&#x27;s huge! I can comfortably fit both hands into this light for gel nails. It has several different timers and even a built in fan! GREAT price!!</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is so easy to use.  I am a novice and beginning my first CND Shellac manicure was a SNAP!!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this product. Less expensive than an LED light but the result were still good. Wait time is a little longer than I would like but I can not complain. This will be saving me tons of time and money. I enjoy doing my own nails anyways. I&#x27;m kind of an artsy kind of gal. Definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product.  Condition Excellent...would use again....</li>
    <li> The instructions were crap for what you pay for this product, I read some others comments that helped figure out how to us this machine and polish, not thanks to the product</li>
    <li> Love it! Worked perfectly out of the box &amp; I&#x27;m enjoying loong-lasting nail polish!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I had a 36 watt and when I saw this I had to buy and test it out! And I&#x27;m in love!! It dries quick and I love all the different settings!! This is a must buy for those who love doing nails!</li>
    <li> I was recommended this dryer by a friend, and I love it. I have done my nails numerous times at home now, and not only is it BETTER than the salon ones (because you can fit all 10 fingers inside at once), it saves me time and money. Well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> this machine is large enough for me to stick both hands in and spread my fingers, too large to my taste but it&#x27;s already home so i will keep it.  Large size comes handy when i do my mom&#x27;s nails, and she can cure both hands at once.</li>
    <li> This is a great machine to have to do gel nails. It is much bigger than ones you can buy at local stores. It is much more of a professional product.  I used the IBD gel nail polish and It worked great. It has a timer. I used two minutes for each coat. They dried  The only thing is make sure you don&#x27;t have any nail polish on your cuticles of skin before you put it under the light because it will stay there until you remove it.</li>
    <li> I bought this nail dryer for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!  She said she gets professional results without a trip to the salon.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s big enough for 2 hands. It is professional grade, awesomely priced and the best I have ever used. I&#x27;m not a professional, but decided to save money and do my own gel nails at home.</li>
    <li> Mine came with a bunch of scratches in the inside of it :( but it has work so far!</li>
    <li> Way bigger than I was expecting. But you can put both feet in at once.</li>
    <li> My daughter is a nail tech and has a different UV light machine.  She saw mine and loves it.  She even told me to put it in my will so she will get it.  Of course, I will buy her one of her own (so she won&#x27;t have to wait).  The quality and ease of use is GREAT!!!  It is large enough for both hands or feet to fit in comfortably. Now I can do my own nails when my daughter isn&#x27;t available.  I can also change polish more often.  It arrived sooner than expected.  Excellent quality and very quick service!</li>
    <li> i love the fact that its big and spacious. i love that the built in fan is put in it. the price is awesome and the lights was easy to put in. its also not heavy at all for being that big. im super happy that i ordered this and will recommemend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Really love it!!! Only thing I&#x27;m confused about is warranty &amp; how to get replacement bulbs if they go out.....</li>
    <li> Just received my UV Lamp today and I love it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful!... I use it for applying CND Shellac Power Polish products, and getting my toes and nails done within 40 min... and then enjoy wearing perfectly looking polish with practically no maintenance for at least couple of weeks...my only regret is not starting using this product earlier in life :)</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try the system out but was very pleased with the speed of filling the order.</li>
    <li> This product delivers exactly what the description states and ordering was painless. It took a couple practices to get the right thickness and style I was looking for and is a great tool. Extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works well, but 2 bulbs burnt out after 4 regular uses.</li>
    <li> This light solved all my problems when curing my gel nails. It works super quick and has worked on 3 different brands of gel polish. I  love it and only wish i had purchased it from the beginning. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and great fast service!! exceeded my expectations!!! great value!!</li>
    <li> Love this dryer.  Big enough for both hands and you never hit the dryer on your finger nails or toe nails.  Great investment.</li>
    <li> Love this lamp!! Can get clients hands done very quickly because of the size.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Great product!</li>
    <li> Ahhhmazing! Dries super quick. You can use regular nail polish as long as you use UV topcoat.  Strongly recommend</li>
    <li> Product works perfectly and as described, but has more than a few visible scratches. Clearly a returned item, which is cool because it works anyway, but less than enchanting to see when opening a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> I can be under the light and the nails still aren&#x27;t dry, I am very disappointed and will NOT recommend</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase..works great! It is exactly as described. Glad i can start using uv nail polish and curing with this lamp!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the bargain that I received on this item. It works great and I received it by the time they had advised. I would recommend this company to everyone who needed the items that they sell.</li>
    <li> This UV light is very powerful and easy to use. I use this for my gel nail, and&lt;br /&gt;works very well. This is goof price for this 54w UV light!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the lamp. Had to put in the light bulbs but its self explanatory. Used it for the first time and nails turned out great. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again. Thank you! ;)</li>
    <li> Just purchased recently and have used several times. Easy to use, cures gel base and top coat quickly. Very powerful light, once nails are cured you are all set and ready to go:)</li>
    <li> I got this for $49 somehow and should have paid way more! It fits both feet at the same time! The fan is great for when the bulbs get too hot on skin!!</li>
    <li> I love that I can do both hands/feet in this - saves lots of time.  Haven&#x27;t had long - but am pleased with the results.  If it is a long-lasting product as well - perfect.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a UV Light for doing gel manicures.  I had looked at a lot of units before I came across this one.  The price couldn&#x27;t be beat and it works great.  I live in Okinawa Japan and sometimes it can take a while to receive things I order from the States.  The package got to me in about a week!  I will definitely purchase from this seller again as well as recommend them to my friends.</li>
    <li> My sister bought this UV light so I got to use it, and it is AMAZING! This is what you have been looking for &#x3D;) I&#x27;m super sad they no longer offer it on Amazon because I was going to buy one for myself. I tried looking for a similar light but couldn&#x27;t find anything in the price range with the same time settings, wattage, and a built in fan. Its been almost two weeks and my nails still look great.</li>
    <li> Bought this after becoming exhausted with the process and expense of getting my nails done at the salon.  I cannot believe I didn&#x27;t invest in this sooner!  This lamp is probably even nicer than the ones they were using at the nail shop and large enough that I didn&#x27;t bump my fingers around trying to get my hands in and out of it.  Large enough to even put both feet in there to do gel on my tootsies too!  Impressed with the simplicity in design and worked perfectly, curing polish in record time.  Great investment for anyone wanting to do their own mani/pedi at home (incidentally, I had no idea gel polish was so much easier to work with than regular polish, it goes on flawlessly even using my left hand).  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  Met my expections and have used it quite a few times since purchasing.</li>
    <li> This light is awesome! Shipping was fast, it&#x27;s big and works like magic.  I received it before I got my polish so I went and bought polish just to try it, I&#x27;ll never get them professionally done again, mine stay longer when I do it with this light!</li>
    <li> Seriously professional grade here. This is even fancier then the ones used in the posh NYC nail salons. A must buy for the savvy and creative at-home gel fanatics.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lamp for my daughter&#x27;s 18th birthday.  She was so surprised!  She and I have fallen in love with it!  It was everything we wanted.  Thanks for great service also. (We just wished it came with instructions on how to do your nails)  I recommend this product to everyone that is thinking about purchasing a uv lamp.</li>
    <li> The lamp itself works great and arrived quickly and intact.  I was most impressed with the customer service.  They responded so quickly to my question.  They set the bar sky high for fantastic customer service!</li>
    <li> The UV nail dryer arrived in a timely fashion.  So excited&lt;br /&gt;to not have to leave the house.  Upon opening the box was&lt;br /&gt;surprised there wasn&#x27;t more protection for product.  Two&lt;br /&gt;bulbs were broke.  One with socket left in and one with&lt;br /&gt;socket still attached.  There was no protection inside the&lt;br /&gt;box to prevent this from happening.  Something so minor&lt;br /&gt;could have made this a more pleasant experience.  Now need&lt;br /&gt;to order more bulbs and have been unsuccessful.  Used with&lt;br /&gt;what is there and works great, but would like to replace&lt;br /&gt;missing bulbs.  We had to take nail dryer apart and get all&lt;br /&gt;the little pieces out.  Good luck and hopefully packaging&lt;br /&gt;will change.</li>
    <li> Everything is great worked perfect seems to well with all products. I bought two and gave one to my mom she loves it too</li>
    <li> I have recommended this item to friends already.  My nails have never been able to grow due to brittleness. Since I&#x27;ve started using the gel nail system a month ago, I finally am getting length and rarely have a break in my nails. The polish stays on and allows me to have the manicured look without the manicured cost. Love it!</li>
    <li> If you are considering buying an UV lamp, think no further.  This is a full 54 Watt professional nail dryer that you can use on natural and fake nails - not just limited to gels and acrylics.  Get a UV topcoat (I use Seche Ultra-V) and YOU CAN CURE REGULAR NAIL POLISH (with UV topcoat).  A large majority of lamps are 36 watts (4 - 9 watt bulbs), this dryer comes with 6 bulbs for 54W.  Easily accommodates both hands or feet.  Timer has 60 second increments up to 5 minutes, and a fan that is optional for use.  It is a super bargain at this price.  The only drawback is that it&#x27;s not really convenient for travel, it can be transported but it&#x27;s not convenient.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find an affordable UV lamp, with higher wattage. However, I bought this and I&#x27;m sooo happy with it. I do my own gel nails at home (using IBD Gels) and I have to say this works amazingly well. My nails cured in a timely manner and did not have to leave them in there longer (like I would with other UV lamps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation is a easy, just open and pop the bulbs in. No hassle and no directions needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buttons are easy to understand and there is also a fan option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any complaints at all!</li>
    <li> Works well. Doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the salon, but pretty good. Might be that I didn&#x27;t apply perfectly</li>
    <li> This dryer is wonderful, works very well and is easy to use, and it is full size so I can place both hands or feet in at the same time.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! Paid for itself in two uses. Do not need to go to a nail salon and pray that the nail tech you get knows what they are doing!</li>
    <li> This is my first attempt at nail shellac so I ordered this unit as it was less expensive than the CND one so I figured if it didn&#x27;t work out, I hadn&#x27;t spent over $100 for it. It came boxed up well protected and bigger than I thought it would be. I used it today and I could not be happier with it.  It is larger enough to do both hands or feet at the same time ( however I need to practice a little more to perfect the technique)  It has all the timer settings needed and even a fan.  Although some reviews said they felt it didn&#x27;t cure enough, my nails we&#x27;re tacky at every step.  Then at the end, I used the rubbing alcohol as suggested and all the &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; was gone and my nails were smooth and dry.  I could do anything right away.  I highly recommend this unit!  I&#x27;m not sure if less expensive brands of shellac might be the problem with those who reported issues.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would work. It cured my nails barely and didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the salons. Not impressed</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this professional-grade 54 watt UV light.  It comes with 6-9 watt bulbs which are easy to insert.  There are 2 tabs to press on the bottom of the unit which opens the light so you can peel off the blue plastic and insert the 6 UV bulbs.  Then plug it in, turn it on with a toggle switch located on the back of the unit, and you are all set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are ready to place your manicured hands or feet inside the unit all you need to do is press a button, located on top of the unit, to time your cure anywhere from 60 seconds on up to 300 seconds (1-5 minutes), depending on your needs.  It also has a button on top to turn on an internal fan, if desired.  When I am done using it I turn the fan off, then I turn the unit off with the back toggle switch, and lastly, I unplug it.  (I&#x27;m weird about leaving electrical appliances plugged in...your call).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered rating this 4 not 5 stars because it arrived with one bulb broken,  but I called Amazon, they found me a replacement bulb at no charge and I had it within a few days.  It is my opinion that this UV light deserves all 5 stars.  I have used it many times and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  If you are considering this purchase, I would suggest snapping it up before this seller is out of stock again and the price (from other sellers) jumps back up to over $100!

Otherwise, if interested read on!&lt;br /&gt;💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅&lt;br /&gt;1st I wash my hands and under my fingernails well, using soap, water and a nail brush, then dry.  If you are happy with your nail length and shape, all you do is push back the cuticles and gently rough up the surface of your nails with a fine grit nail file until you have taken all the natural &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, use a gel cleanser or rubbing alcohol on a lint free wipe to further clean the oils from each nail.  I use the highest % I can find, like 92% rubbing alcohol.  Sometimes I use those tiny pre-packaged alcohol wipes.  Amazon sells them at a good price. Then I clean my gel brush with rubbing alcohol and dry it, making sure there are no particles, dust or lab puppy hairs on it. 🐕 You can simplify by just using the brush that comes with your gel polishes if you wish.  The next thing I do is lightly brush on a dehydrate product (I use IBD&#x27;s) and place my hand under the UV light for 10-20 seconds.  A bonder is next; I lightly brush on OPI&#x27;s &amp;#34;Bond Aid&amp;#34;, avoiding the cuticles and sidewalls.  Now you&#x27;re ready for the fun part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are lucky enough to have nice strong fingernails and do not need to lengthen, shape or repair them, you are ready for a gel base coat.  Brush on slowly and evenly avoiding contact with cuticles or sidewalls.  Clean up any areas of gel on skin with an orangestick,  then place your hand under your beautiful, new UV light (cure it) for 1 minute.  The internal fan is optional.  Next, brush on your gel color coat and cure for 2 minutes.  I usually like 2 coats of color, so repeat last step, cure.  Then brush on your gel topcoat and cure for 2 minutes.  Use your gel cleanser or rubbing alcohol on a lint-free wipe and clean the tacky layer that is left on your fingernails.  Clean your gel brush again too, if using one.  Last of all, gently massage cuticle oil onto your cuticles and surrounding skin.  You now have a beautiful, shiny, durable manicure which will last 2-3 weeks!  I use the cuticle oil every night before bed to keep them healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out YouTube video tutorials for more information on gel manicures including how to lengthen, strengthen, shape, stamp, do french tips, decorate and remove them.

    <li> This was delievered in 1 day! The dryer is huge you cna put both hands and feet in simultaneously! Great!</li>
    <li> Love this lamp nails look amazing when finished. Problem it they peel off two days later. The polish (multiple brands) comes off like a shell (not chipped, but the entire surface area falls off). I know im doing something wrong please help ladies. Thank you in advance:)</li>
    <li> It gives perfect finishing and very fast. I like it and I recommend it. Good buy but I kettle pricy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my daughter for her birthday.  She absolutely loves it!  While it is large enough to accommodate two hands at once, she says it is just easier to do one hand at a time when doing her own nails.  But if she were doing her toes, she would do them both at the same time.  The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  Would purchase again if the need arose.</li>
    <li> It works just as expected! I get perfect nails every time even though I had no experience doing nails prior to my purchase.</li>
    <li> This works great and have been very happy with the product.  It is big enough to put both hands in at the same time.</li>
    <li> It is a great machine... Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great lamp! Large enough to do both hands or feet at once, works incredibly well and high-quality!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT DRIES NAILS PROPERLY AND PROMPTLY.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s better than the one they used at the professional salon I recently went to.</li>
    <li> Works great but 3 light bulbs went out on the 5th use. Very upset because I have to order the bulbs. The light bulbs are $7 each + the shipping cost and time waiting for them to arrive just added to the overall cost. It looks like it was previously used, and One of the latches was broken as well.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer; the fact that I can do both hands at one time is the biggest time saver ever!  I can complete my manicure in less than 15 minutes (this does not include the removal of the polish time).  I HATED going to the nail salon; having to keep to an appointment time; pay out $60 or so for a mani/pedi.  Now I can do this at home at my convenience; it takes a quarter of the time, and I LOVE it.  Am telling all of my friends about it!</li>
    <li> Recently I purchased the 54 watt ROYAL nails professional uv light. I LOVE it!! It has already paid for itself because I didn&#x27;t have to pay $30.00 (3 times already) to someone else to have my nails done! My daughter uses the machine too. It&#x27;s a great product. The quality is top of the line.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! The box came in good unopened condition and it looked like it was brand new. Works ten times better than the single hand dryer I had been using. Works perfectly and now I can do my nails in half the time it would normally take me.</li>
    <li> I love this product- I would def recommend it! I has made my trips to the Salon a distant memory!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that I can use this dryer for my hand and feet.  This dryer is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This was such a great buy. I had no idea it would be big enough for both hands! Such a great surprise. I&#x27;ve gotten so many CND colors now all thanks to this beautiful machine. I love that it offers different time settings and a fan as well. Such a great deal! You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> This UV lamp is fabulous!  High quality and very powerful.  Dries nails very quickly so it saves me a lot of drying time.  Price is unbeatable as well as the service.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how fast this dried my nails.  It took a total 7 minutes to dry the 3 different layers: base, color and top.  Works wonders for a squirmy 3 year old!  I did have to read online for instructions, but it was very easy to use once I knew how.  I love that I can put both hands in at once.</li>
    <li> Have tried the OPI Gel kit that comes with a UV light and then ordered this product.  It is superior in size and length of time to cure gel.  I would highly recommend it for those doing GEL nails in their home.  I bought the OPI gel products and am now able to do the entire process at home.  This vendor shipped quickly and product was as described.</li>
    <li> This product works great! I love the fact that I can place both hands or feet in at once. This saves me time and money. My gel polish lasts longer than other dryers I&#x27;ve used. I recommend other busy women to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I unboxed the item for the first time, and inserted the bulbs as per the instructions. When I turned the power switch on, nothing happened. I have tried using several different outlets, and the product still does not turn on. I am returning this item and looking for a UV light from a different brand. Completely unimpressed with this brand.</li>
    <li> It was good but after 3  uses the 2 bulbs died on me.  So I have to buy 2 new bulbs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now.  It came on time, all of the lights, fan, timer, etc. worked just fine.  This and a starter kit of some sort pays for itself in two manicures.</li>
    <li> I am living in Turkey but my shipping adress was in usa for that reason i got my product after the last returning date. 3 of lights were not working but i couldnt return it. It was my first experience i paid for a trash</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a fantastic rate.  I saw this light on other sites for twice as much. It also had speedy shipping which is always nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this so that I could do my own gel nail polish.  I absolutely hate getting nails done at salons and do not like how unsanitary salons are. This is a great product and has contributed to a lot of money saved due to doing my own nails.  The only thing  noticed is it seems to take a lot longer for my nails to dry than expected.  It takes about an hour for base coat 2 nail polish coats and then a top coat.  I would like for the time to be cut in half but overall I have and will continue to recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> Nice but I have had to change the bulbs 4 times already they burn out like after 7 uses. Not sure what the problem is:/</li>
    <li> I recently purchased gel polish to do my own nails and this dryer is great.  The size allows me to dry both hands at the same time.  So glad I purchased this dryer.</li>
    <li> I have salon quality nails every day!!! Love it! Google for directions :) make sure you clean nails with alcohol prior</li>
    <li> Awesome fits both hands wattage dries super fast price can&#x27;t be beat</li>
    <li> I love this light. I&#x27;m not a licensed professional, and find it very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great gel nail dryer. It is much larger than the ones sold in local beauty supply stores. You can do both hands or both feet simultaneously! I would definitely recommend this product and the seller! Blue Novelties had the best price and shipped the light quickly! I am very pleased with this purchase. I stopped wearing nail color a long time ago because I have thin nails and polish has always chipped off within hours of painting them. With the gel polish and this light, the polish lasts for weeks without chipping or showing any signs of wear! I love it!</li>
    <li> Nice to be able to dry both feet or hands at the same time. Dries like it&#x27;s supposed to..would recommend</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when it was on sale for $56.00. That is unheard of for such quality...to have a fan and UV cure light?!? I love it.</li>
    <li> Great price and works great!!!!</li>
    <li> i bought 2 cnd shellac polishes with the base and top coat for myself for christmas.  i also bought the royal nail uv lamp dryer and they all worked well together.  plus, i also bought the royal nail uv protected glove.  so far so good.  there are many tips on the reviews of the royal nail dryer, which is very helpful.  and, this nail polish tended to shrink under the light.  after googling that problem, i found out my mistakes and hopefully, all will be well for my 2nd experiment after i receive my light for myself for christmas!!</li>
    <li> I work a full time job and go to law school at night. When I feel overworked and super stressed, I look for ways to make my day easier, and the first thing to go is often my beauty routine. Wear a cute blouse to work? Nah, I&#x27;d rather throw on an oversized sweater. Pluck my eyebrows before heading out? Nah, I could trade that for vegging out for five minutes. Paint my nails on the weekend? Takes way too long just to get chipped in three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had basically given up on doing my nails at any time during the school year, until I tried gel nail polish. It last longer and can getting it done is a lot simpler. (When using regular nail polish, I always had to do it right before I went to sleep in order for it to dry long enough to not mess up while doing other activities.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine makes it so easy, I love it! I can do my nails while watching a movie, and by the end, they will be completely cured (ie. won&#x27;t smudge the instant my nails brush against something). Everything from the packaging, construction, and function says Quality (yes, with a captial Q!). All of the bulbs come individually packaged and snap easily into place. The machine opens up at the bottom so you can put the bulbs in easily and makes cleaning easier and quicker. When you close it shut, it snaps back into place (I find it reassuring). I love how simple the timer is and that there are many time options. The first option is 90 secs and there are four or five additional options, each increasing in 30 sec increments. The light automatically turns off once the timer is done, signifying that time is up and saving energy. There is also a button to use the internal fan (this stays on until you press the fan button again and does not respond to the timer). The best feature though is that it is large enough for both hands or both feet to fit comfortably, and the opening is large enough where my hands/feet do not bump against the machine while inserting them or pulling them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I use Gellish and Sephora by OPI Gelshine brands of gel polish. My nails are always completely cured after each use. Wonderful product!/&gt;Lastly, I use Gellish and Sephora by OPI Gelshine brands of gel polish. My nails are always completely cured after each use. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This product needs some directions. I don&#x27;t think I should need 15min or longer between each curing of the coats . ( and they still weren &#x27;t dry.  Sticky right now and it has been an hour after I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser gave me some suggestions....BUT still wish it had Directions enclosed.</li>
    <li> I had been looking at this dryer for a while and when I made my decision, Amazon was out of them. I waited and it was back in stock about a week later. It came and it was amazing. It didn&#x27;t really have any directions, so I just followed the directions on the polish. I used cnd base coat and dried for 90 sec. Then applied color and dried  for 2 min. for each coat. Top coat for 2 min as well. I used a paper towel, dabbed in rubbing alcohol, to remove the tackiness. They turned out beautiful! It was great to do both hands then put them in the dryer instead of one hand at a time. Totally recommend this product! By the way, went to Royal&#x27;s website and the dryer was 3 times as much as it was at Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Was a gift. I was told it works well.</li>
    <li> The most amazing purchase I&#x27;ve had in a long time. I cannot say enough nice things about this product. Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it. I only have to get my pink and white powder w/gel filled once a month now. When I redo the gel topcoat myself it looks like I just got them filled. I feel so professional with this product and its quality.</li>
    <li> I have only used this dryer twice since purchasing it but, I can tell you it is well worth the price.  This dryer has cut down my time for gel applications since now I can do both hands at the same time instead of just one.  I love that it has multiple time settings so that I don&#x27;t have to use my phone anymore.  I also tried it with regular nail polish and with the little fan on, this cut out my drying time drastically.  I was able to leave my house immediately after using this.  It also works great for pedicures as well!!  The bulbs were easy to install but you just have to remember pop the bottom latch open to put them in.  There are no instructions for this but I found this out by reading other reviews.  Hands down, this is worth every penny and then some!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the 54 watt royal nails prof. uv light gel and acrylic nail dryer for my daughter for christmas and she loves it! The shipping was incredibly speedy and the nail dryer works like a dream.....a really great value for the money!</li>
    <li> This dryer works really well.  It cures Gelish polish in one minute and a half and it easily fits both hands or feet at the same time.  It&#x27;s really easy to use and I&#x27;m a beginner but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this dryer at all.  It also has a cooling fan as a great bonus.  I love this machine and I love how my nails turn out.</li>
    <li> ITEMS SHIPPED QUICKLY AND WORKS GREAT, I LOVE IT! I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO OTHERS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR A GEL POLISH DRYER</li>
    <li> I like the product. It works fairly well. It&#x27;s fun to do it yourself. Although one of the lights doesnt work.  Overall I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the light worked</li>
    <li> The only thing is that when I received the item I could not tell if it was already used. Their where scratches on the machine and the box was torn. Other then this the item works great.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews- I am so glad I chose this light.&lt;br /&gt;It works just like the nail salons. No gooey nails like some reviews said&lt;br /&gt;I just read the directions and followed gellish nails website for curing times.</li>
    <li> I love my new UV light! I wish it had a 10 sec timer so I didnt overcure the base coat at times but the light came brand new. Looks slick! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a quality product that after 4 uses so far has left me pleased greatly with my purchase. Product arrived exavtly when they said it would. Service &amp; product have surpassed my expectations!</li>
    <li> Great nail dryer! It is quite a bit larger than I expected, so not very convenient to store, but worth it. I bought this to cure Gelish shellac polish. I have found that I need to dry my polish for a minute longer than Gelish suggests for a 36w dryer, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me. I have used this product 4 times already and I am still happy that I made the purchase:)</li>
    <li> Came out great on during first trial.</li>
    <li> This product will save me so much money in the long run by not going to the nail salon anymore.  I bought this to use with gel and it definitely works as advertised.  The seller was very quick with the shipping too!</li>
    <li> Works beautifully to dry my nails - twice as fast as my previous 36 watt UV light dryer! The fan is a great addition, also!</li>
    <li> I actually just used it today and am very happy with the results. I thought I got a decent deal for something that works great!! I love it!</li>
    <li> This was bigger than i expected but works great and you can do both hands and thumbs at the same time.  It is light weight and has easy to use buttons.  It has a small fan that does not turn off when the light timer turns the lights off.  The bulbs are easy to install.</li>
    <li> It works great! It drys your nail within a few minutes. It&#x27;s a great purchase. Now I don&#x27;t need to worry about ruining my nails long after I applied the polish! :)</li>
    <li> This Royal Nail UV light nail dryer is truly a professional model.  It was a gift to my daughter. My daughter gave her mother a basic gel nail system with a nail dryer from a cosmetic store. The difference was unbelievable.  The Royal Nail dryer has a fan and was comfortable to use.  The drying time is faster.  The basic gel kit my wife got was an unknown brand.  The unknown brand was cheap and burned her hands.  My advise is to not consider a UV light nail dryer with out a fan, although they may cost less, they do not cure the nail well and they are uncomfortable to use.  My daughter is very happy with the Royal Nail UV light Dryer and has done her nails and a couple friends nails.  All are quite impressed!  This deserves a 5 star rating for quality, ease of use, and superb function.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the results.  We can use gel polish with great success (after watching a few youtube videos) and regular polish works amazing.  It usually last 7-10 days without chipping.  I would definitely recommend this product....it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This light is great! I purchased it to replace the light that they recommended when I bought the gel nail kit at Sally&#x27;s. This light is everything plus. It is one of the only ones that I found that is great with reg. nail polish also, because it has a fan along with the  timer. I do fill with reg. polish to make my gel nails last longer. The dark gel polish and the magneto polish is all that I wear and this dried my nails hard. When I use magneto it looks like the picture they post. With the other light, the dark gels only smeared until I got on the top coat. It easily fits both hands with no problems. It shipped quickly and was a snap to install the light bulbs and start using. To me this was a great buy.</li>
    <li> Only used it twice but I love it</li>
    <li> Love this product. Am so glad I bought it. Item is exactly as stated, and shipping was very quick. I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this lamp!  Its the second lamp we have bought and it has beed awesome!  I would recommend this product for sure!  I love that you can fit both Hand or feet at the same time!</li>
    <li> I love this Uv lamp, I have used it about 6 times and have had great results!! It&#x27;s well worth the money and works great with CND, Jellish and today I tried the Opi.  I just clean my nails with alcohol really good and my polish stays on 10- 14 days!!!</li>
    <li> finally I can do my own nails! honestly I will save so much money going to the shop and pay them 30 bucks every two weeks and I can do it myself!</li>
    <li> I was considering buying the OPI gel light after getting my nails done at a salon and loving the result.  I was skeptical about this&lt;br /&gt;light because of the great value I thought it was too good to be true.  When it arrived I was amazed at the size.  You can fit both of&lt;br /&gt;your hands in it at the same time and it works great.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy.  It was a great value considering OPI is 200+.  I haven&#x27;t tried OPI nail polish with this yet only the Gellish so far but it works great.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I love that you can put both feet or both hands in comfortably!  Makes for quicker work!!</li>
    <li> I liked the price and the unit works very well. I didn&#x27;t have time to go out and get my nails done. This light makes it easy for me to take careof my own nails.</li>
    <li> This is the best UV light I have ever gotten. I do recommend this for anyone who does their own nails. It has multiple setting for light and fan.</li>
    <li> Overall, it did the job I needed it to. I used an all-in-one acrylic type of gel and it cured it perfectly and professionally!</li>
    <li> The lower bulb is too low and the it&#x27;s not deep enough.  I wind up running my nails into the bulb which messes up my polish.</li>
    <li> I agree with Kim........I too looked at this item when it was for sale with a price of under $50.00.  I put it in my wish list because I had some other items I wanted to order at the same time, and when I came back they were now asking $199.  What&#x27;s up with that?  I am going to try to wait it out and see what happens, but I did go to the Royal Nails website and they are selling it for $54.00 but you have to pay for the shipping too.  If the price doesn&#x27;t come down on Amazon I guess I will buy it from them.  Even with the cost of shipping if it comes out to cost around $70.00 that a lot better than almost $200.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is large enough to use on your toes, as advertised. However, it took several times of resetting the timer to dry. I expected a more rapid dry time,I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product Nov 2013, and absolutely love it. I have saved so much money doing my own nails, and the convenience of being able to do them as soon as one chips is great. What a great light!  Works wonderful!!! and was in my budget. I also had two of the bulbs go out May 2014, I was lost without my light and could not locate any replacements online, so I emailed the seller they were so courteous and sent me two new bulbs, which arrived quickly, would buy from this vendor again in a blink of the eye.</li>
    <li> Works great! Make sure you know what you&#x27;re doing- gel polish comes out sticky and doesn&#x27;t feel dry. After you put on the top coat, lightly clean with acetone, then it comes out clear, shiny and not sticky! I&#x27;m saving SOOO much money not going to the manicure shop!</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for my gf and she likes that she can put the entire hand at once.  I had done some research on it and it works perfect with Shellac polish.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It is exactly as specified.  It was easy to install the lights.  The fan is nice and I like the timer feature.  I love the size - you can get both hands in at once.  It&#x27;s so much nicer than the one my salon uses.  I&#x27;ve used it with different UV gel polishes and it works with them all.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It is slightly pricey but worth the money when you consider the cost of the salon.  I can change my nail color as frequently as I want.  I do not have to go to the Salon to get my nails done anymore.  Also when they chip I can fix them very easily without having to pay for a full nail set.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as advertised. Took excessive amount of time to cure one hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, who is just starting to use the gel products and polishes.  She likes it because the larger size will handle 2 hands or feet at once, and the six bulbs make it a powerful unit.  When mama&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy...and I am happy.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product.I find the built in timer to be extremely convenient. So far the product has worked great.  The size of the dryer is rather big; however, I don&#x27;t really consider this to be a problem . I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I recently opened my own nail salon and was looking for a good, economical UV lamp for gel manicures. I received the item within 4 days of ordering and I love it. The design is sleek and I like that the bottom opens up for easy cleaning. It has a small fan and 2 settings for the UV light - timed or continuous. Plus it&#x27;s big! Easily fits both hands, probably both feet (haven&#x27;t done any gel pedi&#x27;s yet). It&#x27;s very easy to use and I plan on ordering another one!</li>
    <li> LOVE my UV light!! I used to go to the salon every 4 weeks for gel polish (at 32$ a visit) and now I have bought my own polish and do my manicures at home for pennies each time!! A huge cost savings! I highly recommend this 54 watt unit. It drys and cures the gel perfectly. My friends and sister are envious and are always asking me to do their nails. Make sure you buy polish for UV, not the new LED polishes. Those don&#x27;t work on this unit.</li>
    <li> I like the nail dryer but for some reason my gel polish lifts within just a couple of days. Not sure why. I&#x27;m using the correct product.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this, but it definitely takes practice. If the foundation polish is too thick or gets on your skin, it will peel immediately or leave a bulge. I cannot get a gel manicure (using this light) to last more than a week before it starts chipping on the ends or peeling. However, I can&#x27;t get regular nail polish (&amp; no light) to last even 24 hours, so I am content with a 1 week manicure.  This product works well, is easy to use, and meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> The nail dryer&#x27;s work very well.</li>
    <li> This machine definitely gets the job done. I have used this on myself as well as my friends and family. I do gel artificial nails on myself after spending loads of money getting it done at the salon. I can now do those for myself and acrylic for my sister and gel polish for my friends. This thing is a no brainer. It has multiple time setting which is super convenient. You don&#x27;t need instructions to assemble simply insert bulbs and turn it on. I really like the fan as well. It does both feet and hands at the same time which save a bunch of time. The price is outstanding for what you get. Sally sells a lesser 36 watt dryer for $60. This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made!! What are you waiting for...Just buy this thing. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this light! Before this light I had the Thermal Spa and it was okay but then I started not getting a full 2 weeks out of my shellac manicures. Instead of replacing the bulbs I decided to get this light and I&#x27;m SO glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;Love the fan feature for regular polish and the UV lights are very strong. Going on day 13 of my shellac manicure and no issues.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try doing gel polish myself, however the first attempt was successful! The OPI base, color and top coat were easy to apply and the Royal Nail lamp to cure the polish worked perfectly. I would definetly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> doesnt not work, bulbs went out within first use</li>
    <li> Good for any type of manicure.</li>
    <li> Did not realize how large it was.  Very nice!</li>
    <li> I love this product and am so happy with my purchase. I never painted my fingernails before because the polish would always chip and it would look so unprofessional so quickly, with this machine I feel like I had them done at a salon and have had no chips in my polish.  There are no instructions on how to use it so luckily other reviewers have left some and they worked wonderfully!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who likes their nails done but doesn&#x27;t have the time to go to the salon.</li>
    <li> Delighted!  Easy to assemble and actually a far better unit than at my salon.  I am very happy to be able to do my shellac nails at home.  Since I always use a lightly pink clear color it is a piece of cake.  So nice to be able to do it at home...and so very easy!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice since I purchased it and I am extremely pleased. This is the exact same UV light that the local salons use and at $25 a visit, it has proved to be a good investment! I am very picky about how my manicure is done. Too many times I have come home from a salon and had to redo my nails and then wonder why I paid for such a crappy job. Things like bubbles or bumps and &amp;#34;globs&amp;#34; of shellack buildup at the tips of my nails because of their &amp;#34;rush job&amp;#34; is now a thing of the past! I can take my time, do one hand at a time (although this is certainly large enough to do both hands at the same time) and in less time than what I would spend at a salon, my nails are done to my liking!  The light was shipped super fast. The lights were easy to install. (If you can buckle a seatbelt you can install the lights.) It is super easy to use, just plug in, paint your nails, push the buttons, insert your hands and that&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I was a little concerned about ordering this UV light because of the low price, but once I opened the box and saw that it is the same professional model used in my local salon, is was very pleased. If you are looking for a UV light to do your own manicures, I would highly recommend this model and also this seller.</li>
    <li> Product works great.. I just wouldn&#x27;t suggest people buying their own Shellac system. Nail polish peels off like stickers after about 3 days</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife and she loves it. Price point was good and did a amazing job on her nails. She was blown away. She says Acrylic is the way to go for the salon finish.</li>
    <li> I love this light. It came in great condition and is so easy to use. The opening size is large enough for two hands or feet although I normally do one at a time.  This light was recommended to me from a friend an I also recommend it to others as well.</li>
    <li> A little bigger than I expected but it worked well with the CND shellac using my own OPI laquer.  It will take a little practice but after one use I believe I will like it more each time I use it.  I wish the timer had some shorter time settings but that isn&#x27;t a big deal as a few more seconds makes me feel more sure that it is curing.</li>
    <li> This works great but if no one tells you after you do you nails it will feel wet until you take a cotton ball with alcohol on it and wipe off residue. I spent so much extra time thinking my nails did not dry. You will never go to a salon again</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  It&#x27;s a way better product than the one at my salon!</li>
    <li> This item is great. it is huge! I can fit both hands in it and move them around without touching the sides. The fan makes it so your hands dont get too hot. The different timing options are also wonderful so you dont have to keep pushing a button every 60 sec. Only down side is its little awkward to move around. Example I dont have a set space i do my nails, i sit on the couch so I have to bring the thing onto my lap to use it and they put it back onto my side table. Not that big of a deal though. All in all I love this!</li>
    <li> This equipment does exactly what I expected it to do. It works well. I am a novice but I like gel/shellac nail polish. I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time in salons.I was able to get an &amp;#34;almost &amp;#34;perfect job the first use. That was three days ago. I am waiting to see if it will stay on as long as the salon applications.&lt;br /&gt;What I did not notice in the pre-purchase info was that it is intended only for professional use. In addition, it is somewhat bigger than I expected. I knew however that it would accomodate both hands. But this is a bit bigger than a toaster.</li>
    <li> As expected, salon like results. Strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Use for hard gel on my daughter worked great. I am in nail tec shook currently so I hope it&#x27;s long lasting. Will do an update in the beginning of the yr.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife.  She likes to do her own &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; manicures.  The product does a great job when it is working.  Unfortunately after the second use, the fan burnt out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, of course, made the return/exchange process easy.  The second has lasted through at least three uses.  Hopefully the first one was just an abnormality.</li>
    <li> No review to leave...</li>
    <li> SO excited with this dryer. Works as expected, service and delivery were handled quickly.</li>
    <li> In order to prevent myself and my daughters from enduring $35 gel manicures this item will be paid for in two visits.  So far the UV light Gel and Acrylic Nail Dryer has worked great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!  So glad I made this purchase!!</li>
    <li> My woman was very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My UV light came very quickly which was awesome since I was in a time crunch for a wedding. Very easy to set up, straightforward instructions included in the box, and I am very pleased with the results after use. Large enough for both of my hands or feet to be in it at the same time. Can&#x27;t beat the price! I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Received the product and it was better quality then what I was expecting. I&#x27;ve used it twice and the timer works beautifully. My nails have never looked better. The product was shipped fast and arrived ahead of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> This light worked Just as well as CND light,and much cheaper.I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Works well if you follow product directions. My nails are happy.</li>
    <li> I use this light to cure gel nails and it works better and faster than any other light I have ever tried. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This thing is huge!  Probably could have a whole group of nail dryers at the house.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews which was very helpful in using this product. I absolutely love it. And it works if done right. I just need to get better at painting my nails.</li>
    <li> luv it!!! so nice to be able to get salon perfect nails at home on my own schedule!!</li>
    <li> Where do I get new bulbs for this? Bought it a year ago and a few bulbs have died.&lt;br /&gt;Works well though.</li>
    <li> Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do. Lots of reviews said it wasn&#x27;t working to dry their nails but I had no problem. My guess is maybe they didn&#x27;t wipe the nail off with rubbing alcohol after the final top coat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now and I LOVE it! I used to spend at least $100.00 a month on my nails and now I do it all from my home. I even do my family and girl friends nails too. We just sit down and take our time talking about whatever. The unit is pretty spacious. I can fit both of my hands in there and spread my fingers out and be ok. The set up was easy (came with bulbs and instructions) A lot of complaints about the unit not curing the nails. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with that. I use Gelish, OPI and brands that you can find at Sally&#x27;s. Just make sure you get the right polish. UV Light and LED light are cured differently.</li>
    <li> I need more UV power to reduce drying time</li>
    <li> Works great! Was everything I expected and more!</li>
    <li> Too expensive for what it does</li>
    <li> Bulky product but does the job</li>
    <li> Awesome product. My daughter and I both use and we love it. Nails dry fast and look great.</li>
    <li> I love using my nail dryer.  Works great like the professionals.. Now I don&#x27;t have to go for a mani or pedi, saving alot.</li>
    <li> this light is amazing!!! it&#x27;s huge and super efficient. This light has a fan option which is really great. there are also different time settings which are really useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would definitely recommend!! must buy for shellac users</li>
    <li> This is by far the best thing I&#x27;ve purchased this year so far! I love this machine. It cures perfectly &amp; quickly! I love that it&#x27;s set on a timer so I don&#x27;t have to guess how long it takes. I&#x27;ve done my nails &amp; family members also &amp; they also love the machine &amp; their nails. I&#x27;ve also been able to do coworkers &amp; friends nails &amp; they like that both hands can easily fit into the machine. I would highly recommend this product. I may even purchase another :*)</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. Paid for itself with a couple manicures done at home instead of the salon. I prefer regular polish with a UV top coat so I appreciate the fan.</li>
    <li> Works great! Received it quick!</li>
    <li> this is a great UV lamp I would recommend it  LED is better butbthis works great sturdy well built product</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic invention. I&#x27;ve been getting gel manicures for about 9 months and really love them. But $25 a pop every 2-3 weeks really adds up. After buying this light and some basic colors in gel polishes, I&#x27;m saving tons of money. Plus, I get to do them at home whenever it&#x27;s convenient while watching TV, and do them for my friends. I&#x27;ve used another lamp in the past, but this one is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only slight negative opinion about it is that I wish the timer had a numerical display. Would be nice to see where I am in the countdown.  But it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice and so far it seems to be doing the job. Having my own will definitely save me money.</li>
    <li> Dryer came in time and was larger than I expected (like a regular salon size).  Love the features of varied times for drying and the fan. I am able to put both hands or feet in at the same time.  Works great with my CND products at home, and saves me a ton of money.</li>
    <li> We gave these to our daughters for Christmas. They love them! The result is salon quality without wasting money at the salon!</li>
    <li> This iRoyal Nail professional un light gel and dryer work well.and you can&#x27;t bet the price.I recommend it very handy</li>
    <li> LOVE this lamp! It&#x27;s unnecessarily huge, particularly considering I do my own nails, and can only do one hand at a time, but it&#x27;s great and so far it&#x27;s lasted over a year and a half, with weekly to fortnightly use.</li>
    <li> I love the UV lamp. I have used the OPI uv lamp that is $200 more than this lamp and this one works better. I am incredibly impressed! Definitely worth the buy!!!!</li>
    <li> Although the lamp is much larger than I expected, I have no complaints.  It is lightweight, the bulbs were easy to insert, the timer is wonderful for different hardening times , I can fit my whole hand in, so I do not have to do my thumbs separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have &#x27;gelled&#x27; my nails for the first time (never had it done professionally but my friends have) and I did a really good job.  I will save a lot of money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived in great  condition and on the day promised.&lt;br /&gt;I would not hestitate to do business again with this vendor.</li>
    <li> Update 5/9/13 This company is GREAT after the company read my review, they reached out to me personally to make the problem right and I must say I was very impressed because you don&#x27;t find that everyday where a company or someone really care about their customers and this is the type of company that you want to do business with. So if you have an issue with your product, contact the this company first before writing your review in order to give them a chance to fix what ever the problem is and make it right. I would do business with this company again!! As you read this was my first review..... 1st review After reading some of the reviews I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it so I ordered it. Frist of all after receiving it I notice that it seem to be used because there were a lot of scratches where you place your hands at when drying them, that was the first red flag, but just like the other one that I tried it didn&#x27;t dry my nails and after sitting there repeating the process for over an hour, I just gave up and went to bed with my nails undry, and that was the second red flag, so I&#x27;m returning it today, and will just continue to go to the nail solon. So so disappointed!! :(</li>
    <li> This a great product. I love it because you can use it for everything from regular polish to gels. Very versatile. Also wonderful that you can do both hands or both feet at the same time. For the few dollars extra it&#x27;s worth it. I highly recommend this product over any others I&#x27;ve used. Absolutely a 5 star item!</li>
    <li> I guess it didn&#x27;t register, when I bought this, how big it would be. It&#x27;s huge--big enough to put two giant hands in at once. But it works extremely well and I can do both hands at once. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it were a bit smaller, but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I love this nail dryer. It works so well and I love the features of being able to have different timers and the fan feature is an added bonus. I enjoy how wide the opening is so I can put both hands in at once and also my feet. I would recommened this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used my uv lamp and i feel pleased with my purchased as i do my own nails. Im saving 30 bucks every other week. Lamp was easy to put up, looks fancy!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great!! I love that it has self timer and can fit both hands in at a time</li>
    <li> This lamp was actually better than the one that was used at the salon.  What I like about it is that I can do both hands and then put them both under the lamp, saving me twice as much time.  It was much bigger than I expected.  I only use the 90 sec and 120 sec, but they also have 3 min, 4min, 5 min and a fan.  My nails are better than when I got them done at the salon.  Saves time and money.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before buying this product and I was still a little skeptical when I got it but I used it for the first time last night and it worked perfectly with my Gelish gel polish.  I love that it is large enough for both hands so I could do them at the same time.  I was a little confused at first about how long to put the different layers of polish under the light especially since I read a few reviews saying that it didn&#x27;t set.  I&#x27;m not sure what those people are talking about...maybe they have never gotten gel before at the salon but you&#x27;re nails will not be completely set until the top coat so don&#x27;t try to touch them in between each layer of polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a french manicure and I did the base coat for 120 seconds then each of the polish layers for 90 seconds and then the top coat for 120 seconds.  Then at the end you have to use the acetone to wipe your nails of the sticky stuff.  It worked PERFECTLY!!!  My nails look amazing and they are set.  This was my first time doing gel nails at home and I&#x27;m soo happy I got this light.  It will pay for itself after 3 or 4 times of use.  Oh and makes sure you turn the fan on too while you&#x27;ve got your hands in there otherwise it does get a little warm in there.  I don&#x27;t know about the gloves that people are buying but if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money I just use sunscreen before I start.</li>
    <li> I have never had a manicure before so as a gift my husband bought me a session. Learning about gel polish was a first for me.  Once I had it done I was hooked.  I decided to buy the gel polish and do it at home to save money.  I quickly found out that I needed a UV light. I looked on Amazon and found the one with the most reviews and highest rating and decided to go with that.  I think I received my order within two days and I tried it the night I got it.  I love it.  It works very well right out of the box.  The only thing I had noticed is that the instructions never mentioned removing the blue hue film covering the mirrors.  (I had read in a review to do this so I was prepared).  Plugging in the bulbs was very easy and I was able to use it in seconds.  Very user friendly.  My only comment is that the minimum time setting is 90 seconds and my gel nail polish says to turn on timer for 60 seconds.  I&#x27;m still learning about it (figuring out if using for the 90 seconds is harmful or just taking hands out early and if it matters that it is a 54 watt bulb vs. 36 watt).  I like that both of my hands fit with ease and I don&#x27;t bump them into each other.  I would recommend this to others because I now am able to achieve the same results at home as I did in the nail salon and that makes me very happy because I&#x27;m saving a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Just got this product.  It is surprisingly big, almost as big as a small printer.  Definitely enough room to put both hands in.  The UV bulbs come unassembled. However, there is no instruction whatsoever.  So you just have to figure out how to put the UV bulbs in and how to use the equipment.  That&#x27;s a little frustrating.  FYI: to put the bulbs in, open the top lid from the bottom!  Mine came with a tiny damage on the bottom (manufacturer&#x27;s damage, I think, not a shipping damage) but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get it exchanged as it&#x27;s not worth the shipping cost.  This thing is huge. I used Sally Hanson Gel polishes (base, colour and top coat). I had to keep my hands in much longer than I anticipated.  300 sec setting finally got it cured and dried. Not sure if it&#x27;s the gel polish or the equipment.</li>
    <li> The product is great, my sister is very happy. Bought another one for my cousin, and girlfriend. Good price, and they are happy.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this product after reading many great reviews. However when I got it first I was very disappointed that what they considered instructions was rediculous. They were safety instructions, no instructions on how to put the lights in or how to use it. When I finally figured it out the thing would not turn on. I contacted the manufacturer and the only question they asked is did I have the button turned on. I&#x27;m not stupid, it did not work. I wanted to return it for another but Amazon would not replace it, they gave me a refund. Now I have to order all over again. Not sure if I will get the same one.</li>
    <li> First of all, the product arrived much sooner than I expected. When I used it, it was better than what I thought it would be. I can dry both hands at the same time.(both feet as well). Now I do my own gel nails at home. This product does exactly what it says, I feel like it&#x27;s a great investment. Luv it!</li>
    <li> I received my Royal Nails Professional UV Light four days ago, and I absolutely LOVE it!!  It is extremely easy to use and the multiple timesetting options are great.  The light is large enough to put either both hands or both feet under it.  There is a fan setting so you can dry your toenails if you don&#x27;t want to use the light.  I am amazed that I can sit at home and have beautiful nails in less than 10 minutes.  No more smelling acrylic and paying ridiculous prices!  Believe the reviews from other buyers; I did, and that is why I purchased this light.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
    <li> This UV dryer is solid.  Has a timer from 1 minute to 5 minutes. I used 2 minutes for each curing time. Turned out perfect!  Good fan to help in the process.  No appointments to make and saves you a bundle.  Just remember to peel off the blue plastic(like on appliances)before you use it. I only had my nails done twice at a salon but this gives great results. If people only knew how easy it is to do at home, they&#x27;d buy one right now.  It pays for itself after 3 uses.  Your nails stay strong and grow fast.</li>
    <li> Seems to have a problem curing gel nail polish...takes a very long time...10 minutes per coat...I&#x27;ll get hand cancer before my nails look good.</li>
    <li> I loved getting gel manicures but it became too expensive so I was looking for a product that would do the job at home. I found this salon style dryer and love it! Dries my nails in super quick time and it lasts for at least 16+ days. I also love that it can be for your hands or your feet and that your not limited! The seller shipped it super fast as well! Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> I am extremely glad I bought this curing lamp after doing a lot of research on various ones online. It in extremely well made, and has a timing feature (which most at home gel lamps do not) and is big enough for both hands or feet to cure at once! I was pleasantly surprised by this! I use this with Gelish brand professional polishes, and genuinely couldn&#x27;t be happier, and would buy this again in a heart beat :)</li>
    <li> This is a lovely LARGE UV nail light - lots of room to accommodate both hands, with a fan and several timing options.  Nicer than any I have used in salons!  Well packaged and comes with 6 snap-in bulbs (separately packaged for shipping) Wow!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to upgrade to this machine, not knowing if spending the money would be a good investment. Wow, was it ever! This dries the gels so quickly, I may never pay for a salon painting again! I usually have it set on the 90 sec time, but I don&#x27;t use all of it between coats. I usually try to dry them for about 30 seconds between, then for about 240 seconds after. They are perfectly fine to do whatever I want - no smudges, no imprints. I was having a problem with &amp;#34;tackiness&amp;#34;, but my friend who is an aesthetician to me to take a cotton ball with alcohol on it and wipe them off really well after drying. Then wash your hands. That worked PERFECTLY! And she said it wasn&#x27;t the dryer, but the type of gel polish I bought... that some of them will leave this residue that needs to be wiped off.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to touch up my manicures from the salon. It&#x27;s easy to use and works great on gel polish and acrylic polish as well. Dries both fast. The only things I would change would be where the on/off switch is located and the way the back opens. The switch is on the back, so you either have to remove one hand to turn it on or have someone else do it for you. The &#x27;clips&#x27; on the bottom are plastic and are hard to use (it could wreck your nails). Metal clips would work better and last longer. I read the reviews before I purchased and agree there could be better instructions. For the price it&#x27;s a great buy and I love that you can put both hands or feet in together - a great time-saver. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some people are having issues with their nails not drying- your nails will remain tacky and sticky until you do the last step of wipe each nail with 99 percent rubbing alcohol, I could not find 99 so I used 91 that I purchased at walmart and it worked great. I followed the cnd website tutorial for how long to let each step dry and my nails came out perfect. I&#x27;m very happy with the lamp!</li>
    <li> Brought this for my girl friend and she loves it. There was absolutely no problems to use it, easy to setup.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll advise anyone interested to purchase this without a worry.</li>
    <li> this is very easy to you, i spent at least $30-35 every week to get my nails done.  i am able to do them myself now.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  My daughter uses it weekly for manis and pedis.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very quick drying... great</li>
    <li> Works great...dries quickly</li>
    <li> I really really LOVE THIS UV LIGHT....&lt;br /&gt;I had a different uv light in the past that was expensive and it didn&#x27;t at ALL work as good as this one .&lt;br /&gt;It definitely cuts the time in half and its big so its twice as fast :) if anyone is just now starting this is the light for you makes it that much easier for you.</li>
    <li> Even though this is a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; product I don&#x27;t think the price is necessarily worth it. However, I am satisfied. It works great but the only two down sides would be the size which is a little bit too heavy and big if you&#x27;re not a professional user, and the times to dry your nails take longer.</li>
    <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made for my nails....have saved tons of money doing my own nails..&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny hands down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5 months later... still love it, use it frequently and have had  zero issues.  Love doing my nails and having them look fabulous for days... i have found different brands act differently and perform differently but the light is not picky!</li>
    <li> My wife bought this to use at her salon. It was delivered on time and as described. After trying it for three weeks and she was so pleased with it she bought a second one and would surely recommend this .</li>
    <li> Been getting Gel Manicures from the beauty shop for the last 6 mos.  Gel really works for me.  Finally found a manicure treatment that lasts.  My Gel manicure holds up for over a week at a time. Since I only get a professional manicure once a month, the Royal Nails machine allows me to freshen or completely re-do my nails between my salon manicures.  My gel manicures really hold up to the abuse I put my hands through.  The Royal Nails machine is just about perfect since I can dry the nails on both hands at the same time.  It really cuts down on process time.  Before getting Gel manicures, it would take hours to polish my nails at home.  Now, I can polish my bare nails in less than 30 minutes.  Yes, drying my gel polish does take about 3 times longer than advertised, but no big deal.  What used to take two - three hours elapsed time, is now doable in less than an hour.  The weak link in the process is getting the old gel off my fingers.  It actually takes longer to get the old polish off than it does to apply new gel polish.  The Royal Nails is a quality machine and who can dicker about paying $65.00 for one when a professional gel manicure cost me $40.00 per visit.</li>
    <li> This is a nice uv light.Much nicer than the first one I bought for my daughter and for the price difference you cant go wrong with it.The item was shipped in record time and arrived in new condition as stated by amazon.Very professional looking product.</li>
    <li> This unit is much more than I expected it to be!  First of all, I was surprised at the size.  You can actually put both hands in at the same time, unlike the \\&quot;rinky-dink\\&quot;, over-priced units you get at the drug store.  I love the fan- indicator feature, as it not only serves as a timer, but it gives a delicate cooling sensation while your nails are drying.  I&#x27;m fairly new at the gel manicure process, but it is so quick and easy... For the price of a professional manicure (or less), I have my own light!  So awesome!</li>
    <li> it is wonderful. it is also big, both hands fit in the lamp comfortably. was easy to put together, easy to use, light weight, I am happy with it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t add much to what has already been said in the reviews about this light. It is much better than any UV light I have ever seen in any nail salons. It is simple to use and saves so much time because how large it is. The price is too good to be true for a light this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I can fit both hands or both feet under this light at the same time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The hinged top makes it a breeze for cleaning the inside of the light area or for changing bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The interior is reflective 360 degrees, your free edges and area under the nail is exposed to the UV light saving you time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There is a fan keeping your hands cool while curing. The fan isn&#x27;t strong enough to use as a separate nail dryer although the controls allow you to turn the fan on without the lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The control panel is located on top of the light toward the back. There is an automatic timer with choices of 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fan, light and timer buttons are lit and all located on the control panel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not surprised that this fan has sold out because of the price. It retails on line for over $200.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time and loved the outcome. I really liked being able to put both hands under the light at the same time. It didn&#x27;t take long at all. Definitely worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is great.  You can do both hands or feet at the same time.  Makes doing your nails quick and easy.</li>
    <li> I really like it, it is big enough so both hands fit at once, looks like the ones that are used in the nail salons.  It has worked just fine.  I am glad I read the reviews too as otherwise I would have gotten a wimpy 9V.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I even had trouble at first using it wrong and the seller helped me in the right direction, great customer service! Love it and use it all the time :)</li>
    <li> I shopped around for a while and finally decided to go with this one. Each Time I use it I fall in LOVE all over again. I like to place my client hands on top and take photos. The product in itself is so elegant with a fresh set if freshly done nails both look beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the Deciding Factors are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-The reviews were wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;2-The price for a Two Hand Dryer&lt;br /&gt;3-The brand has a good track record&lt;br /&gt;4-The PRICE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT and my Clients Love it too</li>
    <li> Was really looking forward to getting this product and trying it out! I opened the box yesterday and got to test this bad boy out. What I like about it is that there is nothing to assemble besides attaching the light bulbs which is quite simple. Then you just plug it in and use! I used regular base coat and nail polish and then a gel top coat. I allowed the regular nail polish to dry completely before appying the gel top coat. I then applied the gel coat and put it under the lamp and voila in 2 minutes my nails were beautiful and dry. I especially like how you can put BOTH hands in at once. The fan is a nice touch. Over all very satisfied with this product and unless it breaksdown soon I will give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I love that I can do both my feet and hands at the same time. It was easy to use and has saved me lots of time and money not having to go to the salon every two weeks. totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> This light is wonderful.  It has multiple time buttons for all the different lengths you would use when drying.  It has a fan that also has a button, so it&#x27;s not automatic and won&#x27;t burn out as quickly.  The bulbs are removable as well as access to the fuse, that way all those items could be replaced with ease.  This is important since these are the simple reasons that you would generally replace one of these.  I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Looks like a salon professional curing light and quite satisfied so far. Might take a little longer than 2 minutes to get one layer cured and overall it will take at least 15-20 minutes to get all of your nails done. However, considering i&#x27;ve never done my nails myself before. It is very easy to use. Definitely worth it considering it&#x27;s price and the price it costs to get it professionally done!</li>
    <li> Arrived quick and I&#x27;m pleased with the order.</li>
    <li> Shipping was an issue but once I got this product I loved it!  I like the various timer options and can use fan or no fan.  I would definitely recommend this to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> nice to dry faster than air drying</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the purchase of this item. I ended up buying another one after a family member decided to get it after seeing how easy and fast it was to set up and the price is right. I only tried it once so far but it dried my nails in less than 300 seconds.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife after researching what was available in stores and on line. Quality product.  Large enough to put both hands or both feet in at once.  Light timer works great.  I would recommend this to a friend.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The first day it arrive I did my first gel nail and the uv light was great I did both hands and feet and is really big and I love the fan just to dry regular polish</li>
    <li> I wanted to do Gelish at home but the actual Gelish light is about $300 and I just couldn&#x27;t afford that and honestly didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on it. Then I came across this light for only $51 but I didn&#x27;t know if it would be good or if it would work with the Gelish polishes. After looking at the rating, which was about a 4.9, and reading all the reviews, I figured I would give it a try. Out of 200 total reviews, it had only gotten about 4 that were below a 4. So it was safe to assume that it had to be good. And it is! The lamp works great and works with all different kinds of gel polishes. It&#x27;s pretty big but that&#x27;s a good thing since you can fit both hands and both feet together. No complaints!</li>
    <li> After removing the product from the box it was super simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;Removed the blue cover off mirror, plugged in and turned it on.&lt;br /&gt;It can not be any easier then that!&lt;br /&gt;Love the product and not only do I use it for my nails but my family uses it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down no complaints, love the product no regrets!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more products from this company in the future</li>
    <li> Good gel machine and had this for a year now AND still going!</li>
    <li> decided to invest in this rather than getting manicures. After 3 uses you have paid for this product with the money you save from not getting manicures. I love that it is so big that you can do your entire hand at one time, including thumb.</li>
    <li> I found this uv light on amazon and chose this one because it had the best reviews. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this one because its amazing! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST UV nail dryer for shellac nails,in my opinion.  It is a double wide unit so you can save time and dry 2 hands or feet at a time; it is 54 Watts,  which is the highest power available currently,to dry faster.  It has a fan to keep the unit cool, several timing options, and is very user friendly, especially when changing the UV bulbs.  This unit&#x27;s price lists for $229.00 and can be offered, at times,  for $54.99, which is what I paid for mine.  It is popular, so I had to wait several months for it to come back in stock AT THE REDUCED price of $54.99. BUT It WAS WORTH THE WAIT!  I am so pleased with this unit which is why I am writing this product review.  I am a consumer doing my shellac nails at home to save money and time.  You will not be disapponted with this dryer!  I did a lot of research  and comparisons BEFORE I decided what I wanted and this product from ROYAL NAILS was it!  Professionals will love this unit,too, as they can get their clients in and out of the salon faster with the 54 Watts AND the double wide unit for  quicker drying.  For a first-time, do-it-yourselfer OR a professional in a nail salon, THIS IS THE MACHINE for YOU - - when you see it offered at the incredible price of $54.99, don&#x27;t delay and just snap it up - - you will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying I read a lot of reviews looking to find a UV light to do gel nails at home to save some money.  I bought this one b/c all of the reviews were great and I have not been disappointed at all!  It came within three days of me ordering the item and looks exactly like the picture.  I really like that when I am doing my nails that I can fit both hands in at the same time!  My nails turned out amazing!  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to do their gel nails at home!</li>
    <li> This is worth the buy!  The qulity of this gel achine light is awesome!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was doing research for a professional nail dryer and came across this one with a 5 star rating. I read other peoples reviews and decided this is what I was going to order. What a great price for the size, it is a lot larger than I expected. And it was cheaper than the dryers at the beauty supply store in my area. You can fit both hands and both feet in it at the same time...who has time to dry one foot or hand at a time!?!?!? I know I don&#x27;t! I like that you can run it with just the fan for regular polish and with the UV for Gels &amp; Shellac. I also love that it has different timer settings built right in. Definitely an awesome product for the price. I totally recommend this for anyone that does their own nails! :)</li>
    <li> Wow.  I got this for my wife and (let me just say) it was worth every penny and more.  Her nails are stronger and more beautiful than ever and we no longer have to spend money at the salon.  It takes approximately thirty minutes to do her fingers and toes, and the results are spectacular.  Take note, however, that the polish and the hardener are expensive up front - but they more than pay for themselves within just a few weeks.  Though I got this as a gift for my wife, it ended up being a gift for me, as well.  :)</li>
    <li> I have already used my new professional UV light from Royal.  It works great for gel/shellac nail polish.  It takes about 10 minutes to have your gel polish dried if you follow instructions correctly.  It is as if you went to the nail salon.  I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just got the polish to use with this product. So far so good. After enough research I knew that I would have to find the instructions to elsewhere (which I did in the review section). I have only used the product once and I love it.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Great value too!</li>
    <li> Works just like advertised.  Good heat.  Seems reliable.</li>
    <li> It is great!  Works just like we wanted it to.  Of course, my daughter already knew how to use it correctly.</li>
    <li> This is a great product - it was very easy to set up initially and use. It is so convenient to be able to do both hands at the same time. The price of the machine is about the cost of one manicure so I have already saved so much money despite only owning it for a few months. I highly recommend this product. Great service from the seller too!</li>
    <li> I have been recommending this product to all of my friends! It works so good!</li>
    <li> loved that you can cure both hands at one time.  Saves lots of time</li>
    <li> Awesome nail dryer. And great seller</li>
    <li> Just received this unit and it&#x27;s lights do not turn on.  Looked through the reviews and it seems to be a problem others have had as well.  Sending the unit back.</li>
    <li> If you do your own nails as I do this is a must.  I use to go get my nails done and the driving time alone was 1hr there and back then I would have to wait.  I usually took several hours until I ordered this. Now I do my own nails. I do the gel nail and I love this light. I put the bulbs in myself and afer each use I put it up so it is not out and the bubls get broken. It does everything this it suppose to do.No regrets here.</li>
    <li> Yup, this is great! It is huge.</li>
    <li> I love this uv nail light! I use it for my chellac and it works great! I love that I can put both my hands in at the same time so it cuts down on my drying time. Great product and would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome! Sets your nails well. You can fit both hands at the same time. You can dry your feet as well. There&#x27;s a fan too, so if you are appyling regular nail polish you are able to dry them using the fan.&lt;br /&gt;When you are applying the Gel kit, make sure to follow step by step instructions inside the kit. Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> Big and bulky and took to long to cure.  Bulbs burnt out like they were engineered to break.</li>
    <li> Love this light!  It&#x27;s larger enough to put both hands or both feet in at the same time!  It was very easy to put the bulbs in!</li>
    <li> This was a great choice!  Works well, fits both hands or feet at the same time.  Just as good as the one at the salon.</li>
    <li> Great professional product! A little big to store but can&#x27;t beat the quality! If you plan to do your nail or anyone else&#x27;s on a regular basis this is a great product with professional quality results.</li>
    <li> Great quality, great price! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product! Timely shipped! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Outstanding unit reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is very sleek and works excellently. Easy set up and easy use. If you are looking for a dryer that has a powerful fan though this is not the one for you, it just works to cool the heat of the uv bulbs to your hands. But overall great dryer.</li>
    <li> Great product and delivery was perfect</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work with harmony gelish</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for daughter who is in her early 30&#x27;s and she loved it!</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is huge!  You can fit both hands easily</li>
    <li> Third time a charm... First two orders had broken lights  but once I got the good one I love it!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter n law loves this. She can dry all her nails at once</li>
    <li> Took forever for my nails to dry and they felt sticky.  I used it twice with two brands of polish thinking the polish was the problem, but it&#x27;s this.  I can&#x27;t return it because I&#x27;m &amp;#34;out of my return window&amp;#34;.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tired of salon prices for something I can do myself at home. This lamp is great! It cured my gelish quickly n cost less then a pedi n mani would be at the salon....YAY!</li>
    <li> This is awesome. And my nails look great. It is really worth the investment. You&#x27;ll never need to go to the salon again.</li>
    <li> This is grade A product to do your own nails whether they are gel or regular polish always do my own nails turn out professionally</li>
    <li> Works excellent. My first time trying to do shellac nails at home and they turned out perfect. Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Love this gel light !</li>
    <li> Love it, it is everything I needed and expected. Very easy to use with great time selections.</li>
    <li> This works great.  I save so much money doing my nails myself.</li>
    <li> This dryer works like a charm and I&#x27;m saving almost $35 every time I use it.  Best of all, it&#x27;s large enough to do either fingers or toe nails.  It has been successfully used by all the female members of my family and we are all really pleased.  The dryer is light enough so that we can easily carry it between our homes.  We all highly recommend this machine.</li>
    <li> I received this on election day and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it since I had received my Shellac nail polish that I had ordered prior. When I opened the box I was happy to see that the bulbs were packed safely inside of the nail dryer. I was nervous that I might&#x27;ve had a bad bulb but they all work. When I saw this dryer I noticed how nice looking and professional it looked and I was excited to try it. Even my brother was impressed when he saw it. I have never used a nail dryer nor gel nail polish before. There is plenty of room for both hands inside. I used Shellac colors Romantique and also Cream Puff to do a french manicure. I was happy to see that using a UV light nail dryer with a gel polish really works fast to dry your nails! Your nails will be tacky after you dry them but rest assured that is fine. What I did was apply my base coat dry them with the UV lamp for 10 seconds, applied my color, dried for 2 minutes, applied a second coat of color, dried for 3 minutes (I was paranoid it wouldn&#x27;t dry since I applied more than a thin layer) then I applied the white color on the tips of my nails dried for 2 minutes then I applied my top coat I dried that for another 3 minutes. Be sure to apply thin layers of polish or else when you dry your nails it could look like that dry skin that forms on bean gravy when you leave it out uncovered. I made this mistake on the tips of my nails on one hand by applying the white color on too thick. I applied a thin layer on my other hand it came out perfect. But not bad overall for my first try! After you dry the top coat use a cotton swab with alcohol on it and rub vigorously to remove the tackiness of the polish and your nails will look so shiny! You can immediately go on about your day after you do this. It&#x27;s been 8 days and my nails still have held up and look shiny like day 1. I love this nail dryer and the ease of use of it. Just push a button for the UV light, one for the fan and one for the timer. The light will turn off after the timer is done just push the button for the timer again to whatever time you want to set it again. I can&#x27;t wait until I can use it again with my other Shellac color Red Baroness.e timer is done just push the button for the timer again to whatever time you want to set it again. I can&#x27;t wait until I can use it again with my other Shellac color Red Baroness.</li>
    <li> I like this, I only with it came with a better manual on how much time/how to use it better.  It was easy and simple to set up and get started with though and looks like it is a really well made unit.</li>
    <li> I love this uv drying light, very roomy for both hands. Also great for feet. Really like the fan feature and that it has a timer. I use the fan with the uv light when drying regular polish, great results.</li>
    <li> Better than I could imagine.</li>
    <li> Love the UV Light and love doing my own nails.  Saving me $60 a month by doing them myself!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
    <li> Great nail light. Better than the one I was sold (did not last a year) at a Prof Nail Supply Store.</li>
    <li> I shopped and shopped trying to decide which UV light to purchase.  There is such a range of price points, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do.  After several days of reading reviews and debating with myself, I decided to buy the Royal Nails Professional UV light.  I am glad that I did.  I like that it has a fan, your hands can get pretty hot in a UV light box that doesn&#x27;t have one.  Also, the ability to put both hands or feet in at once is a total plus.  It is worth paying extra to get a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006IBM21K 54 WATT ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL AND ACRILIC NAIL DRYER &amp; CURING RN541 WORKS WITH CND, SHELLAC, OPI, HARMONY GELLISH, IBD GELAC, ETC.. FOR DOUBLE. HANDS OR FEET.]]</li>
    <li> When I first received the royal nails uv light, I was prepared to leave a borderline review. It was clearly *not* a brand new mfg item. My item was, however, in the proper retail box, with full foam packing, instructions, and diagrams. The factory seal was broken and aspects of the lamp looked as though it had been used and cleaned: scuff marks, the blue film was missing, areas were yellowed, the door clip was chiseled at, etc. I never noticed anywhere on the Amazon listing that I would be receiving a seconds/refurbished/used item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I jumped to review-fury, I decided to use it! The bulbs were included and they snapped in &amp; illuminated perfect. Opening the unit to install the bulbs took elbow grease, I suppose that&#x27;s why someone had to chisel at the clamp as mentioned above. The timer worked accurately too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to work on my nails! Alcohol wipe down, Gelish ph bond prep, CND base coat, 2 coats of ASP turquoise nail color (from Sally&#x27;s B), CND top coat. 2min cure for each layer. Alcohol swipe at the end.&lt;br /&gt;It was Briliant!!  The lamp worked perfect. I even did the base &amp; top coat on my toes. Could easily fit 2 hands or feet in. I did one hand at a time - base to top coat. These polishes are so easy to use, so easy to clean up if you make a smudge or smear, even in bright turquoise. Dark colors always look raggedy on me because I can never get a clean, precise application. Not any more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my perfect paint job, with perfectly dry &amp; set nails in a matter of minutes, I came to terms with this UV Lamp. I spent $fiftey-four (plus Amazon prime free shipping), the cost of 2 salon gel manicures. Did the job in my living room while my toddler napped. Had perfectly dry tips but the time my little one woke for a snuggle. 4 days of meal prep, dishes, baths, laundry &amp; house keeping later...my manicure still looks PERFECT. This unit is better then even my pro salon has. It&#x27;s a $200+ lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for the price I paid and the value it now has in my life, even if the listing was for a refurbished or used lamp, I would&#x27;ve been crazy not to snag it. The scuffs, and opened box status is now a non-issue to me!&lt;br /&gt;Glad I have this!! If you&#x27;re on the fence and can pick this up at a good price, it&#x27;s totally worth a try!ue it now has in my life, even if the listing was for a refurbished or used lamp, I would&#x27;ve been crazy not to snag it.

    <li> My daughter really enjoys using it</li>
    <li> Received the product promptly and have used it once with good results</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. It works really well for drying gel nails. It&#x27;s fast, has several drying time options and the lights were easy to install. I also really appreciate that it&#x27;s large enough to fit both hands in at the same time to speed the process up. I&#x27;ve done my nails three times now and it has worked every single time with perfection! It&#x27;s worth the investment if you want to do your own gel nails instead of going to the salon - it will pay for it self after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> I had bought a UV nail dryer at Ulta and it just wasn&#x27;t well made and took a while to dry. This one is more expensive but well worth the price. It is the quality of professional ones and dries both hands at once so the manicure is done in a jiffy! Product came fast and I&#x27;m super happy with it. Best of those available.</li>
    <li> Better than what I expected, very pleased</li>
    <li> I just finished doing my Gel Nails for the first time and the Royal UV Light was fabulous.  The larger size allows me to do&lt;br /&gt;both hands and reduces the time, especially for a beginner like myself.  I bought two, one for me and one for a Christmas Presents.  I will do my pedicure tomorrow and I know I will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is quite a quality machine. Unlike the mass of cheap-o ones in the $20-$40 range, this actually feels professional. Its a great size. Fits two hands or feet no problem but its not over encompassing. All the features and build quality were definitely worth the extra money, which lucky for me at the time, was only $54. It works quite well so far. It seems to be a very solid and reliable unit and we expect it and its bulbs to last a very long while. The seller shipped promptly and was very courteous. Item just as described.</li>
    <li> I have always done my own nails being an ex hairdresser. I went to a salon and got shellac nails. I knew I could do it myself! I bought a kit from beauty supply and the curing light they had on sale. It was terrible! I ordered one that looked more substantial but when it arrived the bulbs were shattered and the company was hard to deal with, so I finally just got a refund. I was tired of fooling around so ordered this one. At last a product I&#x27;m pleased with! Both hands fit at once and it cures perfectly! They don&#x27;t give much for instructions, and I had the bulbs in backwards at first, and wasn&#x27;t sure how to open it but saw the hinges. I now do my grown daughters for them also. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this lamp!  I used two coats regular OPI nail polish on my acrylic nails and then used the Gelish  top coat and cured for 4 min. My nail  tech has been using OPI nail polish and NSI Glaze &amp;Go but it usually cracks. The Gelish has been on 6 days with no cracking and no wear of polish on the tips. The Gelish top coat is a little tacky when done curing but just wipe with alcohol on a paper towel and it will take care of that.  The key is to make sure the nail polish is completely dry before applying the top coat.  I used the lamp with fan to cure the nail polish.</li>
    <li> I love this UV Light for doing Gel Nails.  I considered buying a smaller size, but I wanted to be able to do both hands at the same time, not just one hand.  It is made well and sturdy.  No worried about accidently hitting the side with a wet nail since it is larger.  I researched the reviews on it and it was rated high..and I agree. I do my sisters nails also, so being able to put both hands in at the same time is time saving.  Word of warning, if your friends find out you do your own gel nails, they will want you to do thiers! Saves a lot of money doing your own! Great product.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I was looking at a lot of different dryers to buy my fiancee for christmas. I ended up going with this one, good construction, made well, bulbs fit well, they are not loose, and the dryer works well! So far, so good! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and she loves it, I only recommend buying the shilac with this product or use it with OPI nail lacquer.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this dryer. I use it with the cnd polish and it cures perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cure gel polish in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife for Christmas. She paints her nails a lot, but always expressed disappointment with the drying time (would somehow damage the coat she just put on). I asked around and one of my female friends suggested the Gel coatings, however you need a UV lamp for them. So I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item seems solidly built, the lightbulbs were easy to put in (for the most part). The timer works pretty easily once you figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One gripe I had with it was that it didn&#x27;t come with any sort of instructions. For instance, we put all the bulbs in without opening the top hatch of the product. We had no idea it could be swung open on a hinge. That would have made putting the bulbs in even easier. Also, no instructions for how to use the timer and fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 10 minutes searching the web to no avail (for instructions), we just winged it and it worked great. The nail polish dried very quickly to a hard finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product exceeded my expectations. It seems to be salon quality according to my wife. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> It works.  But  I have to spend extra minutes.</li>
    <li> Even though I didn&#x27;t use it. I gave it to my close friend and she loved it, she uses it all the time. Saves time and money at the nail shop.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Royal Nails Light. I would recommend it to anybody looking for a light. Having 6 lights and awesome fan allows you to dry both hands or feet at the same time which is a must for an impatient person like me. I&#x27;m new in the nail art world, so I haven&#x27;t used it for anything but drying normal polish but I can&#x27;t wait to try out gels and applying tips. :D This lamp is worth the investment. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> saves time when you can do both hands or feet at once!</li>
    <li> Works fantastic. My wife uses it for her nails, and I use it to cure UV epoxy for doming applications. The extra wattage and extra size is definitely a big plus. Timer works great and the fan is also a great extra. I could not be happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great! Good size for both hands, easy to use and lightweight.  Love being able to do my own nails and not pay a pricey salon.</li>
    <li> *After posting this review, I was contacted by the seller. They offered to send me a replacement at no cost to me - pretty cool of them! I should receive it in 2 business days - I will keep this updated. This definitely made my stars go up. I appreciate good customer service!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I am a little disappointed. My Royal Nails arrived on time, but after putting it all together, I noticed that 3 sets of the UV lights were not working!! That means I can only do 1 hand/foot at a time, which is a real bummer. I looked online to see if there were any things that could help me trouble shoot....I didn&#x27;t find anything. I re-arranged the UV bulbs (those all worked fine) so that meant that 1/2 of the system was broken. I tried to contact the company, but no response. I am really bummed that I paid this much, and got something broken! And to top it off - I feel like the company doesn&#x27;t care. I am willing to edit my review if I hear back from them, but it has been 4 days, so we will see. Be cautious when ordering the 54 Watt Royal Nails UV light...it is pretty cheaply made!</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and decided to start doing my own gel at home. I really don&#x27;t enjoy going to get my nails did. Now I just do them at home and it&#x27;s way cheaper and way faster. I go to the nail salon to get them removed and it costs me $3. Way better and for some reason my gel lasts way longer then they do when the salon does them. Maybe because i&#x27;m only using opi gel i&#x27;m not sure. I wish that I bought this a long time ago. Pro-tip: I bought the alcohol wipes at a local store and after i&#x27;ve finished baking my nails i use the wipes. So much easier then trying to put alcohol on a cotton ball. I&#x27;m all about the shortcuts.</li>
    <li> I use to work for a salon and i left that salon so i bought this light to do my own nails and it work better than the ones we had at the salon.</li>
    <li> Please do not wait. This dryer works great. The fan is very quiet. I used the dryer and within 30 minutes I was out the door nails were completely dry. Item came promptly and was packaged good. Now that I have this dryer I will be able to do my own mani/pedi at my convenience.</li>
    <li> Product was received on time and my girlfriend was thrilled. She use to pay to have it done. She loves nice nice nails and this has saved her a ton of money! Product was as advertised. Kudos! Plus I got big time points with her. ( if ya know what I mean )</li>
    <li> I bought this UV light to replace my older 36 watt light. I wanted a light that had the options for setting the timer for more than 90 seconds. This light goes from 90 seconds to 300and also has a separate switch for the fan. I was actually hoping for a single hand version to conserve space, however I&#x27;m so glad I got this one. Being able to do both hands/feet at once is a real time saver. I have only gotten to use this a few times, but I am already in love with it. I actually paid less for this light than I did for my generic 36 watt light 4 years ago. You cannot get a better unit for this price. I hope to be using it for years to come.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is not an LED dryer.  However, having tried a small led dryer that was invariable returned to the vendor...not this one...I can recommend it confidently.  The large size accommodating both hands and feet simultaneously.  Compared to the tiny little ones, this one is far preferred for my use.  It does take some time to cure but does indeed do the job.  Buyers- check the wattage of what you buy.  I will remain leery of reviews for tiny little dryers with overzealous reviews.  This one has sufficient wattage.  A good price.  Seller delivered promptly.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully, easy to set up and use. I&#x27;ve only used it with regular nail polish so far, but  my nails dry in approximately 6 minutes. NO MORE SHEET NAILS!!!!!! I&#x27;m Soooo happy I bought this product. Look no where else. For such a cheap price and the quality, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I also love the fan which many others don&#x27;t come with. I hope this review helped....happy DIY nails ladies!</li>
    <li> My daughter did gel on my nails for her wedding and I loved them, I work in a warehouse and my nails are chipped and broken all the time. When she did my nails they were so much stronger then regular nail polish so I decided to try doing it myself.  She had a small nail dryer that didn&#x27;t have as many lights in it, when I saw this unit was bigger and had more lights I thought I would give it a try. This was a little more expensive but it is so worth it. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about bumping them when I put my hands in to dry. I think because it has more wattage then my daughters it cured my nails better, It is a really nice looking unit and I would recomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is very nice. Its salon quality. I haven&#x27;t actually used it yet. I just tested it out. So far, I am very please with this item. It&#x27;s just what I have been looking for. Thank you :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use my nail dryer. Its perfect. It took about three minutes to completely dry my nails. I did not buy this nail dryer for gel colors. I use regular nail polish and it works just like the professional nail salons. After my nails were dried, they looked so shinny :o) I&#x27;m in-love with this drier. No more waiting 30 minutes or so for my nails to air dry. No more expensive bills at the nail salon. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I wanted gel nails without the price and decided to invest in my own uv light. It arrived quickly, was easy to assemble and functions properly. So far I&#x27;ve used it for a gel nail manicure and regular polish pedicure. It works great and I feel like I&#x27;m treating myself to a salon.</li>
    <li> I looked on line to compare uv products and decided to try this one because of the size and 54 watt strength  I have used it several times and it works great....has several different time setting and a fan, and both hands can fit it easily.  I would recommend this nail drier highly.  It was easy to set up, and was packaged securely.</li>
    <li> i was soo excited to get this product after reading all the reviews as a nail tech this comes  in handy alot because is for two hand, but after receiving it, it was scratch from the top and where you will put your hands but for the price i think is okay, i dont think is the original brand but is good for the price. i already use it like 5 times and i really like it. i gave it 5 stars because it was scratch if not i would it gave it 5. but i still love it. recommended. just remember depending how much you used it the light bulds need to be change around 6 months to a 1year.</li>
    <li> You have to leave nails under a UV light twice as long as under LED, but the price of this light is incredible!  Both hands fit under at the same time easily, so the 2 minutes instead of 1 minute under an expensive LED light is well worth the extra time.</li>
    <li> this. The service for Royal is exceptional. One of the bulbs came in broken. It was replaced almost immediately I am so happy with the service knowing that if I have any problems which I doubt I can get excellent service by just emailing them.</li>
    <li> I have used it a couple of times. The curing and drying time for nails does not take long. It is a great product that i would not trade for any other nail dryer.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is interested in nails whether if its for personal use or business. Received it on time and its worth the cost. I was looking up for a good nail dryer for a while then I came across this dyer and read all the reviews and it very great. It helped me a lot to choose and make the right choice. Thank a lot Amazon.</li>
    <li> Recently got my first UV light. It was easy to use and especially love being able to put both hands or feet in it at one time.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser told me about this product. I&#x27;ve given myself three manicures since I received my UV light &amp; my nails look better than they have since I stopped having them professionally done. I read a 5 star review on Amazon about this light, the reviewer gave detailed instructions about how to use the light &amp; UV polishes. I followed her instructions &amp; my nails  turned out perfect the first time I used it. It saves lots of money &amp; I can do my nails when its convenient. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I got this for doing gel nails at home. It came promptly, before any of the polishes I ordered, which was a frustrating wait. I have never used one before but the set up is pretty self explanatory and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s big enough for both hands or feet, which is perfect when doing a friend&#x27;s nails. While gel polishes have varying times to cure polish depending on brand or color, since those recommendations are based off of a 36 watt UV dryer, and this is a 54 watt dryer, the minimum time has always worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only possible issue I might see for people is that it didn&#x27;t really have much of an instruction manual, but I&#x27;m one of those people who puts stuff together first and only looks at the manual if there&#x27;s a problem. And as I said, this was really simple to put together so that isn&#x27;t an issue for me, but might be for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great buy. I will likely buy it again if it breaks (within a reasonable amount of time) and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I researched nail dryers for a long time before purchase and I&#x27;m very happy with his - it&#x27;s large enough to fit your whole hand with several convenient time options. I usually do not use the fan, but is nice to have as a feature.</li>
