      <li>Great product, good price, Happy Hair!</li>
      <li>but the times I have used it  I am happy that I ordered it.</li>
      <li>Good ole reliable.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this dryer!  </li>
      <li>Good dryer for most men&#x27;s hair styles/lengths.</li>
      <li>This fits the bill nicely.  </li>
      <li>They changed the air filter at the end to a mesh, liked the screen type better but still works</li>
      <li>Most hair dryers out there are now &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; so I kept to this dryer.  </li>
      <li>I have used this brand hair dryer for many years.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>Works great, but is very loud.</li>
      <li>This happened with the first one I recieved, but because Amazon has AMAZING customer service, they replaced it at no charge.  </li>
      <li>That is what I love about it, if I want cool, warm, or hot</li>
      <li>It is light weight, compact, quiet and works great with fine hair.</li>
      <li>the diffuser actually fit the hair dryer.</li>
      <li>found two hair dryers that looked like they might be as good as my old one.  </li>
      <li>I had the same hair dryer for over a decade, and it was the best, until one day it finally stopped working, and after so many years it no longer exists, so</li>
      <li>are three temperature settings and a cool shot button.</li>
      <li>I love it so far !!!</li>
      <li>I love my new hair dryer.</li>
      <li>The hair dryer also feels very plastic-y and cheaply made, but for the price...</li>
      <li>It is lightweight, powerful, HOT, and dries your hair</li>
      <li>The first one I bought had a burning smell right away when I turned it on.</li>
      <li>and it works great, especially with the big diffuser for my curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I have really fine, straight hair that gets flat easily and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need the higher wattage.</li>
      <li>I first  tried this hair dryer when visiting my sister.</li>
      <li>Very functional worth the money</li>
      <li>The hottest temperature setting isn&#x27;t super hot, so this hair dryer doesn&#x27;t dry your hair really fast, but that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
      <li>It does dry my fine curly hair quite well and decently  quickly.</li>
      <li>not so much an option in the hot, humid days of summer.  </li>
      <li>still really like this hair drying because I don&#x27;t worry about it breaking if I accidentally drop it.</li>
      <li>so haven&#x27;t used it that much yet,</li>
      <li>I particularly like the 3 heat settings.</li>
      <li>This was a replacement for an older Helen of Troy.</li>
      <li>It is good that is has a low setting, so you can blow with cooler air as well as warm  or hot, but it produces an annoying high pitched whine  </li>
      <li>I needed a new 1600 watt hairdryer when my Panasonic died.  </li>
      <li>I needed something powerful with a long barrel.&lt;br /&gt;(Short</li>
      <li>so cheaply made they fall seriously short of what should be a long life.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an ionic feature, which I actually like because that seems to give my hair a little more life throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
      <li>It is even a little more quiet than my old Panasonic.</li>
      <li>I am completely sold on this dryer.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be well made, is light weight and the motor is very quiet compared to my previous dryer.</li>
      <li>I would not buy this brand again, but if noises do not bother you, you might like it as it uses less wattage than most other hair dryers on the market.</li>
      <li>It allows me to dry my curly hair with the diffuser, or use without to achieve straight tresses...</li>
      <li>that is so loud even on the low setting</li>
      <li>I have short, fine hair and after reading negative reviews about the results obtained with the Tourmaline/Ionic dryers for my hair type I decided to look for a dryer without those &amp;#34;features&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>and I had to wet my hair down and start over with my tried and true Helen of Troy.</li>
      <li>The force of the air coming out of the hair dryer also isn&#x27;t as strong as some other hair dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>

<li> Didn&#x27;t want to be holding up a heavy dryer but wanted the power and variety of settings that this one has.</li>
<li> It also is not that heavy.</li>
<li> I bought both, hoping that at least one would work.</li>
<li> my husband can hear it downstairs and has complained about  it.  </li>
<li> I might just use the filter in my old hair dryer - but annoying situation nonetheless!</li>
<li> But it is almost impossible to find a hair dryer in the stores that ISN&#x27;T Ion!  </li>
<li> Worst blow dryer I have ever purchased.  </li>

    <li> I thought this hairdryer would be less noisy than other ones I have used that had higher wattage.  It is good that is has a low setting, so you can blow with cooler air as well as warm  or hot, but it produces an annoying high pitched whine  that is so loud even on the low setting my husband can hear it downstairs and has complained about  it.  It does dry my fine curly hair quite well and decently  quickly. I&#x27;ve even tried using it with earplugs, but I can still hear the whine. I would not buy this brand again, but if noises do not bother you, you might like it as it uses less wattage than most other hair dryers on the market.</li>
    <li> 03/09/15  Reduced to 2 Stars UPDATE: After just 6 years of using every other day this dryer just gave up.  My previous Helen of Troy blow dryer lasted 20 years, my previous curling iron lasted 25 years.  Their &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; versions of the same model numbers are junk.  This will be the last Helen of Troy item I buy as all of their products are now so cheaply made they fall seriously short of what should be a long life.  01/05/12  5 Stars I have been using this model of hair dryer for over 20 years.  When my previous one quit on me I bought another one.  I have a sleep number bed in my house and it says not to use any products with &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; whatever.  Most hair dryers out there are now &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; so I kept to this dryer.  Good ole reliable.  They changed the air filter at the end to a mesh, liked the screen type better but still works okay.</li>
    <li> I have used this hair dryer for years. Unfortunately, the removable lint filter is missing from the new dryer I just got! I called Helen of Troy, but they don&#x27;t have any to send me. I have to return the hair dryer and exchange if I want one with a filter! I might just use the filter in my old hair dryer - but annoying situation nonetheless!</li>
    <li> I have really fine, straight hair that gets flat easily and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl. I was looking for a hair dryer that didn&#x27;t cost a fortune and just &amp;#34;got the job done.&amp;#34; This hair dryer fits the bill. It doesn&#x27;t have an ionic feature, which I actually like because that seems to give my hair a little more life throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three temperature settings and a cool shot button. You can also remove lint from the hair dryer in the back. The hottest temperature setting isn&#x27;t super hot, so this hair dryer doesn&#x27;t dry your hair really fast, but that&#x27;s okay with me. The force of the air coming out of the hair dryer also isn&#x27;t as strong as some other hair dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past. The hair dryer also feels very plastic-y and cheaply made, but for the price... what do you expect, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still really like this hair drying because I don&#x27;t worry about it breaking if I accidentally drop it. It&#x27;s sturdy, not too heavy, and dries my hair without damaging it and making it really flat.</li>
    <li> i had had one of these a while ago and then couldn&#x27;t find one to replace it with. i have used this for quite a while and it works just great!!</li>
    <li> I needed a new 1600 watt hairdryer when my Panasonic died.  This fits the bill nicely.  It is even a little more quiet than my old Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand hair dryer for many years. I was unhappy that this latest one did not have the mesh in the back to keep my hair from sucking into the fan thus pulling my hair out of my scalp and causing me pain. I put the mesh from my old broken dryer into it.</li>
    <li> the diffuser actually fit the hair dryer. the diffuser is very wide so it holds alot of hair..I am very happy</li>
    <li> I am completely sold on this dryer.  It allows me to dry my curly hair with the diffuser, or use without to achieve straight tresses...not so much an option in the hot, humid days of summer.  Great product, good price, Happy Hair!</li>
    <li> I love my new hair dryer. It has three speeds on it and three different hair settings. That is what I love about it, if I want cool, warm, or hot I have my choice. It also is not that heavy. I just received it about a week ago so haven&#x27;t used it that much yet, but the times I have used it  I am happy that I ordered it. I love it so far !!!</li>
    <li> After a bit of research I decided to purchase this hair dryer.  I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase. The only thing that could use a design improvement is that I&#x27;m often accidentally switching the temperature to a cooler setting but it&#x27;s not a big issue.  I&#x27;d read about that from another reviewer.  I would recommend this to a friend and buy it again.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an older Helen of Troy. I like the placement of the switches on this one. It is light weight, compact, quiet and works great with fine hair. I don&#x27;t need the higher wattage.</li>
    <li> Worst blow dryer I have ever purchased.  Broke after just a couple of uses and it is passed my return date.</li>
    <li> Works great, but is very loud.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this dryer!  I have tried every other dryer under the sun, but this dryer beats them all.  It is lightweight, powerful, HOT, and dries your hair FAST!&lt;br /&gt;My hair HATES Ion dryers.  But it is almost impossible to find a hair dryer in the stores that ISN&#x27;T Ion!  It&#x27;s nuts.  I was so happy to find this dryer here, and I hope and pray they never stop making it or I just might go insane! lol&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that you don&#x27;t throw away the box for a couple of weeks in case it quits on you.  This happened with the first one I recieved, but because Amazon has AMAZING customer service, they replaced it at no charge.  I just sent it back, no problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this model for over 15 years (same dryer!) and it works great, especially with the big diffuser for my curly hair.  I received a much more expensive dryer as a gift and I had to wet my hair down and start over with my tried and true Helen of Troy.</li>
    <li> Very functional worth the money</li>
    <li> I had the same hair dryer for over a decade, and it was the best, until one day it finally stopped working, and after so many years it no longer exists, so I couldn&#x27;t buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair that takes forever to dry.  I needed something powerful with a long barrel.&lt;br /&gt;(Short hair dryers suck stray strands of long hair into the side and then snag and shred the hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found two hair dryers that looked like they might be as good as my old one.  I bought both, hoping that at least one would work. Then I could return the other.  To my surprise they both worked.  So I decided to keep both of them, and in another decade, when one breaks, I will have a spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two hair dryers are:&lt;br /&gt;Andis 40055 Pro Style 1600 Watt Hair Dryer and&lt;br /&gt;Helen of Troy 6094 Turbo Styling Dryer.</li>
    <li> I first  tried this hair dryer when visiting my sister. It&#x27;s just what I wanted. Didn&#x27;t want to be holding up a heavy dryer but wanted the power and variety of settings that this one has. It&#x27;s lightweight but has 3 heat settings and 2 power settings. I use it every day. Very happy with it. The first one I bought had a burning smell right away when I turned it on. I returned it to the vendor and have used its replacement for about a year with no problem.</li>
    <li> After 4 months of use I like this dryer. It seems to be well made, is light weight and the motor is very quiet compared to my previous dryer. I have short, fine hair and after reading negative reviews about the results obtained with the Tourmaline/Ionic dryers for my hair type I decided to look for a dryer without those &amp;#34;features&amp;#34;. I particularly like the 3 heat settings. Good dryer for most men&#x27;s hair styles/lengths.</li>
