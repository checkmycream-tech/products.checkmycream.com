      <li>scent of the shampoo is kind of minty</li>
      <li>Sometimes it goes away on its own, but when it doesn&#x27;t, putting Selsun on it for ~10 minutes</li>
      <li>I tried this at my boyfriend&#x27;s place when I ran out of my own stuff.  </li>
      <li>you should really try this product, just get a really, really good smelling conditioner to mask the smell in your now beautiful hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of a salon brand snob, but this worked much better than all of the others.</li>
      <li>and so far it&#x27;s worked the best I anticipate by Summer</li>
      <li>many thanks to the good weather and excellent product fast and the product itself is seen by the portal luismer</li>
      <li>Works amazingly but the smell is too strong.</li>
      <li>Wowzer the smell is kind of strong</li>
      <li>and I LOVE the menthol smell.</li>
      <li>Seems to work, but not a shampoo I would use more than once or twice a week.</li>
      <li>The scent is okay for</li>
      <li>The smell of the product may not be the best out of the three above</li>
      <li>and I Love the results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is no adhesive/foiled covering on the top which many products have now.  </li>
      <li>I looked up online and saw many recommendations for this product.</li>
      <li>For good measure, I did this again two days later even though I experienced no itching and had no flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use this most often during the winter months when my skin is drier and my scalp gets a bit</li>
      <li>I was using \\&quot;Head &amp; Shoulders\\&quot; containing selenium sulfide 1% (anti-fungal), tea tree oil, &amp; hydrocortisone ointment, and was not getting much better.  </li>
      <li>It works better than the prescription shampoos that we used.</li>
      <li>I think it has helped keep my tinea versicolor from spreading, and since I have started this regime, the spots aren&#x27;t has prominent.</li>
      <li>this product worked much better.</li>
      <li>It got better after a week or so and kept improving.</li>
      <li>it is a magic product</li>
      <li>sure u use it twice a week</li>
      <li>all in all i would recommend this :)</li>
      <li>But I wish it had a better smell and</li>
      <li>I decided to try it daily for a week out of desperation and it worked wonderfully -</li>
      <li>Am pleased with the results, as well as pricing.</li>
      <li>If I find a solution to the hair stiffness, I will be sure to edit this review to help others out that may have this problem as well.</li>
      <li>Refreshing.</li>
      <li>Upon weeks of use, I noticed that my dandruff had become significantly more prominent.</li>
      <li>The tingling sensation is wonderful too especially during the summer months--so refreshing and</li>
      <li>Best product especially for psoriasis.</li>
      <li>I have been trying many shampoos for years now.</li>
      <li>Many people that I know with dandruff reduce washing the hair because of increased hair loss, a by-product of Dandruff.  </li>
      <li>I think it was because of the change of environment, diet, more exposure to sunshine and the fact that it was fall.</li>
      <li>My hair and scalp feel nice and clean after I use this.</li>
      <li>Although the product was packaged securely with plenty of bubble wrap, the shampoo leaked out of its container top.  </li>
      <li>The original selsun is better.</li>
      <li>I think the best way to rate a product is to compare it to other products.</li>
      <li>A clean scalp is always a better option to reduce hair loss and you are not going to avoid hair fall</li>
      <li>I like the strong menthol smell.</li>
      <li>This helps get rid of the strong medicine smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased to find a shampoo that really helps.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works, but you have to use it consistently -- I prefer to shower every couple days (since I live in the Pacific Northwest, ha, ha), but that seems not to be often enough. Additionally I find that I get better results if I rinse my hair with a different shampoo first to wash out all the stuff accumulated on my scalp, then rinse and use the Selsun Blue.</li>
    <li> I have found my new dandruff shampoo. No more itchy scalp or flakes when I rub my head. After an injury to my head, a friend told me about my dandruff problem while applying a bandage to my head, and recommended Selsun Blue.( I had been using the other highly touted brand). I immediately ordered the 11 ounce bottle thru Amazon, with receipt of same in two days. I noticed a remarkable improvement after the first use, and the majority of the problem was taken care of after the second use (next two days). It has been a month now, and with twice-a-week use, no more dandruff or itchy scalp! (and my hair has NOT started to fall out!)- full disclosure: I do not work for Selsun Blue, nor do I know anyone who does work for them. I can highly recommend Selsun Blue to you, especially if you have a serious dandruff problem, or just a minor one you want taken care of NOW!</li>
    <li> The best at curing what itches &#x27;ya.</li>
    <li> I have bought many different &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; shampoos for my daughter that has thick dark hair and really bad dandruff since she was about 10 (she&#x27;s 15, now).  Some of them have been very expensive and none of them worked.  We tried a different type of Selsun Blue that had Salicylic Acid in it and it didn&#x27;t work.  Then we tried this and FINALLY something worked!!!  She didn&#x27;t have any itching but lots of big flakes that really embarrassed her.  The only downside is that she really doesn&#x27;t like the smell so she uses this only a couple of times a weekl.  I saw a suggestion to go with the green capped SB for the smell issue, so we will try that next time.  We are so happy to have found something that finally helps and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg to buy!</li>
    <li> Works great as a face wash too- recommended by my Dr. It works awesome- get really cool on your face so you know it is working. The best &amp;#34;face wash&amp;#34; I have ever tried!</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product.  it came packed very good and nothing could happen to the bottle.  this was recommended by a dermatologist and has done the job it was suppose to.</li>
    <li> Hello, male, 22, I went to my dermatologist for a condition I have on my face where I am getting minor pink spots around my chin and jaw line. I also suffer from MPB and due to a minoxidil liquid I use, my scalp flakes and itch.    My dermatologist recommended I use this Selsun Blue for flaking and because it can also help with the problem on my face[not to put it on my face, she prescribed Desonide for my face problem but that&#x27;s off topic] I think she means like since shampoo runs down your face, the shampoo will go down my chin and it will be good for my skin problem. Because this shampoo claims to treat seborric dermatitis on the scalp[I don&#x27;t have that, at least not to my knowledge], and I think I have a very minor case of some form of dermatitis on my face.     So I went straight from the dermatologist to Duane Reade and bought two of these for $11 each. That&#x27;s $22, now I see amazon has them for $7 with free shipping? I could have bought THREE of these if I just came home and looked for the damn shampoo on Amazon, which I always do, this was the first time I bought something like that  without using amazon. So that&#x27;s what I get for being desperate..plus it was hot I needed an excuse to go in to Duane Reade since it&#x27;s always air conditioned...it was like a pit stop, but I paid for it, literally.    Anyways, I gave it 5 stars because I used it 2 days ago[the day I went to my dermatologist] and my itching and flaking is gone for now. It was an everyday thing, because of the minoxidil I use. So far I have not felt any itching and when I have been combing my hair I don&#x27;t see the large amounts of flakes falling like it did just 3 days ago. I plan to use this shampoo only twice a week, or maybe once a week. The only bad thing is the smell, but the menthol in it makes my head feel really good. So, 5 stars because it does what it claims to do, and because of the price. Next time I will be buying from Amazon..i&#x27;ll have to think of something else to buy to enter Duane Reade next time.</li>
    <li> I never thought any shampoo would ease down on my dry scalp until I tried this. When you use it on your head it has a cold feeling sort of like if you apply icy hot or bengai. Works great recommend this to anyone who is sick of dandruff.</li>
    <li> Red patches on scalp disappeared after only a few uses and hair is returning as the patches disappear. Works great but note you should only use this twice a week then switch to a non-laurel sulfate shampoo for the rest of the week.</li>
    <li> Best product especially for psoriasis. I use this product every other day whenever I get a flare up and it removes the flare up within a matter of 1-2 days. I was recommended to this product by a dermatologist friend of mine. At first, when I began to use it, it took about 2-3 weeks before I could see results.  I used this in conjunction with the T/Sal Neutrogena Therapeutic Shampoo as well.  Switched off and on every other day. I used so many products for my psoriasis and these products are the only ones that work for me! I reorder from the same manufacture on Amazon every 2-3 months depending on the use.  This bottle is fairly large but a little bit goes along way. Overall, I would highly recommend this product, especially if you have minor to severe psoriasis.  I had minor psoriasis but it progressed and got worse in patches but after using this product, it went away after several months.</li>
    <li> All my dandruff gone within a week love selsun blue. Every winter I get dandruff due to the cold weather and dry air at work. selsun blue took care of the problem in a week. Its also refreshing when using this shampoo due to the fact it contains mentol.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product because I had a problem with dandruff but I did purchase because I have a irritated scalp associated with eczema. If you are a eczema sufferer like me, you know that even the type of soap and shampoo you use can greatly irritate your skin. Coupled with treating breakouts with topical creams, another way to fight eczema is with the right prevention. This means taking your vitamins, omega-3, and using non irritant soap and shampoo. Selsun Blue immediately cools my scalp when washing my hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated or itchy. If you suffer from a irritated scalp condition, I highly recommend that you give this shampoo a try. It worked wonders for me.</li>
    <li> As a 20 year old girl, I&#x27;ve been suffering from dandruff for about a year. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Head n Shoulders to Pureology Dandruff Conditioner, and Selsun Blue Max Strength is the first one that has effectively cleared up my dandruff and made my scalp feel clean and fresh. I&#x27;ve had people comment on how much healthier my hair looks too! Must buy!</li>
    <li> I was using \\&quot;Head &amp; Shoulders\\&quot; containing selenium sulfide 1% (anti-fungal), tea tree oil, &amp; hydrocortisone ointment, and was not getting much better.  When I used the Selson Blue, my problem got much better very quickly.  Selson Blue has selenium sulfide 1% also which is supposed to be the \\&quot;active ingredient\\&quot;, but SB seemed to work much better than Head &amp; Shoulders.  I put SB on my dry shaved head in the shower and rub it around and let it stay that way for a minute or two while I continute to shower.  Then I wet it and rub it around really well - then rinse.  Yes, I shaved my head and beard because this condition was so bad.  You can read online about the various yeast forms that can cause such conditions.</li>
    <li> This is best anti-itchy, anti-dandruff shampoo in the world.  Been use this over 10 years, and though the smell is not the best but you can count on it to work like it described.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly but the smell is too strong. I don&#x27;t mind it, but every time my mom greets me, she complains. And so I only use it for the weekend and it keeps the dandruff away.</li>
    <li> I am a 13 year old boy who has had dandruff for a year or two.  It wasn&#x27;t neccesarily the itching, just the constant flaking.  So, we finally got this, and on the first try it took all the dandruff off my scalp.  There is still a little in my hair but that is nothing a little brushing can&#x27;t fix.  The moment you rub it in your hair you feel this satisfying slight stinging sensation.  Definently get this.</li>
    <li> Came good but  the shampoo doesn&#x27;t help at all</li>
    <li> I have this off-color grainy feeling patch on my jugular notch on my neck. Sometimes it goes away on its own, but when it doesn&#x27;t, putting Selsun on it for ~10 minutes works like a miracle on it. I don&#x27;t know what it is and I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s there. All I know is that it&#x27;s harmless and the only thing that I need to use to make it go away is this dandruff shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells weird and looks like smurf puke though.</li>
    <li> Deep cleans and works great. Husband loves it. I steal some of his once in a while. Good product but neither of us has terrible dandruff.</li>
    <li> I used it to help get rid of razor bumps and/or pimples. It took a few days but it worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> I tried Nizoral, T Gel, and Head &amp; Shoulders and they all had zero effect. I used Selsun Blue ONE day and all my dandruff is gone. I thought i could maybe just use it once a week but i&#x27;ve realized i need to probably use it every other day and i&#x27;m good to go. Definitely worth it, it&#x27;s the only thing that actually works.</li>
    <li> I have had an itchy scalp for a while now. This is what the doctor recommended. My scalp still itches after I shower. I like the strong menthol smell.</li>
    <li> I had very stubborn dandruff, tried various soaps and shampoos, including Head &amp; Shoulders, Pine Tar Soap and shampoo, coal tar shampoo and so on. None give me any practical result. Inspired by reviews of this shampoo, I bought it, and have to say, it really helps! used it only 3 times so far, and almost all my dandruff is gone, no flakes, only couple of very small particles remain! I&#x27;m very pleased to find a shampoo that really helps. And also it has pleasant (as my wife says, I&#x27;d say - neutral) aroma, unlike these tar shampoos, which make you smell like burnt log.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This is very etchy shampoo, so when applying to your scalp, try to rinse it after in such way, that no residue hits your face or other parts of body, because if you don&#x27;t, than you going to feel like little stingers hitting your body all the day.</li>
    <li> No other dandruff shampoo will get those gross flakes out of your hair like this product. It&#x27;s this thick dark forest green color that smells disgusting, but works miracles. If you have really bad dandruff you should really try this product, just get a really, really good smelling conditioner to mask the smell in your now beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> Well to start off this really is a great value for what it does. I use it as directed and its cut my dandruff in half if not more. One thing i woulda liked to know when i bought it is that if i skip a use of it the dandruff really builds up and turns it kinda green-ish...But if used as directed it works perfectly! And my hair feels great afterwords</li>
    <li> I began using one of my friends comb, which led to dandruff,(which he warned me off, after using it). I began searching for effective shampoo which can fight back this dandruff.. i used head and shoulders, pantene and others but none of them came close to this product. i just used it once and it actually did work.. i have no dandruff now, with just one wash, i am free from all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one thing, that you have to be super super careful with this product is that, it is very powerful and strong, if it goes inside your mouth or eyes, it could cause serious damage.. it actually says on the label to contact a poison administration department. But for the intended use it is too good. i could have given 5 stars but, because we have to be extra careful and prepare ourselves before you use it, which lead to 4 stars..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with dandruff for over ten years and have tried almost ever other product out there - Head and Shoulders, Neutrogena, etc - with no improvement.  I was hesitant to buy Selsun Blue because of the higher price and smell but I wish I had tried this product much earlier because within a week of daily use, my dandruff was gone!  To clarify, I had extreme dandruff; my scalp was itchy and there was a thick layer of dead skin cells that you could see around my scalp through my hair.  It was getting so bad that my itching was causing my scalp to bleed in several places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle does say to use twice a week or as directed.  I decided to try it daily for a week out of desperation and it worked wonderfully - I haven&#x27;t seen a single flake since that first week and it&#x27;s been over a month since I started.  I&#x27;ve now switched to using it once or twice a week with a continuation of great results.  I don&#x27;t know why this worked so well for me but if you&#x27;ve been struggling for years with dandruff, then do yourself a favor and try this immediately!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 13-year-old whose friends had started pointing out that he has dandruff.  He washes his hair every other day, and this seems to be doing the trick.  I told him that he needs to use his fingertips to get to his scalp, and also that he might need to wash his hair every day.  So far, the every other day is working.  The bottle states that it might take awhile to see results, and this is true.  It took a couple weeks before the dandruff went away.  Good stuff.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> It works great, but dries out my hair &amp; makes it brittle, nice menthol scent &amp; no dandruff.</li>
    <li> This is my second shampoo my go to</li>
    <li> This is the best dandruff product on the market! Great for removing product build-up. I use it once a week in place of my regular shampoo. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> I have been trying many shampoos for years now. I decided to give Selsun blue one more try and my previous experience was corroborated this time around. It does give you a cool sensation (due to menthol), however, it does make your hair fall more. It has very harsh chemicals such as lots of sulfides and sulfates which is really bad for your color treated hair. it did reduce my dandruff (did not get rid of it completely). but it comes with its cons.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I could see the difference after only using it once. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I had dandruff for as long as i can remember but 2006 for some reason it spireled out of control, and i tried many things for it. Then when i got this shampoo, i used it two times, at first it look like my dandruff was coming back even quicker but when i used it again plus head and shoulders (because selsun smells so bad) a week later there was no dandruff. i usually get dandruff within 4 days to a week of washing my hair, but i tested for another two weeks without washing my hair and nothing came back. It feels great not haveing dandruff anymore, but i still have to use this smelly stuff.&lt;br /&gt;And this smell can last in your hair for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;But all in all i would recommend this :)</li>
    <li> It is very expensive !!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for $11.06 then I discovered it is in Walmart for $6.98 :(((((&lt;br /&gt;Beside I don&#x27;t find any progress with my problem of dandruff !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My scalp has been much healthier since I started using this. Thank you so much for this amazing product, I have no regrets about this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used multiple products for my dandruff problem (Neutrogena, Garnier, Head and Shoulders etc) and this has been the most effective I have found, from the first wash there is great relief, and a few washes afterwards it effectively clears up all the dandruff.  I usually apply it twice in each shower to clean the scalp thoroughly.  It smells and feels great on the head.    I highly recommend this product, and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This is the only anti-dandruff product that works for me and it hasn&#x27;t caused any hair-loss since I started using it two years ago. Thank God for it.    Good luck.</li>
    <li> My husband read somewhere that Selsun Blue medicated shampoo could help with our dog&#x27;s skin issues. We had already spent a lot of time and money trying to resolve his skin issues and were desperate to try anything, especially something this affordable and easy to come by.&lt;br /&gt;He is a large dog who doesn&#x27;t love taking a bath so the most challenging part is actually getting him into the tub. After that, we simply wet him down completely and apply the Selsun Blue to the affected areas. For him, it is always his feet. We then let the Selsun Blue sit for about 5 minutes before rinsing it off.&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the shampoo is kind of minty and I actually like it and it seems like a cool, soothing scent as well. It doesn&#x27;t seem to bother him at all or cause any reactions so that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;We have noticed that he doesn&#x27;t bother his feet for up to a week after we apply it to the affected area. This is definitely a start at getting his feet healed up. We may have to think of another way to do it outside of the bath tub so it&#x27;s not such a chore.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product to use as a shampoo. I have Tinea Versicolor and I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks on my spots and they have almost cleared up! I never would have spent money on those expensive prescription creams if I would have known about this stuff! Also, if you have a stuffy nose, the strong smell will clear it right up. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> good stuff , leaves the scalp tingling ,in a good way .</li>
    <li> Worked pretty quickly, only had to use it a couple of times to get rid of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Helps with the build up on my hair.  I sued it 1x a week.</li>
    <li> I originally used a different variety of \\&quot;medical grade\\&quot; anti-dandruff shampoo, but I decided to try this one out, because it was cheaper and more readily-available. Upon weeks of use, I noticed that my dandruff had become significantly more prominent. Ahhhh yeah, I&#x27;ll go back to the other I was using (Nizoral) &lt;---- this product worked much better.</li>
    <li> Hi everyone,&lt;br /&gt;due to itchy scalp and pimples on my scalp I brought this product in Walmart for 6.99+tx,&lt;br /&gt;but still I want to leave a review over here.&lt;br /&gt;I read somewhere below this shampoo works well for similar problem I have, but it didn&#x27;t help me.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s been 3 weeks already I&#x27;m taking head bath with this shampoo daily, but still I had pimples coming back, may be because of too much body heat.</li>
    <li> Sometimes, somethings are worth the hype.&lt;br /&gt;This is truly one among them.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily scalp and dry ends, Selsun helped clear my dandruff in a week no joke.&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively thick frizzy and black hair.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone on the look out for a solution</li>
    <li> Works great, wish I had been using it all along. I&#x27;m kind of a salon brand snob, but this worked much better than all of the others. No more itching or flaking.</li>
    <li> Seems to work, but not a shampoo I would use more than once or twice a week. I usually trade off with Dove Shampoo because if I use the Selsun Blue too much it irritate my scalp.</li>
    <li> I used it for one month with bad smell on my hair. However, nothing change to the itching. It is not work as expected.</li>
    <li> many thanks to the good weather and excellent product fast and the product itself is seen by the portal luismer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item from another retailer but I had to do a review. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I have been dealing with Seborrheic Dermatitis for over a year. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun. From natural remedies to prescription shampoos. Nothing helped until Selsun Blue. It stopped the itch and the scaly dandruff. It&#x27;s not as drying as some of the other products but I still have to follow up with a good conditioner. But other than that it&#x27;s been great. I&#x27;m so happy with the results.</li>
    <li> its good product over all but it smells really bad after u take a shower need to work on its odor</li>
    <li> it works perfectly！after a week，there is nothing left on my pillow！</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by this product. My daughter&#x27;s skin is still the same . no changes. Very  very disappointed I hate this product&lt;br /&gt;Too disappointed</li>
    <li> Without a doubt the best shampoo to treat scalp acne.  Leaves hair a bit stiff, but can reasonably be handled by other conditioning products.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and was delighted to purchase it over the internet when my local store no longer stocked it. Other products, such as Head-and-shoulders to not work for me and cold tar products do not have the shampoo-like quality that Selsum Blue has.</li>
    <li> great shampoo..stops any itching or flaking within a couple of uses</li>
    <li> Helps keep my scalp from itching too much but must use on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Has not been long enough--will do a detail update in a few months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty demanding on shampoo.  In truth, if you like a good scalp scrubbing, this is the best product out there.  Now, for those looking for a more delicate experience, there are other products that might be best--but if you want a no nonsense deep hair cleaning, this is where its at.</li>
    <li> Works better than T-Gel or Head &amp; Shoulders any day!!</li>
    <li> After using this for a month I can say without a doubt it works.  I have always had dandruff and have gone through shampoos that rarely succeed at destroying my flakey friends but this did them in.  I use about a quarter sized drop of Selsun blue and lather it in my hair making sure to keep my showers under 5mins.  Doing this daily for the last month has taken care of my Dandruff problem all together.</li>
    <li> I do see a difference but the problem is I wash my hair once a week I feel like to see a change quicker you need to use it daily but it really does reduce the amount of dandruff I haven&#x27;t noticed any on my black shirts</li>
    <li> Left hair soft but not really fixing folliculitis</li>
    <li> I tried this at my boyfriend&#x27;s place when I ran out of my own stuff.  I was scared it would ravage my locks, but I loved it.  I have oily scalp and dandruff issues, and this soothes any itchiness in one use.  It also zaps oil like a charm.  I would be careful not to use it often (I use it twice a month), bc it may cause damage to your hair, as it is drying.  But for days when I want a deep, deep clean, this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> Seems to be effective but wish it could smell better and also wish the packaging didn&#x27;t look so much like toilet bleach.</li>
    <li> This keeps my stress induces eczema (on my scalp) in control. I find that with regular use (a couple times a week) keeps my me from having flair-ups. I almost don&#x27;t get any flair-ups now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite of all the Selsun Blue Shampoos. I like that it&#x27;s blue and I LOVE the menthol smell. The tingling sensation is wonderful too especially during the summer months--so refreshing and invigorating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like the color, smell, tingling, but still need to use Selsun Blue, get the one with the purple cap. It is a shampoo and conditioner in one and works just as well at controlling my stress exzema and is not as drying as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the best results from the medication, massage onto scalp and leave it in for a few minutes before rinsing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this on my dog when he has dermatitis flair-ups. This works great on the doggies, too. Just keep the shampoo out away from their faces.</li>
    <li> Selsun Blue Medicated Max Strength is just that, Maximum Strength! It works immediately and keeps itching at bay. It clears up flakes and smooths out the scalp. I would recomened this shampoo to anyone with dandruff and dry scalp.</li>
    <li> it was what i was looking for, thank you so much. it is a good product. thank you so much</li>
    <li> I have used Selsun Blue off and on for years, it works very well and doesn&#x27;t leave your scalp feeling dry. I don&#x27;t use this every time I shampoo. I use this most often during the winter months when my skin is drier and my scalp gets a bit itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m not too crazy about the smell so I usually mix a bit with our regular shampoo. I add a small bit of shampoo in my hand,  mix in some Selsun Blue, then wash. I then follow up with conditioner. This helps get rid of the strong medicine smell. My hair and scalp feel nice and clean after I use this.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for dandruff problem</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent service.</li>
    <li> OK, this has Selenium Sulfide 1% and works great! But the smell for me is unbearable! It smells like menthol cigerettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is an alternative: The Selsun Blue Medicated Dandruff Shampoo, Moisturizing with the green cap. It has the same amount of anti-dandruff Selenium Sulfide 1%, yet doesn&#x27;t smell that bad because the menthol isn&#x27;t in there. The green cap smells great and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you want your hair to have a strong smell of menthol, I highly recommend going with the moisturizing Selsun Blue(green cap) first. If the green cap doesn&#x27;t work, go to your dermatologists and get a prescription.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Fast shipment.</li>
    <li> Great price compared to what I get it for in my local beauty stores. Works for moderate dandruff and other dermatitis issues without having to break the bank at a Dermatologist.  Received on time.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that gets rid of my dandruff. It smells awful, so I only use it about once a weekS but it totally works!</li>
    <li> This medicated shampoo is far superior than any shampoo that I ever tried. I decided to use because of my dandruff (which is under control). It calms my naturally- curly. I leave it on for 5-10 minutes then rinse. I no longer hair flakes. After washing, my hair is easier to comb.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked in a chemistry lab with a fume hood. Every time I got near it, the exhaust fans yanked the shampoo&#x27;s terrible smell out of my hair and filled the fume hood with it. The smell didn&#x27;t have to be yanked out, though. The wind I created just just by turning my head was enough to get a terrible whiff. Once I stopped using this shampoo, the smell went away.</li>
    <li> I live in an apartment building and they delivered the first package to my building and laid the package against the front of the building door when they have access to get in. The 2nd package was dropped off at another building and never retrieved. Had to reorder and get a refund. Pharmafrog or the seller on here needs to ship USPS not this joke of a lasership who refuses to take any sort of customer service initiative and make sure addresses are delivered to or products arent left outside of massive apartment buildings.</li>
    <li> I had white stuff in my hair and it was driving me nuts, when I got this it totally cured me</li>
    <li> It is the best dandruff shampoo my husband tried ever. We do not live in the States but we always order Selsun blue for him. Nothing else help him with dandruff except Selsun blue. We will continue ordering this shampoo from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but I do not feel it is as advertised maximum strength dandruff shampoo. The original selsun is better.</li>
    <li> The best and fastest way to have dandruff free hair, i recommended it to my friends and after using it, they were all were all very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that for seemingly a decade I&#x27;ve had really bad dandruff (to the point where I would sometimes almost constantly itch/scratch and had a ton of flakes). It was so bad I swore off hats (even in the winter) because I hated the way it felt with my itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this for a couple weeks (every day) and it managed to get rid of it! I still use it, so I don&#x27;t know if it was a permanent fix or not, but solving what had been a long term problem earns my respect whether I have to continue using it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you use it every day (or every other day) for that first week or so, otherwise you might not notice a change. Initially it may seem to get worse, but keep at it for at least a couple weeks. It was well worth it!</li>
    <li> Great product - took less than one week to work.</li>
    <li> Bought the product on newspaper review that product can be used to&lt;br /&gt;treat rosacea.  Not sure if it is helping, but starting using as primary shampoo and&lt;br /&gt;it is great.  Cleans and feels good.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have a head full of thick hair an a beard, and I love to wear black. Not the best combo for dandruff. I got tired of my girlfriend brushing flakes off me all the time and decided to use this. It works awesome, I&#x27;m not finding any flakes these days.</li>
    <li> i just recieved my bottle but it was half empty so i was dissapointed hey but stuff happens sometimes i really want a refund or to send me a full one if thats possible</li>
    <li> Expensive but helps itchy scalp and skin for husband with ecezema-like skin.</li>
    <li> This was recommend by our doctors and It really works. It works better than the prescription shampoos that we used.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the recommendation of my dog groomer to use on my dog. Poor baby suffers from doggy eczema and I do think that this helped a little. I wound up getting another product through my vet (that was twice the price) but worked twice as well.</li>
    <li> I used Head and Shoulders clinical strength for approximately 5-10 years and just recently it hasn&#x27;t worked as well. I have been using this Selsun Blue Medicated Maximum Strength Dandruff shampoo for a little over a week now. It works great, however for some reason after washing the shampoo out of my hair and getting out of the shower, my hair becomes extremely stiff when trying to dry (almost as if hair gel were in it). I am a young guy with thick hair, but never had this problem with any other shampoo. I will continue to use it in hopes of possibly finding a solution not to make my hair stiff, since it seems to be working. I am rating this with 4 stars instead of 5, for the stiffness my hair now has to endure. If I find a solution to the hair stiffness, I will be sure to edit this review to help others out that may have this problem as well.</li>
    <li> My wife has used lot of Dandruff period over time . Selsun is good, but the best is Nizoral. In the dandruff hierarchy, see where you fit in .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mild Dandruff : [[ASIN:B001F51RNI Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean Dandruff Shampoo 23.7 Fl Oz (Pack of 2) (packaging may vary)]]&lt;br /&gt;Moderate  : Selsun Blue&lt;br /&gt;Heavy  : [[ASIN:B00EFM2SNG Nizoral A-D Anti-Dandruff Shampoo 7 Fl Oz, 200 ml]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a nature conservationist, just to let you know Selenium has a very long half life vs Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY TIPS FOR DANDRUFF CONTROL :  I have some experiences that might help dandruff sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you wash your hair regularly , with a regular shampoo or even plain water, You will be miles ahead of the rest. ( Google for the term \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; and it means small pieces of dead skin in a person&#x27;s hair. ) .  Many people that I know with dandruff reduce washing the hair because of increased hair loss, a by-product of Dandruff.  This is true, anything dead on your scalp is going to invite bacteria that will cause more hair loss. A clean scalp is always a better option to reduce hair loss and you are not going to avoid hair fall altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While drying the hair, be gentle with the way towel brushes the hair .You are not harvesting a carrot. Hair Roots are plugged in a soft fatty layer and that gets softer after exposed to warm  or hot water. If you go hard on it when wet, you will be ending with unwanted thinning and balding, which many blame it back to Dandruff and try to fix with [[ASIN:B0012BNVE8 Rogaine for Men Hair Regrowth Treatment, 5% Minoxidil Topical Aerosol, Easy-to-Use Foam, 2.11 Ounce, 3 Month Supply (Packaging May Vary)]]. Regular healthy habits like good Night Sleep ( use [[ASIN:B00F6WRVZY Fitbit Force Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Slate, Large]] to track), stress ,taking Multi Vitamins etc do  impact your hair  health. Dandruff and Sweat never mix. If you sweat, you wash .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again , I am not a dermatologist but a person in mid forties who is cured of dandruff and have no patch of baldness. I ought be doing something right !but a person in mid forties who is cured of dandruff and have no patch of baldness. I ought be doing something right !</li>
    <li> I use this as needed, and it works fairly quickly.  Recommended by the dermatologist.  Actually use it for rashes on my chest.</li>
    <li> Also keeps my tinnea versicolor from flaring up like it used to due to the medicine. Smells good after. I have close crop hair, and used to have a scalp that constantly looked sunburnt. This corrected that as well.</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly fast.  I couldn&#x27;t wait two days for it to ship so I ran out to Wal-Mart and picked this up.  There I was in the aisle sniffing dandruff shampoos to see which one of the three products I liked the best.  After reading reviews it came down to Neutrogena T/Gel, Head &amp; Shoulders Clinical Strength or Selsun Blue Medicated Max.  This one won by a landslide!  I actually like the smell and I Love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair with it and see if it worked.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  Once I lathered up, I left it on for a few minutes before thoroughly rinsing it out.  I immediately felt relief, the intense itching had vanished.  The shampoo is drying so I went ahead and used a conditioner, keeping it off my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later my head started to itch a little so I repeated the process.  Once again the itching went away and I saw no flakes once my hair was dry.  For good measure, I did this again two days later even though I experienced no itching and had no flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp is still flake free thanks to Selsun Blue!  This will definitely be my go to product for dandruff from now on!!  ☺  Debi B,</li>
    <li> This stuff really, really works. My dandruff was bad -- I&#x27;d leave flurries on the equipment in the gym, you could see it on my clothes, etc. It&#x27;s been this way for years, and nothing I&#x27;d tried prior had been much help, so I figured I was stuck. The Selsun Blue cleared it up almost entirely in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people mind the smell. To me, it&#x27;s neither good nor bad, but certainly not offensive. Basically, it smells very much like toothpaste. Not something I&#x27;d normally rub in my hair, but also not something that lingers after I get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had dandruff in 20 years. 20 years ago I started using Selsun blue every few days. It was really as simple as that.</li>
    <li> I had really a bad condition for dandruff and tried different shampoo but no one worked , so one day I was searching online and read about selsun blue and I ordered this and let me tell you that this worked amazingly.make sure u use it twice a week it is a magic product</li>
    <li> I think the best way to rate a product is to compare it to other products. This is the best product I have used out of the following:&lt;br /&gt;*  Head &amp; Shoulders&lt;br /&gt;*  Tom Mitchell Dandruff Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;*  Biolage Dandruff Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is based on personal results. The smell of the product may not be the best out of the three above but it certainly isn&#x27;t the worst. The scent is okay for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products I have not tried: Nizoral.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really feel the cool sensation on my scalp when using this shampoo. I don&#x27;t know why. But I wish it had a better smell and the liquid looks horrible lol I only used it twice so far I haven&#x27;t seen any dandruff. The main reason I bought it was because I had a lot of dandruff on the front of my hair and that&#x27;s because I blow dry my hair a lot especially in the front because of my bangs.</li>
    <li> Works only on day used. Does not provide long term relief from itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> i have psorisis on my scalp sometimes. and this stuff is the only thing that really works for that. there are definitely different types of dandruff. If you simply have dry skin, this may not be it for you, but if you get scales and red patches, this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;I dont use it daily, just when i need it, it clears the break up pretty quickly and is soothing.</li>
    <li> I have had sores and itching on my scalp for about a year. I believe it started when I dyed my hair red and I had a reaction to the red dye. My doctor told me to use some medicated shampoo like Neutrogena T/Gel, but the itching did not go away. I consulted a dermatologist as now my scalp was not only itching but I was also getting sores. I took several pharmaceutical medications for scalp problems, but none helped. On my last visit to this doctor it was suggested that I use Selsun Blue every other day together with other medicated shampoos and the pharmaceutical medication that the doctor prescribed. I was astonished as to how soothing this shampoo was. To make a long story short I went on to see another specialist who prescribed different medicine together with medicated shampoo, like Selsun Blue, which I began to use every day. The doctor said that using this shampoo everyday was fine. The sores are now more or less gone but I still use Selsun Blue almost everyday. I still feel its soothing effect. I feel a coolness on my scalp and my hair is nice and smooth and in very good condition.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I read online it helps with Tinea Versicolor, which I have pretty badly on my chest and shoulders. I was putting it on overnight and sleeping in it...but BIG mistake. It ended up burning my skin. Now, I put it on my skin and wash it right off in the shower every other day or so. I think it has helped keep my tinea versicolor from spreading, and since I have started this regime, the spots aren&#x27;t has prominent. I am not healed by any means but I intend on always having this and using it every couple of days in the show just as a maintenance.</li>
    <li> Maybe if you have industrial strength dandruff, you might need this.  I had to give up using it and switched to their product with aloe and moisturizers for the scalp.  It took a while but I think it may be back under control before I decided to try another brand.  I will say this is the only brand I&#x27;ve ever found to work for me but you may have to try several different formulas.</li>
    <li> Used to help stop Tina Versa Colors along with the soap  it worked</li>
    <li> It works well, and you need to wash your hair every other day so keep dandruff away. When you stop, it will come back.</li>
    <li> I was having some serious dandruff problems when I first moved to NorCal. I think it was because of the change of environment, diet, more exposure to sunshine and the fact that it was fall. I looked up online and saw many recommendations for this product. First couple times after I used it, the dandruff got worse. It was reaching the point that I had to used hair brush to clean my scalp. But I didn&#x27;t want to over-wash my hair because my roots were pretty dry and damaged because of dyeing and curling. It got better after a week or so and kept improving. I then started to alternate with my regular shampoo in the second month and stopped using it when the dandruff got under control since I don&#x27;t have to read the ingredients to know that strong products are not for regular frequent use. I used it for about two months and still have two thirds of the bottle now. Been sitting in the bathroom for another month or two since I stopped using it. So, could probably have just bought a smaller one. (Don&#x27;t know if they have it.)</li>
    <li> cleared up my Sun spot rash in a few days</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to say if the shampoo is helping or it&#x27;s diet and other things in life, but it does appear to be less flakes. Hard to have any definitive evidence but I think it&#x27;s an improvement. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on January 9, 2012. The product never arrived within the stated time and customer service failed to provide any replies or assistance concerning the missing product. It finally arrived... TODAY (August 14, 2012). All I can say is wow.. This is simply beyond ridiculously poor service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the product is quite good be aware that you may not receive it for upwards of half a year and they likely will not reply to any attempt to contact their customer service.</li>
    <li> Refreshing. I tried using it for bumps on my scalp, but it didnt work. It is still a dandruff fighter though.</li>
    <li> works till it turns green nasty colors out of no where when the expiration date wasn&#x27;t even close to expiring.</li>
    <li> I have recurring issues with scalp itch every winter. Last year I had a Garnier shampoo I loved which is now discontinued. This season when my issues started up again and I couldn&#x27;t find the Garnier shampoo I settled for a Head and Shoulders shampoo with the same zinc ingredient that the Garnier had as it&#x27;s active ingredient. Well Head and Shoulders wasn&#x27;t working at all for me and my itching was increasing. I&#x27;ve now been using Selsun Blue for about 6 weeks. Selsun Blue has a nice smell over top of a really gross chemical smell sometimes as my day progresses I will smell the nice smell, which resembles the smell of a man&#x27;s bar soap like Irish spring. But often I get a whiff of the under smell which reminds me of Neutragena&#x27;s T-gel. Selsun Blue is a step up from smelling T-gel all day but since I sometimes get a whiff I am self conscious that other people can smell it as well so I only use it on  days when I predict that I&#x27;ll be doing less activities (work, shopping, outings) out and about with the general public. I can only use Selsun Blue for about 3 days in a row before it actually starts making my head feel burny. So I use it a few days and then d/c use and use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner combo, usually by Pantene or Clear, on the days I don&#x27;t us SB. My issues aren&#x27;t sompletely cleared up but less severe and so far it&#x27;s worked the best I anticipate by Summer my head should no longer be itchy as that&#x27;s my usual pattern. This year&#x27;s winter has been especially hard on the condition of my scalp and skin. I&#x27;m thankful I&#x27;ve found this formula of SB. When I bought this SB I also got a bottle of T-gel which I haven&#x27;t tpuched because I dread the smell. I lost the receipt so I can&#x27;t return it. It says it expires in 2015 so I&#x27;ll use it if I finish my SB.</li>
    <li> Wow love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my poor dad who had bad dandruff issues and&lt;br /&gt;it all went away after using this product!</li>
    <li> Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Used it on my son. What can I say? It just worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before we used it we tried head &amp; shoulders which had absolutely no effect what so ever.</li>
    <li> You will smell like a medicine cabinet, but this stuff does work, even on my hard-to-treat dandruff and dry scalp.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dog who has a skin condition. Its a great product and the best medicated  shampoo.on the market</li>
    <li> I had this really ugly skin discoloration on my body. It turned out to be a common skin fungus. I HATED how it looked so my doctor recommended this. I rub it on my body and let it dry for 5-10 minutes then wash it off in the shower. My skin is now evenly colored and back to normal (it took about 3 weeks). This is a blessing.</li>
    <li> Am pleased with the results, as well as pricing. Had developed dry scalp as a result of some medication I was taking, and nothing seemed to be helping. Tried various oils and things that were difficult to apply, high priced shampoos, etc, no relief.  Selsun was very soothing and made a difference within a day or two of using it. I now cycle it with regular shampoo every week or so and things are going well. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> 20 years 7 dermatologist  steroid creams and pills that damaged my skin and now a Dr who finally got it right skin fungas he prescribed Lamisille pills that broke me out in a bad rash.I look to the Internet and found selsun blue I got immediate relief and my rash is already healing overnight thank god for this product.</li>
    <li> Wowzer the smell is kind of strong but it feels great on your head.  Smell took some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought this to the salon when they washed and massaged my head and it felt great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than feeling great, definitely worked for my dandruff.  Other shampoos don&#x27;t seem to have a lasting effect.  Like I would forget to bring it on a business trip and my head would be dandruff-y in a few days.  After using this for a month, even if I forget to bring a dandruff shampoo, my head remains dandruff-free for much longer when I just used the hotel shampoo.</li>
    <li> Although the product was packaged securely with plenty of bubble wrap, the shampoo leaked out of its container top.  There is no adhesive/foiled covering on the top which many products have now.  Therefore, there was the \\&quot;black\\&quot; shampoo throughout the box and some of the product was lost.</li>
    <li> I broke out with red blotches and patches on my body one summer and could not figure out what it was. It didn&#x27;t itch like most rashes so it was difficult to ascertain what it was until I went on the internet and did some research. Long story short, I figured it out it was tinea versicolor, which is a fungal infection that is treatable with the use of selenium sulfide. The active ingredient in this Selsun Blue is selenium sulfide. I began rubbing it on the parts that I had broken out and after a week or so I noticed that it started to go away. So if you have tinea versicolor, definitely give this a try before you go to a doctor. May save you a lot of time and money.</li>
