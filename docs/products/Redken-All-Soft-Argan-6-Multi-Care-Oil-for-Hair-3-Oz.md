      <li>There are two items I have found EVER that make my hair look really shiny and bouncy, very healthy!</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really love it.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.  </li>
      <li>But Amazon requires more words for a post.  </li>
      <li>Love Love this</li>
      <li>If your hair is frizzy, really frizzy, like mine, this is a great product for you.  </li>
      <li>This not only smells wonderful</li>
      <li>Yet another product that I fell in love with and my salon stopped carrying.  </li>
      <li>Ive searched for a perfect product such as this</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I will buy more soon.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>From bugs to branches and thorns and this product keeps my hair healthy and shiny and also helps to lessen the damage caused by breakage.</li>
      <li>love this stuff</li>
      <li>The price on amazon is way better then at a salon.</li>
      <li>I wanted healthy sheen, luster with movement on highlighted, processed hair.</li>

      <li>Thank  You :)</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>nothing better than this oil to fix your hair</li>
      <li>-- it&#x27;s the best conditioning product I&#x27;ve used in long time.</li>
      <li>Many Argan products are too strongly scented.</li>
      <li>I use it before I blow dry, just a pump will do and it gives my a wonderful shine without a greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>Best applied on absolutely dry hair, so you don&#x27;t over do it.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair very soft, not frizzy, great shine and manageable.</li>
      <li>Shine and smoothing, but clean with movement!</li>
      <li>And it makes it so much nicer to have it delivered at a fair price to my doorstep.</li>
      <li>This is truly the best available oil on the market for dry, frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like anything with a strong fragrance</li>
      <li>so it lays flat, adds shine and softness, and smells good too!  </li>
      <li>I have wavy, fine hair with lots of density.  </li>
      <li>This product is really light and works even on my fine, easily weighed-down hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and can get frizzy and def.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, makes hair shiny and fizz free, keep your hair super hydrated.</li>
      <li>Just a little drop produces wonderful results!  </li>
      <li>so smooth, shiny and manageable.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this product in the hopes that it would help my hair regain shine and smoothness and manageability and I am very happy to say I am a fan! My hair is down to the middle of my back, very thick, curly hair that is always unmanageable and frizzy and not soft. I put this in when my hair was damp before I straightened it with my Chi Air. Let me tell you I am very pleased. I would recommend this to anyone with thick curly hair. It does what it is supposed to and is worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is great for use with flat irons.  It leaves your hair soft and silky.  Formula is very lightweight and the smell is not strong.</li>
    <li> I have used all soft argan-6 for a couple of years now and just love it. When I go get my hair cut they always say. WOW!! your hair is so soft.  I tell them that I am shocked because I bleach my hair. This stuff works well with my hair due to all the damage I do to my hair with dying it.</li>
    <li> What was Redken thinking with this pump bottle??  The nozzle needs to be a lot longer.  I love the oil but squirting it out of the bottle is a royal messy pain!  C&#x27;mon Redken.....for this price you can do better!</li>
    <li> I added platinum to my hair the last time I had it colored so it&#x27;s a bit dry, I put it on my hair every night before bed, it has helped immensely. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so sliky. I recommended the product to many of my friends with thick hair and everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I put a couple of pumps in my wet hair after I shower and it helps calm and smooth my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have for me! I work in an environment that&#x27;s extremely taxing on my hair. From bugs to branches and thorns and this product keeps my hair healthy and shiny and also helps to lessen the damage caused by breakage. I would recommend to everywoman who is rough on their hair</li>
    <li> This product is nothing shot of miraculous. My hair is very dry and for lack of a better term poofy. I wanted to grow my hair out and try a longer hair style. I use to have to gel the crap out of it to get it to lay down. This would produce a gelmitt effect and after some time continued use of the product was damaging my hair. Enter Argon Oil.... Now I condition in the shower and after my hair is completely dry I apply about 8 pumps of oil and brush it in. My hair is softer than it&#x27;s ever been and it&#x27;s wonderfully controllable.  My wife loves my soft hair so much more than the gelmitt I use to rock. If your hair is dry and unmanageable give this Argan Oil a try.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair nice and soft. I always use it after I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I did not end up using this product as when I received it and read all the harmful sounding ingredients I sent it back. I had been unable to read the ingredients on the Amazon site. They were not listed under the ingredients tab. I would not have ordered it if I had read what was in it. A hairdresser used it on me after she cut my hair and it seemed nice enough and gave a nice shine, so I thought I would try it. I have already sent it back so cannot remember all the ingredients, but it was not just argan oil and/or other natural ingredients but many chemicals as well, including alcohol, which is known to be drying. I found a similar product with no alcohol and not as many chemicles for much cheaper at Wallgreens drug store and it works as well as the Redken product as I remember the hair dresser using on me. I think the ingredients in the &amp;#34;Hollywood Beauty&amp;#34; Argan Oil Hair Treatment from Morocco Alcohol Free are no worse than the Redken product, with the same Dimethicone, etc. that makes your hair smooth and shinney, but it is around $5.00 for 3 oz as compaired to what $18.00 for the Redken product. Compair the ingredients yourself. The cheaper products works as well and at least does not have drying alcohol.</li>
    <li> Redken All Soft Argan Oil is fantastic!  I have my hair colored regularly, have highlights, and I go swimming a lot, plus I blow-dry my hair daily. As a result..my hair can become very dry and brittle.  However... I have discovered this wonderful hair product.... Redken Argan Oil!  It keeps my hair looking soft, shiny and healthy.  Just a little drop produces wonderful results!  Thanks for a product  that works great!</li>
    <li> I have dry, fairly course hair.  I put this in after a shower.  It makes my hair a bit shiny, a bit more soft (less dry and unruly), and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Product is awesome for my hair. Recommend argan oil to anyone who wants to get their hair in condition and keep it that way.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It lasts such a long time. I have horrible hair from different medical problems and I have used so many different products. I love this one the best!</li>
    <li> I just put it on after I blow dry my hair and it seems to calm the frizzies and keep my hair from appearing dry and lifeless.  I only shampoo every 3 days because of my age, but it keeps my hair looking good during that time.</li>
    <li> Have used this for a long time.  It can work miracles.</li>
    <li> It made my hair look dirty no matter how much I used. the bottle even said to put it on dry hair..I would hate to see what that looks like</li>
    <li> This is the best Argan oil I have tried so far.  It works wonders on my dry hair, and ends.  It&#x27;s also great to use as an overnight conditioner.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this because of the price and the size of the bottle, but when a close friend who works in a premier Salon  recommended it to me, with my bleached, dried out, dyed hair. After the first use, my hair looks totally different. It&#x27;s softer than it has ever been before. I highly HIGHLY recommend this product. Worth the money!!! Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! My hairdresser friend gave me a bottle of this as a gift and I swear I will never buy another oil. Totally worth the price, the first bottle has lasted me almost a year.</li>
    <li> This product does tame the flyaways without making my hair look greasy.  Not a miracle oil, but I like it.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product. I can&#x27;t be without it ever! I always have a good hair day now.&lt;br /&gt;You just need a little to make your hair smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> I put this in my hair at least once a day - if not more.  I cannot live without it.  And it makes it so much nicer to have it delivered at a fair price to my doorstep.</li>
    <li> I have wavy, fine hair with lots of density.  Keeping it under control in DC heat and humidity is a challenge, as is preventing damage from daily flat iron use.  This product is amazing!  I have shiny and sleek hair every day.  While it may seem expensive, it lasts for months.  Lightly scented too.  Many Argan products are too strongly scented.</li>
    <li> Did you know that argan oils.are made from goat poop?but it works you know. And i love it.</li>
    <li> It s a really thick oil,you need to use just a little bit but it smells great and works on dry ,damaged hair ,I would give a 5 star but they make the pump so short and creates a little mess in your hands and on the bottle !</li>
    <li> This argan oil is great for my hair. I know it&#x27;s not in the salons anymore but it still works great and what&#x27;s even better is you don&#x27;t have to buy the $60 diamond oil ( same exact thing). The first bottle lasted me 2 years so it&#x27;s very practical for use.</li>
    <li> My husband thinks it the BEST!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so amazing! One drop was all I used and I was really impressed with the results. Everywhere I went (the first day I used it) people stopped me to say how gorgeous my hair was. Applied to ends and worked up to bottom 3rd of hair when wet. Made combing easier. Rusults in shiny, less frizzy, less static, softer hair. Doesn&#x27;t weight my fine hair down. Hair still took a curl.</li>
    <li> This product is a must if you have thick, coarse hair.  Using this product , along with Redken Diamond Oil Shampoo and Conditioner, has finally made my hair soft and not frizzy.  Even in this Texas heat, no frizzies!  And that is a first for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my aging, thinning hair which needed something to make it look alive again.  This not only smells wonderful I put it on my face when I am putting it on my hair.  Fabulous product.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and I use it each time I wash my hair.  I am not sure it will be the answer to all your hair problems, but it keeps my course hair a bit softer.</li>
    <li> My hair looks fuller and shiny! Love it! You only have to use a dime shaped drop so it will last forever, too.</li>
    <li> My whole family loves this product.. I ordered this as a birthday present from my mom because I work a lot &amp; am unable to really go out shopping. But when I received my order, the box &amp; product were damaged. I was too embarrassed to give a damaged bottle as a present.  I contacted the company, and they let me know they would issue a refund. Still haven&#x27;t heard back from them, and it&#x27;s been quite a while.. Not happy, and I will not be ordering from this company again.</li>
    <li> This item is very very good.  It&#x27;s lightweight and it really makes the hair shiny and it&#x27;s great for brittle hair.  You have to put just a small amount.</li>
    <li> Redkin all Soft Argan-6 Multi-Care oil is perfect and was what I was looking for.  Hair smell GOOD and they are more manageable. Thank  You :)</li>
    <li> A bottle lasts a LONG time on my shoulder-length hair, but as soon as the last bottle was gone, my hair started crying for more.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all in humid weather. Usually redden products have a great scent but this one has none. Stick to Moroccan oil</li>
    <li> Makes your hair feel really soft and healthy. The only down side is that the pump in the bottle doesn&#x27;t reach to the bottom.</li>
    <li> I love this oil to tame my frizzies.  I don&#x27;t like anything with a strong fragrance so was very happy that this oil is very lightly scented.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist recommended this and he is a big Redken fan. I use this on my long hair on the ends after washing and it works great. I can tell a big difference when i forget to use it. Helps alot with dry ends and makes my hair shiny and very soft.</li>
    <li> I use this product along with the All Soft shampoo and conditioner to keep frizz tamged and protect my already damaged hair when heat styling. After I shampoo and condtion I massage a quarter size amount down the mid-shaft and ends of my hair before blow drying with a paddle brush. It gives my hair a glossy finish.</li>
    <li> Yeah!  Love this product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> seems to coat hair but not actually strengthen it long term or condition it</li>
    <li> I have VERY dry hair and skin. There are two items I have found EVER that make my hair look really shiny and bouncy, very healthy! This little bottle of Argan oil is the less costly of the two, and so, gets my vote.</li>
    <li> Hair oil products for sleek, glossy, healthy hair have vastly improved in recent days, but may still leave an \\&quot;oily\\&quot; look that often weighs down hair leaving it flatter, \\&quot;greasy,\\&quot; dirty looking. I wanted healthy sheen, luster with movement on highlighted, processed hair. When my stylist recommended the ARGAN-6 oil sample, we looked at the 6 claims - all great- but was a tad leary of it&#x27;s suggested weightlessness. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a \\&quot;styling\\&quot; product, I wanted life and luster back with youthful active movement.  After using some of the \\&quot;best,\\&quot; most expensive products on market, I can honestly say ARGAN-6  is the very best at meeting it&#x27;s claims &amp; giving me exactly what I wanted &amp; needed. Fully absorbs, but weightless! Shine and smoothing, but clean with movement! I&#x27;m not saying it automatically \\&quot;heals\\&quot; dry, brittle hair, but it does make a drastic improvement in appearance as it says. The side benefit is that with regular routine usage, the hair doesn&#x27;t just look healthier, it is healthier in my, my stylist&#x27;s and complimenters&#x27; opinions.

    <li> First off, I guess I will explain my hair. I have naturally straight brown hair,but because I blow dry it and straighten it every day it has frizzy at the top that are quite annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this I was actually curling my hair for an event I was going to. Curling it with the straight iron and it came out frizzy and not what I wanted. I pulled out this argan oil and put a tiny bit on my palm, and applied it to my hair. It instantly began to calm the frizzies and make my hair look healthy and shiny. I continued to curl my hair with a curling iron and if it started to get frizzy I just put a dab of it in my hair again. It made my hair soft, shiny and no frizz. I was really pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, even after washing my hair and drying it, it still felt more soft than normal and I believe it is because of this oil. Now, I use it after I blow dry my hair and straighten it to tame the frizz. I just put a little in my palm, rub it a round a bit and lightly smooth it into my hair. And, it makes my hair look nice, it hasn&#x27;t made it look oily or anything, but I never put in too much. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my wet hair yet but I like using it on my dry hair.</li>
    <li> The oil in the package is the real deal and works perfectly- the question I have is, is the bottle a defect? Instead of spraying out, the oil drips out...Otherwise, good product and great shipping.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best available oil on the market for dry, frizzy hair. Sure, it&#x27;s pricey, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s very much worth it. One small bottle will last at least a few months. I got great results from using Redken&#x27;s All Soft shampoo and conditioner, at least every other day, with this oil... I read a previous review on this product and it was very negative... My hair has been through so many chemical processes (including bleach) that I can&#x27;t even count, as well as went through years of biotherapy treatments, similar to chemotherapy, that caused me to lose about half of the hair on my head, and when it grew back in, very frizzy, I didn&#x27;t know what to do, but this product definitely helped me out. I don&#x27;t have the time or the patience to use a flat iron every day, and I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer, either... This product is great to pass through damp hair and allow to air dry. It&#x27;s also great for the many other uses listed on the bottle/box.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great to help avoid static in my fine hair during the winter months. I use one pea size drop along with mouse and then blow dry and style as usual. It does not leave any residue or buildup and keeps my hair soft and static free.</li>
    <li> I like to work this into my hair just right after I use the hair dryer and hair straightener (I use Chi hair straightener).  Result: looks sleek, shiny and supple.  No greasy look at all.</li>
    <li> Did not smell very good.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT ON MY HAIR</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have long fine naturally curly hair which is a bit dry and broken in places, noticed results after second use.  Tames broken hair so it lays flat, adds shine and softness, and smells good too!  It darkened my hair color a bit.  Only use a couple drops and work thru hair, then a couple more and work on the ends. It&#x27;s an oil so use as highly concentrated product! Received earlier than stated also.</li>
    <li> Love this for my hair! Gives hair a great shine without the oily look.no frizz winter and summer! Must buy</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be the solution to my stupid hair problem. I have naturally blonde, fine, yet course hair. It is brittle, and no matter how much I style it, it always looks bad.  I bought this product  in  desperation, as no matter how much I styled my hair before, nothing ever helped. The first time I used it, I rubbed it into my hair before blow drying. It helped a little, making m hair a little softer.   Of course, the next couple of time I used it, my hair went right back to its normal crappy state. Pissed off, I took it back to the store and got a refund for it. I then bought a $4 got2b blow dry/flat iron spray in an orange bottle. Let me tell you, it works ALOT better than this expensive crap ever did.   Moral of the story is, if I&#x27;m gonna spend $30 on a hair product in a tiny bottle, it BETTER be consistent. This did not live up to my expectations at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Leaves my hair soft and smooth without making it greasy. You can use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> I use this after my hair is towel dried. Put 3-4 squirts into palm of hand, rub together then apply to hair. I have very thick long hair and it makes it soooo much easier to brush through and blow dry. My hairdresser asked what product I was using in my hair because it was so soft!</li>
    <li> Love Love this, It&#x27;s the BEST BEST, I buy 2 bottles at a time, I put at the ends of my hair and It looks so shiny n healthy, by far the best, I&#x27;ve tried many &amp; this Is the winner</li>
    <li> My hair has received a quintuple whammy of damage-- 1) poor nutrition has caused brittle, dry, thin hair,  2) genetics have caused dry, brittle, thin hair,  3) coloring has caused brittle, dry, damaged hair,  4) poor habits of exposing my hair to hot water daily has caused brittle, dry, thin hair,  and 5) wearing my hair in a ponytail has caused it to break off in spots.  In other words, my hair is in bad shape.  It is extraordinarily dry and brittle, and is so damaged that it is a ball of frizz almost all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried just about every product under the sun trying to repair the damage, or at least to prevent further damage.  In fact, my bathroom looks like a hair salon-- I have six different shampoos, nine different conditioners, and three different deep treatments in my shower, plus a vanity under which I must have no fewere than thirty different bottles, jars, or cans of products meant to protect or repair my hair.  Few have done much of anything, but the line of Redken All Soft products, in particular the Argan-6 oil, has made a difference in the appearance of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my hair, I generally towel dry it and then let it air dry for about 10-15 minutes before I rub five pumps of Redken All Soft Argan-6 oil into my just-below-the-shoulder-length hair.  I then let my hair air dry completely.  The Argan-6 oil allows my hair to air dry without become frizzy, and also allows my natural waves to be enhanced instead of being the catalyst for frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I want to flat-iron my hair (which I do not do very often due to the degree of damage my hair already has), I rub another two or three pumps of Redken All Soft Argan-6 oil through my hair.  It helps protect my hair from the heat of my flat iron, and adds an additional element of shine to my dry, brittle, damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redken All Soft Argan-6 oil has minimal scent, but does have a very slight \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent that enhances the yummy scent the remainder of the line has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redken All Soft Argan-6 oil is an oil, but it is a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; oil, which means it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair LOOKING oily at all.  I use A LOT (five to eight pumps per day), and my hair still doesn&#x27;t look oily at all.  I DO NOT apply it to the hair near my scalp, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redken All Soft Argan-6 oil is pricey compared to some other similar products, but it is a far superior product to its look-alikes.  It is a dry oil that SOFTENS hair, but does not weight it down, that de-frizzes hair, but that does not lacquer hair in silicone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would hightly recommend this product to anyone who has seriously damaged hair, as I do.  It works well!</li>
    <li> I have VERY thick hair that has a mind of it&#x27;s own.  This is a great product that manages to keep all of my flyaways down so my hair looks smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> I tried this when a friend recommended it to me, and it worked so well I immediately had to buy it. It&#x27;s not the most natural product, and I do try to buy super natural products, but I checked it on EWG and it doesn&#x27;t have anything TOO bad. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for my hair because I struggle with split ends, and I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works like this. I really like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, because fragrances can be irritating to me. This product is really light and works even on my fine, easily weighed-down hair. With just a tiny drop the results are really noticeable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little thick, so take care to not apply too much. Best applied on absolutely dry hair, so you don&#x27;t over do it. Smells lovely too! And really takes care of frizz.</li>
    <li> Oil is expensive but worth it. Likes how it makes my hair soft and keeps it healthy. Recommend if you color your hair or need repair. Does not make hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, but it is hard to find in salons. I use a little in my hair before blow drying to add shine. any residue on my hands, I rub into my hands and arms. This is a miracle oil.</li>
    <li> Great smell, it leaves hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> really works  and emells like a very clean hair&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;my hair with this oil is renowned</li>
    <li> I bought this product while abroad in England. I didn&#x27;t take my Moroccan Oil with me because every time I took it on a plane, the bottle leaked. Fortunately I always packed it in a sealed baggie, but it was ridiculous that such an expensive product got wasted at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now used Redken Argan -6 for six months and I won&#x27;t go back to Moroccan Oil. Not only is it less expensive, but it has a much less strong scent. I liked the Moroccan Oil scent, but it was mildly irritating. I am allergic to many hair conditioners, but Redken argan oil doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems somewhat less heavy. Since I cannot wash my hair daily because I have very dry skin, it is important that hair products aren&#x27;t too oily. This leaves my hair silky without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Redken keeps making it -- it&#x27;s the best conditioning product I&#x27;ve used in long time.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and it is very dry on the ends.  This oil is wonderful! I  rub it on the ends only and it leaves my hair soft and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Its ok but I don&#x27;t really love it. It seems pretty heavy for my hair, I like using good old fashioned coconut oil better.</li>
    <li> I bought this recently and LOVE it. I have used/loved the All Soft Redken line for years, so when I saw they had a product comparable to the Moroccan oils of this world, I was eager to try it. I&#x27;m female/mid 30s/and color my hair every few months - so I need the moisture. My hair is fine and can get frizzy and def. dried out from processing and hot treatments/straightening etc. Anyway - it works great. Leaves my hair very soft, not frizzy, great shine and manageable. Thanks Redken!</li>
    <li> This oil is GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use it on dry hair-- when I want to take the frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is non greasy.  I just pump a small amount in my hands- rub together and run through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the price- the bottle should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased the whole All Soft line and next to the chemistry shots, this is my favorite product! I love what it does to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no frizzies and my hair looks sleek, polished and hydrated. I use several pumps but I have long (dyed) blonde hair so I always use quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its got several uses but I usually put it in after the leave in spray or after drying.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference this product makes on my hair...so smooth, shiny and manageable.  I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Uhm.. All I can say is that I am like so happy with this product my hair feels so soft, it doesn&#x27;t tangle and its not dry and brittle. Ive searched for a perfect product such as this and i am so happy that i found it! All I can say is that this is the best product for my hair and i am so glad I found this! My hair is like totally been damaged by constant dyeing and this product saved my hair! I LOVE IT! its not soft and supple .. And it doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down.. I will definitely going to buy this product again! ILOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is  alittle too heavy for my hair.  I can only use very little or it seems to weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> nothing better than this oil to fix your hair</li>
    <li> SHHH I use it on my hands and face too...</li>
    <li> Took a chance and ordered this.  Boy am I happy I did.  Best thing that happened to my hair in years!</li>
    <li> Yet another product that I fell in love with and my salon stopped carrying.  I use it before I blow dry, just a pump will do and it gives my a wonderful shine without a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you supposed to receive. Redken have everything you need to make your hair feel healthy. Excellent choose. 100% recommended.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;sprayer&amp;#34; did not spray, just a glob of oil would leak out and get all over my hand. The box the product was in (not the outer Amazon box) was all beat up and the bottle itself was cheaply made, which led me to suspect that the product was counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil inside was cloudy. Maybe it is supposed to be (I&#x27;ve never used this product before, so can&#x27;t say), but I&#x27;ve never seen a cloudy argan oil product before, so I suspect it was spoiled/contaminated. I was afraid to even put on my hair, so maybe it was a good thing the sprayer didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threw it out and will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This hair oil works very well in helping hair cuticle maintenance. My hair is brittle from coloring. This product helped me in my efforts to prevent breakage and frizzing.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my long hair. We used it for my daughter&#x27;s hair, too. I will buy more soon. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Overall I like this product. If you use to much it does tend to make hair feel a little greasy. I use just a few squirts for my shoulder length hair and  it keeps it well conditioned. The price on amazon is way better then at a salon.</li>
    <li> a little too slick at times</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel soft and silky--I use JUST one or two drops, amazing</li>
    <li> What else can I say!  But Amazon requires more words for a post.  I found the smell too strong, but I have a sensitive nose,</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders and really makes your hair nice and soft!</li>
    <li> Only pil treatment I&#x27;ll ever use</li>
    <li> It was one of the better thing ever buying this product.</li>
    <li> use it on my hair and skin. love this stuff</li>
    <li> Love this product. It smells really good and makes your house feel so soft. Would definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, and in winter when it&#x27;s dry, it looks like I constantly have my finger in a light socket.  This oil does seem to help a little bit, and it makes my hair even more soft than it already was.  However, it&#x27;s very hard to apply evenly.  Either I don&#x27;t have enough on and it&#x27;s fuzz-city or I put too much on and my bangs clump together and make me look unwashed.</li>
    <li> Good for shine and moisture. I still prefer the Macadamia hair serum though, which does what this one does, only better</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, makes hair shiny and fizz free, keep your hair super hydrated. This is a must have for wavy/curly haired folks</li>
    <li> This is the best product, ever. I use it every day, it does not make your hair feel oily or unable to style because of oil. I use it right before I blow dry and it works, every time. My only complaint would be the seller. It still hasn&#x27;t arrived at my house and I ordered it quite a while ago.</li>
    <li> the only product I buy now.  I put this on my naturally wavy long hair right after showering and let air dry.  no more frizzies!  Love the smell.  Such a great product.</li>
    <li> This arrived quicky and was the real deal. I really like this stuff. Its lightly scented, never makes my hair greasy, and smooths it out. I knocked off a star because a 5 star would make my damaged hair look like new. This ALMOST does that. Almost!</li>
    <li> Wow! This is the best hair product I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Redken, but this one tops them all.  If your hair is frizzy, really frizzy, like mine, this is a great product for you.  When I use this oil, I don&#x27;t even have to flatiron or blow out my hair.  I just smooth it in my damp hair and go.  It isn&#x27;t too heavy for my fine hair, yet it smooths the frizz and gives it great shine. I rarely review products, but this one is so awesome, I felt compelled to do so.  Great buy!</li>
