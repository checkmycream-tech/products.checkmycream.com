### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I Am Very Happy With This!</li>
      <li>Great job Jergens!</li>
      <li>But I gave it 3.5 stars for trying and I will continue to use it on my legs and hope for the best!</li>
      <li>LOL!)</li>
      <li>I have used BB creams and CC creams on my face, so I know that there is a bit of a learning-curve with getting the color perfect.</li>
      <li>My skin tone is best described as a tannish olive  color.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something to give my skin a pick me up during winter months and this was perfect.  </li>
      <li>and it just gives my skin that flawless look</li>
      <li>This lotion is wonderful!  </li>
      <li>My wife loves this stuff - Amazon has the best price anywhere!</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s not the best we&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Have a good one!</li>
      <li>Great cream, and smells good too!</li>
      <li>If you want tan skin then use the self tanners, they work great.</li>
      <li>I love this BB!!</li>
      <li>my skin looks amazing!  </li>
      <li>Amazing!  </li>
      <li>This cream was great for darker skin tones and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>provide superior hydration</li>
      <li>And it is surprisingly moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>But it is a good moisturizer for the body.</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for an effective moisturizing body cream that does have some good results I would recommend this just remember like all good things you must be patient and it won&#x27;t work in 5 days.</li>
      <li>I put it on my legs right after shaving, and it is perfect for that.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I bought this based on a reccomendation from a friend and I am glad I got it!</li>
      <li>either way, i love this product!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth, even and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>i love this product!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product...</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>nice.</li>
      <li>I actually kind of like it</li>
      <li>It worked to give me a nice glowy tan look --</li>
      <li>Evens out my skin tone nicely</li>
      <li>On the one hand, summer is coming and I will start wearing clothes that show my arms and legs and a product that makes them look better has to be a good thing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Like the smell of this BB Body cream and it does leave a nice sheen.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell and a nice smooth texture when applying.  </li>
      <li>As for the color, it was more of rose beige foundation color ... not a sunkissed, tanned look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a hint of color that gives my skin a nice healthy glow.</li>
      <li>First and foremost, I don&#x27;t have any commitment to any enhancement products, I&#x27;ll use just about anything my hand hits on underneath the sink, so it could be pocket busting designer balms someone else thought made a great gift for me,</li>
      <li>If your skin is very light like mine, you might want to get the darker shade, as I did.</li>
      <li>Its fabulous for leaving the skin healthy looking and glowing!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but for the most part I&#x27;m pleased with the results</li>
      <li>Because of the sheerness of the product, I can see it more for summer use - than winter for</li>
      <li>it brightened my skin, i love using it on my face.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that my skin looks a lot better and even when I use this cream.</li>
      <li>I want to love this, hoping for an unscented version eventually.</li>
      <li>, just makes my skin look brighter and better just like a BB .</li>
      <li>I no longer look pasty, and my skin tone is even and subtlety more tan looking.</li>
      <li>it works, as do most of jergens products.</li>
      <li>and  my results were just okay.</li>
      <li>A self-tanner would do more.</li>
      <li>The more you use it the better your skin looks and feels.  </li>
      <li>the smell is okay</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>Nice smell, but wish it was fragrance free.</li>
      <li>The smell of Jergens is not as yummy as VS love addict</li>
      <li>Love The Skin Tone.</li>
      <li>The  CVS  tube darkened and covered evenly and moisturized I think better.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>hope for more truth in advertising from one of the oldest skin lotion brands.</li>
      <li>many folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It will go in the cavern under the sink, and from time to time I&#x27;m sure its&#x27; number will be called.</li>
      <li>It gives my skin a more even tone and glow.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is the tinted part that I&#x27;m not so sure about.  </li>
      <li>This lotion has a nice smooth texture - it does not leave your skin sticky like most lotions.</li>
      <li>I also noticed some of my lighter skin discolorations start to blend more evenly</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>And I was glad that another reviewer stated the problem with parabens.</li>
      <li>Love this body cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the type of person who likes to try a lot of different lotions and this one has really impressed me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Oh and I found out that BB cream means Blemish balm. :)</li>
      <li>so she was glad to try this Jergens BB Body</li>
      <li>At the end, it does itself okay.</li>
      <li>I suppose that a product&#x27;s ability to maintain healthy skin is always my priority.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see any streaks or discoloration, but also made my skin more smooth and even.  </li>
      <li>It is light, absorbs quickly and gives a nice filtered look to my skin.  </li>
      <li>Also, the lotion has a strong perfume scent.</li>
      <li>This product  would be fine for medium or even fair-to-medium skin tones.  </li>
      <li>It has a light fragrance and applies easily.  </li>
      <li>but it is light and not bothersome.</li>
      <li>The tint is so light</li>
      <li>color itself is a light brown which reminds me of some type of cream foundation.</li>
      <li>Really restores the skin quality and gives a nice color/sheen.</li>
      <li>It applies smoothly.  </li>
      <li>I wish this had the original Jergens scent though.</li>
      <li>Then I had an education lesson of creams with my wife which was pretty interesting.</li>
      <li>Until this BB Body - I got the medium - deep, not the one for fair  skin - and after just 4 days my skin already looks creamy and smooth.</li>
      <li>I did not see anything special that something cheaper could not do.</li>
      <li>The first day I used it my husband commented several times on how great my skin looked</li>
      <li>I love body cream, the way it makes your skin so much softer.</li>
      <li>I have naturally fair skin but bought the deep tones version.  </li>
      <li>used this cream for almost a full month</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a Jergen&#x27;s product, so I was not surprised that it was pleasantly moist and creamy.  </li>
      <li>me, I prefer a good untinted body cream and a self-tanning product if I need a little more color at the beginning of the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>quickly dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a mild scent when you put it on</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love this product! i first purchased it from my local walmart for like 11 bucks. expensive for me but the jergens firming lotion has always worked for me so i gave it a shot. BAM! it worked. it brightened my skin, i love using it on my face. it smoothed away spots and evened my skin. it firmed it and tanned it, this testimony comes from my buns! my bum was smoothed out, no cellulite or wrinkles and really bronzed. nice. its doesnt smell bad and isnt very brown, its isnt a instant tanner and honestly , being that i&#x27;m a black girl, like milk chocolate/ mocha, i can testify more to the brightening than the tanning i think. either way, i love this product! it works, as do most of jergens products. oh, no shimmer &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to give my skin a pick me up during winter months and this was perfect.  It is light, absorbs quickly and gives a nice filtered look to my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t give me a tan, just makes my skin look brighter and better just like a BB . I can get dressed almost immediately without any transfer.  I wish this had the original Jergens scent though.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff - Amazon has the best price anywhere!</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful!  The more you use it the better your skin looks and feels.  It has a mild scent when you put it on but as it dries the scent goes away.  Your skin will thank you for using this product!</li>
    <li> I Am Very Happy With This! I Have Used It Day And Night For 4 Days.  Love The Skin Tone. My Skin Is Firmer and&lt;br /&gt;Looks Amazing. I Am 55 And Seeing The Signs Of Discoloration And Sagging.</li>
    <li> Jergens has come out with an All in one BB Cream for Darker Skin Tones. It guarantees to show visible results in just 5 days of the following things :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydrates &amp; Smoothes your skin&lt;br /&gt;Brightens &amp; Illuminates (same thing)&lt;br /&gt;Evens Skin Tones&lt;br /&gt;Visibly Firms Skin&lt;br /&gt;Minimizes the appearances of imperfections&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now does it do all these things in just 5 days? no. However you do eventually see some results just not within the time frame that Jergens promises. The results I did see first were how much nicer skin felt (hydration/smoother skin) after about 1 week.  I also noticed some of my lighter skin discolorations start to blend more evenly (sun spots, natural dark spots) the darker it didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on. this will include stretch marks or bad scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Cream itself is quite thick, and darker toned similar to a sunscreen texture. It does dry rather quickly which is nice and doesn&#x27;t leave you with an oily feeling like a lot of lotions tend to do.  So if you&#x27;re looking for an effective moisturizing body cream that does have some good results I would recommend this just remember like all good things you must be patient and it won&#x27;t work in 5 days.</li>
    <li> seems different from same Jergens BB body Cream I purchased at CVS in the respect of color consistency on my skin.  I have spider veins and bruises on my legs.  The  CVS  tube darkened and covered evenly and moisturized I think better.  Haven&#x27;t compared ingredients but will do so.</li>
    <li> I love body cream, the way it makes your skin so much softer. This cream was great for darker skin tones and smells amazing. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product  would be fine for medium or even fair-to-medium skin tones.  It applies smoothly.  Its is a tad thin.  I like other BB products MUCH better. In fact, all others have worked better--Cover Girl, Rimmel, Revlon, Maybelline.  This one is definitely the poorest performer of the bunch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who likes to try a lot of different lotions and this one has really impressed me.&lt;br /&gt;The color itself is a light brown which reminds me of some type of cream foundation. It is very silky and goes on smooth, the directions say to let the lotion dry on skin before getting dressed which I assume is to prevent staining, but I have not had that problem. It only takes a few days of consistent use to see results and my skin overall looks and feels great and of course very moisturized&lt;br /&gt; Remember this is a body cream and not intended for the face.</li>
    <li> My gal&#x27;s sister has darker complexion than the rest of the ladies in our family so she was glad to try this Jergens BB Body Perfecting Skin Cream.  She is an active parent who is into exercise and hanging out with other moms.  After trying this product for seven days, she did not notice any significant difference compared to the Vaseline Aloe Fresh Lotion that she uses daily.  Claimed results of Hydration: same as other daily lotions.  Illuminates, evens, firms, and corrects skin: not noticeable after seven days.  It&#x27;s clearly not as effective as the La Mer skin care products that she pays high prices for.  Overall: a good moisturizing lotion for daily use after doing dishes, gardening, chores, etc...but definitely not effective for restoring youthful skin compared to premium skin care products.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to have found the miracle in a tube.  Unfortunately, this is not a miracle.  It doesn&#x27;t really moisturize, just provides a greasy barrier.  As for the color, it was more of rose beige foundation color ... not a sunkissed, tanned look.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about the idea of BB cream for the body.  On the one hand, summer is coming and I will start wearing clothes that show my arms and legs and a product that makes them look better has to be a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the tinted part that I&#x27;m not so sure about.  At the beginning of the season I&#x27;ll be pasty white (or at least as pasty white as someone with a medium dark Scandinavian complexion gets).  But this product doesn&#x27;t give that much color when it is blended in -- it is very sheer.  And, though it doesn&#x27;t show up on my darker winter clothes, I worry about stains on light and white colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I prefer a good untinted body cream and a self-tanning product if I need a little more color at the beginning of the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a fragrance but if it is not too close to my face, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a decent BB cream for very tan or African American skin, this is a decent cream.  However, it&#x27;s not the best we&#x27;ve used.  Frankly, it does nothing but cover up.  Most other BB creams actually nourish and replenish.  This, however, is SIMPLY a surface-wear substance.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product...very creamy, saw improvement in skin tone in a week. I actually combine it with jergens glow self tanner--works really well....coverage is even, tanning very realistic.</li>
    <li> This product offers a very very minimal color correction, and acts as an even more minimal moisturizer. For those two reasons alone, I&#x27;m not sure what else it is good for since the two things its intended it falls short of performing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not something I would buy.</li>
    <li> I thought this might be the answer to my dry skin. Sadly to say its just not all what it is cracked up to be. I just think of it as a lotion that anyone can use. I did not see anything special that something cheaper could not do. I saw no signs of difference after a period of time. It seemed to dry out my skin a bit more. Olease remember I do have very dry skin as well. This might work better on someone that does not have overally dry skin.</li>
    <li> Like the smell of this BB Body cream and it does leave a nice sheen. I didn&#x27;t notice an improvement in skin yet.&lt;br /&gt;It suppose to hydrate, firm, illuminate and correct. I will update if I see these benefits. But it is a good moisturizer for the body.</li>
    <li> I rated Jergens BB Body cream for darker skin tones 3.5 stars so I rounded up. First off, I have light/med complexion and thought a hint of color will improve the overall look of my skin. The tint is so light that its nearly impossible to notice it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victorias Secret beauty rush shimmer swirl cream actually makes my skin look better. The smell of Jergens is not as yummy as VS love addict but it is light and not bothersome. Also it is not as creamy as it should be and doesn&#x27;t spread effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Jergens BB body cream has a lot of claims and this bottle did not make my skin look or feel firmer/brighter/smoother or improve my imperfections. But I gave it 3.5 stars for trying and I will continue to use it on my legs and hope for the best!</li>
    <li> Oddly enough, this is very thick and creamy, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to act like a thick and creamy moisturizer.  As we are heading into the summer, this will be nice to give my skin a little shine for in the office.  It doesn&#x27;t have SPF, so I need to have a different lotion for when I&#x27;ll be outside.  Also, it is not good enough for colder days when my skin is likely to be dryer or chapped.  I&#x27;ll have to go back to an intense moisturizer for that.  Overall, this is good enough for right now, but not for an everyday thing.  I&#x27;ll definitely need to find something that can cover more bases and seasons.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Jergen&#x27;s product, so I was not surprised that it was pleasantly moist and creamy.  However, this was a smidge dark for my medium-fair skin (it wasn&#x27;t so much that it was too dark as that lighter changes are easiest to smoothest in color and look more natural).  Overall, results are even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend the lighter shade for &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; skin tones.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a nice smooth texture - it does not leave your skin sticky like most lotions. However, as others have noted - it is not moisturizing at all. I feel like my skin might be smoother, the texture might be slightly improved but my combo skin is still dry. Also, the lotion has a strong perfume scent. The scent isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just too strong. And not sure why there are light and medium versions - when applied it&#x27;s sheer. Overall, I disappointed because I love the texture but it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for me. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for close to a year and haven&#x27;t seen that great of results unfortunately! though I do have quite a few age spots and uneven skin that I don&#x27;t think truthfully any over the counter product could help :-(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of Indian ethnicity, this doesn&#x27;t match at all.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really hard to decipher the code of these products and figure out what will match my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Fair &#x3D; white people&lt;br /&gt;Medium &#x3D; Hispanic? Asian?  Depends on the color undertones of the product&lt;br /&gt;Dark &#x3D; Black? Asian?  Also depends&lt;br /&gt;I wish they could find a better system, or sold small samples of this or something.  Or, you know, just be non-pc and put a picture of the white, Hispanic, Asian, or Black person whose skin tone the product would match.  At least then you&#x27;d know.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m North Indian, and it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this - she buys this stuff on my account and i never see that it is purchased.  She has me reordering it so it must be good.&lt;br /&gt;She is a fan of this cream and now only uses this.</li>
    <li> Really restores the skin quality and gives a nice color/sheen.</li>
    <li> even though it did not really do all the things its says it will do, I still love this product. I usually just put it on my arms and legs and I love it the smell is okay I actually kind of like it, then it really brightens and illuminates my skin like it says it does it makes it glow and it just gives my skin that flawless look</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> This product is terrific. I bought it at Target for $13, will be buying from Amazon from now on. I have - or I should say had - very dry, very pale skin that I so didn&#x27;t enjoy looking at. Until this BB Body - I got the medium - deep, not the one for fair  skin - and after just 4 days my skin already looks creamy and smooth. I no longer look pasty, and my skin tone is even and subtlety more tan looking. There is no self tanner smell, however, and my towels aren&#x27;t getting stained, either. It&#x27;s just a hint of color that gives my skin a nice healthy glow. I absolutely love this BB and can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough. If your skin is very light like mine, you might want to get the darker shade, as I did. Not sure that the fair would be able to work as well. Maybe that&#x27;s one reason for the mixed reviews. I love this BB!!</li>
    <li> I used this for a few weeks before a trip to Mexico so I didn&#x27;t look pale.  It worked to give me a nice glowy tan look -- I don&#x27;t see any streaks or discoloration, but also made my skin more smooth and even.  I recommend this.  I am pale but had a bit of a natural tan when using this medium-to-dark shade.</li>
    <li> This body cream is said to be for darker skin tones, but it does nothing to alter any skin tone. There is very little penetration of this cream into the skin, and my dry skin remains dry with this product. There appears to be some shimmer in this product which creates an artificial &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;, the bad part of which rubs off on everything it touches. I can honestly detect no real benefit from using this product as it does nothing to improve, and very little to maintain. I suppose it will work better for those less prone to dry skin.</li>
    <li> First off, I have to say that I am not too clear what BB body cream is compared to a regular moisturizer. Then I had an education lesson of creams with my wife which was pretty interesting. Oh and I found out that BB cream means Blemish balm. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves this creamy, scented cream that helps cover some uneven tones on her body, hands and legs, as well as acts like a moisturizer. She finds that this is a lighter lotion that is just absorbed onto the skin unlike some other creams which she tried before (such as Aveeno - which is too thick and does not smell as nice). It is also supposed to firm the skin as it has collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She, however, was disappointed that it did not have SPF as part of the ingredient as this would definitely have made it a all-in-one solution as a BB body lotion.</li>
    <li> This works.  Gives your skin a nice glow and it does do some toning, as much as you can expect from a topical cream.</li>
    <li> The only body lotion I use now. Works good on black skin. Makes legs look almost &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> So disapointed !  I  believed ther ad claims and purchased the BB body cream.&lt;br /&gt;Nowhere did it tell me that it was just another &amp;#34;fake tanning&amp;#34; cream.&lt;br /&gt;It has Not &amp;#34;enhanced&amp;#34; my skin  tone, only made it orangish and highlighted my rough patches.&lt;br /&gt;Would hope for more truth in advertising from one of the oldest skin lotion brands.</li>
    <li> This product did not meet my expectations or those results as advertised.  Actually saw no difference-expensive and ineffective.A self-tanner would do more.</li>
    <li> Great cream, and smells good too!</li>
    <li> My last container of overpriced snake oil had just been depleted and voila, this tube magically appeared which alludes to a couple of points. First and foremost, I don&#x27;t have any commitment to any enhancement products, I&#x27;ll use just about anything my hand hits on underneath the sink, so it could be pocket busting designer balms someone else thought made a great gift for me, stuff that I bought off the discount rack at a local pharmacy, or the two products that actually work with chafing...cocoa butter and petroleum jelly...Hey, it worked for Lena Horne, that is all the endorsement I really need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this stuff claims after five days of use, my skin should shimmer like beams of light emanating from the god Orisha but as far as I can tell it has a silky texture, the tint of coffee mocha, a reasonably light scent and near to no lasting impact on my skin&#x27;s propensity to dry out over the course of the day, just like most other creams and lotions I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AA/BB/CC?  What&#x27;s next DD (dark and delusional)? It will go in the cavern under the sink, and from time to time I&#x27;m sure its&#x27; number will be called. But, at these prices for the benefit provided, when the tube is empty, it will not be replaced.</li>
    <li> So far using on my arms and I love it. I have fair skin that is now 50 years old, and while the first 45 years it was without blemish, it now is showing blemishes from the sun that my regular BB hides on my face and now i am trying this body creme. BB cream is basically a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jergens BB Body Cream is a complexion-correcting moisturizer that also attempts to give a uniform tone to reduce visability of  imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best feature - super absorbent.</li>
    <li> I found this does even out and somewhat darken my skin tone with repeat application, and is a light moisturizer (less than I need during the heating season; may be fine for summer). However I believe it is short-sighted of manufacturers to put perfume in everything when it is known that a large percentage of the population has perfume allergy, some serious, and when even those without said allergies will not want competing fragrances in multiple products. And I was glad that another reviewer stated the problem with parabens. I do give credit for the seller, for listing the product&#x27;s chemical ingredients.</li>
    <li> I purchased the med deep and started using it Saturday. I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but for the most part I&#x27;m pleased with the results, My thighs look more toned and some minor imperfections are blurred but if you have any heavier veins or clusters of spider veins you probably won&#x27;t see much change. Some reviewers have complained about the scent .I don&#x27;t have an issue with it, it&#x27;s not strong or disagreeable for me. I am on the fence about how long the tube will last which remains to be seen. If you use it on your entire body I don&#x27;t see it lasting too long. I&#x27;m assuming that other companies will get on this bandwagon fairly soon as they did with the facial BB and CC creams so I&#x27;m keeping my options open for a leg product with better coverage.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product this evening at my local Target.  They have 2 oz trial sizes for $3, and the full size product is only $11.39 there as well.  Since I&#x27;ve only applied it once, I can&#x27;t say too much yet other than I like the fragrance.  I just wanted to share that you can get this MUCH cheaper at Target.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve an olive complexion that tans and  hyper-pigments insect bites or pimples. I had high hopes for this Jergens product that didn&#x27;t materialize in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t:&lt;br /&gt;• even out discolorations&lt;br /&gt;• provide an enhanced sheen&lt;br /&gt;• provide superior hydration&lt;br /&gt;• firm skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did:&lt;br /&gt;• deliver some moisture, but nothing screaming &amp;#34;superior hydration&amp;#34;,&lt;br /&gt;• make my skin feel smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t do enough of anything to make me buy this is the future. I&#x27;m not sure if this colder than usual winter has anything to do with the product&#x27;s performance. I&#x27;m very disappointed in Jergens this time.</li>
    <li> Evens out my skin tone nicely</li>
    <li> I received two samples of this cream one for light skin tones and one for dark skin tones.  I am reviewing both at the same time because although I applied one to each arm there was literally no difference in color.  For that reason I have subtracted a star.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love this cream and will purchase this in the future.  It has a light fragrance and applies easily.  The price is reasonable for a tube this size, and I would recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> This product is bananas expensive for what one receives and the quality of the product. I have used BB creams and CC creams on my face, so I know that there is a bit of a learning-curve with getting the color perfect. (And, in some cases, no amount of rubbing will make the product look natural. LOL!) Here, the problem seemed to be a decided lack of color. I didn&#x27;t really see the &amp;#34;Beauty Balm&amp;#34; aspect of it. Additionally, I was disappointed that there was so little moisture provided by this product. I suppose that a product&#x27;s ability to maintain healthy skin is always my priority. So, I think this is where the product fails for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, I would consider a richer, self-tanner rather than a skimpy BB cream. And, for this price, you could pick up a number of prestige brands.</li>
    <li> Unlike many of the previous versions of Jerkins lotions I have tried, this is sheer, goes on evenly and quickly and I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry to get dressed.  After about a week of daily use, your skin will take on a slightly sun-kissed tan hue.  And that&#x27;s always a nice thing in the dead of winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a deep moisturizer for those with very dry skin, but more for those who choose to use a daily moisturizer to prevent dry skin.  Because of the sheerness of the product, I can see it more for summer use - than winter for many folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see that it lives up to its claim of evening skin tones, illuminates and smooths.  Haven&#x27;t seen much firming yet - but then again, I&#x27;m an old granny and it may be too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the product.  I will probably save what is left and use it about a week before shorts season begins though - just so my skin can look look then.</li>
    <li> I do like this however results are pretty subtle.  Even subtle helps my freckled skin.  Nice smell, but wish it was fragrance free. I use on are  &amp; legs and have gone through several bottles is last summer.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product. I am getting older and my legs are getting a little blotchy so I was hoping this product would offer some help. I was mostly hoping it would even my skin tone, hide some ( very minor ) old scars and perhaps firm them up a bit. All things that this product promises on the label&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BB cream I tried was suggested for medium to deep skin tones. My skin tone is best described as a tannish olive  color. The cream comes out of the tube a beige color but disappears when you rub it in. My boyfriend who has a dark chocolate skin tone was curious and he tried it. It also disappeared into his skin when he rubbed it in. I don&#x27;t think this product can even skin tone or cover any imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice and not overwhelming and quickly dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this cream for almost a full month and  my results were just okay. This is not a particularly effective moisturizer. I felt the moisturizing effects wore off quickly.The cream did NOT deliver visibly firm skin. As far as perfecting my legs , I don&#x27;t feel this product made a noticeable difference over my normal body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall , I can&#x27;t recommend this product for its stated uses.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say this Jergens BB Cream was a waste for me. I had high hopes because the company has been in business so long. Honestly and simply never saw any improvement or felt any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This creamy lotion is better for darker skintones but not ones that are really dark (think Indian skin hues vs dark African American hues).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is smooth but more gel-like than creamy like as a body lotion generally is. At the end, it does itself okay. It&#x27;s not superb as a moisturizer. For the price range (currently $19.49), one would expect something a bit better.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a reccomendation from a friend and I am glad I got it! I have noticed that my skin looks a lot better and even when I use this cream.</li>
    <li> Love this body cream. I do think it tints my skin a little, but for me I LOVE that look.  And I hate tanners, etc.  And it is surprisingly moisturizing.  I put it on my legs right after shaving, and it is perfect for that.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  I love this product.  I have used the Jergens self tanner for years which I really like so I tried this product.  I have naturally fair skin but bought the deep tones version.  It really works.  After just a few days I noticed a real difference in the evenness of my skin tone and texture.  My skin is smooth, even and beautiful.  The first day I used it my husband commented several times on how great my skin looked and I never told him I was trying a new product. It prolongs my tan - both real and sunless and makes my skin glow without any glitter or sparkly affect.  No where does it claim that it will change the color of your skin.  If you want tan skin then use the self tanners, they work great. I have to admit I am really surprised at the difference in my skin.  I was afraid this would be another $12 wasted but I was wrong.  Other reviewers mentioned the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; problem which I have noticed but it is not so bad as to make me not use the product.  I had been using Nivea moisturizer but no more.  It has a pleasant smell and a nice smooth texture when applying.  This is my new daily lotion and I stocked up so as not to run out.  Great job Jergens!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m incorporating this lotion into my daily routine! Its fabulous for leaving the skin healthy looking and glowing! I use it on my legs as well, since it helps to even out skin tone in areas where spider veins like to hang out ;)</li>
    <li> The smell is terrible! I want to love this, hoping for an unscented version eventually.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for little over a year now.  It gives my skin a more even tone and glow.  I love it! It does have a bit of a self tanner scent not smell because I hate the smell of san tanners and that is why I do not use them. In the summer my skin is pretty tan so I use the BB cream only, but during the winter I get really light so I use about a dime size of the Med Sally Hansen&#x27;s Airbrush Legs with the Med BB cream and my skin looks amazing!  Try it.  With any bronzer/tanning products you will need to dry before placing your clothes on.  You can also take a napkin after you have dried a little and wipe your body down before getting dressed, which will help if you have put a lot of it on so it does not transfer to your clothes, plus it does not affect the look at all.  Have a good one!</li>
    <li> After I use it my legs looks with a natural glow</li>
