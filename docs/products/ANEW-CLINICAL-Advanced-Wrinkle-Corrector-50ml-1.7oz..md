<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As with all Avon Anew products, this one is just as effective.  I have used Avon Anew for years and can honestly I am please with the results.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but the seller shipped me either something that had been replaced in the container....or it had gone bad. It smelled terrible. The color was off....and I have used and loved this product for years. this was not a good match</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and am 55 years young, a grandmother of 7. I started using this when it first came out off and on but more regularly after the age of 45 when I noticed sun damage and wrinkles. It is by far the best thing I have found so far compared to other products I have tried including other Avon anti- wrinkle creams which have been a little too harsh on my skin. I found when I stray away from Anew Clinical and try other products such as Oil of Olay, Estee Lauder, Garnier and others my skin starts too feel extremely dry again and looks tired, dull and seems all lines show. so I end up going back to Clinical. I am 55 so I am certainly not wrinkle free but I get a lot of complements on my skin and people don&#x27;t believe my age. And I fried in the sun. I don&#x27;t know about oily skin but for dry skin this is the best. I&#x27;m sure since it is moisturizing my skin so well that improves the appearance of lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have bee looking for a moisturizing cream for years that won&#x27;t cause my skin to breakout.   FINALLY...I can stop searching.  It does sting a little bit whe first applied guess that means its working.  Thumbs up for this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for years. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, including Perricone, and I always go back to this one. This is perfect for mature skin. Softens wrinkles and lines and makes my skin luminous. I use it over a good c serum.</li>
    <li> This cream feels good on my face, and when I wake up my skin is soft and even...but not noticeable improvements with the wrinkles.  I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have many yet so I may be expecting too much.</li>
    <li> have used this for years . can&#x27;t improve on great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the dermabrasion and the peel from Avon for about a month, and can really notice a difference.  Skin feels much smoother. No, I don&#x27;t look 30 again, but at 60+ I have been wearing only some eyemakeup and going out without foundation on my face!&lt;br /&gt;Initially had 2 spots that broke out when I began this process, but I have read that is not unusual during beginning treatment with dermabrasion.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for allowing sellers to offer products at a better price. I know Avon does not approve, but those of us trying to save a little money, appreciate the help.  Everything I have purchased along this line is factory wrapped an sealed; looks just the same as what I buy from my Avon representative.  Same texture, smell, look.</li>
    <li> This cream is good for hydrating skin quickly but unlike some other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t notice any tingling or the immediate plumping action described. From the other reviews, I expected a tiny jar but it actually is a good sized jar, about the same as any other product. The good thing about this cream is that you only need a tiny bit. For the first 10 days I was able to get all the product I needed just from the lid.</li>
    <li> This is not the real Avon clinical Anew. I&#x27;m not sure where it&#x27;s from but this is not it!!! Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I have not used this type of cream in the past.  Have not used long enough to determine quality.  Perhaps I can determine the quality in the near future...after time of usage.  smooth cool cream.&lt;br /&gt;rd</li>
    <li> Surprised more people don&#x27;t use this product.  It really shows results immediately and I won&#x27;t go without it. Great Value.</li>
    <li> I used the whole jar and never saw a difference.  I&#x27;m not that old or wrinkled, but this definitely did not do a thing!</li>
    <li> I have used this product since it came out and have been satisfied completely.  This price is almost half of the cost which I think is great!</li>
    <li> I have tried the Olay Pro-X and loved it for years; it saved my Mary-Kay-ruined skin. Then I tried the Anew Wrinkle Corrector and no matter what else I try to stray away to, I always come back to the Avon Anew products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried just about everything (except that $200 La Mer LOL) and nothing is any better than the Anew. It especially makes my neck skin look soft, smooth and hydrated. I use retinoids and Finacea so my skin can get pretty dried out and flaky, but if I use the Anew or their new Genics, my face is smooth and not flaky when I wake up in the morning. It feels nice and hydrated, it doesn&#x27;t get that crepey look any more. (I&#x27;m probably a LOT older than the folks who reviewed this and it didn&#x27;t &#x27;do&#x27; anything for them...because they have young skin already)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve pretty much given up on ever finding anything I like better than the Anew line, I try every new high-end product as it is launched and still I go back to Anew. I&#x27;m not even an Avon fan but when you find something that works, you stick by it until you find something better! I don&#x27;t foresee anything better right now. (I just tried and returned Lancome&#x27;s new Genifique, a direct competitor of the Genics from Avon....sorry Lancome, I gave you a whole month to dazzle me...Ditto for Estee Lauder serum....)</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I can tell a huge difference in my skin when I run out.  I reorder quickly!</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time, and in perfect condition. I am very happy with the purchase, and will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> My skin is addicted to this stuff. Noticeable results. It&#x27;s a gel not a greasy cream, which I am  told by an aesthetician holds moisture in. I&#x27;d bathe in it if I could afford to.</li>
    <li> This product feels so good going on! Immediately, my skin feels more nourished. I was happy to find a product that immediately makes my skin feel less dry.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews for this product prior to purchasing so I was excited to receive it in the mail.  The texture of cream is really good, but I wasn&#x27;t fond of the smell or the burning feeling on my face perhaps my skin is too sensitive had to stop using.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and have to say that it is absolutely my favorite cream...and I don&#x27;t have to spend a lot for great results. So glad that I can buy it through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea and acne Rosacea which was under control for the last year or so. I ordered this product to help with wrinkles. Started using about a week ago. It stings when you apply it to skin. I now have three huge painful blemishes on my chin and the Rosacea redness and acne is back around both sides of my nose. Had to stop using the product two days ago. Just a warning for acne prone and Rosacea skin. This product is too harsh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  People say I don&#x27;t look my age (63) so it must be working! Grin.</li>
    <li> Love this cream!  It arrived in good condition and in a sealed package.  This is an option to \\&quot;botox\\&quot; with no risks or side effects at all.  After a few uses the visible wrinkles are \\&quot;erased\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this cream is revolting, so I only use it on my neck, and even then must put a drop of lavender oil under my nose so I can&#x27;t smell it. So many cosmetic brands are adding this particular fragrance to their formulas, even Shiseido and Estee Lauder Re-Nutriv, which I had been using for decades.</li>
    <li> This creme is very hydrating and smells good. I don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles (yet) so not sure it really improved anything for me. I would recommend it if you have really dry skin.</li>
    <li> This costs $32 on the Avon website and its only $18 on Amazon. Id say thats a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;This product clears my face quickly when i have breakouts, so i hate to be without it. So happy i found it on here. I have sensitive skin and im 43 years old but have been told i look younger. I like to use this as an overnight cream cause its a little greasy for daytime use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Avon anti-wrinkle creams before and this is my least favorite. It&#x27;s not bad, it just isn&#x27;t any better than any other face cream. It feels nice to the touch and is probably best for someone who is looking for soft skin but not concerned about younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> My wife tried this and swears it&#x27;s more effective than other expensive creams she&#x27;s bought.  She uses it especially at night before bed.</li>
    <li> not the right promise</li>
    <li> This is a light moisturizer as well as a wrinkle corrector.  I have not used it long enough to get results, but I can tell it really helps my skin.  It is not greasy and absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product every night for years.  In combination with the Anew Thermafirm in the morning, my skin looks very good!</li>
    <li> works well if you use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Anew has my business forever.  My skin has improved so much.  I will always use this product. and have told others about it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of Avon but I really like this product.  I have tried a lot of different wrinkle creams (haven&#x27;t we all, LOL) and this is by far the best.  I agree that it is pricey but compared to some others, it is not.  I just try to watch for it on sale.  It is kind of strong if you have sensitive skin.  I have found if I put a little Vitamin E oil on those sensitive spots, then apply Anew, the results are much better.  I also like the fact that makeup goes on over it good.  Some other creams in the same family don&#x27;t like makeup.</li>
    <li> This product works exceptionally well.  I was using the Anew Clinical duo - Eye cream and gel and found the gel to work better than the cream which needless to say doesn;t change the price!  Thought I&#x27;d try another Anew Clinical product, and this one does what I want.  You can feel it slightly tingling after application. It doesn&#x27;t burn me, but I do have to fight the initial itch.  I use it as a preventative for crows feet and around my smile line.  I need to be more consistent with it...even so, I&#x27;m seeing results. Get it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. I have very wrinkles and attribute that to this amazing product. I will be not be without it.</li>
    <li> This cream is great and for the price I won&#x27;t be without it.  I use Retin-a to keep my skin glowing, and use this twice a week to amp up the exfoliation.  My skin has never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;7-2015:  editing my review to say that with consistent use on clean skin at least 3 times a week at night before bed, my skin is gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Received product timely. So far I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. Maybe it requires more time. I&#x27;m being patient and hoping it works as described. Gave it 3 stars because the scent is fine, the product although a little more runny than expected is not oily or drying. So far it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my fine lines, but staying neutral and giving it time to work. So far no complaints, but nothing to brag about either.</li>
    <li> This Avoin product works as well as some of the more expensive brands out there - goes on smoothly, clean smell, and you can feel it working over night.</li>
    <li> I know that many other people thought this cream was fabulous so maybe it is just my skin.  I have found that my skin is looking increasingly dull and grey with this cream.  But most noticeably, my pores look enormous.  They literally look like they did in high school.  I think you could drive a Mack truck through my pores right now.  In addition, I have broken out on my chin and around my nose.  That&#x27;s another thing I haven&#x27;t done since high school.  Like I said, maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but I really don&#x27;t care for this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good as most Avon products are. It&#x27;s also less expensive here than on the avon site. But as far as \\&quot;correcting\\&quot; wrinkles....I can&#x27;t say that I look younger than I did prior to purchasing. I look the same to me. I think the reviews from the ladies on Avon are dreamers or wishers. It is a great moisturizer, but there is no real fountain of youth.</li>
    <li> I have had crazy dry skin all of my life. This is the only facial cream that has completely cured my flaking skin. Lovely!</li>
    <li> Stings on my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and I won&#x27;t be using this again. Based on other reviews, I&#x27;m the exception though, it just wasn&#x27;t for me. I cannot stand the smell. I don&#x27;t consider it a nice fresh smell, it&#x27;s so odd to me I can&#x27;t figure out what it smells like. I don&#x27;t like anything abou this creme. The color looks like french vanilla pudding and the texture isn&#x27;t far from pudding texture either.  It feels greasy to me when I have it on. As for it doing it&#x27;s job, I suppose it does. It&#x27;s only been a month. I just think that there are other cremes out there that have the same results and are more pleasant smelling and the texture is more to my liking. It is quite pricey for the amount in the jar.  I don&#x27;t use alot at a time but it looks like it will last me another week or so. The illusion of the container makes it seem like there&#x27;s more in there. The bottom of the container inside is about 1/2 an inch above the actual bottom of the container outside, hope that makes sense. One last thing, I ran out of day cream so I used this during the day and it made my foundation blend horribly. So stick to it at night only as it is intented for.</li>
    <li> I use this and I have seem some result with it. I am 65 so I don&#x27;t expect miracles but this has moisturized and firmed up and diminished  some of the fine lines on my face... I will order this again IT makes the skin feel great and I would use it for that reason alone even if it didn&#x27;t  diminish wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 years and can definitely see the creases in my forehead disappear. I am very please with this product and I even have my mother using it. She is as thrilled as I am. Great product if you need a little help. Thanks amazon.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the product gave used it for years. Got it at a great price and the seller really knows the meaning of customer service. Really went the distance to help w/ P.O. problem. Janetkwiek@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS CREAM ALONG WITH OTHER AVON CREAMS.. THIS IS CHEAPER THAN BUYING IT DIRECTLY THROUGH AVON.. THIS IS WHY I BUY IT HERE RELIGIOUSLY HERE...</li>
    <li> Feels great but don&#x27;t clear up any wrinkles..found out the only way to get rid of the wrinkles is a plastic sergeon..</li>
    <li> It tingles when applied and I love the scent. I notice a huge difference on my fine lines about a week after initial use. I have been a fan of this product since I first started using it. It&#x27;s worth the money paid.</li>
    <li> The best antiage cream if you want to look younger. .  My favorite.  .. I&#x27;m 41 years old with no wringle at all.  It is like magic, better than botox...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, but it does nothing to help with wrinkles.  I don&#x27;t expect a miracle, but this just didn&#x27;t do anything to improve the wrinkle situation.</li>
    <li> As expected; speedy delivery</li>
    <li> This Stings Im A Good Way With The 10% Glycolic. I Ope It Is 10% Glycolic That Is Stinging And Not Witch Hazel . I Trust Avon So IHope Their Product Is As Advertised.</li>
    <li> Usually I&#x27;m happy when a product is \\&quot;good enough\\&quot;. This cream goes far beyond that...it works miracles! Even after the first night, I could see a change for the better, and after two weeks, I would say it is a miracle-worker!&lt;br /&gt;Super-satisfied, will for sure buy again!</li>
    <li> I read an article from a dermatologist stating that this is a good product. I tried it for about 3-4 weeks and saw no difference. It seems like it is doing something due to the tingle when you first but it on but this was not for me.</li>
    <li> She still has wrinkles...LOL</li>
    <li> I like this cream, but my wrinkles are still with me.</li>
    <li> Love this avon product, Would buy this product again and again</li>
    <li> WRINKLES FILL OUT ALLEGEDLY.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, have been using it for over 5 yrs. good price and works great. Leaves your skin smooth and not heavy like alot of lotions I have tried. thank you.</li>
    <li> The smell is slightly strong but I just use it before bed every few days when I am not using the clinical Pro line eraser treatment also from avon and it seems to moisturize well and work well with the other avon product</li>
    <li> Not bad but I&#x27;m not going to buy it again.  For such a small jar I was actually able to get a lot of applications out of it.  However the tingling sensation from the cream (as they say on the package that is how I know it is working) was too much for me.  It was itchy and stung my skin.  I used it in combination with the ANEW Clinical advanced retexturing peel, so maybe it was a combination of the two.  As far as wrinkles were concerned, I supposed their appearance has lessened.  I&#x27;m 29 so I didn&#x27;t really have noticeable wrinkles, just some starting to form around my eyes.  I bought this as a &amp;#34;preventative&amp;#34; measure.</li>
    <li> My friend and I just love it. We&#x27;ve used other expensive moisturiser but the result is not the same as this product. So we are sticking to it.</li>
    <li> I bought this creme to use as a night-time creme.  I put a little amount on my finger tip before bedtime and then I leave it to soak in and do its magic.  It&#x27;s a nice, rich creme that seems to reduce the appearance of fine lines under my eyes.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff!!</li>
    <li> This cream is very supple and goes on smoothly. It really makes your skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> It made my face very soft, wrinkle free within 3 weeks!! Im amazed! I only use it night time bcaz the lack of sunscreen in it. Very good product, try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  Love the texture and silky feel of my skin after application.  The scent is nice.  The only objection is the shape of the jar makes it difficult to get the remains of cream out.  I have to use a Q tip under the rim to get my $$$ worth.  Come on AVON!  Did you think we wouldn&#x27;t notice?  Why do huge $$$ making corporations think we&#x27;re stupid enough to throw away the jar and order more when there is still lots of cream hidden?</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product. It is a very pleasant smelling and not to heavy. I like the way it makes your face feel. The price is great affordable and I feel its making a difference in the way my skin looks around my mouth and \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot;. I have noticed the wrinkles on my forehead are not as noticeable also.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed and wrinkle reduction but I can say it is helping with the dry flaky skin that this winter has caused. I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be minimizing my wrinkles on my forehead &amp; neck.  This is my first time using it so need more time to see how it works .</li>
    <li> Third time on ordering this item.  Love what how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Best cream by Avon! I use it everyday and it makes my skin feel and look so smooth and youthful.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost two years.  I do not have any wrinkles because of this product. I am 42 yrs and you would never believe me if you saw me. This is not a gimmick product like the big brands.  Take my advice, use this product with confidence that you will see changes in your facial appearance.</li>
    <li> Best on the market.  I like it not only for applying to my face at bed time for skin renewal and anti-wrinkle properties, but to clear my occasional pimples.  This stuff works wonders on pimples.  I&#x27;m 58 years old, so do understand that the fountain of youth comes only from a plastic surgeon.  But the Anew wrinkle corrector makes me feel more confident and I feel that it does work to a degree.</li>
    <li> A one Item and seller</li>
    <li> First time trying and i wasn&#x27;t disappointed....</li>
    <li> Anew Clinical Advanced Winkle Corrector is just okay.  I still have my wrinkles just like I had before using this product but I was okay for a moisture cream.</li>
    <li> I use this every night and I love it.  I feel wonderful. Glides on easily.  My face feels and looks very well moisturized.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite night cream. It absorbs well and tightens my skin and helps lighten the beginning dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it does sting at first- go light at first. It has an AHA- which is helping your skin! It does what creams and serums costing three and six times as much and it is no where near as &amp;#34;precious&amp;#34; so I tend to be more generous and I love feeling I can be free with my application! When you see the results, give it time- you didn&#x27;t get this way in a few weeks- you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite work as well as the reviews I&#x27;ve read, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it to see if there is a change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 51 and I have been using this stuff for 12 years. It makes my skin appear more firm and youthful looking almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I use this every day AFTER I use the Eye lift Pro Dual Eye System product.  I love how this product ( Anew Advanced Wrinkle Corrector) feels on my face.  I will continue to buy as long as I can find it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet not sure what all the fuss is about that its the best wrinkle corrector for the price. Not so sure about that. I did have very high expectations though..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I can see the difference...my face looks even and more radiant...I highly recommend it...I</li>
    <li> This, like several Avon products I&#x27;ve seen reviewed enthusiastically and ordered, seemed to work very well at first.  But, after a couple of weeks, I noticed my skin was dryer and duller. I have very good skin so it is the product not my skin. I&#x27;ve thrown out 3 of these Avon products that I believed the reviews on and found to be not very good at all.</li>
    <li> This product competes with the make-up counter products that cost much more.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rich and creamy but does not leave a greasy look/feel. It smells nice too.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks great and wrinkles are less visible. Why pay more when you can have the&lt;br /&gt;same quality at a fraction of the price. Thank you Avon!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite.  The Avon Clinical line is my favorite and works best for my skin type.  It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and feels good all day.  Goes on smooth and adsorbes nicely.  Gives my skin a healthy glow.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best face cream! I have used it for a long time! I have tried other brands, but I always come back to ANew Clinical Advanced Wrinkle cream.</li>
    <li> The cream goes on smooth and is not oily. I am very happy with my purchase. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years or longer and I love it! I am 47 years old and it does help... I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Love it and I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and is working well with my skin.  Great deal to find a cheaper price here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product make me break out so much</li>
    <li> I read all the great reviews on Amazon on this product so I ordered. After I used Olay pro x advanced cleaning system that day. I put this on before I went to bed. Hoping for good results. I have been  fortunate at 59 to have small pores and nice skin. This has made my pores very noticable and the wrinkles on my face are now much more pronounced it went straight into the garbage! What a waste of money. I am trying a new skin care regiment hoping to get back the way my skin looked before.</li>
    <li> The cream is light and very moisturizing.  My skin feels great after I use it.  I use very little make- up so I can&#x27;t say really how it helps with that but I&#x27;m very happy with it and will order more when this jar is finished.</li>
    <li> It works. I have used this product for ten years or more.  I think it superior to the Olay product.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve mentioned, I love all of the Avon clinical and Anew products.  This is a great inexpenseve day cream for me.  All creams tout &#x27;wrinkle corrector&#x27; well that I&#x27;d love to experience, but as we all age, we gain wrinkles!  (and hopefully more life experiences along the way)!  This rates with brand name products I&#x27;ve used previously for less than half the price, keep it up Avon!</li>
    <li> This facial cream is amazing.  I will be purchasing more when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I have used many wonderful beauty products but, the ANEW products are by far the best. Although this particular product isn&#x27;t age defined...They have different groups of ANEW products that are based on age groups. I think this is great because our skin has different needs as it matures.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels in my skin...sinks in immediately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Avon products for quite awhile and love how they make my skin feel. Not all of my wrinkles are gone, but my face looks much better than it did before I started using this product.</li>
    <li> This lightweight face cream glides over your skin smoothly. Some creams leave an almost waxy residue and if rubbed will create little bits of rolled up facial debris. No such &#x27;pilling&#x27; with this product. A simple cream with simply good results-within 3-4 days my skin has a more even appearance; I have a bad wrinkle between my eyes-with continued use of CLINICAL, it diminishes enough that I no longer scare small children!</li>
