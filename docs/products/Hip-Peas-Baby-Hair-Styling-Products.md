      <li>, I doubt it would be effective for brushing.</li>
      <li>Well-made &amp; it came nicely packaged.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also her size, so she loves brushing her own hair too.</li>

      <li>I would recommend this for any newborn, and am looking forward to using it as she grows more hair.</li>

      <li>and it sometimes builds up static in her hair.</li>

      <li>/&gt;We promptly returned it and are looking for a better solution.</li>
      <li>so lovely.</li>
      <li>I just wished the ultra-softness of the bristles were better described.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>This would have been a great brush for a new born but not a toddler with hair.</li>
      <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for actual hair, but it worked great on my face :)</li>
      <li>My daughter is 13mths with fine hair who just out grew her baby brush</li>
      <li>It would not brush my newborns fine hair</li>
      <li>Good for newborns but very soft.</li>
      <li>This product seemed to fit the bill</li>
      <li>just use it lightly on the area and then wash the hair, then afterward apply some oil</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft and the brush is good quality.</li>
      <li>It is nice and soft and brushes her hair just fine, but the bristles do tend to fall out easily</li>
      <li>originally bought this brush as a Christmas gift in 2014.</li>
      <li>I love products made from wood, and was looking for a brush with a thicker handle that my little guy could more easily grasp and brush his own hair now that he is showing interest.</li>
      <li>Well made, perfect for newborn heads with extra soft hair.</li>
      <li>So soft, you&#x27;ll not find a better baby brush out there!</li>
      <li>Probably a great training hair brush to use on bald babies, but once they have hair, it&#x27;s not very functional.</li>
      <li>but I found the bristles to be too soft to be effective (for use on a mustache/beard)</li>
      <li>your kid has a full head of hair</li>
      <li>but this one is much softer and more tolerable for our newborn.</li>
      <li>When she came out with a full head of hair, I bought this brush.</li>
      <li>so i was looking for a nice natural toddler brush.</li>
      <li>Nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Nice, soft brush</li>
      <li>This brush is definitely only good for newborns.  </li>
      <li>This is a soft nice brush...</li>
      <li>Good enough for a newborn AND for a toddler!</li>
      <li>nice soft brush that mildly sheds.</li>
      <li>The bristles are extremely soft and doesn&#x27;t do a great job for my toddler&#x27;s curly soft locks</li>
      <li>cradle cap went away quickly.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Hairs fall out of brush quickly.</li>
      <li>The brush is better suited for an older infant.</li>
      <li>It works great for one-year-old&#x27;s short, fine hair but may not be something she&#x27;ll be able to use for very long.</li>
      <li>The brush is really soft so it will be suitable even for newborns.</li>
      <li>It was worth a second chance and highly recommend for fine baby hair!!!</li>
      <li>forward to the one I bought for my own child (who has more than the average amount of hair, I admit) and the brush i recieved this time sucked.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;m supporting something that was produced in an  environmentally conscious way.</li>
      <li>Love this, it is super soft.</li>
      <li>Very soft and good for natural and newborns.</li>
      <li>This brush is gentle &amp; seems to do the job on her fine baby hair.  </li>
      <li>Great for my little one.</li>

      <li>This is a great natural brush with wonderfully soft bristles that work great on baby&#x27;s fine hair without scratching or irritating the scalp.</li>
      <li>Although the quality of the product is great, the actual bristles are way to soft and don&#x27;t brush the hair at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This little brush is super cute and sturdy! It is soft enough for a baby&#x27;s scalp and detangles tiny little locks with ease! Good enough for a newborn AND for a toddler! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> perfect for our newborn&#x27;s hair.  Nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Bristles were too soft - my Daughter was around 9 months old with wavy hair and it just was just too soft to brush her hair - sadly I had to return it</li>
    <li> The bristles are incredibly soft and fine. Perfect for my newborn born with a full head of hair. I haven&#x27;t had any of the bristles fall out like other reviewers mentioned but unless it comes out in chunks it would be expected that some fall out (it is a bristle hair brush after all). Definitely recommend if you are looking for a super soft brush for extra fine baby hair.</li>
    <li> Buttery soft bristles- so lovely.</li>
    <li> this is a great product love using this for my daughter she only lets me brush with this brush love it</li>
    <li> Love this brush should of bought 2!!!!!</li>
    <li> Soft and gentle on baby hair.</li>
    <li> super soft, just what i was looking for. although the  hairs on the brush does come out a bit.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a fake product but I hated the brush I received.&lt;br /&gt;Backstory:&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this brush as a Christmas gift in 2014. That brush was awesome. The wood was good quality. The bristles were soft but firm. Worked like a charm to brush thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to the one I bought for my own child (who has more than the average amount of hair, I admit) and the brush i recieved this time sucked. Sucked really hard. The bristles were soft but they weren&#x27;t firm anymore. The bristles were misshapened as well. The wood felt cheaper. I was disappointed and returned it.</li>
    <li> The bristles are not separate looking like in the picture.  When the package arrived they were all &amp;#34;mushed&amp;#34; together.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my three month old. Will be a keepsake. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably best for new borns. The bristles are extremely soft and doesn&#x27;t do a great job for my toddler&#x27;s curly soft locks</li>
    <li> Bristles (if you could even call them that) are too soft to brush my 2 yr old and 4 month old&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it, brush works well and appears to be well made.</li>
    <li> Hairs fall out of brush quickly.</li>
    <li> Very soft and good for natural and newborns. Not good for older tots. As the bristles are almost to soft and the brush sheds a lot since first use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an extremely soft bristled brush. Not exactly what I was looking for, but not the brush&#x27;s fault. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Super soft &amp; vegan! Baby loves it - have been using it since he was about 6 weeks old.  Plan on purchasing for new mommy friends</li>
    <li> Too soft. All the reviews which said that this brush is too soft to actually brush hair were &amp;#34;SPOT ON&amp;#34;. It is soft, but so soft that it is useless even on the baby boy&#x27;s short hair. Never gets used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so confused by the reviews, it makes me think I received the wrong brush.  The bristles on the one I received are ridiculously soft, softer than a soft bristled tooth brush.  This might be fine for a newborn or someone with very little hair, but this will not help my 21-month-old&#x27;s hair, which is long and straight, but there&#x27;s a lot of it.  Some of the reviews rave about it being a great brush for tangles or babies with lots of hair, which makes me think they changed the bristles?  Box also came smashed, so some of the bristles were mangled.  I&#x27;m returning the brush.</li>
    <li> This is a soft nice brush... I just feel like it&#x27;s too nice to take into the bath like our plastic one.</li>
    <li> The listing for this brush says it can be used for babys and toddlers is wrong. I bought one and this brush is meant ONLY for babys. The bristles are way to soft, they do absolutely nothing for my daughters hair just braise the top of my daughters head not actually brushing her hair. The picture is also deceiving where the bristles look firm, but when you actually get the product the bristles look completely different. Their more together- almost smashed looking, completely different than pictured. If your looking for a good brush for you toddler I&#x27;d suggest getting one locally at walgreens or longs drugs (Hawaii people). Not worth buying unless for an infant.</li>
    <li> Super soft.  Love it.  Doesn&#x27;t work much past the peach fuzz stage</li>
    <li> Great brush but it is extremely soft. Great brush for newborns but I have a toddler that needed something more stiff. Will keep for the next little one. :-)</li>
    <li> I love this brush and the makers! The bristles are perfect for toddler hair. I lost the first one and am buying another.</li>
    <li> Perfect for newborn hair</li>
    <li> It is actually TOO soft, and doesn&#x27;t do anything to the hair you are trying to brush. Probably a great training hair brush to use on bald babies, but once they have hair, it&#x27;s not very functional.</li>
    <li> Before our daughter was born we didn&#x27;t bother to buy a hairbrush because we didn&#x27;t expect to need one. When she came out with a full head of hair, I bought this brush. It is nice and soft and brushes her hair just fine, but the bristles do tend to fall out easily and it sometimes builds up static in her hair. The bristle loss and static aren&#x27;t bad enough to bother getting another brush, so we&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Just got this brush today and it is way too soft. Just like one reviewer said i don&#x27;t understand how everyone is saying this soft brush can comb thru tangles. This brush is for newborns with very little hair. My daughter is 13mths with fine hair who just out grew her baby brush so i was looking for a nice natural toddler brush. This is actually softer than her baby brush and it cant even comb thru her hair. It is a nice brush for a newborn but why would I pay this price when they sell them at the dollar store? I was so looking forward to receiving this based on quality and the reviews here, disappointed and returning it today.</li>
    <li> The box was open and the bristles were just falling out of it before I even touched them.</li>
    <li> Love this! So super soft!  It&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;m supporting something that was produced in an  environmentally conscious way.</li>
    <li> Good for newborns but very soft. If you have a baby with curly hair, look for something with firmer bristles.</li>
    <li> I mistakenly bought this brush for my curly haired toddler. Bristles are absolutely too soft. The brush is better suited for an older infant. Its cute and I have saved it. Maybe for baby #2..?</li>
    <li> We bought few in the past and none of them were soft like this. Our son did not want to use any of the old ones but he loves this one.</li>
    <li> i used this before bathtime when my baby had cradle cap. just use it lightly on the area and then wash the hair, then afterward apply some oil (i used coconut but you can use any oil, baby oil whatever). cradle cap went away quickly. will use it when he has more hair to brush it.</li>
    <li> This is a great natural brush with wonderfully soft bristles that work great on baby&#x27;s fine hair without scratching or irritating the scalp.</li>
    <li> Cruelty free and super soft bristles!</li>
    <li> Bristles are too soft to actually comb my baby&#x27;s fine hair (and she doesn&#x27;t even have a lot haha). It just kind of &amp;#34;wipes her hair down&amp;#34; instead of combing through it. Nice wooden handle and natural materials, however.</li>
    <li> Nice, soft brush but doesn&#x27;t get deep enough for kitten fur. However, he enjoys it.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. The brisels are so soft that I couldn&#x27;t even brush my sons hair. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Softest brush ever!  Was perfect for our newborn!</li>
    <li> Very cute and well made brush. The bristles are a bit soft and don&#x27;t get through my daughter&#x27;s curls but if have a little one with straight or fine hair, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after having lost the one inexpensive plastic one the hospital sent home with us. I love products made from wood, and was looking for a brush with a thicker handle that my little guy could more easily grasp and brush his own hair now that he is showing interest. This product seemed to fit the bill but we were sorely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived and when I opened the box pictured I was met with tons of loose bristles! It was a mess. I hoped it was a packaging error and not a problem with the brush, so I cleared away the loose ones and gave it a try. The first problem was that it was entirely too soft. So soft it didn&#x27;t brush his hair. It was so much softer than the hospital brush, and that made it completely ineffective. On top of that, it left a bunch of new loose bristles in its wake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We promptly returned it and are looking for a better solution.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s too soft &amp; doesn&#x27;t comb through my 1yr old daughter&#x27;s hair. Well made, perfect for newborn heads with extra soft hair.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. First - it did NOT look like the picture. The bristles were all frayed and used up looking. The brush barely smoothed the top layer of my daughter&#x27;s hair so I&#x27;m not sure how it could be good for cradle cap. I returned mine.</li>
    <li> The second I physically held this I knew it was a piece of junk! The bristles started falling out immediately in huge chunks- just holding it! I havent even used it on anyone yet! It is extremely soft and mushy, I doubt it would be effective for brushing. SO disappointed :-(</li>
    <li> Baby was born with a full head of hair -- this brush is perfect. As others mention, it is ridiculously soft, but that makes it ideal for brushing my newborn&#x27;s hair. He doesn&#x27;t mind at all. Today he smiled when I started brushing his head (he is 6 weeks old). Could see how it would not be helpful for all types of hair or ages of child. It is so soft you can brush their skin with it and I don&#x27;t think they would mind.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old has terrible tangling in the back of her head.  This brush is gentle &amp; seems to do the job on her fine baby hair.  It&#x27;s also her size, so she loves brushing her own hair too.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> A bit too soft for my 4 year olds hair. He has super fine hair but if his hair isn&#x27;t wet it doesn&#x27;t really do much of anything to put shape to his hair. Otherwise it&#x27;s a nice brush for a babies hair maybe.</li>
    <li> Baby brush, like baby-baby.  Extremely soft, and pretty useless after any &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; hair has grown in.  Its more for scalp care I think.</li>
    <li> Very soft and works well on my little baby boys hair, he loves it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for very fine hair</li>
    <li> nice soft brush that mildly sheds. Great for my little one.</li>
    <li> Got this brush, and used it after bath time, the next morning there were dark spots all over it, almost like it got moldy overnight!  Tossed it immediately.</li>
    <li> This brush has the softest bristles I have found on a brush. Our baby loves for us to use this brush, although she has very little hair.  I would recommend this for any newborn, and am looking forward to using it as she grows more hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is exactly what we wanted. Simple and oh so soft bristles for baby&#x27;s head. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this little brush and so does my daughter.  Her hair isn&#x27;t long enough yet to get tangled but I do like to brush her hair ofter bath and before we go somewhere. It makes her hair look so soft.  She likes to watch me brush her hair in the mirror.</li>
    <li> Nice little brush. Well-made &amp; it came nicely packaged. The bristles ar really super soft. It works great for one-year-old&#x27;s short, fine hair but may not be something she&#x27;ll be able to use for very long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m returning this because the bristles are too soft. When my daughters hair is wet it doesn&#x27;t comb through anything more than the top layer of hair</li>
    <li> Very soft bristles but they started falling out in clumps right away.  Returned this product as I think this can be a choking hazard for baby.</li>
    <li> My little one won&#x27;t let me use anything else on her hair.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> I love this brush for my newborn. It is super soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate her sensitive scalp. Also helps loosen cradle cap.</li>
    <li> was a little too soft.</li>
    <li> Although the quality of the product is great, the actual bristles are way to soft and don&#x27;t brush the hair at all. This would have been a great brush for a new born but not a toddler with hair.</li>
    <li> So this was a difficult review star wise.  Do I rate based on the product as it is, or as I wanted for my needs?  I guess it is on how it is portrayed vs. what I was hoping for.  Because as far as quality this is 5 stars.  I wanted a natural bristle brush that would brush through fine and thin toddler hair.  That would require a somewhat stiff bristle but not so stiff to be scratchy and painful for her.  The bristles on this brush are so soft and flexible that it barely brushes my newborns very fine hair which is only about a half inch long.  The bristles are luxurious, and could be used as a facial exfoliating brush they are so soft.  This is great if you are looking for this, but it is not a brush for any amount of hair.  This is definitely a newborn brush, and only if they don&#x27;t have much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the other review mistyped when they stated this was definitely for thick hair-they certainly meant definitely NOT for thick hair.</li>
    <li> Very very soft. I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s for newborn babies or for babies with very soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t quite work with curls</li>
    <li> This is so soft and we love it but an entire clump/section fell out within a few weeks of using. We still use it but it&#x27;s a real bummer that it started to fall apart so soon.</li>
    <li> I bout a few baby brushes and this is by far my favorite! It&#x27;s bristles are SO soft! It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Not for a toddler.Bristles are way too soft!Returned it.</li>
    <li> This is a quality brush but I found the bristles to be too soft to be effective (for use on a mustache/beard)</li>
    <li> just the cutest perfect baby brush for your newborns soft little head and scalp.</li>
    <li> The bristles are extremely soft and tend to shed often. It&#x27;s okay to brush my son&#x27;s hair now but will be completely for the cradle cap he&#x27;s developed and when his texture changes.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for: a super soft brush for my newborn&#x27;s fuzzy hair. If you have an older child with anything but the &amp;#34;duck fuzz,&amp;#34; I doubt these soft bristles would go through it. Have only used it a few times, but have not noticed any bristles coming out.</li>
    <li> My toddler has very short, thin, wispy hair, and this brush is soft, delicate and perfect to brush her hair.  Her thin hair tangles easily and for that this brush is gentle enough to brush through the tangles and untangle it.  The bristles are soft and the brush is good quality. Perfect for wet and dry hair. I can&#x27;t imagine that this brush would work on thick or very long hair.</li>
    <li> So soft, you&#x27;ll not find a better baby brush out there!</li>
    <li> My 3 month old has a lot of hair and this vrush works well. She also likes it because its so soft.</li>
    <li> Sucks!!!! Too darn soft won&#x27;t hardly brush any hair on a baby. The brittles fall off alot</li>
    <li> I bought this the first time and returned b/c it was very smashed and not what I thought it would be. Then I decided to try it again and was very impressed! It was worth a second chance and highly recommend for fine baby hair!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is the definition of quality. The bristles are very soft, perfect for a newborn&#x27;s delicate little head. The box does not specify what the bristles are made of, it only suggests they are all natural. I&#x27;m alright with that!</li>
    <li> bought this for brushing my newborn&#x27;s hair, which turned out to be totally unnecessary, but the brush is nice. no complaints.</li>
    <li> worked great when my baby was a newborn even though he had lots of hair, but ever since he was 4 months i couldn&#x27;t use this anymore it wouldn&#x27;t do anything..</li>
    <li> This is a comfortable brush to use, but the bristles are VERY soft.  The whole thing doesn&#x27;t work well for my daughter who has very thin, blonde hair.  I just wished the ultra-softness of the bristles were better described.  It&#x27;s otherwise a good baby brush.</li>
    <li> The brush is really soft so it will be suitable even for newborns. I bought this for my 1 yo. Even though the brush is soft, it is able to tame his hair even after waking from his sleep. Great brush!</li>
    <li> This was perfect for our newborns hair. It helped remove some of the crusties from birth and our newborn doesn&#x27;t seem to even notice we are brushing her hair. We tried using the comb we received from the hospital but this one is much softer and more tolerable for our newborn.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a face brush. It&#x27;s a very soft brush and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for actual hair, but it worked great on my face :)</li>
    <li> Very soft brush! Cute logo and packaged very nice.</li>
    <li> Arrived with a big chunk of bristles missing.  I returned it.  Nothing else to say about this.  Just not high quality I guess.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS.  IT IS NOT A HAIRBRUSH.  It would not brush my newborns fine hair and it went in the trash.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> Love this, it is super soft.</li>
    <li> Well, I bought this for my 18 month old and it did nothing! This brush is definitely only good for newborns.  The bristles are super soft but have not support to them for brushing through even the smallest amount of hair.  I would recommend it for a newborns sensitive head.</li>
    <li> Great brush for my lil girls hair.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Too soft even for a baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Ultra soft brissles are perfect for our boy. He&#x27;s virtually bald at near one year with extra fine hair only a quarter/half inch long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your kid has a full head of hair this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, these soft brissles Smooths the &amp;#34;bed-head&amp;#34; after a night of tossing and turning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wood and should have no bpa/bpb but you never know what type of glue they use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall we like it. It&#x27;s light and small enough he can handle to try and comb his own hair without hurting himself or to use as a chew toy (like everything else he comes across). No sharp edges.</li>
    <li> Brush was so soft, it would not grip my baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> great quality, just a little too soft to go through any hair. i would recommend this for a baby with not a lot of hair, but not a toddler</li>
    <li> Soft for the baby&#x27;s head but not effective.</li>
    <li> I use it to straighten the fringe on my rugs.  Works great!</li>
