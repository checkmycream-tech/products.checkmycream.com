      <li>, you will love them like I do.</li>
      <li>Turns out that most of them just do not get how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I figured that with all the nail polish remover, q-tips, cotton balls, etc that I use, I would save a lot of money and most of all TIME.  </li>
      <li>then I&#x27;ll get a touch up manicure from my manicurist to keep my nails looking healthy.</li>
      <li>Maybe I should practise more using it, but ....</li>
      <li>When they arrived i opened them and was happy to see they were not broken because the box had been smushed.</li>
      <li>: )</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I suffer from hand tremors and have never been able to paint my nails because of this.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Okay when I seen this product I thought &amp;#34;wow that is so cool&amp;#34; but after getting it and using them.</li>
      <li>has always been a bit of a challenge,  but these have made getting them done much more efficient.  </li>
      <li>Love.  </li>
      <li>If it was made from say a more flexible material I think would work much better</li>
      <li>Love.  </li>
      <li>I look forward to being able to buy lots more nail polish and not having to pay 15 bucks to have</li>
      <li>Love.  </li>
      <li>I love the size chart to record which stencil was used, and you can record more than one persons by putting their name or symbol their size on the chart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>nails look good, even on the right hand (</li>
      <li>Pretty good.</li>
      <li>worth the money, and I&#x27;m sure they will pay for themselves just in unwasted nail polish!</li>
      <li>Perfectly clean lines with no paint on my skin!</li>
      <li>good product i just need to practice more because it takes a steady hand, and know how.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Some tips - please make sure to fit each one for the nail specifically - not your finger.  </li>
      <li>It was a bit flimsier than expected, but it does a great job in making sure your nail polish ends up on your nails!</li>
      <li>Cleanup is also easy.</li>
      <li>but to get the best performance and to get all the nail covered you have to use a size down for your fingers.</li>
      <li>I&amp;#34;m very petite,4&#x27;10&amp;#34; and was able to find the perfect fit, plus there was enough for my Daughter in law who is taller to make a set for her self!!</li>
      <li>I managed just fine, though...</li>
      <li>There are a variety of sizes, I sorted out the ones that fit my fingers best and snugly in a little plastic container with my polishes.  </li>
      <li>Clean up is easy too.  </li>
      <li>And My update - as I continue to use them - they are indispensable for tip of the finger touch ups.  </li>
      <li>Variety of sizes to fit fingers.  </li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t really fit, and are cheaply made.</li>
      <li>but they really do work and help my manicures look better  :)</li>
      <li>- make sure to paint right on the devices themselves too - that way your polish goes to the edge of your nail.  </li>
      <li>works best with low-profile, high arched nails, especially acrylics</li>
      <li>One very good thing about these stencils is that the excess polish comes off them easily, even when polish dried on it.</li>
      <li>mani and have awesome nails everyday!</li>
      <li>I tried every clean up stick made and non of them worked for me.  </li>
      <li>I read the reviews, put the right sizes on and voila!</li>
      <li>Overall a good product</li>
      <li>The good news is that once you have them - you have them - one set should last you</li>
      <li>and my hands are often unsteady and these pink guides have come in very handy for me.  </li>
      <li>but i figured out that the trade off (having super clean polish lines on the sides) would be worth it.</li>
      <li>Just fix any chips then repaint the top third of the nail - recover with a top coat and you are set.  </li>
      <li>so I was sure some clever person had to have a solution.  </li>
      <li>The infomercial looked too good to be true and other people&#x27;s video reviews of them online -</li>
      <li>Worked great for me - no dings or missing polish.  </li>
      <li>If you are messy, as I am with polish, this is a great invention.  </li>
      <li>You do have to find the sizes that fit very snug on the finger tip</li>
      <li>That alone makes this worth the price.  </li>
      <li>I do not think it is worth the price because of the pain associated.</li>
      <li>They slip easily onto the fingertips and, as long as you use the right size, are very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Just find the right size for each finger and slide them on.</li>
      <li>I was so right.  </li>
      <li>Some are just right and do work</li>
      <li>and im right handed)</li>
      <li>so the sizes aren&#x27;t quite right.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for my mom on mother&#x27;s day and thought that the plastic pieces worked for the french tip as well as cleaning up the nail. When I got it I was wrong, it was just tape. Not what I expected at all, and I definitely did not pay that much for tape.</li>
    <li> I happened upon this on youtube and was very impressed.When I searched it and saw the price I decided against buying it because of the price($20something for plastic, no way).  I like to do my nail every 4-5 days and got tired of all the clean up and decided that this just might be worth it.  I figured that with all the nail polish remover, q-tips, cotton balls, etc that I use, I would save a lot of money and most of all TIME.  I was so right.  No polish on the sides of my nails and very little by my cuticle.  I also used them for nail stamping. That alone makes this worth the price.  I use an extra large stamper and instead of rolling from one side to the other, I center the design on the middle of my nail and roll to one side and then back to the other side.  The excess polish goes on the stencil and not on the sides of my nails.  Very little clean up on my cuticles.  I just don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews.  I love these and they seem like they will last a long time.  Clean up is easy too.  I just scrap off the dried nail polish with an orange stick. (again saves on remover)&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is that even though it has extras of some of them, they don&#x27;t have extras of the ones I need.( i need 2 6&#x27;s for each hand) but the fact that I do one hand at a time makes it work out ok.&lt;br /&gt;If you like saving time and money doing your nails,get this, you will love them like I do.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help as much as I hoped they would</li>
    <li> The idea is nice but material hurt your fingers when using it</li>
    <li> These are perfection. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t really fit, and are cheaply made. They don&#x27;t work like the picture suggest, and are very hard to fit on your nails. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these if I were you.</li>
    <li> My main nail polish challenge is painting the edge/end of the nail (for a longer lasting manicure) without getting polish on my finger tips.  I was hoping this product would solve that issue since it appears to go under the nail tip.  Unfortunately it goes flat across the finger tip, and leaves all the skin exposed that I typically end up getting paint on.  The only skin that this product protects are the flat sides of the nails, which are the only parts I never have any problem staying within the lines on.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how many people out there are challenged by the flat sides of the nail, but not the actual cuticle bed or nail tip - but I imagine this product would work for them.  For the rest of us - this is not worth the money, application time, or space in our homes.</li>
    <li> Work well...nice quality.</li>
    <li> perfect for my daughter to paint her nails.</li>
    <li> Awesome stencils they work well love them</li>
    <li> It was a bit flimsier than expected, but it does a great job in making sure your nail polish ends up on your nails!</li>
    <li> Product priced too high for what you get. Works well looks good</li>
    <li> this is a clever product and it does work. but to get the best performance and to get all the nail covered you have to use a size down for your fingers. and that really hurts. but i just suck it up. nails look good, even on the right hand (and im right handed)</li>
    <li> This is really a great product,  and although the price is kind of steep for what it is,  im  very glad I purchased these.  I have 3 young children and so finding time to do my nails has always been a bit of a challenge,  but these have made getting them done much more efficient.  They really do work,  and since I&#x27;m not spending so much time worrying  about getting paint all over my fingers,  I get them done in half the time.  I was initially worried about having a raised paint line where the polish hit the guide,  but I tried taking them off after waiting for them to set a minute but we&#x27;re still wet and I have had no problems.  People have also complained about them being painful,  which they can be if you choose too small of a size,  but they give you quite a few sizes to choose from so I just went to the next size up.  Even if it was a little big,  it still worked fine.  Overall a good product and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I spent $22 on these and IMHO - they are maybe worth $5.  They keep a little of the polish off, but they&#x27;re a pain to put and keep on, they&#x27;re flimsy, and took way more time to use than just putting the stickers on and cleaning up my nails after the fact.</li>
    <li> I am unfortunately sick &amp; I&#x27;m unable to go have my nails done every 2 weeks, like I use to. this product allows me to apply the polish with a professional look, regardless of which hand I use. now I go to get a pedi about every 6-8 weeks depending on how I&#x27;m feeling. then I&#x27;ll get a touch up manicure from my manicurist to keep my nails looking healthy.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my 9 year old because she likes to paint her nails and i didn&#x27;t want to hear her complain anymore about getting it all over her fingers. now her complaint is that the stencils hurt her fingers even when she goes up to the next size.</li>
    <li> Maybe my fingers are just weird sizes, but either the stencils are way too tight and hurt to have on, or they fall off my fingertip. Some are just right and do work well - in those instances it makes painting my dominant hand much much easier, but thats only the case with maybe half my fingers. overall, i like the product well enough.</li>
    <li> These do not work.  the polish still leaks through the sides even when they are on tight.</li>
    <li> when you take it of it damage the nail</li>
    <li> Best part of the product is it arrived on time, and is as described. However for the product to truly work it will pinch your finger pretty bad because you have to go with a smaller size. also it doesn&#x27;t cover your eponychium (the fleshy part at the bottom of the nail). Yes i knew from the picture that it wouldn&#x27;t but i figured out that the trade off (having super clean polish lines on the sides) would be worth it. I don&#x27;t plan on using it but will not return it either because it&#x27;s just not worth my time. I do not think it is worth the price because of the pain associated. But my verdict is that it does work however, painfully.</li>
    <li> it doesnt serve the purpose</li>
    <li> These work great, with zero cleanup needed after painting the nails. Just find the right size for each finger and slide them on. Paint your nails, and once they&#x27;re dry, slip the stencils off. Perfectly clean lines with no paint on my skin! I can&#x27;t wait to try the stickers that came with it for a &amp;#34;french&amp;#34; manicure!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. First time I ever got it right and didn&#x27;t have to acetone it all off again. Finally I can do my Wednesday &amp;#34;between manis&amp;#34; mani and have awesome nails everyday! I read the reviews, put the right sizes on and voila! No nail polish on my fingers, nor around my nail or mysteriously all over my hands. Plus, added bonus , keeping them on prevented me from messing it up before the polish dried. I LOVE Creanails!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to get these things.  The infomercial looked too good to be true and other people&#x27;s video reviews of them online - well let&#x27;s just say those people made it seem like they didn&#x27;t work that well.  Turns out that most of them just do not get how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no issues with mine - although of course I have suggestions about how they can improve them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They definitely work and definitely fit just fine - plenty of sizes to choose from (although I could have used a size between a 2 and 3 and between a 4 and 5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They really made a big difference - especially when painting my right hand (I am a rightie).  Seriously - a big difference with only slight messes at my cuticles - too bad there is no device to guard against that area yet... Plus my polish was still able to go to the edges of my nail for complete coverage (almost complete coverage - I think there may have been a side sliver missed on two of my nails - very slight - only me being anal. : ).  I was actually pretty impressed.  And I used a dark polish for my first attempt at using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips - please make sure to fit each one for the nail specifically - not your finger.  (This may have been the issue with some video reviews because the polish did not get too far towards the edges of the nail - these people seem to choose sizes to fit on their fingers as opposed to their nails...not a good choice.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - make sure to paint right on the devices themselves too - that way your polish goes to the edge of your nail.  (Again some videos - the people tried to stay away from painting on the device and missed the edges of their nails.  That defeats the entire purpose of these things.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And - based on some video reviews too - if your nails are extremely short - like you bite them or they are broken way down - do not bother with this product.  They will only work if you have some nail growth so that the device can hook under your nail top.  If your nails fall just a bit over the tip of your finger should do if squared off.  And they should be fine for really long nails too - not tallons - but longer nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing they will hopefully change - I wish that the bigger sizes were shorter - my thumb was a size 8 - but due to how thumbs are shaped the guard was not as snug to the nail as I would have liked since the thumb finger kind of curves a bit.  If they were one third shorter in length that would have helped to keep them even closer to the nail. I managed just fine, though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh - and a trick to get them off neatly while your nails dry - give them just a few minutes to slightly set - then from the top of your nails on both sides of the device - push them down towards the other side of your finger - almost like squeezing them down - then slide off the top of your finger.  Worked great for me - no dings or missing polish.  If you are hesitant - just wait for your polish to dry, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway - I would say to definitely try these - they made a HUGE difference for me.  The sizes were plenty to choose from - although like I said some half sizes would have helped me make it even easier. : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the price seems a little steep for little platic tips - but I guess they have invented something that is not available in a lot of places - and really does work - so I guess we have to pay a premium right now.  The good news is that once you have them - you have them - one set should last you just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***  And My update - as I continue to use them - they are indispensable for tip of the finger touch ups.  (My secret for getting manicures to last two plus weeks.)  Just fix any chips then repaint the top third of the nail - recover with a top coat and you are set.  These little things make for quick and neat work of that!!!  Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh - and I forgot to mention - I can only do one hand at a time - having these things on the hand you are polishing with just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Again - not too bad as I can carefully slip them off the one hand just polished and put them right on - carefully - the other hand and polish away.ing with just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Again - not too bad as I can carefully slip them off the one hand just polished and put them right on - carefully - the other hand and polish away.</li>
    <li> It is not perfect, but it does help avoid majority of smudges - choose the size that fits really tightly around your nails - it will dig into your finger skin but this is the only way to avoid smudges.</li>
    <li> Great item, easy to use</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about these because of the price, but I figured it couldn&#x27;t be any worse then some other gadgets I&#x27;ve seen. Thankfully they really do work! While they&#x27;re not &#x27;fool proof&#x27; they do give you an easier time of painting your own nails. I still get the occasional stray line, but I think that&#x27;s more because I have fat fingers so the sizes aren&#x27;t quite right. However it&#x27;s only one finger so 9/10 isn&#x27;t bad at all. Cleanup is also easy. I just let them dry then peel off the paint later once it&#x27;s time to use them again.</li>
    <li> I have shaky hands and sooo often am &amp;#34;outside&amp;#34; the lines when I try to do my polish.  This set makes neat and tidy nails a breeze!  So many different sizes to use.  I&amp;#34;m very petite,4&#x27;10&amp;#34; and was able to find the perfect fit, plus there was enough for my Daughter in law who is taller to make a set for her self!!</li>
    <li> Crea nails sound like the perfect invention for proffesional looking nails. When they arrived i opened them and was happy to see they were not broken because the box had been smushed. I tried them and they would not fit on my fingers. Either they were too tight or for abnormal alien hands. I am very disappointed. This was a waste of my money and i cant return it. I am NOT a happy customer! The only good part is the french strips which i am yet to try. Do not buy these if you dont feel like wasting your money.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;NOT A HAPPY GIRL</li>
    <li> My wife loves this thing and her nails look very nice and sexy. Happy wife, happy home...</li>
    <li> works best with low-profile, high arched nails, especially acrylics</li>
    <li> Help not very dirty the corners of the fingers. And it is good to make gradients nails.</li>
    <li> excellent product, arrived on time, girlfriend says she loves it. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this product. The fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my cuticles being covered in nail polish when I&#x27;m trying to do an ombr&amp;eacute; or sponge look is amazing. I&#x27;m a nail polish and nail art fanatic, I just wish I bought this product sooner.</li>
    <li> These are ok - but awkward to use.  You still have to watch out for the cuticle area as that isn&#x27;t covered.  The only product I found to help self nail painting.  :)  Pretty good.</li>
    <li> good product i just need to practice more because it takes a steady hand, and know how.  Practice makes perfect</li>
    <li> Love.  Love.  Love.  I have wanted to do my own nails for a while because I want to save money.  However, I just suck at it because I would get the polish all over my skin.  I tried every clean up stick made and non of them worked for me.  I knew getting polish on the skin was a problem self-polishers suffer from so I was sure some clever person had to have a solution.  So, I typed in nail polish guide and crenails popped up.  I read the reviews  and watched a youtube video and decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions from the youtube video and for the first time EVER, my nails look great.  Not one bit of polish on my skin.  I love it.  It is perfect!!!</li>
    <li> The bonus was not in the box and they were dirt and looked they had been used.  I ordered new not used and the box said there was a bonus but then there wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> not easy to use.. it&#x27;s a nice concept, but given the stencil is hard plastics, it is just very hard to get a perfect polish with this. Maybe I should practise more using it, but ....</li>
    <li> Great.  Variety of sizes to fit fingers.  No more mess doing the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; hand.  These are great when applying the press on polish too, keeps the nail exposed and positioned so you can smoothly apply the decals.  I love the size chart to record which stencil was used, and you can record more than one persons by putting their name or symbol their size on the chart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side is you have to wait to dry a minute or two before removing them in order to polish the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; hand, it&#x27;s a little awkward to work with them on.</li>
    <li> Well  the concept is good but I think the material it is made from should be different.  It is made of a hard plastic so although there are many sizes it may not always fit snug or comfortably. If it was made from say a more flexible material I think would work much better</li>
    <li> works pretty well to keep mail polish off skin</li>
    <li> This is helpful for such unprofessional person to polish my nails.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy item.  It really makes clean-up easier after after sponge painting my nails.</li>
    <li> Perfect for someone that just can&#x27;t seem to get their nails perfect. The only thing, that are a little tight once you put them on but, good. Great product</li>
    <li> which is all that needs to be said.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t worked well for me yet, but it may just require practice.</li>
    <li> These slide on easily and work great for the bottom 3/4&#x27;s of your fingernails.  The problem is the top part is where I mess up the painting the most.</li>
    <li> If you are messy, as I am with polish, this is a great invention.  Easy to use and accommodates my extra small nail beds.  If you are in the least bit skeptical about buying this product to assist with nail polishing don’t be, it works great.  The guides allow you to polish really close to the cuticle without polishing your skin …… Just what I needed!</li>
    <li> Seems like a silly product but they really do work and help my manicures look better  :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even bother - seriously pure junk.  I don&#x27;t know what I thought I would be buying, but this was a waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> Okay when I seen this product I thought &amp;#34;wow that is so cool&amp;#34; but after getting it and using them. Nope they were not worth it for me. All they did was make a mess.</li>
    <li> I suffer from hand tremors and have never been able to paint my nails because of this. I was sick of buying those costly nail polish strips and turned to Amazon and found this. I was hesitant to purchase this product because of the negative reviews, but thank God I thought better of it and bought it anyway! I just received these in the mail and the worked perfectly.  You do have to find the sizes that fit very snug on the finger tip and that was a little painful, but my nails look great! I look forward to being able to buy lots more nail polish and not having to pay 15 bucks to have a salon professional paint my nails!</li>
    <li> I ordered these from Amazon after putting them in my wish list and staring at them for a while; I am one of those people who CANNOT put nail polish on just my nails.  I have spent many hours applying polish to my fingernails only to take it off again because of the awful job I&#x27;ve done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you see in the picture on Amazon is what you get:  small plastic tips that you slide on the ends of your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived yesterday and I tried them this morning. The tips are numbered and there is a little card where you can record what number goes on each finger.  They slip easily onto the fingertips and, as long as you use the right size, are very comfortable.  Essentially, the tips create a barrier between the sides of your nails and your skin;  this means the only &#x27;line&#x27; you have to worry about is your cuticle line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is amazing.  I look like I&#x27;ve just had a professional manicure.  I&#x27;m so excited about these little miracles that I&#x27;m convinced I could now try some nail art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money, and I&#x27;m sure they will pay for themselves just in unwasted nail polish!</li>
    <li> Great gizmo! Works very well. Less mess when manicuring on the \\&quot;other\\&quot; hand.  Variety of sizes, may be a bit tight the first time you use them, better snug than loose.  *Before putting on stencils make sure you already have your polishes lined up and the tops loose, it is difficult to do this with the stencils on, and be sure you tighten the polish tops again after you remove the stencils.*  One very good thing about these stencils is that the excess polish comes off them easily, even when polish dried on it. I took another stencil and scraped the polish off with no effort: wipe with a tissue or pad. If not completely dried, some polishes just roll off with a little rubbing.</li>
    <li> I like it. Must have for messy starters. I gave it four stars because it is expensive. I would pay maximum $9.99 and not $24.99</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well these work! I can polish my nails MUCH faster without having to worry about the nail polish overlapping the sides of my nails.There was a clean, straight edge after I removed the plastic CreaNails stencils and my manicure looked very professional. This is the first time I&#x27;ve polished my nails when I didn&#x27;t have to dig out the polish from around my skin using a toothpick, Q tip or polish remover BUT I was a bit more careful when applying the polish at my cuticle bed which the stencils do not protect. The only clean up I had was removing the overlapped polish from the stencils after my polish dried. Extremely clever product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:I have very small nails so I purchased the kids set and they are a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> I bought my CreaNail guides on eBay. I don&#x27;t see well anymore and my hands are often unsteady and these pink guides have come in very handy for me.  When I try to do my nails I seem to get the polish all over the sides of my nails, especially if I need to do multiple coats (base, color and top).  There are a variety of sizes, I sorted out the ones that fit my fingers best and snugly in a little plastic container with my polishes.  The white guide strips for the french nails are disposable and easily replaced, the pink guides that fit onto your finger are plastic and reusable.  When my pink guides get smeared with layers of polishing goofs I clean mine carefully with a cue-tip and some Non-Acetone nail polish remover and they are just like new.  These are great help for klutzy people like me.</li>
