    <li> Just what I was looking for.  Not too large and not too small. . The perfect size for pushing the front of your hair back.</li>
    <li> what you see is what you get these are durable they hold the hair well.</li>
    <li> Cute, fun to wear, and come in several colors.  Great for kids, but I&#x27;m no kid, and I like them, especially days when my hair looks less-than-great!  Perks me up!</li>
    <li> I liked these basic metal barrettes because they match so many outfits... I ordered two packs because of the good price.</li>
    <li> The colors in the set of clip are great, but the quality if poor.  The paint was chipping on them when I pulled them out of the box when they were delivered.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old has thick curly hair.  These clips aren&#x27;t  big enough to hold her hair away from her face.  I could use them to secure fly-aways in a pony tail, but that&#x27;s it.  I&#x27;m saving them for that purpose, but for what I wanted to use them for, I was disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> These clips won&#x27;t stay in my grandaughter&#x27;s hair.  They just fall right out.  I should return them, but it&#x27;s too much trouble.</li>

    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I paid $5.00 for these... ugh.</li>
    <li> Work well and stay on my toddlers hair.</li>
    <li> Smaller hair clips, works well for my little girl because she doesn&#x27;t notice them. They are small so I worry that she could swallow them.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a small clip for my hair. I have baby fine, thin hair and clips that way too much tend to slip out of my hair. Not so with these. I am very pleased.</li>

    <li> These hold my 5 yr olds bangs back perfectly.</li>

    <li> A little smaller than expected but it fixes little fly-aways if necessary.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Works well on my three year old daughter&#x27;s fine hair. No snagging, which is great. She can open and close them and get them out of her hair too.</li>
