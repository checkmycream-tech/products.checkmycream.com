    <li> Exact fit Great Price!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the quality of this product.  Because I have a longer (rather than wide) nose, I needed to upgrade from the standard nose cushion.  Works great.</li>
    <li> The design was very close to my current mask.  my actually fit better.of course it worked perfectly IFyou can wear it.  It really STINKS.  I washed it with Lysol fragrant hand soap.  It did nothing.  Then I wased it with pol olive dish liquid and there was only a slight improvement.  Then I tried rubbing alcohol, that helped a little too. Was this mask packed in an old industrial oil drum a left to age for 6 months?  I don&#x27;t know who is at fault, the manufacturer or the realtor.  And concidering I have had other masks from this manufacturer I&#x27;m looking at the handling/storage by the retailer.&lt;br /&gt;Then again in some factory in China the line worker didn&#x27;t have enough reagents so tossed some lead chips into the vat.  Which added fine shine.</li>
    <li> Mask was a perfect replacement.</li>
    <li> I use a sleep mask and I needed a replacement nose pillow badly. The manufacture charge almost $100 I found it here for a great price!!</li>

    <li> Same as the local medical branch, but for less money. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I was unable to afford getting new equipment from my doctor since I lost my insurance, so I looked around for the parts I needed and what do you know, I found them on Amazon for a cheaper price (no surprise). Anyway, the product arrived before the expect by date and in excellent New Condition. So now i am back to using my CPAP machine like I need to and it no longer has a weird smell</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement, but wasn&#x27;t sure if my previous cushion was the &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; or the regular.  I was worried if I ordered the wide that it might not be interchangeable.

    <li> I have been on the CPAP machine for years and I have tried numerous mask even the most latest but I have not found one yet as good as this one.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we needed. It works great. Fits perfect.</li>
    <li> This fit perfectly in my cpap and was a great deal. I will definitely purchase again. If you don&#x27;t have insurance or your copay is more than the price of this go ahead and get this one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Fits the standard Mirage FX nasal mask system. For me personally, this Wide mask offers a better fit than the standard size that originally came with my mask.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace and maintain. Durable product.</li>
