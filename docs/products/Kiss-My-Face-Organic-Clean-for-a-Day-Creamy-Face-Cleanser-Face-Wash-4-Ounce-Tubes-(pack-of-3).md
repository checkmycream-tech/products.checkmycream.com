      <li>Works well and has a nice fresh citrus scent.</li>
      <li>And it smells fantastic (like a creamsicle).</li>

      <li>Although mild it still makes my face feel clean!</li>
      <li>Great products, very gentle for sensitive skin and lightly scented.</li>

      <li>I love this product because it gets my face really clean, including removing makeup, and leaves my skin feeling super soft.  </li>
      <li>The smell of oranges is fresh, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a replacement for Mary Kay, something more natural.  </li>
      <li>My skin can get oily, but is too sensitive for most face washes.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this product totally feels great and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
      <li>I have tried for years to find the right face wash for my face.</li>
      <li>It has a clean scent &amp; rinses very well.  </li>
      <li>This cleanser certainly kept my face clean and prevented breakouts, but left my skin more oily than it has ever been.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great as a makeup remover (although wouldn&#x27;t use it for eye makeup necessarily), and good for the occasional deeper cleanse, but I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
      <li>Great EWG reviews and hard to find.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam up, but most cleansers foam simply because they&#x27;re loaded with chemicals.</li>
      <li>I have used them religiously for six years, and I was able to see and feel a difference in my skin within one month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin like mine, and I&#x27;m becoming addicted to the KMF Organic line.  </li>
      <li>Used to buy from Whole Foods then they stopped selling.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
      <li>It leaves my face clean and not dry at all.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin with rosacea tendencies and this product is very gentle.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a full five stars is because there may be something out there</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I love that this has little to no chemical ingredients in it.</li>
      <li>I use it morning and night and it rinses cleanly from the face and doesn&#x27;t dry the face out.</li>
      <li>Normally if something doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin (which is just aboute verything) it reacts immediately.</li>
      <li>I have more combination skin, but a lot of facial cleansers can dry out my skin, so</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for almost a month and, while my face does certainly feel more moisturized, it also feels oily even after only a few hours of washing it with this product.  </li>
      <li>only warning I would offer to anyone who is buying for the first time - this is NOT a foaming cleanser.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented with other all-natural creamy cleansers out of curiosity, like the Sukin one, but they left my face oily and my eyes stinging, so this one remains my all-time favorite.</li>
      <li>but as far as taking off my face at the end of the day......</li>
      <li>I also really like the KMF facial creme and sunscreen and the Eyewitness Eye Cream.</li>
      <li>It really does, as other reviewers have said, smell like a creamsicle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always surprised at how long one tube lasts me.</li>
      <li>Before it I used popular brands which left my skin blotchy and red, so I&#x27;d always feel uncomfortable without concealer.</li>
      <li>Face wash for sensitive or dry skin leaves it too oily.</li>
      <li>Little tip - you don&#x27;t need to use too much, a pea sized squeeze will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have tried for years to find the right face wash for my face. My skin can get oily, but is too sensitive for most face washes. Face wash intended for &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin usually dries my face out and leaves it red. Face wash for sensitive or dry skin leaves it too oily. This face wash is perfect. It is creamy, but still gets my face clean. No redness. No oiliness. And it smells fantastic (like a creamsicle).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  It leaves my face clean and not dry at all.  So long bar soap!</li>
    <li> I seek this product out and it&#x27;s the only thing I have used on my face for several years; I&#x27;m addicted to the smell! Also, my face feels so refreshed and energized after using it. Little tip - you don&#x27;t need to use too much, a pea sized squeeze will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this organic face wash.  I feel like I get a very clean face without irritation.  My acne has improved greatly since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it gets my face really clean, including removing makeup, and leaves my skin feeling super soft.  Plus the Amazon price is great compared to my local drugstore.</li>
    <li> I also use the exfoliating face wash for \\&quot;dirtier days\\&quot; (like after hiking or other grubby activities).  This wash is great too, much creamier and non-drying.  Contact lens wearers should be cautioned, the creamy-ness can leave a slightly oily feeling in and around your eyes, so you should remove your lenses before washing.  It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin like mine, and I&#x27;m becoming addicted to the KMF Organic line.  I bought in three&#x27;s to save $$$.  Great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> If I had known this didn&#x27;t suds up at all I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. It&#x27;s ok as a morning face wash but as far as taking off my face at the end of the day......I&#x27;ve gotta have some suds!</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser but I am not too sure about the way it smells.  It isn&#x27;t bad but not as refreshing as others.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the Kiss My Face organic facial products.  I have used them religiously for six years, and I was able to see and feel a difference in my skin within one month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great as a cleanser; it rinses clean and leaves your skin feeling refreshed.  The smell of oranges is fresh, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only warning I would offer to anyone who is buying for the first time - this is NOT a foaming cleanser.  It still gets your skin clean, but don&#x27;t expect suds.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two years and I love both the scent and what it does for my skin. Before it I used popular brands which left my skin blotchy and red, so I&#x27;d always feel uncomfortable without concealer. With this one I don&#x27;t even need to use any foundation. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best at taking eye makeup off, but I just buy wipes for that. I&#x27;m always surprised at how long one tube lasts me.The exfoliating version works almost just as well, but leaves my face a tad dry.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented with other all-natural creamy cleansers out of curiosity, like the Sukin one, but they left my face oily and my eyes stinging, so this one remains my all-time favorite.</li>
    <li> This gentle, natural cleanser works wonderfully, and has a very light, non-offensive scent.  I highly recommend it!  I do wish that the bottle was a little larger for the price, however.</li>
    <li> This is a good cleanser. It really does, as other reviewers have said, smell like a creamsicle. I have dry, relatively sensitive skin, and this cleanser doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my face. It doesn&#x27;t foam up, but most cleansers foam simply because they&#x27;re loaded with chemicals. This one isn&#x27;t, and it cleans my face well. I use this with my Clarisonic, and they pair nicely together.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is awesome! It smells great, feels great and my super sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t had any reaction in the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it. Normally if something doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin (which is just aboute verything) it reacts immediately. This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> I have more combination skin, but a lot of facial cleansers can dry out my skin, so I was looking for a cleanser that would help keep my skin hydrated.  This cleanser certainly kept my face clean and prevented breakouts, but left my skin more oily than it has ever been.  I&#x27;ve used this product for almost a month and, while my face does certainly feel more moisturized, it also feels oily even after only a few hours of washing it with this product.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll put away the rest of the tube until winter when my skin even drier and see how it works then.  It does not have added fragrances, but there is something in the formula that makes my skin burn slightly after washing - not enough to make me stop using the product, but just so that I notice.</li>
    <li> I was sent a sample of this cleanser and was very surprised to find that it removed my mascara and did a great job at removing dirt and makeup.  Currently I&#x27;ve been using a Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange essence facial cleanser, Clinique take the day off Eye make-up remover, and Burt&#x27;s Bees Rosewater toner...  3 Steps!  With the KMF cleanser it removed everything and when I checked for any leftover dirt or makeup by using the toner, the cotton ball was clean!  Woohoo!  I&#x27;m buying this cleanser today.  I also really like the KMF facial creme and sunscreen and the Eyewitness Eye Cream.</li>
    <li> Great products, very gentle for sensitive skin and lightly scented.</li>
    <li> This product burned my face. I was using it for a period of 4 weeks and my face gradually became dryer until it looked all red and splotchy. It got to the point that it hurt to put my moisturizer after using this cleanser. I am very disappointed as I was trying to go all natural with my skincare regimen.</li>
    <li> I have used the moisturizer &amp; loved it.  This cleanser is not oily &amp; removes all my make up &amp; mascara so&lt;br /&gt;easily.  It has a clean scent &amp; rinses very well.  I recommend to all skin types.  I have dry skin &amp; does not&lt;br /&gt;make my skin tight &amp; dry.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was a little thicker.  It will run off your fingers if you don&#x27;t apply it quickly</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it is really is nice on the skin and I love how creamy and moisturizing it is. Isn&#x27;t harsh like other face washes. Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Not perfumey but rather like fresh citrus (ah, the alpha hydroxies!) I use it morning and night and it rinses cleanly from the face and doesn&#x27;t dry the face out.</li>
    <li> Have loved this face wash for awhile. Now I buy this pack every couple of months for me and my girls. Used to buy from Whole Foods then they stopped selling. I&#x27;ve also bought from another vendor but it was a bit pricey. Found this 3-pack on Amazon and now I only buy it here. We each get a face wash and I write our initials so I know which kid is using mine that month lol. But really love this product and the 3- pack ordering option. Once you add the toner and moisturizer it&#x27;s just a perfect combo. Smells good too! If you like a tangerine refreshing smell in the morning which I love. Will continue to purchase from Amazon.</li>
    <li> The best face cleanser for dry skin on the planet!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash! It smells so good, feels great on my skin, and totally takes my make up off. I have sensitive skin and this product totally feels great and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all. I&#x27;ve been using if for years and I am totally hooked. I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a replacement for Mary Kay, something more natural.  It&#x27;s a clean smelling, light, and effective cleaner.</li>
    <li> Great EWG reviews and hard to find.  Works well and has a nice fresh citrus scent.</li>
    <li> I like it because it does a good job without a lot of unpronounceable and suspect ingredients. I am paying more attention  to what I use and eat than I used to.</li>
    <li> Love this face cleanser.  Cleans well without drying or creating an oily surface.  I have oily skin that gets very dry and needs moisture but need to be careful not to create an oily surface.  My face has actually stopped breaking out and it seems to help my Rosacia as well.</li>
    <li> I love that this has little to no chemical ingredients in it. My face tends to have a combination complexion, prone to both dryness and breakouts, and this is just a bit too drying for my skin. It&#x27;s great as a makeup remover (although wouldn&#x27;t use it for eye makeup necessarily), and good for the occasional deeper cleanse, but I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin with rosacea tendencies and this product is very gentle.  Although mild it still makes my face feel clean! The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a full five stars is because there may be something out there that&#x27;s even better but until I find it, I will use this faithfully.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get tricked guys! It comes with only one pack instead of pack of 3.</li>
