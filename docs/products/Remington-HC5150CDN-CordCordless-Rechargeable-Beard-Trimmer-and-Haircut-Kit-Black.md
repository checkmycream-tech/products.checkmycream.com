      <li>Glad I have no need of it.</li>

      <li>I love that it will work when its plugged in</li>

      <li>I also love that it&#x27;s cordless</li>
      <li>I have struggled with getting a close shave for many moons now,</li>
      <li>I love this product, recommend everyone checks it out if you are in need.</li>
      <li>Nice smooth cut and doesnt grab and pull the hair.</li>
      <li>The only reason why this didn&#x27;t receive a perfect score is because of the color.</li>
      <li>I love how he looks, and so does he. :-)     </li>
      <li>Ive tried every trimmer and this is the only one that is the best.</li>
      <li>I have used this device 2 times so far and have been pretty impressed with it.  </li>
      <li>Such a good item for the price!</li>
      <li>However, the slider is made of plastic, and can easily break.</li>
      <li>It has been running for about 40 minutes of runtime and is still going strong.    </li>
      <li>simply add this to your list its Fabulous!!! :)</li>
      <li>He likes a close cut, and it works fine.  </li>
      <li>Ideal for full on hair cuts, as well as sideburn and facial hair trimming.</li>
      <li>Now I can get a quick haircut without having to pay 20 bucks for it!  </li>
      <li>i liked my last one fine, but this remington product is better in every way!  </li>
      <li>I am glad that I had faith in all of the positive reviews, and here is one more to add to the mix.    </li>
      <li>This little gadget is perfect gift for any man in your life ladies.</li>
      <li>The attachments / guide that adjusts beard length is huge in size.  </li>
      <li>This is great for facial hair and the excess hair that men have at the neck line.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s quiet, holds a great charge, and shaves my head (with no guard attached) even closer.  </li>
      <li>Someone tell me what you can use this for if it doesn&#x27;t cut close without the guard and the one adjustable setting guard doesn&#x27;t fit into place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It did a very good job on my beard making everything even and sharp looking.  </li>
      <li>Very useful in my family.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I have fine hair that grows fast, so I will get better.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband and the attachment does not stay on, falls right off!  </li>
      <li>i shave my head, so a good cordless clipper is a big deal to me.  </li>
      <li>Not bad.  </li>
      <li>Its perfect for men who want a fast cut after the shower so its good on wet or dry hair.</li>
      <li>This cordless haircut kit is easy to use and creates a nice final effect.  </li>
      <li>But the clippings were everywhere, so it worked super.  </li>
      <li>I wanted something more along the size of a normal beard trimmer and not a hair clipper.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why so many businesses now treat you really well the first time, then take it for granted thereafter</li>
      <li>(Amazon is consistent, hence the repeat biz!).  </li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t use the adjustable guard very often, but the couple times i have it worked fine.  </li>
      <li>The battery charge holds for a decent amount of time and the head seems to be tilted at a pretty good angle so that I can actually get a clean shave.</li>
      <li>The price and the quality are just right.</li>
      <li>Last winter I entered an ice-sculpting contest for the first time and only used these clippers, my near perfect 18ft recreation of Venus de Milo took first place!    </li>
      <li>This would be good for a young man to learn with if they can grow facial</li>
      <li>I started off with a larger, more powerful Remington model that lasted for six years.</li>
      <li>It was very reasonably priced, so I bought it and brought it home.</li>
      <li>It was a very reasonable price for the size and quality.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It does a pretty good job, but if you are looking for a narrow beard trimmer, this is NOT what you want.  </li>
      <li>Why my husband didn&#x27;t say anything when I first gave it to him</li>
      <li>I have a pretty dense bear</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>It works really well!</li>
      <li>The battery charged for 14 hours the first time, and I have not had to charge it again.  </li>
      <li>I ordered these clippers for my dad and returned them after the first use.  </li>
      <li>the plus side, the battery does last a while, and you can use it while its plugged in, unlike others in this price range, hey :-)</li>
      <li>First time I used it, it died halfway through my head.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cordless haircut kit is easy to use and creates a nice final effect.  I used it on my two nephews and the results were quite good.  An excellent value!</li>
    <li> This is the best clipper I have ever used. It leaves me with a clean shave;I can be confident about going out in public after I use it knowing that my face is clear of all unwanted hair. The battery life on it is also excellent. Very solid product.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer! Have saved lots of money by cutting my husband&#x27;s hairwith this trimmer! will never go to a barber again! very easy to use! remington is a dependable brand!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is good for hair cuts. If your looking for something to trim your beard this is to big. The attachments that come with it are not made for beards . Rather then send it back I donated to charity.</li>
    <li> Comes with ONE clipper guard which does NOT lock into place.  Yes the one item that changes settings does not lock into place and just pops off the second you apply pressure to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you try to use it as a close trimmer and it is not a close cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly what can this be used for?  Someone tell me what you can use this for if it doesn&#x27;t cut close without the guard and the one adjustable setting guard doesn&#x27;t fit into place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money here.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and the attachment does not stay on, falls right off!  Talk about a big rip off.  I just found this out.  Why my husband didn&#x27;t say anything when I first gave it to him is beyond me, now I can&#x27;t return it and wasted $$!</li>
    <li> I was desperately in the need for a new shaver, and I randomly found this one at Target. It was very reasonably priced, so I bought it and brought it home. I can honestly say that this shaver did the job AMAZINGLY well, and my biggest concern...battery life, was actually NOT a concern at all. The only reason why this didn&#x27;t receive a perfect score is because of the color. The bathroom appliances for my wife and I are all white, so sadly the theme isn&#x27;t perfect anymore, and she&#x27;s making me use our guest bathroom instead whenever I use it. Other than this, I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone on a budget.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to a corded trimmer again.  Excellent power.  The charge lasts for 4 to 5 buzz-cuts for me.  The investment pays back in one haircut!!  Where else do you get a return on your investment like that!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had Remington hair clippers and beard trimmers for years. They are very durable and with my husband&#x27;s coarse bristle like hair, many other clippers have failed. He usually keeps his hair very close to the scalp and sometimes uses clippers to remove most of the hair before shaving his head. He also has a thick beard and uses Remington clippers to keep that under control as well! I would recommend Remington to anyone who wants a durable hair trimming kit.</li>
    <li> I have gone through many clippers in my time, maybe like 3. The Remington HC-5150CDN is by far the greatest our time and perhaps the best we&#x27;ll ever see.    Its versatility is amazing, I have been cutting hair one minute than using it to scramble eggs the next. Last winter I entered an ice-sculpting contest for the first time and only used these clippers, my near perfect 18ft recreation of Venus de Milo took first place!    I highly recommend these clippers to anyone who is interested in not only cutting hair but living life to the fullest and discovering your full potential.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the barber in my house. I cut everyone&#x27;s hair (kids and adults) with this. Ive tried every trimmer and this is the only one that is the best. doesn&#x27;t leave lines on their head and cuts great. i love using this for my family and of course friends!</li>
    <li> I have cut my husband&#x27;s hair for the last six years. We have used several different clippers, but this has got to be in my top two. I love that it will work when its plugged in and I&#x27;ve used it two or three times without having to recharge it. I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spots over and over again. It works really wll. Such a good item for the price!</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have noted, this item has one clipper guard that will not lock into place. Even the gentlest amount of pressure will cause the guard to pop out of place. Otherwise, the battery lasts as advertised, the size and weight feel good. Had to return this item.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Precision Power hair clipper last week and have used it twice since getting it. It&#x27;s a great tool, perfect for clipping hair quickly and efficiently. It has a nice ergonomic design and is easy to use. Ideal for full on hair cuts, as well as sideburn and facial hair trimming. I highly suggest this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer for my boyfriend and he just loves it.  It&#x27;s easy to use, wieldy, and leaves a man mohawked like no other trimmer.</li>
    <li> Since I bought this device, I probably saved almost $100 on haircuts. Very easy to use. The price and the quality are just right.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s birthday was coming up, and I knew I wanted to get him something great! But, men are hard to shop for! I came across the Precision Power Hair and Beard Trimmer, and was not sure if I should make it his gift. Well, I am so glad I did! He loves it! He really appreciated the thoughtfulness. And, it really does an awesome job. It was a win-win. I love how he looks, and so does he. :-)     I think if you are in the marker for a new trimmer, you should certainly give this a try. First of all, Remington is a very trusted brand. And, it works! It is very easy to use, precise, and has a great result. At least this is what he told me! From what I see, I agree.</li>
    <li> The battery charge holds for a decent amount of time and the head seems to be tilted at a pretty good angle so that I can actually get a clean shave. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered these clippers for my dad and returned them after the first use.  The adjustable blade would not lock into place.  It repeatedly slipped out of the setting during operation resulting in gaps in his hair.</li>
    <li> My dad has been a stylist for over 60 years so I would think he knows good clippers from bad. He likes these clippers. Nice smooth cut and doesnt grab and pull the hair.</li>
    <li> This little gadget is perfect gift for any man in your life ladies. This is great for facial hair and the excess hair that men have at the neck line. Its perfect for men who want a fast cut after the shower so its good on wet or dry hair. I would defintly recomend this gift so, if you have man in your life with a birthday coming up or need a simple gift idea for the future simply add this to your list its Fabulous!!! :)</li>
    <li> Is it a bird?  Is it a plane?  No, it&#x27;s my fabulously shaved face, flying high and landing softly on the clouds... at least that is what it felt like this morning when I used this product.  I have struggled with getting a close shave for many moons now, (I&#x27;m a very hairy fellow), and this product was the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy a new trimmer because my old one was wearing out.  I was looking for a goatee / beard trimmer.  The attachments / guide that adjusts beard length is huge in size.  It makes it virtually impossible to trim above your lip.  The other problem I have is that it seems to tug / pull hair not cut it.  I found it unpleasant to use.  I tried it a few times and bought different trimmer.  I just received the Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer, I like it a lot more.  It is small enough to trim all parts of your face and doesn&#x27;t tug.  I will be donating this, it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted.It is sharp and doesn&#x27;t pull and yank at your beard.I know some don&#x27;t like the larger size of it,but that was the main reason I chose it in the first place.I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a little bigger trimmer like I was.It was a very reasonable price for the size and quality.</li>
    <li> This is okay for shaving and cutting hair. However, the slider is made of plastic, and can easily break. I broke both of the edges of the plastic guide while cutting my head. Now i need to be careful and keep the HC5150CN straight otherwise i risk cutting my hair with no guide,</li>
    <li> The nice thing about this is you can use it plugged in or go cordless.&lt;br /&gt;I use only this, to keep my stubble short and it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair like others do.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After owning this for about a year I like this razor even better for keeping my stubble short.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this can remain plugged in while you shave is very convenient when you forget to pre-charge it.&lt;br /&gt;This remains my favorite electric razor of all time and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this device 2 times so far and have been pretty impressed with it.  I LOVE the fact that the guards lock in place on this shaver.  I had another model previously that the guards did not lock, so putting pressure on the shaver would allow the guard to adjust.  It did a very good job on my beard making everything even and sharp looking.  The battery charged for 14 hours the first time, and I have not had to charge it again.  It has been running for about 40 minutes of runtime and is still going strong.    I also tried this on my head, as I normally keep my head shaved close.  I allowed it to grow out for a week prior to cutting.  It took a little while to get it shaved back down.  It did do a good job, but I had to make several passes in order to get it cut down.  It mostly seemed to be related to the fact that I have thick hair, and the width of the clippers is a little bit smaller.  I will probably continue using my current pro hair clippers to cut my head hair as they are a bit wider, but will definitely use this to keep my beard trimmed up.    I would definitely recommend this shaver for beard upkeep. If you have a thick head of hair and plan on using this to keep your hair cut, you may want something a little bit larger.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A GIFT FROM MY WIFE AND ONE OF THE BEST GIFTS SHE HAS GIVEN ME. I AM WHAT SOME WOULD CALLED \\&quot;GOING BALD\\&quot; BUT HAVE LOTS OF HAIR ON THE SIDES AND BACK OF MY HEAD. THIS IS GREAT FOR THE TRIMMING AND NO NEED TO GO TO PROFESSIONALS ALL THE TIME. I HGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ALL WHO ARE IN THE SAME \\&quot;GROUPING\\&quot; AS MYSELF!</li>
    <li> Buzz type cuts in my house are a monthly thing with 2 teenage boys and these clippers are crazy fast and do a great job! Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Not much cutting power and the battery isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
    <li> I should have heeded the other reviewers who claimed the guard does not fit on the cutter. Just got mine and the guard does not stay in place at all. What kind of quality checks do they do? It is going back!</li>
    <li> If my husband waits too long for me to cut his hair, it can kind of clog a little, but I like that it only has one or two attachments.  He likes a close cut, and it works fine.  Even for a longer look, it also does a good job.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product that I have ever had the misfortune to use. First time I used it, it died halfway through my head. I figured it was not fully charged. In the middle of my second go around, charged before hand, now sitting at the computer with half a shaved head while I write this review wishing I remembered the brand name of the last razor I owned.</li>
    <li> I bought this recently for my husband and he loves it! It&#x27;s definitely a no fuss clipper kit! It works well for his facial hair and we haven&#x27;t had any problems!</li>
    <li> I questioned whether to get this clipper because the price is pretty low, and you usually get what you pay for, but in this case, I am very pleased!  I am glad that I had faith in all of the positive reviews, and here is one more to add to the mix.    The clipper has a very nice selection of hair length settings when using the attachments, and when I used it I wondered if it was actually cutting because I felt nothing...no pulling whatsoever.  But the clippings were everywhere, so it worked super.  I like that it is cordless too.</li>
    <li> I just got this and it works great. I&#x27;m using it to clip my dog. He has the really soft hair that&#x27;s hard to find clippers that will cut it. It cuts thru his hair like a hot knife thru butter. I also love that it&#x27;s cordless so my pup doesn&#x27;t get tangled in the cord and its cord doesn&#x27;t limit reach. I love love love these clippers!</li>
    <li> It works really well! Exceeds my expectation!!</li>
    <li> Not bad.  The 3mm cut is the smallest, but it cut my hair very easily.  Best thing was I didn&#x27;t feel I&#x27;d get cut going around my ears.  I just wish there was a 1 mm cut on them also.</li>
    <li> Now I can get a quick haircut without having to pay 20 bucks for it!  Fortunately, I have fine hair that grows fast, so I will get better.  I don&#x27;t understand why so many businesses now treat you really well the first time, then take it for granted thereafter (Amazon is consistent, hence the repeat biz!).  I got tired of trying new places!</li>
    <li> It takes time and repetition to get rid or trim small hair, but besides that the blade is good and it cuts well.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a hair cut kit, look no fruther, this is it! I love this product, recommend everyone checks it out if you are in need.</li>
    <li> i shave my head, so a good cordless clipper is a big deal to me.  i liked my last one fine, but this remington product is better in every way!  it&#x27;s quiet, holds a great charge, and shaves my head (with no guard attached) even closer.  another benefit is that the tips of the blades are not sharp, so i don&#x27;t gouge my head as often.  i don&#x27;t use the adjustable guard very often, but the couple times i have it worked fine.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I ordered this trimmer so that my husband could trim my neckline between professional hair cuts.  It does a good job.</li>
    <li> It does a pretty good job, but if you are looking for a narrow beard trimmer, this is NOT what you want.  It&#x27;s head is the size of a regular hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is a good cordless haircutter. Very useful in my family.I am so happy with the trimmer. Buy it!!!!!!!!! The looks of my sons are good.</li>
    <li> working for one year!</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer to shave my head. I started off with a larger, more powerful Remington model that lasted for six years. This model is MUCH lighter and produces far less vibration. It doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close as the last one but in both cases I&#x27;m left with nothing but stubble so the final outcome is acceptable. Like any home trimmer this will not get you any close than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachable height adjustment is so terrible as to be useless. It&#x27;s difficult to attach, difficult to adjust and instantly clogs with hair. It&#x27;s not possible that during product testing they didn&#x27;t notice this so shame on Remington for even including it. Glad I have no need of it.</li>
    <li> Took out product from box, looked at it and notice something between the blade. I unscrewed the blade and it turned out that it was hair not a lot of it but still. After cleaning it, i used it and it was okay. The blade are sharp that is for sure, but they are not razors sharp so at the end of the day you still have some hair left.</li>
    <li> The attachments this comes with seem like a childs toy, they just wont work. This would be good for a young man to learn with if they can grow facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this, get it to use without the clipper guards, for example, I use it to trim my beard down before I use a razor, and my sideburns, to get that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.  And thats it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the battery does last a while, and you can use it while its plugged in, unlike others in this price range, hey :-)</li>
    <li> It looks to be a really good quality product. It has not been used yet so I don&#x27;t how it is going to work. I have high hope for it</li>
    <li> Only problem I have is that it is not cutting my hair evenly. I had a previous Remington and it was cheaper and did&lt;br /&gt;a even cut.</li>
    <li> I found it not strong enough to buzz hair  and the adjustable clip is pretty flimsy.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for years. I like it low and this helps in a great way.&lt;br /&gt;Being cordless makes it so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Although, the battery on this unit seems to last about 20-30 minutes before slowing down. It does last long enough for me to finish the job. So I cannot complain too much.&lt;br /&gt;Especially for the price, which is great.</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer, but I like a slightly closer shave, may just be personal preference though.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty dense bear so it the past some beard trimmers are too weak to do anything but pull hair.  So far this one has been up to the task but it is the size of a trimmer that your barber would have.  I wanted something more along the size of a normal beard trimmer and not a hair clipper.  The hair length attachments that come with this are garbage.  They don&#x27;t come in sizes below 3 (which is slightly too long for side burn management), they don&#x27;t hold to higher values, and they are very long and made of cheap plastic so one has already broken.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for my personnel use!</li>
