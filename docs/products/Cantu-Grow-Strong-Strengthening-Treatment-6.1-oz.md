      <li>more than this is the fact that my hair has stopped falling.  </li>
      <li>Thumbs up Cantu :)</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love how it keeps it manageable from day to day.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love how this product feels in my hair.</li>
      <li>I love the moisture that it gives to my hair.</li>
      <li>I need to have a creamy leave in and this is one that I love.</li>
      <li>and I was hoping for more moisture.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Works great on my hair and always leaves it feeling so soft.</li>
      <li>Having literally seen the response of my very negro kinky hair to these products I am delighted to add that the Cantu Grow Strong Treatment is a MUST ADD to your arsenal of &#x27;Hair Protectors&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves your hair manageable and with a lovely mild coconut scent.  </li>
      <li>It was cheap and got the job done.</li>
      <li>Good stuff, I will definitely be buying more</li>
      <li>Yes, some products on Amazon are more than at a large, local store, but the variety of sizes, brands, and customer service from ordering to amazingly fast delivery and excellent return policy makes Amazon my first stop when looking for many items.</li>
      <li>I love the whole line of Cantu hair products!</li>
      <li>I imagine lying on the beach feeling a cool breeze.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect that claim to hold true, but it does.</li>
      <li>It makes it extremely soft and i love the smell.</li>
      <li>and this experience proves it.  </li>
      <li>My verdict is out right now.  </li>
      <li>You can easily find this at Walmart for around $4, and less than a dollar more at Target.  </li>
      <li>Finally came across Cantu and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>I was so worried about my breaking, falling hair and concerned that I might be the first in my family to go bald</li>
      <li>My hair has also grown so much!</li>
      <li>Weeks after only one application of this product my own natural hair was surprisingly very moisturized when I removed my cornrows.  </li>
      <li>Moisturizes with a nice scent and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  </li>
      <li>As I mentioned in my aforementioned review, Cantu needs to do better marketing of their products as it is really a first for me to find something that actually works on true, fibre-texture negro hair - i.e. not mixed/semi-curly/soft texture hair.</li>
      <li>The last set of cornrows I decided to apply this product (Cantu Shea butter grow strong) to my scalp and cornrow braids.  </li>
      <li>I have fairly straight Caucasian hair that is getting a bit fuzzier</li>
      <li>The product is very penetrating as stated on the label</li>
      <li>something that strengthens my curls without too much of a grease feel is something I appreciate.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels so much thicker and manageable since I started using the shea butter.  </li>
      <li>That aside, using this in conjunction with my moisturizer has transformed my hair back to its original texture .</li>
      <li>and this had really made my hair soft and it is growing well</li>
      <li>Love this product on my 4c African American natural hair texture.</li>
      <li>love it,  use it everyday.  </li>
      <li>After I have had my cornrows in a couple of weeks I normally spray my roots with a diluted protein treatment (Cantu product as well) to help keep my hair moist and to help prevent breakage.  </li>
      <li>but my hair is very soft after moisturizing and sealing.</li>
      <li>Soft Hair!</li>
      <li>I use it to smooth my edges &amp; lay down my hair after styling.</li>
      <li>The Shea butter keeps my hair moisturized and soft.</li>
      <li>I started my natural hair journey about 5 mths ago and it makes my natural curls thrive.</li>
      <li>It leaves my curls soft and defined.</li>
      <li>and I realized when I use this my hair is soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>It dries soft, silky, and not a bit greasy.</li>
      <li>When I wake up my hair is soft and well</li>
      <li>It has my hair soft and moisturised, I&#x27;m checking out the others in this line</li>
      <li>Really worked for my niece who has very dry hair.  </li>
      <li>Not sure if this would suffice for really coarse hair, as it is definitely a light product.  </li>
      <li>I will come back after completely using to re-rate this product.</li>
      <li>Bought my daughter almost the entire Cantu line for her natural hair</li>
      <li>I have tried a number of very expensive products and this one is by far superior.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soooo soft and I have that dry, brittle, 4b type hair.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve had leave-ins and other stuff that either left my hair dry or too greasy and this had an even balance for my hair as well as my 5 year old.  </li>
<li> (we go grey but NEVER bald).  </li>

<li> left it greasy and lank, disappointing since i am in love with the other cantu products.</li>
<li> There are a few stores that still carry the Cantu line but they sell only one or two products from them, so people shouldn&#x27;t complain about the online price when you clearly don&#x27;t know whether other people can buy it in their areas or not.</li>
<li> Maybe they&#x27;re mixing it with other products?</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other leave ins</li>
<li> But all that alcohol was extremely damaging my hair.</li>
<li> Not sure but would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a little to thin if you have thicker hair , doesn&#x27;t really absorb moisture</li>
<li> I let my hair get a little wet</li>
<li> However, extreme stress and new medications appeared to be the culprits and unfortunately, nothing could be done to change those two factors.  </li>
<li> it makes it a little oily</li>
<li> The Cantu line is one of very few product lines that I can use due to having psoriasis on my scalp.</li>
<li> I put it in my hair a few times a week before I go to bed and put a bonnet on.</li>
<li> It softens without being greasy or heavy.  </li>
<li> Less split ends!</li>
<li> Made my hair too wet at first then after  while my hair became dry,brittle and hard, my hair hated it, don&#x27;t waste ur $$$$</li>
<li> Over the past 3 weeks my hair seems to be a lot stronger.</li>
<li> Hard to judge the impact its made on the strength of my hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought my daughter almost the entire Cantu line for her natural hair and she loves the way her hair now looks,</li>
    <li> I was had been in three stores looking for either Chi Conditioner or Aphogee Conditioner and ran across this product at my 4th stop which was Family Dollar.  I just happen to be buying deodorant when I seen this product.  Read it and figured, why not.  HAPPY I DID!  I&#x27;ve had leave-ins and other stuff that either left my hair dry or too greasy and this had an even balance for my hair as well as my 5 year old.  Less split ends! Soft Hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Moisturizes with a nice scent and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  I am biracial, so something that strengthens my curls without too much of a grease feel is something I appreciate.  Not sure if this would suffice for really coarse hair, as it is definitely a light product.  I use this, along with Carol&#x27;s Daughter milk and Mixed Chicks leave-in, as part of my regular rotation.  Great products, but Cantu is the best around for affordable, daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, the price here is outrageous.  You can easily find this at Walmart for around $4, and less than a dollar more at Target.  Amazon is a joke with pricing. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> smells like castor oil... which i hate the smell off, didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. left it greasy and lank, disappointing since i am in love with the other cantu products.</li>
    <li> Hard to judge the impact its made on the strength of my hair but it feels good and smells good</li>
    <li> i use to this to moisturize my 4a/b hair and it does an amazing job. my hair feels really good all day. i spritz my hair with water then apply this to my hair and i seal in the moisture with my oil. and this had really made my hair soft and it is growing well</li>
    <li> I use this product to moisturize and seal every night and it does the trick. It makes my hair soooo soft and I have that dry, brittle, 4b type hair. I love how it keeps it manageable from day to day. Definitely a must have in my hair regimen.</li>
    <li> this delivered everything it branded it about</li>
    <li> The Cantu line is one of very few product lines that I can use due to having psoriasis on my scalp. The Shea butter keeps my hair moisturized and soft. I went natural 3 years ago and this has been one of few products that have helped my hair to grow and doesn&#x27;t affect my psoriasis. I need to have a creamy leave in and this is one that I love. I&#x27;ve tried other leave ins but if its running it causes my psoriasis to flare up. I put it in my hair a few times a week before I go to bed and put a bonnet on. When I wake up my hair is soft and well moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to buy my products online since a lot of the stores in Seattle area have stopped selling this line and replaced it with the Shea Moisture line, which my psoriasis doesn&#x27;t like. There are a few stores that still carry the Cantu line but they sell only one or two products from them, so people shouldn&#x27;t complain about the online price when you clearly don&#x27;t know whether other people can buy it in their areas or not.</li>
    <li> I have used this product here and there for a while.  It has a very pleasant smell and is very light weight.  Recently Ive tried different cornrow styles as a means of protection from breakage and over processing.  After I have had my cornrows in a couple of weeks I normally spray my roots with a diluted protein treatment (Cantu product as well) to help keep my hair moist and to help prevent breakage.  The last set of cornrows I decided to apply this product (Cantu Shea butter grow strong) to my scalp and cornrow braids.  This product work wonderfully and the results was proof of that.  Weeks after only one application of this product my own natural hair was surprisingly very moisturized when I removed my cornrows.  The product is very penetrating as stated on the label and this experience proves it.  I will continue to use this product and I will recommend it to anyone looking for a good moisturizing product at a good price.</li>
    <li> This stuff just didnt work for me.  Left my hair quite greasy and I was hoping for more moisture.  Oh well...</li>
    <li> Made my hair too wet at first then after  while my hair became dry,brittle and hard, my hair hated it, don&#x27;t waste ur $$$$</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright it&#x27;s a little to thin if you have thicker hair , doesn&#x27;t really absorb moisture it makes it a little oily</li>
    <li> Coming from someone with 3a/b type hair, this product is a lifesaver. I was always using Sauve Hair Mousse #7. It was cheap and got the job done. But all that alcohol was extremely damaging my hair. And after 10+ years, my hair has had enough. Finally came across Cantu and I&#x27;m glad I did. It leaves my curls soft and defined. I&#x27;ve read about people reporting white flakes, not the case with me. Maybe they&#x27;re mixing it with other products? Not sure but would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> So I have been using this product for a while. I love the moisture that it gives to my hair. I can also reapply it as often as I need if I feel my hair is drying out. It is an excellent moisturizer to use if you also seal your hair afterward. The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I do not feel it penetrates as deeply as I would want it too but my hair is very soft after moisturizing and sealing. This product is also great because it does not contain any petroleum or mineral oil.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I started my natural hair journey about 5 mths ago and it makes my natural curls thrive. I let my hair get a little wet when I shower and apply this stuff and my hair curls up really nice. My hair has also grown so much!</li>
    <li> Bought this for $4 some where...can&#x27;t remember where but I love it!!! I use it to smooth my edges &amp; lay down my hair after styling. Tie it with a silk scarf after for a few minutes or hours &amp; voila!! Works wonders on my 4c/4b hair. Absolutely amazing.....</li>
    <li> My hair loves this product. It has my hair soft and moisturised, I&#x27;m checking out the others in this line</li>
    <li> I absolutely love how this product feels in my hair. It makes it extremely soft and i love the smell. Smells like soap. Over the past 3 weeks my hair seems to be a lot stronger.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so much thicker and manageable since I started using the shea butter.  I have tried a number of very expensive products and this one is by far superior.</li>
    <li> HAPPY  WITH  THE  PRODUCT  CARDINE  L.  JORDAN</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It softens without being greasy or heavy.  Believe it or not, it also enhances growth.  I didn&#x27;t expect that claim to hold true, but it does.</li>
    <li> Great prouct. I have fairly straight Caucasian hair that is getting a bit fuzzier as I age (lol, not just the gray ones.) The hair-care salon cautioned it was for &amp;#34;ethnic hair&amp;#34; whatever that means. To me, it is a great conditioner and use a nickel size dollop after each shampoo. It dries soft, silky, and not a bit greasy. Any of the cream leftover on my hands gets rubbed in: ingredients are not very different than those in my shea butter body cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re: comment on price. Yes, some products on Amazon are more than at a large, local store, but the variety of sizes, brands, and customer service from ordering to amazingly fast delivery and excellent return policy makes Amazon my first stop when looking for many items. Go Amazon Prime!</li>
    <li> My verdict is out right now.  Haven&#x27;t had a change to fully use to get any results. I will come back after completely using to re-rate this product.</li>
    <li> I love the whole line of Cantu hair products! Works great on my hair and always leaves it feeling so soft.</li>
    <li> I use this almost every day and my hair is getting stronger every day.  I would definitely recomment to my friends.</li>
    <li> On 29-Jan-2014 I rated my initial purchase of the Cantu Shea Butter Coconut Curling Cream together with the Cantu Shampoo and Cantu Conditioner.  Having literally seen the response of my very negro kinky hair to these products I am delighted to add that the Cantu Grow Strong Treatment is a MUST ADD to your arsenal of &#x27;Hair Protectors&#x27;.  I was so worried about my breaking, falling hair and concerned that I might be the first in my family to go bald (we go grey but NEVER bald).  However, extreme stress and new medications appeared to be the culprits and unfortunately, nothing could be done to change those two factors.  The word-of-mouth advertisement I received via my daughter via a friend of hers with respect to the Cantu products has been my hair saviour.  This product leaves your hair manageable and with a lovely mild coconut scent.  The texture change is immediate but more than this is the fact that my hair has stopped falling.  As I mentioned in my aforementioned review, Cantu needs to do better marketing of their products as it is really a first for me to find something that actually works on true, fibre-texture negro hair - i.e. not mixed/semi-curly/soft texture hair.</li>
    <li> love it,  use it everyday.  it shipped perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am African American and I realized when I use this my hair is soft and moisturized. Has a nice smell to me. Amazing. Thumbs up Cantu :)</li>
    <li> This product smells great.  Whenever I apply to my scalp.  I imagine lying on the beach feeling a cool breeze.  That aside, using this in conjunction with my moisturizer has transformed my hair back to its original texture .</li>
    <li> This is a holy grail item. I use it under Fantasia IC hair polisher, styling gel, and get the best hair. This is an excellent leave in moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, I will definitely be buying more</li>
    <li> Really worked for my niece who has very dry hair.  Keeps moisture in hair all day.  Have ordered her extra container.  Great product.</li>
    <li> waiting for progress.</li>
    <li> Love this product on my 4c African American natural hair texture.</li>
</ol>
