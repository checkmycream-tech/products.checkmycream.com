    <li> Originally I wasn&#x27;t too sure this was going to work for me, since my skin is so sensitive to scented products. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong,you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of this product and it didn&#x27;t cause any issues for my sensitive skin! If you want silky smooth skin and to shave less frequently, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It works fine.  Legs are smooth.  Just pricey for shave cream.</li>
    <li> Best shave lotion if you tan. Decreases the frequency in which you have to shave</li>
    <li> love the smell but no noticeable hair reducing effects</li>
    <li> is ok but i wont buy it again</li>
    <li> Best shaving lotion invented, after you use this you will never want to use anything else all year round!</li>
    <li> This smells like baby aspirin. It&#x27;s a fine shaving lotion, but I&#x27;ve tried better for less expensive.</li>
    <li> ** Best shave lotion!!!  I highly recommend if you suffer from extra sensitive skin and often cut yourself when shaving.  Quick absorbent and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling sticky I apply it on dry skin then get my skin wet in shower and begin to shave it has definetly improved the stubbles on my legs and it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin won&#x27;t irritate your skin in fact will improve appearance of skin leaving it silky smooth &amp; glowing, even my husband has notice how smooth my legs are will be ordering more bottles love this stuff**</li>
    <li> Best shave cream out there! I won&#x27;t use anything else anymore, my legs feel great with this and it seems to help prolong my tan as advertised.</li>
    <li> Not like normal shaving cream but I like the results.... I&#x27;d buy again....</li>
    <li> I love, love this stuff. Great for shaving when you have a tan. The smell is a little too fruity, but overall I love it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t keep my tan as long as I expected, nor did it keep my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. This shaving gel works amazing for my skin. It does not break me out. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> I bought this shave lotion from a tanning salon. Retail price is $20, so it&#x27;s a bargain from here. Now this doesn&#x27;t lather up like shaving cream would, so sometimes it&#x27;s hard to tell where you have shaved. It smells AMAZING and makes your legs feel really smooth. I have been able to longer without shaving my legs since buying this. This lotion reduces your pore size so you don&#x27;t have to shave as often. If you tan a lot and hate to shave, I really recommend this...Even if you don&#x27;t tan or don&#x27;t care to shave, I STILL recommend this. : )</li>
    <li> Manscaping is all the rage now... and I personally hate hair. Im a pretty big guy (6 foot, 210 lbs) and I have lots of hair as a result. I had bought an electric razor for my body because razor blades would give me red bumps and make me super itchy. I tried everything but nothing worked unless it made my skin feel like it was exposed to chemicals. I got this little pink container as a gag gift from someone but.... IT WORKS!!!! I freakin love this stuff and hope you guys will consider making a scent/bottle for guys with the same ingredients! No more red bumps, skin feels and looks amazing. Im still afraid that red bumps will show up but usually by now Im riddled with several here and there and not a single one has popped up. The smell is really girly, but I dont smell it much afterwards and if anything is secretly relaxing during a shower.</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely amazing, and keeps your skin nice and soft. I really wish they&#x27;d make a lotion, because it smells THAT good!</li>
    <li> I do like it does not leave your skin feeling dry or flaky. Has a nice smell ease to rinse off of your skin. good Stuff</li>
    <li> Smells good and works great!</li>
    <li> I got this shave lotion in a set at my local tanning salon and I was kind of skeptical at first, but I used it last night and my legs are super smooth and soft and my tan is still there! It is a different concept than shave creams or gels because this is actually the consistency of a lotion. I wish instead of washing it off, it could just stay on (if you do a dry shave  -- which you can with this product). The smell is nice, but can be a little overpowering at first. It&#x27;s very citrusy/fruity. Still, really happy with the product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> this was pretty expensive and I haven&#x27;t noticed a change from using it. I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Wasn&#x27;t too sure about it because it&#x27;s a lotion, but my legs are super smooth and still nice and dark from tanning. 5 stars</li>
    <li> Love it!! I have very sensitive skin (Psoriasis) so when I shave, I always get razor burn. I used this and didn&#x27;t get one bit of razor burn. It went on smooth and made my skin feel like heaven. The scent isn&#x27;t to over powering either.</li>
    <li> Love this shaving lotion</li>
    <li> Regular shaving cream makes my legs feel much smoother. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.... It is a MUST HAVE for tanners. I noticed last year that I wasn&#x27;t keeping color on my legs this year I bought it and I am on my 3rd bottle... It keeps your tan on your legs so well especially since I shave my legs everyday!! BUY IT YOU WONT REGRET IT!!</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AH-MAZING. Even if you don&#x27;t tan, this is by far the best shave stuff I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t lather up; it&#x27;s like a lotion, but it makes it nearly impossible to cut yourself (I cut myself shaving ALL THE TIME, but have yet to do it once while using this), and leaves you with an amazingly close, smooth shave with very soft skin. Love, love, love it. Will definitely buy again, I&#x27;ll never be able to shave without it again!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.but for your bikini area a WOW.no bumps no razor burn.for legs you can&#x27;t see where it has or hasn&#x27;t been.the razor just doesn&#x27;t drag.wow good stuff smells so good I wish I could leave it on.your hair doesn&#x27;t seem to grow as quick.def for your lady parts</li>
    <li> This is amazing! It has all the right perks such as the smell wich is a fruity soft light scent. The shave it gives me is so smooth and i have no razor rash in my bikini area plus my skin stays smoother longer.Also im able to maintain my tan longer. I love this product that i went back n ordered more because i dnt want to chance running out. I used coochy cream in the past wich is a very good product but now this one has BEAT THEM ALL. The way i keep a smoother shave longer is my #1 reason outa so many reasons that i love this product</li>
