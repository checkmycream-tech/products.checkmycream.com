      <li>The Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Skin Therapy Oil - Face is affordable and it&#x27;s a nice size for the price.</li>

      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
      <li>Well...truthfully...not sure I see a lot wrinkle gone...</li>

      <li>Lot more moisture than face creams.  </li>
      <li>Many people say hormones give you a pregnancy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;m contributing it to the skin therapy oil.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I received a trial of this from Ulta and fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>Most of them were okay</li>

      <li>And it just seems brighter, more youthful &amp; healthy.  </li>
      <li>Overall, after using products that cost between $8 and $60, I found that I like best out of them all.</li>
      <li>I love Palmer&#x27;s products and will continue buying them.</li>
      <li>At night I used about 3 to 4 drops; during the day 2 drops because if I used more my makeup would smear and run by midday.  </li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to wash my face with anything but water since I was a teenager.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I love this product and it works.</li>
      <li>They are much more convenient than the Buf Pads which brought tears to my eyes.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t have many pimples</li>
      <li>And make sure to use sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this at a retail store after a miserable winter when my skin was so dry it felt like paper. I quickly went through significantly more expensive products, trying to keep my skin hydrated. I bought this when I ran out of a very expensive product that gave me less than satisfactory results. I&#x27;m 58 and I&#x27;ve taken good care of my fair skin, but this oil is like magic! I use it in the morning and at night, on my face, neck and chest. After a few days of use, I was just amazed at the difference in my skin! It looked and felt like when I was in my 30s. It looked smooth and felt unbelievably soft. I mist my skin with witch hazel and use a simple, homemade vitamin C serum before I apply the oil. I also use this oil under makeup. I just let it dry for a few minutes before applying makeup. The fragrance is gentle and gives me no allergy issues. I hope they never stop making this. I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> Like it but I should have ordered w/o a scent because the rose water is pronounced and takes a bit of getting used to.  Never liked rosewater scent but I&#x27;m going to use this because I like the overall gentle softness on my skin this product leaves.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly.  Excellent product.  Goes on nice and absorbs well into skin.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with all of Palmer&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;Quality without the high price.</li>
    <li> The price was right, I haven&#x27;t had it but a few days, so don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s working yet. I have a very dry face in the Winter time and thought I&#x27;d try this out. So far nothing.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for a very reasonable price. I have tried products from 20-180$ as I have sensitive and dry skin, but this product beats all of the others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week, but so far I have noticed a huge difference in my skin! I wish I had tried this years ago, but I was put off by the fact that it&#x27;s an oil. I am 24 and I have extremely sensitive, fair, oily skin with some dark marks and large pores. It&#x27;s making my skin tone more even every day, my pores are significantly smaller, and my skin is actually not oily anymore! I don&#x27;t even have to wear makeup! For the first time ever! I use it once a day after washing off any makeup and massage it into my face and under my chin until it feels like it has been absorbed. It recommends avoiding sunlight exposure, but I have been tanning for my honeymoon and I have had no problems. Of course, I don&#x27;t apply it until after I&#x27;m done tanning. Also, it does not leave a residue on your pillow or clothes if you rub it in completely (upward motions to prevent wrinkles). As a side note, I know that tanning can sometimes have similar effects on your skin (clearing blemishes, etc), but I have tanned before and it has NEVER had such an immediate or thorough effect. I hope this helps sway you to buy it because I never would have tried it if it wasn&#x27;t for all the other positive reviews.</li>
    <li> Left my face dry, stopped using it and the dry spots went away, it may have been the face powder I was using stopped using that too. I will give it another try with the powder I use to use instead of the new one I was trying out to see if it is different results.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist said these items are not good to use for acne, or to improve skin, I purchased a bunch of items that I threw out.</li>
    <li> It goes on very soft and it feels very silky.  It makes your face very soft and smooth.  I&#x27;ve been using Palmer&#x27;s products for years and each product is better than the next.  I strongly recommend this product for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Gives face a glow and just the right texture/flow.</li>
    <li> This oil is AWESOME! Initially I was a bit skeptical about using an oil on my oily skin, but I&#x27;m glad I did not let that stop me from trying this out! I&#x27;m currently 17 weeks pregnant, 37 yo and have always had oily skin, with hormonal breakouts. I started experiencing breakouts and at the same time, due to cold/dry weather my skin turned extremely dry and was flaking! I found this skin therapy oil by accident and have always used Palmer&#x27;s other products and based on the good reviews, decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have said, this oil absorbs well and does not leave you feeling greasy! My skin has cleared up and I&#x27;ve really noticed an improvement in fine lines and acne scars. Many people say hormones give you a pregnancy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;m contributing it to the skin therapy oil. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the beginning of February 2015; its now June 2015.  I used this oil every day and night since I received it.  I have sensitive and blemished skin.  In the beginning, it helped even out my skin tone and appeared to make it smooth looking but it didn&#x27;t do much for my blemishes or keep breakouts at bay. My blemishes lightened just a tiny bit but no real significant difference.  At night I used about 3 to 4 drops; during the day 2 drops because if I used more my makeup would smear and run by midday.  I like the light fragrant smell but for the most part, it didn&#x27;t make a huge difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This absorbs quickly and does not cause acne. There&#x27;s a light scent when first applied but it disappears quickly. Be careful how much you use. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve purchased this twice now. it only takes a few drops to moisturize my face and neck, so it lasts a long time. got all the good oils in one bottle, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely wonderful ! It has shrunken my pores tremendously. I put in on every night at bedtime.. Love it.. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> This feels really great on the skin at first.  It doesn&#x27;t absorb well so it would be more beneficial to wear at night.  About a week into using this product I started getting little clogged pore bumps on my chin and forehead.  I stopped using and the bumps went away.  I&amp;#34;m not sure If I got a bad bottle or if it the product.</li>
    <li> Well...truthfully...not sure I see a lot wrinkle gone...however, having such dry skin it is great to apply and do believe it is helping the dryness.  So I feel better about my skin.  Lot more moisture than face creams.  So put on, let soak in and then apply night or day cream...great!</li>
    <li> Good product bottle leaked before I received it otherwise good product</li>
    <li> o.k., I never write reviews, but I really appreciate those that do, so I thought I&#x27;d contribute to the greater good this time.  Because this product is truly amazing!  I received a sample in a magazine and thought I&#x27;d give it a try, as I live in a very dry climate and had to take some medication that made my skin very flaky.  I had tried all sorts of creams and lotions, but then I got pimples.  To go along with my wrinkles.  Awesome.  (I&#x27;m 43, by the way).  So I figured I had nothing to lose and it turns out, I had everything to gain.  My complexion has never been better!  It has a softness that I haven&#x27;t had in decades.  And it just seems brighter, more youthful &amp; healthy.  I haven&#x27;t noticed diminished sun spots, and my wrinkles are still there, but I&#x27;ve only used for a month.  Even if I don&#x27;t see those results, the ones I have are worth it for me.  Especially at $10/bottle!  Are you kidding me?  I want to cry thinking of the money I&#x27;ve spent trying to get these results.</li>
    <li> Love this! It makes my face so smooth. I lather it on at nights and use it sparingly in the day time.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a couple weeks... I think it&#x27;s doing something...</li>
    <li> The smell is weird and its greasy at first BUT it left my skin very soft and matte.</li>
    <li> I bought this product mainly to help with dark marks and uneven skin tone. Unfortunately, it did not help me with either. However, there are some positives that I won&#x27;t ignore: it&#x27;s moisturizing, glides on easy, smells good, and is not at all irritating. In the first couple weeks I was using it, it also smoothed out and firmed the skin around my eyes and my upper cheeks...however, that improvement only continued so long. It&#x27;s not ineffective but doesn&#x27;t do everything it claims to do.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product at Target after searching for a face moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t make my face feel sticky and then dry up my skin afterwards like my previous face lotion. I was a bit skeptical about using this because I hadn&#x27;t really used a face OIL before. I ended up buying it anyway because I have used other Palmer&#x27;s products before, and have heard that cocoa butter does wonders for your skin! Buying this was absolutely NO mistake, and after using it daily my face feels smoother and visibly healthier!&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I first apply the oil after washing my face. When I dry my face after washing it, it feels drier (no matter which cleanser I use). I use the dropper tool and put one drop on my forehead, both cheeks (somewhere closer to the temple), the nose, and the chin. I use more oil in the morning than I do at night because I don&#x27;t put as much product on in the morning as I do in the evening. At night I do the same thing, excluding the drop on the nose (YES, this makes a HUGE difference in how much oil is on your face).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what this will do for scars; I have the Palmer&#x27;s Body Oil and none of my scars have faded quite yet (I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a year), but the face oil might do something different. I just know that whatever it&#x27;s doing, I&#x27;m pretty much satisfied with it!</li>
    <li> I was always afraid to use any type of &#x27;beauty&#x27; oil on my face, out of fear I would breakout. I got a sample of this and gave it a whirl, I love this stuff! I came to Amazon to try and get it at a lower price than my local drugstore, and I&#x27;m glad I did. This oil is so gentle, no breakouts, no oily skin, just soft, healthy skin. I also love the smell. I use this at night, I put a good amount around my eye area, after I apply my eye cream, then I put a few small drops in my hands, and rub it in all over my face &amp; neck. I didn&#x27;t realize at first that it contains Retinol, so that is just a bonus. I&#x27;ve had this for a quite few months now, and still have only used about a quarter of the bottle...and I use this every night, so it is a great value too! I recently bought the rose hip scented oil for the body(which can actually also be used on your face)from Palmer&#x27;s, and I love that too!</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!!!!! I can&#x27;t live without it. I am 28 years old and use it. It makes my face look soft and smooth. People actually think I lie about my age!! They say wow, you look very young. Yep.....thanks to this!! :) No itching or burning at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about six months. I wanted to wait a while to review it. I have to say I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived with this. I am a man with very sensitive skin and shaving has always been a dread because of the damage it does to my face. I started using this after I shave and I can&#x27;t even describe the difference. Not only does my skin bounce back from the shaving but over time it&#x27;s made the damage shaving does lessen. I also started using it under my eyes and they have been noticing less puffy and, well younger looking. I highly recommend and lasts a long time. Because it&#x27;s an oil I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It makes my skin super soft. I use it at night before bed because it takes a while for it to completely soak in. I would recommend this product for sure!</li>
    <li> Helped to moisturize my skin and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It, in fact, caused my pores to shrink. I love Palmer&#x27;s products and will continue buying them.</li>
    <li> Best facial oil ever , combination of all essential beauty oils. I did not purchase off amazon but at my local drug store and have been using this for a month now. I&#x27;ve have KP (keratosis pilaris) since childhood and stuggle with cheek redness and small bumps, i no longer have this issue after 27 years. I wash my face at night and lightly add this oil before bed. I have seen major improvement in my skin. My skin feels smoother, more rejuvinated and less redness/irritation.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday to remove my acne marks and it helps so much. I apply it at least twice a day and one of those times being at night. When I wake up the next morning my skin isn&#x27;t too oily or too dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every night for a few months now and its been glowing ever since. I have sensitive skin but works for me!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh.  I can&#x27;t describe how many different products and brands, all ranges of expensive before I found a sample of this product.  I never even tried the regular skin therapy oil before, so never thought to use it on my face.  I always thought I should use a thick cream on my face. I was proven wrong! The oil goes on smooth and is super hydrating. Some of the creams leave my face feeling dry after awhile. This keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day and all night. It leaves my skin feeling soft and really helped improve my uneven skin tone.  I like the smell as well.  Only problem is I could not find it in the stores, so will have to buy it online until I do. Would highly recommend you at least try.</li>
    <li> Would be perfect if it didn&#x27;t have the artificial, strong fragrance. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and it&#x27;s making my skin radiate, but lately I&#x27;ve started to have a negative reaction to it. I think it&#x27;s because of the fragrance. I will have to begrudgingly stop using this.</li>
    <li> I read all the other reviews before I purchased this.  I do NOT have sensitive skin, but this product made me break out.  I stopped using it after only a few days.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with a terrible complexion: acne, dryness, oily skin, uneven skin tone, dark spots, acne marks, the list goes on. I saw that this oil had some good reviews and decided to try thinking I had nothing to lose. I was worried that with it being an oil it would break my face out more but oh my goodness..I&#x27;m SO extremely glad that I gave it a try! I have been using it every night on my face after I take off my makeup and WOW! It has actually cleared up my skin and added so much hydration to my skin without causing it to be oily. I&#x27;ve noticed a more vibrant even skin tone too! My crows feet and forehead lines have decreased in size. I&#x27;ve been calling it my little &amp;#34;miracle in a bottle.&amp;#34; For the price it&#x27;s worth a shot and will last you for a couple months! :) Thanks Palmers!!!!</li>
    <li> I received a trial of this from Ulta and fell in love with it.  Strange to intentionally put oil on my face, especially having oily skin, but wow!  The results are definitely noticeable.  My skin looks and feels smooth and even, not oily / not dry.  Some people complain about the scent, I personally like the smell.  Overall, after using products that cost between $8 and $60, I found that I like best out of them all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to rate this product as when I received it the product had leaked all over the box and the other item I ordered with it. I had received a sample a few weeks earlier and while it made my skin soft, in the long term it probably would have made the oily parts of my combination skin a little too greasy.</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff. I&#x27;ve bought Vitamin C separately, but somehow this mixture really works to help with wrinkles. I see a lot of improvement. So far, it does not make my skin red or irritated. I was persuaded by the other reviews to try it, and I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I had a horrendous break out and had tried so many products that caused dryness without removing the honker of a pimple. I picked at it and thought a scar might result, so I got this product. In 2 days I saw my skin respond beautifully with a large reduction of pimples and the large one reduced in size. Two days later, that big zit is gone and the tissue has reduced in redness and most likely not going to scar! This product is great and I highly recommend it. Do not be dismayed by it being oil; it feels incredible, dries fairly quickly, and had great results.</li>
    <li> Although my skin is naturally oil this oil based skin therapy is fantastic, will buy again for my self and friends!</li>
    <li> Love to use this at night... It feels oily initially but the skin drinks it right up and it just feels soft and supple... I have sensitive skin and am also prone to breakouts and have never had an issue with this product. I like to apply it before bed and my skin always looks glowy and soft in the morning! Another great thing about this oil is that I can apply it near and underneath my eyes and it never stings or irritates them! Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days so far, but I love how it smells and I literally saw a difference in my skin overnight. The dropper can be a bit messy, but it&#x27;s a huge bottle for a great price. I switched to this after using an expensive vitamin c serum, and saw more results using this for a week than I ever did with the pricy serum!</li>
    <li> Wow. This stuff smells AMAZING and NOT like cocoa butter, but like a faint fruity rose. It&#x27;s DIVINE!  I love how it makes my skin feel so incredibly moisturized and it has retinol... although you have to be careful as I put this on my nose not realizing it was touching the mucus membranes on in the inside of my nostrils and the next day they were quite tender, red and itchy... so tonight I put a thick layer of Cetaphil cream around the sensitive nose, eye, and lip area before applying this oil to the rest of my face, neck, and decolletage. So really, just avoid those sensitive areas and you&#x27;re fine. And make sure to use sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention I paid less than NINE dollars for this at my local grocery store? Este Lauder can kiss my arse. I can afford to use this daily, liberally, and all over my neck &amp; decolletage area without worrying about wasting product. Who cares at this price? I also LOVE the fact that this little beauty oil is so small and easy to pack and comes in glass. So classy and nostalgic :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job Palmer&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Just started using this product Wichita I heard advertised on the radio so I hope it works for my dark spots</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I purchased it at Target for 8.00. Been using it twice a day along with my Shea Moisture Black Soap for about a week and  it has cleared up my dark spots and my skin is glowing. It&#x27;s light not greasy and has an amazing smell.</li>
    <li> This product has reduce my fine lines and amazon is awesome I have not had to take anything back</li>
    <li> I started using this product on the recommendation of a dear friend. After 4 weeks, my boyfriend complimented my skin, how it looked smoother. Now after 6 or 7 weeks, he commented again, observing how the small laugh lines are virtually gone. His reaction is the best reason to keep using it!&lt;br /&gt;My skin always feels dewy, never greasy. And a little goes a long way. This bottle will last for months. Excellent value.</li>
    <li> I have happily used a good brand of face creams for years.  But since I like the Palmers bath oil, I decided to try this.  It feels so good on the skin.  I think this little bottle will last a long time so it is way cheaper than what I have been using.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>

    <li> This is a very non-oily oil which happily (for me, anyway) has no cocoa butter smell. It&#x27;s supposedly a Rose Hips fragrance, which is very faint.  It&#x27;s quite thin and almost watery, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m suffocating my skin. It dries quickly to a velvety matte finish. I use it at night, but it would probably work well for day (altho no SPF). So far my skin looks brighter, more rested and happier after having used it nightly for about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palmer seems to make dozens of these facial oils, so don&#x27;t get confused by all the names. The ingredients consist of Retinol surrounded by 10 pure oils, ranging from sesame to macadamia to coconut, along with Vitamin C and of course, cocoa butter. I would not expect any great anti-aging benefits from this (or any other topical product, to be honest) but my skin feels softer and has that elusive &#x27;glow&#x27; no other oil has been able to deliver and that&#x27;s enough for me!</li>
    <li> I bought  this at Jewel Osco not amazon.  I had been using organic coconut oil on my face and body for the past year, which I began to feel was becoming  to heavy and oily for me.  I&#x27;ve  tried several  other cheap , homemade, and expensive  alternatives.  I&#x27;m 27 and noticed I&#x27;ve been getting  dark circles  and baggy eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks  now and my eyes are looking back to normal!  I don&#x27;t look so haggarded.  I love the way it feels  but I never liked rose flowery scents, it&#x27;s faint  and settles pretty nicely.  I&#x27;ll be buying more of this and the body oil also.  I use 2x a day.  It absorbs quick unlike the coconut  oil I use  to use.  (Husband&#x27;s account  )</li>
    <li> I have been \\&quot;plagued\\&quot; with skin issues all my life. I have tried products that cost more than $100 and as few as. 50 cents (not the rapper-smile) in a quest to have improved skin appearance. I don&#x27;t think I will ever have flawless skin but I try. I have used this product on my face and neck for three weeks. After all of my blackheads popped out in weeks one and two, it has been smooth sailing!  My skin is smoother, more even tone, and the little bumps and hills are smoothing. I am for once in life happy about a product that works. Thanks goodness for this product. One additional thing I did was. went to the Dollar Store and got some of those green and yellow scrubber/sponges---you know the ones that fall apart quickly...well I use those as an exfoliating pad. Works wonders and you get about ten for a buck. They are much more convenient than the Buf Pads which brought tears to my eyes. I love this product and it works. Heck, in a month or so I may post a selfie</li>
    <li> Nice product. I was afraid to try a new product on my sensitive skin but I have not had any negative issues with this oil. Also its a great price because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Using my husband&#x27;s account. I am pleasantly surprised by this product! Firstly I did not buy this on Amazon but at Duane Reade because shipping prices are ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late twenties and did not worry about enlarged pores until I recently noticed them slowly getting larger in areas like my nose and cheeks. So I began looking into masks and oil reducing creams to help with this. There was a small improvement that took several weeks to notice. This oil, which has a pleasant smell, I have been using for 3 days now (at nights only) and I do not know how it does it but my pores have shrunk significantly more!! in 3 nights!!! The pores on my nose are still a little large but the ones on my cheeks, back to being tiny!! I am not going to stop using this. I see no difference in my dark spots, but that is expected, those are harder to get rid off. I look forward to using this product for a long time and hope Amazon soon will have good deals to offer.</li>
    <li> Very nice...The wife likes it...</li>
    <li> My favorite product leaves skin so soft</li>
    <li> This made my skin breakout after a few days. My skin is usually not at all sensitive and I haven&#x27;t gotten pimples in years. It did make it feel soft and did not make the skin feel greasy.Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> Great moisture and seems to work well.</li>
    <li> I put this on every day now on my face and hands.  I have reordered it twice now.  I like the combination of oils as it is not too greasy or doesn&#x27;t significantly use any occlusive oils.  You should be aware that it has Retinol, but I have not been able to find out if it&#x27;s 2.5%.  From using it, I think it may be a little less than 2.5%, but you can definitely tell it&#x27;s there.  With Retinol in it, one needs to be careful about either getting it in your eyes or going out in the sun.  I don&#x27;t put this on if I&#x27;m going to be outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use it with some other moisturizing items over a typical few days.  Other active ingredients I use include lanolin and Shea Butter Oil (and/or products that include those).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m allergic to half a dozen common chemicals and ingredients in shampoos, conditioners, moisturizers, and soft soaps. And I also have mild irritations due to a variety of astringent products.  Palmer&#x27;s is one of the few liquid cosmetic products I use.  I&#x27;ve had no adverse reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AJ</li>
    <li> I have tried different creams for years, from expensive to cheap. But I have to give this five stars, been only using this for about 3 weeks now, and my acne scars is fading dramatically. I say would this is not a skin moisturizer. Even though I have oily skin it made my skin extra dry. I only use this on the scars which is my cheeks and forehead. I notice in the past when I would us fade cream and I apply it all over my face, it would make the parts of my skin without the scars lighter, and my scars would look darker. So with this routine I&#x27;m doing now just using Apply it on the scars is working great, once scars fade completely, I would apply it all over to even out skin. TRY THIS !!!!!</li>
    <li> amazing product.  I am in my early 40&#x27;s and still have acne from time to time, and my skin is starting to show signs of aging.  I hate to spend $100&#x27;s on skin care that may or may not work.  I tried this and have been very very happy.  I feel like my skin has cleared up, looks younger, and feels very soft.  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my skin feel great and does not leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. My skin is soft and glowing after 2 days use, once at night after I wash my face before bed.</li>
    <li> New glowing skin in days! SO in love with this!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely incredible. I am a skin care product junkie but I have sensitive skin and most products cause me to break out and made little or no improvement. I saw this oil at CVS and decided to give it a shot. This stuff is so great!! After 3-4 days of use before bed, my skin is brighter with a rosy glow, dark spots are fading, and wrinkles seem less noticeable. Best part, no acne! I&#x27;m very happy to have made this little discovery. I highly recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> I love it! It makes my skin so soft and supple. Very good for skin. My skin feels soft, smooth, and plump. I use it every night.</li>
    <li> really melts into your face, evens out skin color, not greasy</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Never thought I would put &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on my face and say that.  Used sparingly it absorbs into my skin.  Guess my skin has changed with age.</li>
    <li> So far I absolutely love this product and I do see a difference in my skin already. I have very dry skin and it&#x27;s sometimes sensitive. I had been looking around for awhile for a really good moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Most of them were okay but they didn&#x27;t really keep my face feeling moisturized for long enough. This definitely lasts for me. It takes a few minutes to soak in but after that it never feels greasy on my skin. I occasionally get pimples but this hasn&#x27;t caused any or any other unwanted effects so far. The other concerns with my skin was just looking dull, redness, and dark spots/scars. I&#x27;m impressed by the difference I see in my skin in just a short time. My skin looks healthier and the dark spots are fading already. The Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Skin Therapy Oil - Face is affordable and it&#x27;s a nice size for the price. I was worried about the scent of the product before I got it because I get headaches easily if scents are too strong. It wasn&#x27;t a problem for me at all and it has a pleasant rose scent to it. This is easily a new favorite of mine and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This has clear my face!!! i can&#x27;t believe it!!! buy it buy it !!! !:)</li>
    <li> My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the fragrance.  I&#x27;m not fond of putting anything on my face that has fragrance to it, and this is a very mild rosehip scent.  Although my mother loves it, I wish Palmer&#x27;s would come out with an unscented version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, this oil is incredible!  I am in my 20s and have extremely oily skin.  I have had adult acne since I was 21, and my skin is very sensitive to chemicals and allergens.  Using this oil in place of my nighttime moisturizer has STOPPED the oil production in my face!!  My face is smoother, I have noticeably less acne, drastically less oil, and my skin looks vibrant and healthy!  I&#x27;ll never go a night without this oil for my face!  I can&#x27;t believe I now have makeup-optional skin because of an oil!&lt;br /&gt;My mother is in her 50s and has beautiful skin, but it is getting dry and she can start to see fine lines and wrinkles.  She tried this oil after I begged her to, and she loves it!  It works great for moisturizing her skin, and her skin tone has become more vibrant and healthy as well.  She uses it morning and night, and after only a week you can see a difference in her fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to EVERYONE - it&#x27;s amazing!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true about the positive reviews. I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now to really see if it works. It does. My skin is soft and my pores are better. I&#x27;m 44 but I don&#x27;t look like it 😊</li>
    <li> This is incredible stuff.  I had debris buried in my face for decades that came dislodged after just a few days of using this item.  The Palmer&#x27;s site has free shipping, but it costs more per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order more than one:  you will wish that you did.</li>
    <li> Every now and then a product comes along that you know you will never run out of again. This is one. I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s (gasp, when did that happen???)  My skin wasn&#x27;t too bad, but it was looking dull and needed hydration. I was also noticing that my decolletage area was looking &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; I guess you could say. I started using this on my face, neck and decolletage areas and I feel like it took years off! I&#x27;m not kidding. I was not nervous about oil. I use olive oil to wash my face at night and have for years. I used to have very oil skin, but actually using oil has helped a lot. Think back to Science class. Like dissolves like! Try it. :) BTW, they also have a body oil that is awesome.</li>
    <li> This product broke me out pretty badly.  It never felt like it absorbed into my skin.  The scent is too strong as well.  I had high hopes for this after reading all the positive reviews.  But my skin did not like it at all.</li>
    <li> Seems to be great on my skin!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with this product.  I didn&#x27;t like the artificial fragrance, and the long list of clearly not natural ingredients.  It also left me with lots of small breakouts.  Unfortunately I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This formula is terrific!  After using this product for a month, I got comments from family and friends on my my improved skin tone. Try it.</li>
    <li> Think I&#x27;m allergic to something in this. Face swelled up with first use.</li>
    <li> I love this face oil!  I do prefer this one over the other Palmer&#x27;s face oil w/o retinol.  My skin has typical T-Zone oil &amp; I still get blemishes sometimes, but this face oil sinks right in &amp; gives me a dewy glow.  I rub it on my neck, as well.  This has never once clogged my pores or caused sun sensitivity; my skin tone, on my face, is fair/olive w/ a dusting of freckles.  I hope they never discontinue this.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product religiously, so it&#x27;s hard to rate it appropriately.  However, when I have used it, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin seems softer and smoother.  Will try to be more diligent in my usage and see what happens then....</li>
    <li> I work in a manufacturing plant that is high humidity, and then the outside air is average. I think this constant change in humidity is what causes my skin to become so dry all the time, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that helps that. I usually have combination skin and this just soaks into my skin perfectly, after a few minutes there is almost no oily residue and my breakouts have gotten much better since using this product.</li>
    <li> Love,the way this product makes my skin feel and look .works  well.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitivity to moisturizers and alike but with this product there are no break outs. It only makes your skin smooth and radiant. Disappointed Amazon&#x27;s price is so high. You can purchase for less from pharmacies and some super markets that carry the product even when not on sale. The prices I&#x27;ve found are between $10-$12.</li>
    <li> This is the wife, on my husband&#x27;s account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, this stuff is the bomb! Thanks to my perpetual dry skin and my 30&#x27;s kicking in in earnest, my untreated complexion is embarrassing to me. I don&#x27;t have many pimples but I have horrible red blotches (not rosacea) and dry patches that could make a mummy feel good about herself. I haven&#x27;t been able to wash my face with anything but water since I was a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this stuff and it was an instant improvement. Not only does it moisturize, but it totally evens out my skin tone and makes my skin feel as healthy as it looks. It is also light enough to use every day! Goodbye blotchy skin! I&#x27;ve never had instant results from any face care product before. I am so excited I found this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. It&#x27;s fragrance is slightly floral but not overwhelming. I received it fairly quickly and packaging worked fine. Try it out if you love body oil!</li>
    <li> Works great and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrific !!</li>
    <li> I like it for after I shave my legs.</li>
    <li> This face oil soaks in fast and is not greasy!  I love it for the winter months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different, high-priced product for years, but decided to give Palmer&#x27;s a try.  This therapy oil is AWESOME!  I cannot believe the difference it has made in the look and feel of my face already.</li>
