<li> It&#x27;s always hard to find nail polish collections at my local Ulta</li>
<li> Definitely need at least two coats, though!</li>
<li> - my nail lady had to put 4 coats on and it was still a little streaky.</li>
<li> I had gotten this nail polish a few days ago.  </li>
<li> This color is a little brighter than I would usually wear on my fingers, but when I wore it I got some compliments.</li>
<li> I hate pink.  </li>
<li> I mean ... HATE.  </li>
<li> I do use a base coat.</li>

    <li> I always find OPI to be the best nail polish to use.  This particular one is a little watery though.  It seems thinner than other colors I have and I need more coats.
