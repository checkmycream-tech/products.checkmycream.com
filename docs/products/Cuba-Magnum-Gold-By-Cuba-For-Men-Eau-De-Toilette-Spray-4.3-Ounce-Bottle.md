### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I know their frangrances show an excellent cost/benefit result.  </li>
      <li>The packaging was good, but the case in which the perfume came was excellent, a bit dented.</li>
      <li>It smells great.</li>
      <li>But either way I was happy with Cuba</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say you can get a good six hours out of this.</li>
      <li>i like it good smell and lasts</li>
      <li>Good for night outs and party wears</li>
      <li>But, this cologne smells really good.  </li>
      <li>Cuba is a great fragrance, probably my favorite for the price.</li>
      <li>I love it and will always order it!</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>but the bottle was amazing the way it was made.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s about 10 bucks for a nice sized bottle of the stuff--</li>
      <li>I save my Channel Bleu for special occasions but the Cuba Magnum Gold is a great every day fragrance for work or the gym.  </li>
      <li>When I upgraded to this larger one, I wasnt so impressed.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance</li>
      <li>Like the cologne, Now feels like I had to wait for the week after thanksgiving to get a better bargain (I paid $12.xx) now listed at $7.53.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This cologne smelled okay.</li>
      <li>and I fell in love with the Gold.</li>
      <li>Smells just like \\&quot;Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male\\&quot; with a hint more vanilla.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty sensual in a warm snuggly kind of way</li>
      <li>Smells good even though it don&#x27;t last for longer time but still good for the price we paid.</li>
      <li>I suggest you to try Cuba Gold whose smell is not so strong and lasts much longer, in a pleasant way, rather than this Magnum Gold.</li>
      <li>Thats very cool</li>
      <li>very nice and soft smelling Cologne</li>
      <li>This is easily comparable to many higher end fragrances-- and for 4.3 ounces!</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed as I found it here for under $10</li>
      <li>EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
      <li>I originally bought the variety pack of Cuba for Men, and my girlfriend</li>
      <li>To me, this is a perfect scent to wear for an intimate evening out with your significant other.</li>
      <li>I bought this item in a smaller size and I loved the smell.  </li>
      <li>The first impression is of a strong scent but wait for one hour</li>
      <li>It has a nice long lasting smell and the bottle is non-leaking so it is great for trips.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite fragrance I have tried so far.</li>
      <li>I would classify this as a romantic fragrance; not at all trendy or clubby like, say, La Nuit de L&#x27;homme.</li>
      <li>Its fun to give it as a gift.</li>
      <li>Great, cheap, long lasting cologne.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved this scent since my freshman year in high school, had to go big on this one.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll smell like a cheap pimp ( Loud, but no substance).</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>i have been ordering this colonge for years am very satisfyed with it.</li>
      <li>It was more than I expected.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get enough of those warm, powdery smells like this and Le Male.</li>
      <li>Lasts pretty long, and the price is right.</li>
      <li>highly recommended</li>
      <li>and since I bought other things at the time got free shipping as well.  </li>
      <li>A small puff should do the trick in avoiding you being recognized from a distance :).</li>
      <li>Very suitable as a casual signature type scent.</li>
      <li>Smells soft and powdery.</li>
      <li>I would be upset if I had to sit near someone who had this on ALL day.</li>
      <li>Sticks on you like glue.. LOUD and offensive...</li>
      <li>My least favorite cuba cologne</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>Obviously smells super similar to Le Male by JPG but for a fraction of the price.  </li>
      <li>(I think it&#x27;s the pineapple note that pulls it in that sweet cozy direction).</li>
      <li>It is a young scent, a little masculine though.</li>

    <li> I love this fragrance</li>
    <li> very nice and soft smelling Cologne this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought it I really like it</li>
    <li> Smells just like \\&quot;Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male\\&quot; with a hint more vanilla. Lasts pretty long, and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Like the cologne, Now feels like I had to wait for the week after thanksgiving to get a better bargain (I paid $12.xx) now listed at $7.53. But either way I was happy with Cuba Magnum.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely is a lot stronger the Polo Black (one of my favs) or Drakkar and is retained for about 4-6 hrs. A small puff should do the trick in avoiding you being recognized from a distance :). Good for night outs and party wears</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll smell like a cheap pimp ( Loud, but no substance). And the horrible smell NEVER goes away. Sticks on you like glue.. LOUD and offensive... I would be upset if I had to sit near someone who had this on ALL day. I intend gifting this to my father in law.. hehe..( he started it).</li>
    <li> I am a bit frustrated with this product.  I have been a Cuba customer for a long time, so I know their frangrances show an excellent cost/benefit result.  Nevertheless Cuba Magnum Gold does not last as long as the other Cuba products I have already tried.  The first impression is of a strong scent but wait for one hour and you will get quite diappointed with the smell.  I suggest you to try Cuba Gold whose smell is not so strong and lasts much longer, in a pleasant way, rather than this Magnum Gold.</li>
    <li> My least favorite cuba cologne but it&#x27;s still great</li>
    <li> i like the cologne, my concern is with the sprayer/nasal, after a couple of days of use it stopped working and now it pours out i do believe there is s defect and it should be addressed</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on a whim because I had never heard of it.  But, this cologne smells really good.  It was more than I expected.  I will continue to purchase it in the future.</li>
    <li> Always a WINNER with the ladies...men comment on it too.</li>
    <li> This cologne smelled okay. but the bottle was amazing the way it was made. Its fun to give it as a gift.</li>
    <li> i have been ordering this colonge for years am very satisfyed with it.</li>
    <li> Cuba is a great fragrance, probably my favorite for the price. I have been stocking up on it for about 4 years. I think I have enough to last a life time.</li>
    <li> Buen producto, Excelente.</li>
    <li> Wow. If there was ever a cheapy but goody, this is it. Lots and lots of quality for the price. This is easily comparable to many higher end fragrances-- and for 4.3 ounces! You can definitely smell the juniper, Bergamot and lavender in here. I would classify this as a romantic fragrance; not at all trendy or clubby like, say, La Nuit de L&#x27;homme. Very suitable as a casual signature type scent. The projection is a little weak but you can always amp it up by spraying on a little more (it&#x27;s about 10 bucks for a nice sized bottle of the stuff-- you don&#x27;t have to worry about wasting it). I&#x27;d say you can get a good six hours out of this. To me, this is a perfect scent to wear for an intimate evening out with your significant other. It&#x27;s pretty sensual in a warm snuggly kind of way (I think it&#x27;s the pineapple note that pulls it in that sweet cozy direction). Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Thought they were cigars. My mistake I guess.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in a smaller size and I loved the smell.  When I upgraded to this larger one, I wasnt so impressed.</li>
    <li> YES. I&#x27;ve loved this scent since my freshman year in high school, had to go big on this one.</li>
    <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
    <li> Obviously smells super similar to Le Male by JPG but for a fraction of the price.  I can&#x27;t get enough of those warm, powdery smells like this and Le Male.</li>
    <li> This cologne I purchased for my son. He has worn this scent for the last couple of years. It is a young scent, a little masculine though. It does have an undertone of floral with musk. He gets a lot of compliments when wearing it.</li>
    <li> It does not smell the same as regular Cuba gold , very disappointed it could be the fake version because its not even strong at all, Sending it back</li>
    <li> The packaging was good, but the case in which the perfume came was excellent, a bit dented. but I guess that&#x27;s shipping&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it hadn&#x27;t been dented I would have given it as a gift to my brother, I think I&#x27;ll keep it. It smells great. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommended</li>
    <li> I buy it for my grandfather...he LOVES it! He says the pump stops working sometimes when the bottle gets low, but other than that he has no complaints.</li>
    <li> I use a hint of cologne every day.  I save my Channel Bleu for special occasions but the Cuba Magnum Gold is a great every day fragrance for work or the gym.  I bought it before and was running low and hoped that it was still on Amazon at similar price.  I was not disappointed as I found it here for under $10 and since I bought other things at the time got free shipping as well.  I recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> nothing bad to say...  I love it and will always order it! I been buying this for over 10 years now.</li>
    <li> Smells soft and powdery.I have never smelt Lemale but this has been compared to it. Last long on my skin. Can&#x27;t beat the price for the amount of juice and scent.</li>
    <li> Smells good even though it don&#x27;t last for longer time but still good for the price we paid. Yes i would recommend</li>
    <li> i like it good smell and lasts</li>
    <li> I originally bought the variety pack of Cuba for Men, and my girlfriend and I fell in love with the Gold. You can not beat the price for this eau de toilette. It smells amazing and it lasts all day. This is my favorite fragrance I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> Thats very cool, i loveit</li>
    <li> Great, cheap, long lasting cologne.  My husband has used this for years as his daily, inexpensive, cologne.  I love it.  It has a nice long lasting smell and the bottle is non-leaking so it is great for trips.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son....came on time will order again</li>
