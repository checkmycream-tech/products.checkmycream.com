<ol>
      <li>Wonderful item!  </li>
      <li>Love it!!!!  </li>
      <li>Im so impressed with this thing.  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with this hairpiece.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a good amount of &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; and matches my hair perfect.</li>
      <li>but it looked great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never owned anything like this before, and it looks great</li>
      <li>This is a nice piece!</li>
      <li>This will be a great thing to have in about a month or so when I have more length to attach it to.</li>
      <li>My own pony works through.</li>
      <li>I had a perfect color match thanks to the highlights, and it held in place all night.</li>
      <li>Its ok....</li>
      <li>Great price and surprisingly natural looking.</li>
      <li>and I enjoy wearing it for going out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this is great for brides, as it will last all day, lasts in yoga class, salsa dancing, or house cleaning, (yes, it adds glamor to your scrubbing)&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
      <li>I wore it Saturday night and it stayed secure.</li>
      <li>these strands are high quality made synthetic, so the fine texture goes well with many peoples hair, there is just more of it.</li>
      <li>but this did not match at all, and the velcro used to keep it secure always gets full of hair</li>
      <li>The color is surprisingly nice--with different colors weaved in.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fun</li>
      <li>Matches  perfectly, easy to put on, and looks very natural!  </li>
      <li>Its soft and easy to put on.</li>
      <li>I also had a difficult time telling what the colors were to match my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The service was great!</li>
      <li>Pretty cute actually.</li>
      <li>R25 is a nice, multi-tonal light blonde with ash blonde.</li>
      <li>My only tip is i picked the light warm blonde and it was a bit darker than the picture, which worked because my roots are darker than my ends.</li>
      <li>I went to Ulta first to colormatch.  </li>
      <li>just as good as much more expensive hairpieces.  </li>
      <li>works very well but after a couple of times you need a new one ,I live in a real hot area</li>
      <li>The wrap Around Pony hairpiese by jessica looks and feel like real hair and color</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t tell difference from real hair.  </li>
      <li>Really looks natural though I wish I had gotten the lighter shade, it still works because I have so many colors naturally in my blonde hair.  </li>
      <li>R@% is a nice mix of light blonde strands with warm medium blonde accenting your base color, if you are a level 9 blonde, then this will be good for you.&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
      <li>is no ash or wheat tones in it, and i believe many people have these types of double blonde highlites in their hair.&lt;br /&gt;go</li>
      <li>It works better if you have a pony tail that is a little longer to start.  </li>
      <li>IT is so easy to put in and makes your hair look like you spent hours on it!</li>
      <li>Once I figure out how to attach it tightly enough, it should be fun.</li>
      <li>Im growing my hair out from a short cut and have a stubby pony tail right now</li>
      <li>My own pony is so thick, synthetic pony doesn&#x27;t wrap around it completely.</li>
      <li>I am a hairstylist and somdays i have to get up very early and just dont want to do my hair</li>
      <li>to ulta first and color swatch yourself, then come back and buy here as its cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hair is soft and color is very natural.  </li>
      <li>This is a natural looking way to enhance your natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great for going out when you want to look special.&lt;br</li>
      <li>are from the early Germanic tribes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this extension a lot of natural feeling strands.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
      <li>blondes very rarely have really thick hair, mostly those that have naturally blonde hair that is thick</li>
      <li>&gt; your ethnicity determines your hair, IF you HAIR IS naturally more coarse, thick ethnic, like from , Arabia, India, Mexico, Africa, or other parts of the world like Scotland, certain regions in eastern Europe, than you may want a weft from china or india.</li>
      <li>designed this and the other stylable extensions to an an average of Caucasian hair which each individual strand tends to be more thin and fine strands, not rough or coarse.</li>

<li> The hair was very nice quality, however, it wasn&#x27;t very thick and very difficult to curl.</li>

<li> This ponytail does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;when choosing a hair piece think of your ethnicity, i have had alot of experiences with hairpieces that were way to thick for my face, meaning the strands just felt heavy and</li>
<li> not sure if it&#x27;s me, or the way the colors were displayed</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too thin and does not come with a return slip.</li>
<li> The color is a red/ dirty blond, not like the picture I seen.</li>

    <li> Not happy with this purchase, sending it back. And I have to pay for the return shipping!!  The color is a red/ dirty blond, not like the picture I seen.</li>
    <li> works very well but after a couple of times you need a new one ,I live in a real hot area</li>
    <li> LOOVVEEE this simple pony tail. IT is so easy to put in and makes your hair look like you spent hours on it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful item!  Matches  perfectly, easy to put on, and looks very natural!  Love it!!!!  Arrived on the second business day after my evening order as well.</li>
    <li> The wrap Around Pony hairpiese by jessica looks and feel like real hair and color looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my granddaughter who dance at the competition and no one believe it was not her hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Pretty cute actually. The color is surprisingly nice--with different colors weaved in. My only complaint is it&#x27;s hard to keep it in. It needs those snap combs I&#x27;ve had in other extensions. Or a holes to help the bobby pins stay in. Once I figure out how to attach it tightly enough, it should be fun.</li>
    <li> The hair was very nice quality, however, it wasn&#x27;t very thick and very difficult to curl. I also had a difficult time telling what the colors were to match my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The service was great!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t tell difference from real hair.  just as good as much more expensive hairpieces.  the only problem is that it does fall out eventually, so have to check on it every so often.</li>
    <li> My own pony works through. My own pony is so thick, synthetic pony doesn&#x27;t wrap around it completely.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. It&#x27;s too thin and does not come with a return slip. Go to a beauty salon instead.</li>
    <li> Its ok.... Kinda thin though I was hoping for something a little more substantial especially bc of the other reviews stating that it was heavy</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this hairpiece.  I went to Ulta first to colormatch.  Hair is soft and color is very natural.  A bit too long so I am having stylist trim it up.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and somdays i have to get up very early and just dont want to do my hair but it still needs to look topnotch! This ponytail does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;when choosing a hair piece think of your ethnicity, i have had alot of experiences with hairpieces that were way to thick for my face, meaning the strands just felt heavy and blah, these usually are the cheaper synthetic hair, or human hair from india thats a mix of coarser strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so Ken Paves  designed this and the other stylable extensions to an an average of Caucasian hair which each individual strand tends to be more thin and fine strands, not rough or coarse. this extension a lot of natural feeling strands.&lt;br /&gt;Most blondes very rarely have really thick hair, mostly those that have naturally blonde hair that is thick are from the early Germanic tribes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; your ethnicity determines your hair, IF you HAIR IS naturally more coarse, thick ethnic, like from , Arabia, India, Mexico, Africa, or other parts of the world like Scotland, certain regions in eastern Europe, than you may want a weft from china or india. these strands are high quality made synthetic, so the fine texture goes well with many peoples hair, there is just more of it.

    <li> This is a natural looking way to enhance your natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great for going out when you want to look special.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fun and I enjoy wearing it for going out.</li>

    <li> I was a bit skeptical whether or not this would work with my fine hair but it looked great. I had a perfect color match thanks to the highlights, and it held in place all night. I would definitely buy this again. My only tip is i picked the light warm blonde and it was a bit darker than the picture, which worked because my roots are darker than my ends.</li>

Really looks natural though I wish I had gotten the lighter shade, it still works because I have so many colors naturally in my blonde hair.  It works better if you have a pony tail that is a little longer to start.  Im growing my hair out from a short cut and have a stubby pony tail right now and it curls under but that is not this products fault.  This will be a great thing to have in about a month or so when I have more length to attach it to. Great price and surprisingly natural looking. If I had to fault it, maybe it could be a bit thicker.</li>
