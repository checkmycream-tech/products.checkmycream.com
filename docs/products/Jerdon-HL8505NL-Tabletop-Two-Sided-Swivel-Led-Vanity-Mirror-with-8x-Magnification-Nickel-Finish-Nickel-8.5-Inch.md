<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My daughter loves her new mirror. Very good quality and the nickel finish matches her fixtures.</li>
    <li> The light around the mirror just is not bright enough for me - and that is maybe what is making the magnification not seem strong enough. But the instruction sheet/booklet states the magnification is 5x and the mirror has an 8x sticker on it. Assume it is 8x but they should update their booklet. Also the on-off button is very poorly designed - it can be turned to the right or left - but only one direction turns the mirror off. Think it would break fast if I continued to do it the wrong way. Decided to return it after 48 hours. Otherwise seems well made - and is probably a very good mirror as long as you don&#x27;t need brighter lights to see (I am getting older - so may be my issue alone!)</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected, but is satisfactory in overall function.  Attractive frame.</li>
    <li> Loved this mirror but I got it in Octo 14 and all bulbs are out, less than 6 months later.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I saw one something like it at a hotel.  I use it to pull out small facial hairs, but my husband has ended up using it more than myself to get eyelashes out from his eye.  The light could be brighter (which is why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star), but it is bright enough at certain angles, and words fine with the room light also on.  It is heavy, good quality.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I previously had an old school Remington mirror that folds open, with 4 settings. I&#x27;ve had this mirror for 10+ years and never had to replace a bulb, and believe me, I used the crap outta that thing. I was looking for a replacement ONLY because I wanted something smaller that took up less space, plus, higher magnification (I think my Remington was only 1x/3x). With that said, this Jerdon mirror was everything I wanted. I spent countless hours comparing and reviewing other mirrors before my purchase and was so pleased when I got it. The lighting and mag are great!! A+.... HOWEVER, I got this for Christmas, it is now January 22 (less than a month later) and the bulbs went out. Done. Maybe I got a faulty product, I&#x27;m not sure, but I chose this mirror because the lighting is not supposed to go out!! Crap product.</li>
    <li> The magnification and the lights are amazing!  This is the best lighted mirror that I have purchased.  It is a beautiful piece to my vanity.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the purchase.  The mirror is well constructed, looks great with the nickel finish, and the 8x magnification works well.</li>
    <li> Use this mirror everyday in my master bathroom while getting ready.  Great for detailed grooming and makeup application with very natural, clear light.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the light could be twice as bright, but still a high quality, solid mirror that I&#x27;m cool with using for everyday use.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product daily for about 2 months and it&#x27;s worked flawlessly. The lighting is neither too bright nor dull and I am very happy with the 8x magnification. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The mirror did not have the magnification that it advertised.  This is first of two different Jerdon mirrors that I bought and returned for the same reason.</li>
    <li> Love the magnification level and the light.  The best part was it was not as expensive as other&#x27;s that I considered</li>
    <li> Great light for my makeup in the morning.  Sturdy and attractive</li>
    <li> Worth the price , quality light and mirror .</li>
    <li> Bought the Jerdon 8X mirror w/ LED light for my wife for Christmas.  She loves it &amp; says it was just what she wanted.  The mirror must be good because she is pretty &amp;#34;picky&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Everthing look good and arrived on time, my daughter 14 going on 25 is in love with it. Personally don&#x27;t know much about them, all I know she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> THE BOTTOM LINE:  This feature rich mirror has a 1 year, no hassle warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(+) GOOD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POWER: The interior lamp has enough wattage to create a bright viewing area. It is electrically powered via a clear cord placed in the back of the base. There is a convenient power switch to turn the light on or off without disconnecting the plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LED TECHNOLOGY: The lamp has been designed to deliver ample bright light for years without replacement.  These features make it superior to other mirrors I considered, including the [[ASIN:B000U0F9GA Conair BE47BR Double-Sided Illuminated Oval Mirror, Oiled Bronze]]  and [[ASIN:B001BHUFTC Zadro VAN410 Two-Sided Vanity Swivel Mirror, Satin Nickel, 1X and 10X]].  Both use incandescent lamps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DESIGN: The mirror is 8.5\\&quot; in diameter, and 12\\&quot; tall, a good height for viewing and stability. The base is heavier than the mirror casing, so it doesn&#x27;t topple easily. The level of magnification available displays details clearly.  Toggle between the two views by simply flipping the mirror. The brushed nickel finish is attractive, durable and resistant to surface scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARRANTY:  1 year coverage against defects.  Jerdon is very responsive and shipped out a replacement upon receipt of proof of purchase.  No hassle returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(+/-) SO-SO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPECTRUM:  The color of the light has a greenish cast that does not imitate daylight.  This can be an inconvenience, depending on how one uses the mirror, but is an issue that can be worked around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUALITY:  The magnification is ample, however, it is not 8X.  To measure, I drew a 1\\&quot; line on a piece of paper and held it up to the mirror.  I moved it away from the mirror until it was as long (magnified) as possible yet still in focus.  Then I held up a ruler to the line and measured it.  The line was .5\\&quot; longer than the first measurement.  To be 8X magnification, the line should have been 8 times longer.  From a usability standpoint, I&#x27;ve found this level of magnification to be functional.  However, it does not match the product description.This may not be uncommon and may explain the wide disparity in the price of competing products.  I paid more for this mirror to get what I believed was greater magnification (and a few other features) than lower priced mirrors but did not measure them. From a practical standpoint, this mirror&#x27;s magnifying side functions well despite the technical details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I downgraded my review after three months due to discovery of the aforementioned issues.  Jerdon&#x27;s customer service and no hassle return policy compensates for most of the concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPARABLES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair has a very small viewing area that makes it impractical. It is not well weighted and uses a dim incandescent lamp. The Zadro also has an incandescent lamp and doesn&#x27;t offer the design features of this mirror.I&#x27;ve found this level of magnification to be functional.
