    <li> Great product!  I use it on a daily basis and love it.  Shopping a Amazon was convenient and easy.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This line has done wonders for my skin! It&#x27;s softer, more vibrant, brighter. I love the way the products smell! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> It arrived today and I love it.  I have used dermalogica for years and the small size of the normal barrier repair goes so quickly.  I was so excited to find a bigger size!</li>

    <li> Excellent product, excellent price. The delivery of this product was exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday with my moisturizer.  A little bit goes a long way. You can use it at night too.  It really works.</li>
    <li> I love this line of dermalogica!  The barrier repair makes my face feel silky &amp; smooth with no irritation or residue.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect cream for me. I have dry skin and it is hearty but light and silky. I&#x27;ve tried so many products over my lifetime and this is the first I have found works perfectly. I have very light pale, dry skin. I use this on my face.</li>
    <li> This barrier repair glides on smoothly and is very protective to the skin. I purchased it to use on my face but used it on 2 small patches on my hands that are sensitive to soaps. It worked wonders. A little too expensive to use on larger areas of the body but perfect for small areas.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my esthetician. It has helped with the redness on my cheeks and nose. It feels really nice going on. You only need to use a little, so this size of tube will last a long time. My mom was complaining about chapped hands from gardening, so I let her use this to soothe them. I had to buy an extra tube for her. She loves it. It&#x27;s expensive to use on hands, but the relief she felt was worth it.</li>
    <li> amazing product!  fast shipping!  visible improvement, but not complete healing (the problem is very complex)</li>
    <li> The tiny metal seal was on the rim after removing the cap. The product works well after procedures to trap moisture onto the skin and creates a make-up kind of look, which hides redness. Make-up applies well over this product too because of the silicone.</li>
    <li> So glad there is an option to buy online, as it much more economical than buying at an overpriced spa.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive acne prone skin. Wears great under make-up. Love this product very much. Will buy again. Cheaper through here.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with the seller, who gave me exactly what I expected at a great price.  I just don&#x27;t think the product is a good match for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Especially in winter I must have this. It repairs redness caused by dry skin and chapping. On a daily basis I apply, sometimes mixing in with my moisturizer. Also provides a great base for applying foundation.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and was pleased to find it in the larger salon size tube. It can get pricey when using the smaller tubes.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have very sensitive skin that tends to turn very red. Since I&#x27;ve been using dermalogica barrier repair along with the daily microfolient and ultra calming serum concentrate my skin looks great !!! ( I also use a clarisonic with the microfolient ). I have people ask me what I&#x27;ve done to my skin it looks so nice and rested !!!! I&#x27;ve also left the house lately and forgotten to wear my foundation !!!!! That has NEVER happen before !!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a stunning buy ... my skin has never felt so soft and hydrated ... truly one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried!!</li>
    <li> I love Dermalogica barrier repair and was happy to find a &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; size tube available.  It did not come in it&#x27;s original box, so I was nervous at first, but the foil cover was there and I still had some of the product left in my previous tube and was able to compare it and it looks, feels, smalle, and applies exactly the same. It&#x27;s legit.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Dermalogica barrier repair is a superior product. It has no perfumes in it but contains natural ingredients that is very soothing  and gentle to my skin</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES this product and we will continue to buy it time and time again.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry about the lack of detail, but I don&#x27;t use this product. I simply buy it for my&lt;br /&gt;bride.</li>
