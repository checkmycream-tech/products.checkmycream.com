<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The fact that I can use this on my face AND body is perfect because I get occasional breakouts on my shoulders too.  This is great for making your skin feel fresh, clean, and for getting rid of those blemishes.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have decided to stick with using this scrub by Beauty Facial Extreme because it delivers the perfect amount of moisture to my skin while also cleaning it. I decided to try this one because it&#x27;s for both the face and body. Usually products are only for one or the other. I&#x27;ve had dry and flaky skin during these winter months. It was rather embarrassing walking around with flaky skin on my face. It would also look way worse if I tried to cover it up with makeup. No product has taken care of it until I&#x27;ve tried this scrub. The scrub action in it is very powerful. It&#x27;s a lifesaver and left the skin on my face and back problem free. I absolutely love it! It works so well on my skin. It&#x27;s very rare to find something that my daughter and I both can share when it comes to facial products.&lt;br /&gt; It would also look way worse if I tried to cover it up with makeup. No product has taken care of it until I&#x27;ve tried this scrub. The scrub action in it is very powerful. It&#x27;s a lifesaver and left the skin on my face and back problem free.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel amazing!! High quality product, I definitely recommend trying</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for your skin!</li>
    <li> This product really help fade the dark spots on my face . It also help reduce the appearance of my black heads.</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing and different from other scrubs that I have used. I wear a lot of make up so scrubbing my face and getting all of the make up off is a must for me. Unfortunately, all other scrubs eventually dry my skin out and I can&#x27;t use them anymore. This product is so gentle yet so so effective. My face feels brand new after every time I use it. It&#x27;s soft, make up free, and refreshed. It cleans my pores very well which in turn makes them appear smaller, and I&#x27;ve always struggled with large pores. A little of this product goes a long way. Give it a try and treat yourself.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever had!!!  I&#x27;ve tried so many scrub before but none like this one.  Leaves your face smoother, brighter and fresh looking.  Wonderfull product.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> 2 kids later and it shows on my face. I tried this and it made a difference immediately. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! It works so well on my skin. It&#x27;s very rare to find something that my daughter and i both can share when it comes to facial products. It does wonders to her acne and our dry skin, not to mention what it does to loose skin. As us women age we tend to have little places where to be honest we just want our skin to be as tight as when we were our daughters age and this cream is perfect for it! You can even use it on your body and face! Especially after moving from Florida to Indy the climate change has been so tough on our skin. Thanks to this Exfoliating Face &amp; Body Scrub our skin has never been better. It doesn&#x27;t even take much to show what a difference it makes.</li>
    <li> This exfoliating scrub is to die for. I have never found something that can clean and exfoliate at the same time while doing an amazing job. I feel cleaner and brighter, and my skin is glowing. It really works on both your face as well as the rest of your body. Good for all skin types.</li>
    <li> Another good product by Beauty facial extreme. It removes dead skin cells consistently and you can’t find this kind of product often. I applied this scrub for nearly two weeks and I found better improvement compared to past. This product improves our skin tone and Make your skin feel smooth and flawless.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised by how small the container is, I thought of returning it but I ended gave it a try. It is really good on my skin it lighten and dark spot faded in just few uses..</li>
    <li> Works perfectly my skin has never felt or looked better. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products and without a doubt this has been the best, I&#x27;ve never had such radiant looking skin before. Just one jar has gone so far I highly recommend to anyone wanting to clear up troublesome acne, it&#x27;s been a lifesaver for me.</li>
    <li> This is my new jam. Jam alert! Jams on jams, I&#x27;ll tell you that much.</li>
    <li> My face has always given me problems due to climate  or wether change.  This product has not only improved my skin but also made me lot confident about my self.</li>
    <li> This scrub makes your skin feel like new. It also feels so soft after the first use. I will definitely continue buying this scrub.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference using this. Way too expensive to buy when you get the same results as you would using cheap stuff.</li>
    <li> This product is the best. It makes my skin feel smooth and clean. I love it.</li>
    <li> I made the decision to get this clean because I’ve always had discolorations on my experience (dark splotches) and I haven’t had much fortune with items in previous times to create them vanish. I’ve tried it all! Lotions, creams, outfits, and bleaches! Nothing has even come near to the outcomes I’ve seen from this particular clean. Within about per 7 days, I began to see them reduce on my chin area and face. I hardly had to use any on my experience as a little goes a lengthy way. Really like love love this item and I can’t delay to see what the lengthy run outcomes of the clean will be!</li>
    <li> It is a face and body scrub and I used it. I purchase it many time&amp;#62; it is awesome products for women girls as well as for men. . I am using it at regular basis and I am satisfied with this product. This is awesome product in its category. I liked it and recommended to every one to use it.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy how a small amount goes a long way, and it is gentle but effective. I like how soft and clear my skin looked after using it for a week.  Now, I think my skin craves it every other day. I use a gentle facial wash first to open my pores, then the scrub, and rinse. It rinses off easily.</li>
    <li> Great scrub for the face. It left my skin feeling very smooth and clear. It made my face look lighter and more even.</li>
    <li> I love how effective this product is at improving my skin. As I’m aging my skin doesn’t look perfect anymore. What this product does is miraculous, I could see improvements just a few days after using it. I also like how gentle it is on the skin, it definitely doesn’t leave any burn on the skin or anything like that.</li>
    <li> This Stuff is Amazing! My wife ordered it and wanted me to try it out to get rid of some of the Acne that I was having trouble with. Cleared it up in less than a week! It has made my wife more confident in the way she looks because she is looking amazing because of this exfoliating cream! Will definitely get another one after ours runs out!</li>
    <li> good for the face, good for the body, what isn&#x27;t to love! It&#x27;s a good size for throwing in my travel bag, perfect for handling those environmental changes and their effects on my skin - rrc</li>
    <li> This face and body scrub works great. I started using this scrub and got effective result. It works very well to exfoliate and I would definitely rub gently though, because its powerful on its own and won&#x27;t need lot of pressure to remove the dead skin. It helped to remove old skin and rough patches. It has given me even tone making healthy, fresh and charming look.</li>
    <li> I use this on my body because I have rough and dry skin and it helps make everything feel smooth.... I work in a factory and have to wear another suit OVER my scrubs and I am on my feet and using my hands all day.... And my hands get really dried out from washing them and using hand sanitizer right after that before going in the clean room and this feels great.</li>
    <li> My goodness what can I say? I have had horrible skin for so many years but after I tried this product that began to change. I can&#x27;t express how happy and amazing it feels to have nice skin thanks to this. I use it once a week and I love the way it&#x27;s made my skin feel! Like a baby&#x27;s butt I swear!</li>
    <li> My mother had a lot age spots and sun spots. She wanted to get a new skin tone. I found this product and she liked it a lot! Now, she is happy and wonderful! I will buy it more and more times, so my mom will be happy!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST Exfoliating scrub EVER! I have purchased many over the last 20 years and this one is worth every penny! If you are hesitating on whether or not to purchase this product, don&#x27;t! You will be pleased and a little goes a long way! I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> A small amount goes a long way, and the skin feels clean and ready for moisturizing or make-up. Have used it as directed for 4 or 5 weeks, but I am not sure if it&#x27;s really effective as they claim for reducing scars or dark spots.</li>
    <li> scrub is always better than a face wash and this one is even better. When you use it you will automatically get to know. I had a lot of spots on my face when i was young and then i started using this products. You wont believe i got incredible results in a very less time. I think one should try it .</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it three times every week. It is very gentle to the skin.</li>
    <li> As a guy a good scrub is great prior to shaving and this scrub not only prep&#x27;d my face for a good shave but my skin felt as soft as a baby&#x27;s. You don&#x27;t need too much, a small amount goes a long way. I normally use it 2-3 times a week. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a scrub that contained pumice granules. I love it!! I love pumice stones and know how amazingly effective they are for my feet so I was excited to try this on my face&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been using several of the BFE face products together but this one has made the most difference. I worried it would feel raw on my skin but it&#x27;s such a gentle exfoliation.  My skin shines even after the first use. After several it&#x27;s like one have new skin. A new face. Hydrated and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Received free in exchange for my honest review</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this body wash. It smells so fresh and you can smell the natural ingredients. The ingredients are so great that they dont let your skin damage and even provides good smell. My hands and legs are very soft.</li>
    <li> Great products, after using this scrub makes my face feel so smooth.</li>
    <li> It is really good product. I ordered it and it feels so nice on my skin. My skin feels smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I intend to order more of this product. I look forward to using it more and more.</li>
    <li> This exfoliating face and body scrub makes my skin feel amazing. I use it everyday in he shower. It&#x27;s a light blue color and when you use it you can feel the exfoliants working. I have sensitive skin and was worried it would make me break out but it  does not burn or irritate my skin at all. My skin feels smoother and my pores look smaller after using this. I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin that wishes to have clean clear skin that is hydrated and healthy looking. These are absolutely my very own honest opinions after having received and tried this product for free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> I know everyone goes for the over the counter products but this one is a winner. I have used Ebay and tried everything I could find and even went to all of the Wal-Mart&#x27;s in my area and nothing helped until I found this. This item really handles all of my facial imperfections and it works very quickly. This is the only beauty product I use for my face now.</li>
    <li> This scrub worked so well for me that I doubt I&#x27;ll ever switch back to my old scrub. My skin has become so much softer since using this product, and I don&#x27;t have a pimple or blackhead in sight! For anyone struggling with acne or skin problems, I would highly encourage you to try this out.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing,i feel my face alot cleaner not to mention it feels as if it has toned down my blackheads</li>
    <li> It restores that natural glow back to your face, and I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in the importance of exfoliation. When I&#x27;m not using something homemade, I use this and get similar results. Love the packaging too!</li>
    <li> Beauty Facial Extreme products are amazing! I use several of them, and this one is my favorite. The scrub sensation feels like it is working right away. This product has helped me stay acne free within the first week of use. My pores look smaller too. I can confirm that this product works as described. I use it in the shower every morning, and my skin loves it!</li>
    <li> super duper product wow!  Will order really soon!  But I wish it came in a bigger container!</li>
    <li> This scrub is awesome.</li>
    <li> Great body scrub. Leaves skin smooth and fresh. Powerful exfoliator.</li>
    <li> This facial and body scrub works fine. I only used it on my face for my acne, and saw some clear improvement in about three weeks. It does not really whitens my skin but I really like the deep cleansing it provides for my skin. Overall, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from severe acne most of my life and have used every otc cream out there. A dermatologist recently told me that if I used an exfoliant it would help tremendously. She was right! This cream is amazing! My skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> This body and face scrub is just awesome... Its smell beautifully...  The paste is fine... and you feel nice and relaxing while massaging on your skin... Pores are deeply cleaned and a bright clean moisturized effect is left</li>
    <li> I used to try different products over a period of time but they did not help me overcome the malnourished skin of mine. Tried this and I have results. Introduced it to my fiance as well. She says that it&#x27;s great and I can see it through her glow as well. Definitely ordering a new batch.</li>
    <li> This product is a good thing to buy these days...especially if you want to brighten up your skin.</li>
    <li> it was eh....wasnt as great as described.</li>
