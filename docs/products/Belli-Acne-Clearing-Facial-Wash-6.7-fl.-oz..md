<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did not receive the acne clearing facial wash, but instead a body wash.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a whim when I saw it on sale on another site. I have normal skin, but usually use an acne type facial wash to keep blackheads away. This was a dream come true because I had the hardest time in stores finding anything safe during pregnancy other than Purpose, or the original Nuetrogena wash. I keep this tube by my sink and use it at night. I LOVE that it says it&#x27;s exfoliating, as that helps keep pores clear. I also used Purpose in my shower for mornings. Using the two has still kept my skin in tip top shape this entire pregnancy!   It&#x27;s very gentle, and I love love love that it can be used as a mask as well. Thanks Belli for providing amazing products pregnant (and breastfeeing) women can still use! :)</li>
    <li> After studying the scientific literature and research we came to the conclusion that every preservative ingredient has some concerns about some sort of toxicity issues.  And yet, it is still crucial that products contain a preservative ingredient to decrease the risk of bacterial contamination. The challenge for any manufacturer is to choose the preservative with the best overall safety profile for the particular application.  We decided that avoiding risks of birth defects was our number one priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, also known as IPBC, is a white or slightly off-white crystalline powder that contains iodine. It is used in a wide variety of cosmetics and personal-care products.&lt;br /&gt;The safety of Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate has been assessed by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel. The CIR Expert Panel evaluated the scientific data and concluded that Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate was safe as a cosmetic ingredient at concentrations less than or equal to 0.1%. Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate should not be used in products intended to be aerosolized.&lt;br /&gt;CIR Safety Review: The CIR Expert Panel noted the low degree of sensitization observed in some studies and acknowledged the mild skin irritation potential of Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate at concentrations of 0.5% and above. Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate was negative in tests for mutagenicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a careful study of the different classes of preservatives for a rinse-off product like Belli Acne Cleansing Facial Wash we switched to iodopropynyl butylcarbamate several years ago because the paraben class of preservatives (methyl, ethyl, propyl, butylparaben-- the most common ones found in cosmetic products) had questionable links to birth defects, estrogenic activity, and even breast cancer.&lt;br /&gt;Belli products try to use the most appropriate preservative ingredients for each individual formulation. Preservative selectiondepends on several key factors, including:&lt;br /&gt;* The type, nature and condition of the product;&lt;br /&gt;* Who&#x27;s expected to use it;&lt;br /&gt;* How it&#x27;s intended to be used.&lt;br /&gt;In the United States, regulatory oversight of cosmetic products, including preservative ingredients, is the responsibility of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Among its responsibilities, the FDA has the authority to ban or restrict ingredients due to safety concerns. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR), an independent scientific body that works in tandem with the FDA, thoroughly reviews and assesses the safety of ingredients and publishes results in scientific journals.&lt;br /&gt;In the European Union, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) is responsible for the safety evaluation of cosmetic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;The Belli Brand complies with all regulations in the markets in which we operate, and often exceeds them with our own high standards of additional screening&lt;br /&gt;Every preservative ingredient in the Belli Pregnancy collection must pass teratology screening for safety (See below). When selecting preservatives, Belli products adhere to other safety steps, including:&lt;br /&gt;* Ongoing review of the most up-to-date research and available data on preservative ingredients&lt;br /&gt;* Identifying potential factors that may have an impact on the effectiveness and safety of the product&#x27;s use, including how it will be used and where it will be stored&lt;br /&gt;* Evaluating all suppliers of our ingredients to ensure shipments conform to our high standards for quality and safety.&lt;br /&gt;Our extensive teratology screening process showed that iodopropynyl butylcarbamate (at the concentration we use of less than 0.1%) was one of the few effective preservatives available that has no links to birth defects, miscarriage, or other problems during pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;At Belli, our highest priority is you and your baby. That&#x27;s why we are constantly studying the best ingredients with no demonstrated teratogeniceffects taking the greatest care in developing safe products that pass the Belli safety screening. We appreciate your feedback and we assure you that we are looking for the safest ingredients to reformulate our products if necessary</li>
    <li> I had broken out in a pattern on the lower part of my face in little red bumps, including little points of pus.  The entire area was reddish and irritated and peeling constantly. The skin looked strained. After one week of using this facial wash, my skin is clear and smooth again. I teamed it up with a no-preservative skin calming face lotion for sensitive skin from the cosmetic company La Roche-Posay called Toleriane.  Notice the scent though---ahhhh! It&#x27;s a lovely non-literal citrus note: spirit-lifting and calming. Not a cheesy cosmetic scent at all! I sniffed a few other products by Belli in a drugstore recently, and they all smell great! I alternate how I use the wash: morning-just a regular cleanse and rinse; evening-leave a light layer on as a mask for a minute or two (not longer this stuff works!) and then rinse. Pre-pregnancy I was a dedicated Shiseido fan. Now I could imagine using the Belli cleanser indefinitely.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product.  Suffered through some severe acne during the first trimester, blotchy dry skin patches, redness, and cyctic like acne around the nose and mouth and chin.  not sure if its the miracle of this product or just the coming of the second trimester but I have been using this for two weeks and this is the first week in as long as I can remember where I didn&#x27;t wake up with any new acne!  I don&#x27;t love that it doesn&#x27;t get a nice foam, but it seems to be working.  fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> I adore this product. My acne while pregnant resembles that of my teenage students - it has been horrible! I tried several different pregnancy-safe options before I took the plunge to buy this miracle wash...not one worked. I had tons of tiny red bumpy whiteheads all over my chin line and regular zits were 100% worse than I ever had before. This face wash has alleviated almost 90% of all my acne. Woo-hoo! I feel human again. I also have sensitive skin and this product does not bother me in the slightest.      My only complaint is that a bottle lasts only a little longer than a month. I wish it were thicker so I wouldn&#x27;t lose some while washing.</li>
    <li> Every pregnancy is different; therefore, not everything will work for everyone, unfortunately.  I am a pleased customer and recommend this product for two reasons.  The most important one is that it is safe to use during pregnancy.  I asked my dermatologist and my OB/GYN and they both approved.  The second one is that it soothed my red, blotchy, acne skin.  I am a first time mother and my first three months were not kind to my skin.  I have ALWAYS had acne problems and due to my pregnancy, I could no longer use the prescribed acne medications and was at a loss.  I was so embarrassed about my skin, as if pregnancy is not hard enough as is.  I looked like a tomato with a rash and the acne got progressively worse as time passed by.  This is NOT a cure, but I found it soothing and calming.  Within a few days of using it for the first time, I noticed my skin was not as irritated, as red.  The rash and acne cleared up a bit.  It&#x27;s been a month since I started using it and I am pleased with the results.  The redness has diminished significantly.  I am not acne free, but this stuff helped me a lot.  My skin is not as bad as it was, for sure!  It&#x27;s gentle and SAFE to use.  It has a great smell too.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I felt I had to because this product saved my skin. After using this product I have the best skin I have ever had!  I have had acne on and off all of my life. Over the last few years I had been using proactiv to keep my skin from breaking out. When I got pregnant with my first child, my skin broke out all over and proactiv was not working at all. I actually felt I was becoming allergic to it and it was making my condition worse.  I ordered Belli Acne Clearing wash and within a week or so my skin was clear. I even like to use it as a mask twice a week. I love the one step solution; all I have to use is this and sunscreen, which couldn&#x27;t be an easier routine. It has given me my skin back, and I am worry free. Thank you Belli!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it claimed it would help with pregnancy acne with natural ingredients.  I have been using it for a month now, and my acne has gotten worse, not better.  It does smell  really good, but it made my face burn and really dry and itchy.  I think it&#x27;s probably just better   for people without sensative skin.</li>
    <li> Just received it in the mail and so far it&#x27;s been working for me.  I absolutely love the smell of the cleanser!  I will definitely be buying more of this!</li>
    <li> I really really like this product.  I use it along with the belli pre-treatent scrub and rotate the two depending on how my skin is.  The scent is great and I like that I can also use it as a face mask if needed.  Once I found out i was pregnant I did a bunch of research since I could no longer use my Differen cream. This has been a great replacement for me.  Even if I have a few spots, they heal quickly.  Great product, will likely continue to use it after pregnancy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had breakouts since my early twenties, not massive cystic acne or anything, but little blemishes that form under the skin and make my complexion look bumpy. My breakouts got especially bad when I was PMSing, so I knew I was in for it when I became pregnant. When I discovered I was pregnant, I got off my Neutrogena salicylic acid wash and switched to this. Now, I had to make several modifications to the product as it didn&#x27;t completely remove my makeup (however it works great in the morning to get rid of any excess oil before doing your makeup) so I deducted one star. Now for those of you who say it doesn&#x27;t foam up - it doesn&#x27;t. It also doesn&#x27;t contain sodium laureth sulfates, which is used in most bubbling/foaming products to add a bubbling/foaming effect, and it also is considered a possible carcinogenic and maintains residual levels in the heart, lungs and brain from skin contact... So needless to say, I&#x27;m okay that it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;foam up.\\&quot; I first use a non-comodegenic oil such as organic olive or jojoba oil to remove my makeup with a cotton pad, and then use this face wash to do a thorough cleanse and wash off with a muslin cloth. If I didn&#x27;t use the muslin cloth to gently scrub off the face wash, I have the feeling that it might leave a residue or film on my face, but with the cloth my skin feels soft refreshed and best of all I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or new acne forming. Because it had really kept any new breakouts at bay, even without the tried-and-true anti-acne medications, and because it is baby-safe, I truly think this is worth the price tag. Give it a try with a cloth to scrub, and try it as the \\&quot;mask\\&quot; where you leave it on a thin layer for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> I am 28 weeks pregnant and have been experiencing severe, painful acne since week 5. I had tried just about everything safe for pregnancy before ordering Belli Acne Clearing Facial Wash, and nothing was working. After using this product for under a week, I notice a dramatic difference in my skin. The existing blemishes are significantly reduced and (so far) no additional cystic, painful blemishes have made an appearance. I also purchased the spot treatment, but honestly, since using the facial wash each night, I have not even needed to use the spot treatment. Very happy with this purchase. I feel like I don&#x27;t have to cake on the make-up (which just made the situation worse) before leaving the house. Pregnancy is hard enough, so glad to have my skin and confidence back! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It helped at first but after a week or so I saw my face getting back to the way it looked (breakouts) if not worse.</li>
    <li> I am not pregnant nor have I ever been pregnant.  I have however been desperately searching for an \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; acne cleanser that has no salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.  Based on other reviews of women who were not pregnant endorsing this product, I decided to give it a try.    I have hormonal acne (ie, comes and goes with my period), and I figured pregnancy acne is based on hormones. :)    This wash is not very lathery or foamy, and in some ways feels a bit \\&quot;thin.\\&quot;  If you quickly rub it on and off your face, I don&#x27;t think it does much good.  However, I have had success leaving it on my face for a few min and then washing it off.  It has improved the condition of my skin, and does not create dried or irritated areas like other acne washes.     The product does leak out of the packaging a little at the bottom over time, so I would probably give it 4 stars.  However, I really want to encourage \\&quot;natural\\&quot; acne face washes, and I like their formulation, so I give it 5 stars.  I actually prefer it to my Origins Checks and Balances face wash right now, when I never thought I would find a product I liked better than that!  It is pricey, but comparable to other pricey washes that I like a lot less.</li>
    <li> Belli Acne Clearing Facial Wash cleared my pregnancy acne in 2 weeks.  I wish I had known about this product from the beginning of the pregnancy.  The wash has also been helpful post-pregnancy in helping keep my skin clear.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like amazing lemongrass but that&#x27;s the only positive I could find. It didn&#x27;t work for me. It came in a terrible tube that busted in the mail and leaked through it&#x27;s tube, plastic bag, and outer cardboard box. I emailed Belli customer service for a replacement and they&#x27;ve done nothing. A mistake!!!!</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin anyways and then when I became pregnant I could no longer use my other face washes because of the sacylic acid. So after my face looking horrible for the first few months I knew I had to find something to help me. I found this on a maternity clothing website and then looked it up on Amazon and found it for the same price. I have been using it ever since and have already re-ordered it. I work for a Dermatologist and she is going to start carrying it in her office to sell to her pregnant patients because the results were so great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good as advertised. I love this skin care product! And I feel safe while using this. Although I am not sure it is really helpful for curing acne since I don&#x27;t have acne but my face is very comfortable after using this.</li>
    <li> Before I found out I was pregnant my skin was freaking out and I was using everything on the market to try and clear it up. When I found out I was pregnant I was worried about the acne getting WORSE, especially when the most tried and true product (salicylic acid) was a big NO NO. This is the ONLY Acne face wash that I have seen specially made for pregnant women and it uses Latic Acid. I actually regularly would pay a lot for a Lactic Acid Peel at Elizabeth Arden all the time so I knew it would be great in cleaning out my pores. You can even use this product as a \\&quot;mask\\&quot; and leave it on for 5 minutes for a really powerful treatment.  Its not drying or irritating to my sensitive skin either.  If your pregnant this is a must have.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels luxurious. Reassuring that there are no harmful chemicals. Don&#x27;t know if it is clearing hormonal acne from pregnancy but it&#x27;s certainly not harming :-)</li>
    <li> I used this product twice a day for a month, and I never noticed a difference. It&#x27;s really hard to find an acne product for when you&#x27;re pregnant, much less one that works, so I&#x27;m not too disappointed. It didn&#x27;t make my problem any worse; it just didn&#x27;t make it better, either.</li>
    <li> smells great and really clears up acne during pregnant. product is a little expensive but definitely works on prenatal acne.</li>
    <li> Gentle and effective for me. Didnt dry out my skin. My skin was much better after using this product. But it is a little pricey and hard to find.</li>
    <li> I started using this product 5 years ago when I was pregnant and continue to use it.  It has so far been the only product that cleared up my  pregnancy acne, but also leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean; it removes makeup gently and easily.  I highly recommend this for pregnant and non-pregnant skin.  It is extremely gentle.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get  face wash that would be safe to use during pregnancy and help fight break outs. it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out and has a pleasant smell... but it didn&#x27;t do much for helping to clear up my face. If you are looking for a mild cleanser, then this would probably work well for you.</li>
    <li> My wife use this while she was pregnant and it&#x27;s the only kind of facial wash that she trust. She did a lot of research prior to making the purchase.</li>
    <li> Face wash is good, but the date on the bottle says made in 2002. I hope it is meant to last that long. It does not make soapy suds at all.</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash that is safe for pregnancy.  It smells and works wonders.  Love the Belli line</li>
    <li> It worked \\&quot;OK\\&quot; on my acne but the fact that my eye lashes were burned off forced me to stop use. I tried not to get near my eyes but sometimes when I would the water on my face it would touch them I guess. It got worse and worse the more times I used... very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I  must be allergic to it because I had tiny bumps on my face including inflamed acne after 2 weeks of changing to this product.  My face did not feel clean after washing, and felt greasy all day.  I give it at least an extra star because it&#x27;s safe for use during pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of acne with my pregnancy. This product helped a lot. It smells good too. I won&#x27;t purchase again because my doctor said I could use other products that are much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I was looking to switch all of my facial products to pregnancy safe versions and this product seemed perfect.  The problem with this product is that it just doesn&#x27;t work at clearing acne.  I love the fresh sweet green tea smell of the wash but it won&#x27;t do anything to clear acne.  I even tried leaving this on as a mask and still it did not help with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product for acne.  I do recommend this product as a facial wash.</li>
    <li> I suffer from adult hormonal acne. I have an arsenal of expensive face washes, prescription creams, electric scrub brushes, toners - you name it. As anyone with hormonal acne knows - there is no cure, all you can do is clean the heck out of your face and hope for the best.  After we found out I was pregnant, my partner read up all the labels on my face care products and threw them ALL out, as 99% of them had risky ingredients.  I furiously searched for something to clean my face with and came across BELLI.    I have to say this product cleaned my face - leaving no residue - better than my prescription face wash.  My partner even switched from his $45 dollar face wash to this product, he has adult acne as well.  We are on our 3rd bottle of it - I think it has found a permanent place in our household, pregnant or not.    For women expecting it to take care of their pregnant hormonal acne - sorry, there is no miracle cure - but you CAN reduce it as much as possible with facials every 6 weeks, exfoliating and using a daily face wash that thoroughly cleans, like BELLI does.    BELLI is gentle and leaves my face squeaky clean. Compared to what I spent on my other face wash products, BELLI is a bargain!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash- too bad I just now discovered it! I am pregnant with my 2nd child. My skin is never perfect, especially when I am pregnant. But this is the best its been in a very long time. So this face wash is either a miracle or my skin has decided after all these years to be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this wash!</li>
    <li> In my first month of pregnancy my face started breaking out pretty bad.  I was using L&#x27;oreal Go 360 Clean and that was helping some.  Then I read that I should not use salicyclic acid while pregnant.  After some research I bought the Belli Acne Cleanser because it is safe for pregnant women. After using it for the first time I could tell a difference.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and my face is smooth again.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> the smell is good but I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet. I have pregnancy acne so I don&#x27;t know how much is to do with washing my face and really how much is to do with hormones so I can&#x27;t give this a good or bad rating. It makes my skin feel fine after I use it, not too dry and like it has been washed clean. I use it in the morning and at night and it does a decent job at getting make up off.</li>
    <li> This soap is very gentle and does the work without drying out your skin. I first saw this product advertised in a magazine and decided to try it out. I am not pregnant, nor trying to get pregnant, but I am very hormonal ;). I have tried numerous acne products and have found just very few that actually do what they say their gonna do....this is one of them. The only negative......the price!</li>
    <li> As soon as I got pregnant I got the same hormonal acne I had as a teen! I freaked out about using too many chemicals on my face so I bought this. This worked just didn&#x27;t clear everything.  It cleared about 50% of my acne but I was happy enough with that. No other product worked as well and was safe for baby.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t use it alone...I also use it along with the Belli Pre Treatment Scrub and the Belli Acne Control Spot Treatment. I use the scrub first, then the facial wash, then the spot treatment. The scrub instructions said to use it 2-3 times per week but I use it every day, along with the other two products. I&#x27;ve had amazing results since starting the system only six days ago. I started getting breakouts several years ago, and I tried many over the counter facial meds, and some worked for a while then stopped working. So I went to the doctor and I tried several prescriptions. The only one that worked was a low dose of anti-biotics. But I didn&#x27;t want to be on anti-biotics long term because of the major side effects so I tried other prescription meds that believe it or not, didn&#x27;t work and actually made my acne worse. So I did some research and found Belli and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m not pregnant but I love that I can continue to use it when my husband and I decide to have kids. My face has cleared up in 6 days and my complexion is much much MUCH better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not pregnant and never have been, but thought I&#x27;d give this a try since my breakouts seem to revolve around my menstrual cycles. It smells great, is gentle on the skin and seems to work well so far.</li>
    <li> Used all through pregnancy and worked like a charm when nothing else would. Definitely worth the price. Will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product during my pregnancy because I wanted peace of mind that I wasn&#x27;t using ingredients that would be harmful to my baby. However after using this product for 2-3 weeks my face broke out worse than before I started using this product so I quit using it. It over-dried my face and left my skin flaking even though I only used it once a day and also used a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used to have acne in junior and high school, but 10 years after graduation I didn&#x27;t think it would come back just because I got pregnant. I sure was WRONG! My acne first trimester was so horrible even my husband couldn&#x27;t deny it any longer. I wish I could say that this was a miracle product and it cleared up my acne completely and immediately, but the truth is that is took a few weeks and it cleared about 50% in the first couple of weeks. But after months of NOTHING working I was very pleased! I&#x27;ve bought another bottle after my first one ran out and even though my skin is better. It is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin in any way whatsoever.  Plus--it&#x27;s the only safe acne wash I&#x27;ve found that actually has acne fighting ingredients (7% lactic acid). Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> What a great product.  I use this even while not pregnant.  I put a little on blemishes and just leave it.  Blemish gone in a day or two.  Purchased twice already.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and is safe for my babies but other than that this product was worthless.  The hormones from being pregnant with twins have caused serious breakouts and this product didn&#x27;t even touch the problem.  In fact the acne started to get worse when I was using it.  I really thought this would be a good solution but unfortunately it did nothing to treat my acne.</li>
    <li> I am ticked I spent so much on this.  It&#x27;s just as bad as the conventional products out there.  Read the ingredients list carefully and check the Environmental Working Group website for hazardous ingredients.  I tossed most of the tube in favor of ACTUALLY natural products.  Also, I did not like the consistency.  It is a thick gel that does not seem to penetrate the skin.  It did nothing to clear the few blemishes that I had.</li>
    <li> When I stopped taking birth control pills my skin started breaking out from hormones... I started using Dermologica and everything cleared up.  A year later I got pregnant and with the hormones came break outs and cystic pimples on my chin I could no longer use my Dermologica face wash since it has salylic acid in it so I bought the Belli acne face wash, I was not crazy about the scent and also my pimples got worse I know that the makers of Belli say the skin purges and sometimes needs to get worse before it gets better but this went on for 4 weeks and was not getting any better and new pimples were coming up.  I switched to Basis face wash which is dermotologist approved and can find in any store and is about $7.00 within a week my skin started getting better and now at 9 weeks pregnant is almost all clear and have been using it for 2 weeks.      This product is a great idea but doesnt work at all</li>
    <li> I had all the hopes that this was the miracle wash to clear up my bad acne but sadly it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Right after I found out I was pregnant, I broke out really bad all over my face. It was more like a rash and it kind of itched. Having never had acne problems growing up, this was new to me and very hard to cope with. It seemed every other pregnant woman had this beautiful pregnancy glow, and I was stuck with a completely different type of \\&quot;glow\\&quot;. I was just going to wait it out and start some Proactiv or something after I was done breast feeding, but then someone recommended the Belli Acne Facial Wash, so I gave it a shot. My face cleared up within a week, I swear. I highly recommend this product. It really works. I think I&#x27;ll continue it even after I&#x27;m done breast feeding, since it works so well and it doesn&#x27;t have the crazy chemicals that Proactiv has.</li>
    <li> Great product. Cleans well and has maintained my face breakout free. Does not irritate my face, it is very mild.</li>
    <li> Since I have been pregnant, I&#x27;ve had stubborn breakouts on my chin since the day I found out I was pregnant.  Nothing really was helping them go away.  I had this product recommended to me by a fellow pregnant woman having the same issue.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for a month and I&#x27;m happy to say I have not had ANY breakouts since using this product.  Way to make a mom-to-be feel good...when nothing seems to fit of feel right!!</li>
    <li> I bought this due to experiencing acne while pregnant...something I hadn&#x27;t had an issue with previous to pregnancy. I like the smell of this product, that it was safe for me and baby, that it seemed to clean OK, and wash away well leaving skin feeling nice and soft for a few hours before getting oily again. I don&#x27;t like that it wouldn&#x27;t clean my make-up off which meant that I had to use a different product first. Also, if the first product I used was oily or left a residue on my hands/face, Belli wouldn&#x27;t foam and I would waste more of the product than was used trying to get it to clean and foam, which made me frustrated with the cost of the product. Furthermore, I used it twice a day but can&#x27;t say with certainty that it actually helped my acne problem. I bought Bella B Foaming Face Wash and have used it for 5 days. I like it a lot so far and haven&#x27;t had any new acne surface since using it. It leaves the skin a little dryer but it also feel cleaner and removes my makeup completely.</li>
    <li> This face wash is great! It smells wonderful. While pregnant most smells make me sick. This one smelled amazing. I like how it make my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled off and on with acne since I was a teenager.  My face was doing quite well before I got pregnant (second pregnancy), but I broke out once the hormones in the first trimester went bananas.  I&#x27;ve used many different acne treatments, but I wanted something that was safe for the pregnancy.  I LOVE this product.  I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t overdry, and I don&#x27;t have to use anything at all but this morning and night.  Sometimes I keep it on for the 5 minute mask, which is a great option.  I also use a mild scrubbing pad at night with the face wash to help with exfoliation (which helps with breakouts and scars).  I love how soft my skin feels, and the product seems to help with redness.  I love this product so much I will probably keep using it even after I am no longer pregnant!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne ironically, since the beginning of my 20s. I finally went to a dermetologist and was put on RX facial wash. My face was clear for the first time since my teens! Then we decided to start trying for a baby. I came off of the RX as they are not safe while pregnant and my acne returned. After I got pregnant, my acne became worse. I tried just washing with regular facial soap with no change. I read about this product in my OB office and decided to give it a try as it is the only one that I have found to be safe for pregnant women. I tried it and it made my acne worse. I thought that maybe it would get worse before it got better and went through 2 tubes. It just continued to get worse so I quit buying it and went back to washing with regular facial soap.  This product did not work for me, but it may for you. It seems like based on the other reviews that I have seen that women who had already had problems with acne before pregnancy seem to have a less favorable reaction to this product. So if you had clear skin before pregnancy, you may want to try it.</li>
    <li> I have used over ten different skin care regimens to try to manage my adult cystic acne.  I only started using this one when we began trying to get pregnant, and it is the best face wash, hands down, I have ever used.  I know that not every face wash works for every person, but this one did it for me, when products like Proactiv, Mary Kay, Arbonne, Avon, Neutrogena, Aveeno, Clean and Clear and others didn&#x27;t!  I will continue to use it beyond pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my pimply pregnancy skin and is still helpful in my postpartum days.  The bottle lasts for quite a while.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I first heard of this product on BabyCenter. I am in my second trimester and have experience acne since my teens.I&#x27;ve tried everything since then; every Dr. prescription, Proactiv, Clinique, and many over the counter products. I thought when I started breaking out constantly during my pregnancy there wouldn&#x27;t be anything that could help. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to do miracles, but at least to help. I have to admit it has done that and more. Within a week my current pimples were gone and haven&#x27;t had any crazy breakouts since before starting this product(I still get maybe one or two pimples but that&#x27;s better than I had before). I know everyone&#x27;s face and hormones are different but if you are frustrated with your acne during your pregnancy I could suggest at least giving this a try!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after getting some pesky acne a couple weeks after discovering I was pregnant. My skin became extremely greasy and my acne worse almost immediately. I tried to stick it out for a while to see if my skin was just adjusting, but no such luck. My final straw was when I woke up with three large, painful cysts on my chin. It felt like the worse acne of my life and I was miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my regular cleanser (Cetaphil) and noticed an improvement within days. My skin is less greasy and the cysts are healing and I&#x27;m not getting new breakouts anymore. My skin is still far from perfect but at least not he horrendous mess that it was when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying this will everyone&#x27;s experience. Maybe I am allergic to one or more of the ingredients. Regardless, I am disappointed to have spent $20 for a face full of zits.</li>
    <li> With this pregnancy, my OBGYN told me not to use any products with Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid.  My acne has been so terrible and I was desperate to find a way to fix it.  A variety of mild, natural face washes and moisturizers were not doing the trick, so after some internet research, I came across Belli products.  I received my shipment in the mail on Thursday and today it is Sunday, and my skin is already 50% better. No new breakouts and the old ones are healing.  I use this twice a day--once in the morning and once at night, and it has made a huge difference.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry and irritated like many other acne solutions have.  I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone (pregnant or not) looking to heal their acne without the use of heavy chemicals.</li>
    <li> In my 20&#x27;s I started getting cystic acne and breaking out horribly. The only thing that worked to clear it up was antibiotics. The first time I was pregnant my skin was ridiculous. I didn&#x27;t use anything because I was afraid of the ingredients. It took about 4 months after giving birth for my face to return to it&#x27;s normal, but still acne ridden apperance. Then I breastfed so my dermatologist said the antibiotics are not a good idea. So my face still had acne, but not as bad as it was when I was pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I became pregnant with my second child I knew I was pregnant because the acne that I was getting was similar to the first time around. This pregnancy I didn&#x27;t want my already broken out face to turn into a worse mess as it did with my first child. After researching several products I found Belli. I read all the reviews and they&#x27;re pretty mixed. Works for some, other hate it. I decided to try it because it might just work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it seems to be working. I have been using this religiously since I received it about 4 days ago. The smell is great it&#x27;s lemon scented, but not overpowering. Some people say it burns their skin. It hasn&#x27;t burned mine, but my skin is not that sensitve to new products. My skin only burned when I was using Proactiv face wash. It does dry my skin out a little bit after I wash, but once I put on lotion it&#x27;s fine. Another reviewer said it made their skin worse before it got better, but mine seems to be clearing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to update this review in about two weeks. I took a picture of what my face looked like before and in 2 weeks I&#x27;ll post an after shot. I want to see if this product actually works. I&#x27;ll post the before and after shot so that you&#x27;ll all see if it does make a difference. Also, before I buy another bottle I want to make sure it works. It is pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> The consistency is thick and creamy (clear gel). It has a clearly \\&quot;lemon\\&quot; smell so you first-trimester ladies might not mind it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say first that I do not have sensitive skin, I have normal skin that can be dry in winter and oily in summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this face cleanser with a little water in my palm to cause it to suds slightly in my hands before rubbing on. I left it on my face and neck about 45 seconds until it started to feel warm and then I washed it right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting out of the bath, I noticed my cheeks and chin were red, dry, tight and seemed overly cleansed. I applied my hyaluronic acid serum and daily lotion for moisture but noticed some continued tingling/irritation that I&#x27;ve never had before. Basically my skin felt a little stripped and dry. Not good for a product that specifically sells itself as not overly-drying. Won&#x27;t be using it again but I&#x27;d love the fragrance as a bath oil :)</li>
    <li> After becoming pregnant, I have been plagued with acne even worse than the acne I faced when 15 years old.  I was even more frustrated when I found out that there is potential danger to the baby when the mother uses products containing salicylic acid or retinol in them (of course, every face product that works for me contains either or both of these ingredients).  I was very happy to come across this product as it is marketed specifically to be safe for pregnant women.  However, and I didn&#x27;t think it possible, but it made my already horrible acne even worse.  I have been using it for 2 weeks in hopes that it just needed time, but I am giving up on it now that my face is covered with acne.  It has a nice smell and I am happy that there is a company releasing products like this, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  It is still worth a try, and I hope that I am in the minority with this product not working.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this with no effect.  I haven&#x27;t really found anything that has helped me so far during my pregnancy.  I am going to go to the doctor and see what they advise; it&#x27;s much easier I think to get an expert&#x27;s opinion for free than take my own guesses on what works.</li>
    <li> I bought this face wash for use during my pregnancy because it was paraben-free and didn&#x27;t have artificial fragrances, etc. I have oily skin and was worried about breakouts, but I had no pregnancy acne at all and I give credit to this product. I used it at night and in the morning.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I was dealing with pregnancy related acne. Prior to pregnancy, I never had great skin, but I had it pretty much under control with the right mix of face washes, toners, etc. Due to my doctors advice of staying away from salicylic acid, I had to find some new products. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now in conjunction with the belli spot treatment. Overall, I&#x27;d say that it might slightly work. I&#x27;m still breaking out a lot, but probably not as bad as previously. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll repurchase once I run out. It&#x27;s a bit pricey and I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s helping more than a drugstore brand would.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple acne products over the years and this is by far the best I have tried!  I was looking for something safe during pregnancy and will now use this for the rest of my life.  Thank you to whoever invented it...!</li>
    <li> Great if you looking for a safe, natural alternative. A small dime sized portion is allss that is needed to cleanse the entire face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product until I realized it contained Phenoxyethanol. Many companies use this as an alternative to parabens. It is a cheap preservative that is just as harmful as parabens. I was hugely disapointed when I learned Belli uses this in some of their products. I will finish the bottle of this cleanser but will not be re-purchasing. I spent over $100 on Belli products to revamp my skincare regimen now that I am pregnant but I guess I should have done better research on the ingredients before purchasing. I just trusted when they said it was safe.</li>
    <li> WELL, I HAVE TO USE A LOT TO DO ONE FACE WASH SINCE THE TEXTURE OF IT WAS VERY THIN. AND IT NEEDS ME TO SPEND MORE TIME ON THE WASHING COMPARE WITH USING OTHER PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after I found out I was pregnant and my face turned into a teenager&#x27;s worst nightmare! This did nothing for my adult pregnancy acne. I ended up resorting back to a natural product I had used previously. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love the Belli product line. I have used the Belli Pre-Treatment Scrub and Spot treatment throughout my whole pregnancy to control cystic acne and have been pretty much breakout free with those items. However, I initially purchased this face wash and while it may work great for mild pregnancy acne I did not have much luck with it. My advise is that if you suffer from severe acne is to skip this face wash and just use the Belli Pre-Treatment Scrub and Spot treatment.</li>
    <li> I have acne even not pregnant so I was skeptical about just using a product to clear my face. However, this product works great!!</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRIED A DOZEN FACEWASHES, INCLUDING PRESCRIPTIONS, SO FAR THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT HELPS CALM MY ACNE DOWN AND DRIES IT OUT WITHOUT DRYING MY SKIN. CAN ALSO BE USED AS A MASK, THAT HELPS ALOT TOO.</li>
    <li> I liked that this product did not contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide (both are not recommended during pregnancy), yet managed to clear up most of my acne. I was not expecting a miracle, nor did I achieve one, but it definitely made a difference. I like the smell and it did not dry out my face or make it oilier than it already was. I noticed a reduction in breakouts on my face after using this product. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you look at the ingredients,Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate is listed. This is a toxic chemical used to preserve cosmetics. Whether or not the amount is minimal. I would not want to jeopardize my unborn child&#x27;s health! To use an ingredient such as this in something that&#x27;s geared towards pregnant woman is despicable. Look it up.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I had to for this product.Cleared up my skin within two days. I would recommend to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> In my third trimester of pregnancy I started breaking out horribly because of all the hormones. I started to look for a face wash that was safe to use during pregnancy and came across this product on Amazon. Within a couple days of use I started to notice that my face was starting to clear up. My skin is also very sensitive and tends to dry very easily. The face wash was mild enough to not cause any damage to my skin or make it overly dry.</li>
    <li> I have normal skin--not overly sensitive-- and this product made me break out. I used it for 2 days and the entire lower half of my face (cheeks and chin) are red, itchy and full of bumps. I ordered directly from the company and they are refunding my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want to try this, I suggest buying from a place where you can return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the product smells very good.</li>
    <li> I got this product while I was pregnant in my first trimester because my once beautiful skin was exploding due to pregnancy Hormones running rampant in my body!  I was desperate for a cure!  This product did not seem to make a difference in my acne breakouts, made my skin feel dry and tight and is a little overpriced I thought. I would not buy this product again and am still looking for other acne alternatives to use during pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I will say, that it is a good idea, and it would be nice if other Companies used lactic acid vs saycyclic  (sp?) acid in their acne products.</li>
    <li> I think it may be working or at least helping. Or it may just be that my pregnancy hormones are finally starting to even out.</li>
    <li> i personally like BELLI very much, which i think is quite safe for women who have baby and i also like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0012XQ2FG Belli Skin Care Acne Clearing Facial Wash 6.7 oz.]]  I have had acne since I was a teen and nothing has worked better.  My acne cleared up with in two weeks with out the harsh side effects of many other acne products.  My skin looks radiant and clear.  I&#x27;m hooked.  Thanks Belli!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this to use during my pregnancy.  It may not clear up every breakout I have, but it certainly is the best alternative I&#x27;ve found during pregnancy, since I can&#x27;t use other products (salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, etc.).  If you are hesitant, I say it&#x27;s worth getting and trying.  There aren&#x27;t a lot of options out there, and this is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I am not pregnant but I needed a face wash that was gentle and for acne.  So far after a week of use I have only one new \\&quot;bump\\&quot;.  The existing acne does not look as angry as it did before using.  It smells nice and is very good at removing make up.&lt;br /&gt;I will add more as I use it longer.</li>
    <li> Broke out really bad in the first month of my pregnancy-everyday a new painful Mt. Vesuvius found a place on my lower half of my face! Found this and after 1-2 days, they all cleared up! Smells like lemons and goes on really well with Clarisonic. I will continue to use after baby is born. Wonderful find-especially with the limited facial cleanser options during pregnancy!</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing to help my skin while pregnant, and I think it actually made it WORSE. I&#x27;m going to end up wasting most of the bottle, very disappointing. I also thought it smelled pretty bad.</li>
    <li> Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Feels like your skin is cleansed after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Big size tube.&lt;br /&gt;I try not to get it near my eyes cause it dries thin skin areas there.&lt;br /&gt;It did tends to dry my skin during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;I normally have oily combination skin so I just cut down my use of it to a few days a week.  I used soap with more moisture in between.&lt;br /&gt;Overall  I liked this product and will buy it again.  Maybe even when I am not pregnant.</li>
    <li> Decided to give this stuff a try, thought it&#x27;d work well looking at the quality and price but really was not impressed..</li>
    <li> Love this  product.  Not pregnant anymore but still use it! It makes my skin feel clean.  It&#x27;s a must buy</li>
    <li> i did not notice a difference with my face while using this product.  i still got pregnancy mask around the tip of my nose and cheeks.  i also broke out with acne a lot more.  overall this product did not work for me. for the dark spots i started to use Porcelana, a day and night cream that worked a lot better.  i am still dealing with the acne but I&#x27;ve been using Origins face wash and its made a difference. I will not purchase Belli again.</li>
    <li> I have never been a person who struggles with acne. Every now and then I will get a pimple, but it was few and far between. I am nearing the end of my first trimester and have been struggling with more blemishes than normal, mostly concentrated on my chin. Of course I have read everything about every product available and have been hesitant to use anything because of the chemicals that should be avoided. I found this and acne control spot treatment and figured it was worth a try. It&#x27;s been 2 days and the product is absolutely amazing. The few spots that I was having issues with have virtually disappeared. I have not had any issues with drying like the product warns about, but if you have sensitive skin, I would use it sparingly. I highly recommend the product for any woman struggling with blemishes, pregnant or not.</li>
    <li> This face wash wasn&#x27;t really what I expected. It didn&#x27;t lather up well at all. It just felt like I was putting water on my face. Smelled like lemons which was ok, but not great. I only used it for a couple weeks, so not sure if it really helped or not. I wouldn&#x27;t spend as much as I did on a product like this.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use while I was pregnant because my acne was out of control. After using it for 6 weeks I  did not notice a single change in my skin. Also, it is very thin and loose.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be okay at first, but after about one month my skin looks worse then it has in the last decade!  I still give it 3 stars since it seems that I PERSONALLY just need the prescription strength treatments.  I got in to see a dermatologist after I started breaking out so badly.  He gave me a prescription for clindamyicin to use during pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have pretty good skin, I think this will work fine for you.  Especially if you just use OTC stuff like salicylic acid.  I actually like the cleanser, and I will keep using this bottle WITH my stronger Rx meds.</li>
    <li> This product may not work for everyone, but it worked WONDERS for me. I went through a major hormone surge at the beginning of my second trimester.  My face broke out like never before...forget about pregnancy glow! I tried using Cetaphil, which normally works great for me (per my dermatologist), but not this time. I bought this product with the expectation that it might not work. Needless to say, I am SO happy I bought this in conjunction with the blemish treatment.  It smells awesome (my favorite scent of any facial cleanser).  I followed the instructions on the label that indicate you can use it as a 5 minute mask, which I think really made a difference.  I literally noticed a change in my skin within a day. I encourage you to try this along with the blemish treatment.</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly amazing. I have very very sensitive skin. And being pregnant, it&#x27;s even more sensitive. But with this product, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and my face always feels so smooth after I use it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a good choice for pregnancy. Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a cure all but face is no worse and maybe a little better. Not a lot combats pregnancy skin anyway! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I been having massive breakouts during my trimester and I came across Belli skincare. I normally used the traditional acne remedies like salicylic, benzoyl peroxide, gylcolic acid but this uses lactic acid so it&#x27;s safe for pregnancy. Of course it doesn&#x27;t have the same type of results but it&#x27;s a good alternative to what I use. The cleanser is like a gel but doesn&#x27;t lather up much. The cleanser is a bit drying on my skin so I use it either other day. I have combination skin with pregnancy breakout.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I&#x27;m pregnant and suffering from pregnancy acne used this product and on the 2nd day can see a difference. Very impressed</li>
    <li> I broke out from using this, but I have really sensitive skin. I have rosacea and typically use oil free, fragrance free acne wash.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells, and my face feels clean after using it, and doesn&#x27;t dry me out too much.  I have combo skin, and it is most likey because I am pregnant, but my skin is very dry, so I have to put lotion on after using.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t foam up all that well, so it takes a little more product to clean off mascara or makeup.  Other than that my breakouts have stopped, which I am very pleased with.</li>
    <li> I bought this face wash since I have always had hormonal acne.  Now that I am pregnant it has been quite difficult to find a wash that doesn&#x27;t have harmful ingredients for my baby.  I gave belly a try but honestly I didn&#x27;t see significant improvement.  So I stopped using it.  I now alternate a scrub with a sensitive skin wash (using my clarisonic) and that has given me better results.</li>
