    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it is the only lotion that sinks into your skin without leaving a layer of grease.  So upset when can&#x27;t find it in stores or costco anymore.  It is hypoallergenic and makes your skin look healthy and with a shine.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it!  Amazon has better price than in stores (when I can FIND it!).  Have been using it for years and wouldn&#x27;t change.</li>
    <li> Searched MANY stores and could not find \\&quot;Original.\\&quot; I cannot use the others, do not like the others.  I am allergic to everything and this is the best product for absorbing in dry skin. It was shipped immediately and i had it in several days.  I highy recommend it![[ASIN:B00006RH5C Keri Original Dry Skin Lotion, Soothing Dry Skin Formula, Packaging May Vary, 20 oz (567 g)]]</li>
    <li> Used Keri lotion for decades. Our local stores in our county don&#x27;t carry it anymore so we&#x27;ve had to go online to purchase it. Amazon service as always was as promised.</li>
    <li> I could not find any local store that had the same price for the 20-ounce, plus you get twice as much!</li>
    <li> This is becoming harder and harder to find in the stores.  I have used this lotion for 30 years and I hope they never stop making it.  There is no other lotion out there like it.</li>
    <li> I have used Keri lotion for over 30 years and was saddened when it was pulled from the shelves of my local shopping places.  I was pleased to find it on line and will continue to be a customer.</li>

    <li> I have used this \\&quot;original\\&quot; Keri for many years.  I prefer it to all the other Keri&#x27;s preferring this thicker texture to the thinner textures.  I use it after every shower and it keeps my skin looking smooth and moist covering my dryness (scaliness).  It covers scaliness on elbows, feet as well as hands.  It was recommended years ago by a doctor for use on very dry skin and I have continued to use it for over 25 years.  I have tried others but always come back to Keri Original.
