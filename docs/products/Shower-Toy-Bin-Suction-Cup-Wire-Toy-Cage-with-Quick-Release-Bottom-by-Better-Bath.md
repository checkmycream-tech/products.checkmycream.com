### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Looked perfect for holding my kids toys:</li>
      <li>Best bath tub toy holder yet!</li>
      <li>I think this product is great!</li>
      <li>very happy, got the product in about 4-5 days and does wonders organizing my 4 yr.</li>
      <li>Suction cups aren&#x27;t that great</li>
      <li>The price is great</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great concept and still wish I could&#x27;ve made it work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great idea in theory-it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything better and still using it after 4 years!!</li>
      <li>Everything dries our really nicely!</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t perfect but it&#x27;s close and certainly the best storage for bath toys that I&#x27;ve been able to find!  </li>
      <li>Falls apart very easily!</li>
      <li>good idea in theory</li>
      <li>Even though it is cheaper Han most!</li>
      <li>For the love of Pete, do yourself a favor and do not get this product!  </li>
      <li>I do have to say their customer service was amazing though.</li>
      <li>They can&#x27;t even hold up their own weight,</li>
      <li>It really is the best thing I&#x27;ve found to hold all our bath toys.  </li>
      <li>We love it and have had it for many years!</li>
      <li>Very cheap will not stay together let alone on the wall</li>
      <li>Got home &amp; tried that...got it up in about 10 more minutes.</li>
      <li>The suction cups did not want to stick to my nice, smooth tile.  </li>
      <li>I would say definately better than the mesh bags and plastic frogs that get moldy, and better than the floor-to-ceiling pressure pole with shelves.</li>
      <li>I love that you can drop all the toys in at once.</li>
      <li>It also comes with some sort of smooth sticker things to put on the wall, to place the suction cups on, for those that may not have a real smooth tile/surface in their shower.</li>
      <li>but in my opinion could use more then suction cups to hold it up and together.</li>
      <li>We bought this toy bin for our tile shower, and it doesn&#x27;t stick to the wall worth anything!!  </li>
      <li>Also, my two-year-old son just pulled it off the wall when we let him look at it-and he was able to do that easily.</li>
      <li>It has a been a perfect solution for my daughter&#x27;s wet bath toys!</li>
      <li>Easy to install and holds quite a bit.  </li>
      <li>But it was a great toy holder and helped drain the water off the toys and easy for my toddler to open.</li>
      <li>The things is huge, and takes up a ton of space along the wall.  </li>
      <li>and it stuck on smooth tile.  </li>
      <li>And I cleaned the wall, and then dried it so the suction cups would work their best.  </li>
      <li>The pieces were all buckled so it would barely fit together</li>
      <li>I could not get this to fit together and stay together at all.</li>
      <li>I was excited to recieve this basket.....</li>
      <li>I ignored the other reviewers and thought this would be a great way to hold my child&#x27;s bath toys.  </li>
      <li>This product will stop stay hanging without the use of super glue.</li>
      <li>My husband and I are both pretty technologically advanced.</li>
      <li>I received my toy bin in the mail pretty quickly...was very excited because it looked very neat.  </li>
      <li>We designed and build our own wooden fence in our backyard by ourselves, etc.</li>
      <li>Thought it would be good because its bigger than most tub toy storage and thought it would be sturdy enough... Not one bit.</li>
      <li>would not work in my shower, couldn&#x27;t get it to line up right with the pattern of my shower surround.</li>
      <li>We got it to stick pretty good, but the trap door on the bottom would not stay closed.</li>
      <li>I love how the toys dry out quickly.</li>
      <li>As for it sticking to the wall...it did fall the first time I stuck it to the wall</li>
      <li>and if you open the bottom latch to let the toys fall out, the top three peices move and come apart.</li>
      <li>Well, first off the box looked like it was from the 80&#x27;s, then the suction cups looked used.  </li>
      <li>If I did get it to stay together, the latch wouldn&#x27;t hold any more weight than a single rubber ducky bath toy...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay together very well either</li>
      <li>Very dissappointed.</li>
      <li>I really really want it to work (</li>
      <li>The suction cups do not stick very well either.</li>
      <li>Easy fix was to clamp the connection points so it does not fall apart as easy but for children its hard to keep it in one piece.</li>
      <li>which is the only reason I spent more $$ buying the command strips to stick it to the wall and over an hour getting it to stay there!)  </li>
      <li>Following the instructions given (with a little help from the picture) wasn&#x27;t perfectly simple, but once accomplished it has held on beautifully.</li>
      <li>It is a lousy product that is best left on the shelves of the warehouse.</li>
      <li>i thought this would keep my son&#x27;s toys dry and clean without getting moldy.  </li>
      <li>Seriously, the picture makes this look like such an awesome solution to the soggy wet toys in my bath tub.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s only HALF full!!  </li>
      <li>In the first place the &amp;#34;parts won&#x27;t stay together and then even if by some miracle they do stay together for a short time</li>
      <li>open to air dry; hangs on the wall; easy release catch.</li>
      <li>The bath toys also have to be rather large, because there are big gaps in the bin sides.  </li>
      <li>It has started to rust a little where the plastic coating has come away, but after all this time it has absolutely been worth the value.</li>
      <li>Has been up for 6 weeks now with no trouble.  </li>
      <li>I would hav paid a few more $ for something that actually worked.</li>
      <li>I got it for her first Christmas last year since I knew she would be getting several bath toys as gifts.  </li>
      <li>I give it a high rating because (1) it is LARGE (a little larger than a gallon of milk) and will hold some weight - like 20 superheros, a half dozen cars, a plastic boat, and 6 diving sticks; (2) the trap door at the bottom was entertaining to the last; (3) the suction cups actually stick to an uneven tub wall; and (4) you can wash and rinse the whole lot with hot, soapy water without removing it from the tub.</li>
      <li>i threw it away &amp; bought a new different type of toy bin from babies r us.  </li>
      <li>The next day I purchased some double sided brackets (that were as much as what I paid for the bin!!)at the hardware store.</li>
      <li>I tried the whole thing again the next day, but they did the same thing.  </li>
      <li>then the whole thing would fall apart again when the latch let loose.</li>
      <li>I just have to clean the suction cups and wall with alcohol and stick it back up for another few months.  </li>
      <li>i was hoping for three secure sides with a working door at least.</li>
      <li>About 5 minutes later we heard a loud bang...guess what it fell.  </li>
      <li>I guess its back to the old fashioned mesh bag for us.</li>
      <li>At first I had trouble figuring out how to put it together</li>
      <li>Good idea bad execution.  </li>

<li> Good idea bad execution.  </li>
<li> (they don&#x27;t stay &#x27;stuck&#x27; on for long) and the whole thing falls apart if one little thing (i.e. a suction cup) moves.</li>
<li> The measurements or the pieces are just shy of accurate.</li>
<li> bought this for my sons bathroom and not only wouldn&#x27;t stay on the bathtub wall but wouldn&#x27;t stay closed as well.....</li>
<li> Either the door wouldn&#x27;t open at all or it wouldn&#x27;t stay closed, even when we had all of the parts put together correctly.</li>
<li> The trap door at the bottom falls open with a slight bump, so my daughter couldn&#x27;t fill it before it would open and</li>
<li> Cleaned the tub wall &amp; let it dry.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste money on this one-it didn&#x27;t even make it past the first night in our house.</li>
<li> It falls apart every time I open it, And it is just a mess to try and keep it up without my toddler ripping it off the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
<li> but the trap door doesnt close , and as soon as I put ALL the tiny little toys in it...</li>
<li> The idea is great, but the product itself is horrible.</li>
<li> The basket does not stay closed.</li>
<li> Very flimsy and poorly made.</li>
<li> Choose the height and location carefully.</li>
<li> and, once assembled, the trap door wouldn&#x27;t stay closed ...</li>
<li> Also, the bottom will NOT stay closed, therefore will not keep toys inside.  </li>
<li> If it didn&#x27;t fall down in the middle of the night (scaring the bejesus out of all of us), it would fall down on my daughter during bath-time.  </li>
<li> I agree with other reviewers that you need three hands to install it, but I&#x27;ve had this on my tub wall for 3+ years with my kids leaning, pulling, and hanging on it</li>
<li> It is hard to put all the pieces together in place and stick it all at the same time.  </li>
<li> -you can imagine how frustrating that is for a young child.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it does fall off the wall every few months.  </li>
<li> Little ones will bump their head.</li>

    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick... at all.</li>
    <li> I thought this basket would be the answer to my storage problems.  It was horrible to put together and the suction cups didn&#x27;t stick at all, even with the \\&quot;smooth surface\\&quot; stickers.  I have attached it to the wall with Command stick strips.  It is holding for now, but we will see.  The bath toys also have to be rather large, because there are big gaps in the bin sides.  It doesn&#x27;t stay together very well either, I need to give it a test run with the kids playing with it.  If it falls apart, I am sending it back.  I really really want it to work (which is the only reason I spent more $$ buying the command strips to stick it to the wall and over an hour getting it to stay there!)  The idea is great, but the product itself is horrible.</li>
    <li> I bought this product couldn&#x27;t even get it to stick and was afraid it would knock my child in the head.  Just threw it away waste of money.  DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> It is hard to put all the pieces together in place and stick it all at the same time.  It keeps falling apart.  One person can not do it alone.  And the suction cups don&#x27;t work at all.  I am returning it and getting something else.  I wish I had checked the reviews before ordering this item.</li>
    <li> poor quality. hard to keep attached</li>
    <li> very happy, got the product in about 4-5 days and does wonders organizing my 4 yr. olds toys in the bath tub.</li>
    <li> This product was unusable and I had to send it back. The pieces were all buckled so it would barely fit together and, once assembled, the trap door wouldn&#x27;t stay closed ... so absolutely useless as a toy caddy!</li>
    <li> We bought this toy bin for our tile shower, and it doesn&#x27;t stick to the wall worth anything!!  We have tried everything,  and it seems to be too flimsy to even do it&#x27;s purpose of holding toys!!  We wasted our money and were very disappointed with the product!!</li>
    <li> It is difficult to put together without help &amp; doesn&#x27;t stay suctioned to wall. Would not recomend &amp; very poorly made.</li>
    <li> Not even with extra tape.  Useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything and still can&#x27;t get it to work.  I&#x27;m throwing it away and trying something else.</li>
    <li> No matter what I did I could not get this thing to work properly.  The suction cups did not want to stick to my nice, smooth tile.  When I was finally able to get the silly thing together, the trapdoor didn&#x27;t snap in correctly.  Seriously, don&#x27;t buy this thing.  I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> As everyone else said, this is the worst design ever and it doesn&#x27;t stay up.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
    <li> The price is great but when the item arrived It is only three sides and the bottom. It is difficult to get it together and if you open the bottom latch to let the toys fall out, the top three peices move and come apart. Easy fix was to clamp the connection points so it does not fall apart as easy but for children its hard to keep it in one piece.</li>
    <li> I read others say that this is hard to assemble, but I don&#x27;t know how anyone can think that. You can basically just look at the picture on the box it comes in and figure out how it goes together-in fact, that&#x27;s what I did. Didn&#x27;t even open the instructions. Doesn&#x27;t take any screws/tools, just a little common sense. As for it sticking to the wall...it did fall the first time I stuck it to the wall but, I cleaned all four suction cups with rubbing alcohol and it hasn&#x27;t fallen once, in over a week now.  It also comes with some sort of smooth sticker things to put on the wall, to place the suction cups on, for those that may not have a real smooth tile/surface in their shower. I think this product is great! Won&#x27;t mold, like the nets do and holds TONS of toys. I have 36 foam letters/numbers, and several rubber bath toys in it now and it&#x27;s only HALF full!!  I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> only lasted a week, and it Didn&#x27;t work had to throw it away.  Good idea bad execution.  Very flimsy and poorly made.</li>
    <li> This product will stop stay hanging without the use of super glue. The measurements or the pieces are just shy of accurate. The basket does not stay closed. I would demand my money back. Even though it is cheaper Han most! I would hav paid a few more $ for something that actually worked. I would have given it zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> It worked for about a  year, then some spots started showing rust, so I threw it away. But it was a great toy holder and helped drain the water off the toys and easy for my toddler to open.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible - doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It does not stick to the tile or the stickers that come with it.  Waste of money and my time.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk.  Even with NOTHING in it, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on the wall of the tub.  And I cleaned the wall, and then dried it so the suction cups would work their best.  I bought two of them and mounted them.  And in the middle of the night, they both ejected themselves off of the wall and into the tub -- making a truly horrible racket and waking us all up!  I tried the whole thing again the next day, but they did the same thing.  Remember, this is with NOTHING in them!  They can&#x27;t even hold up their own weight, much less the added weight of toys!  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have put together this product and it is now suctioned to the wall in the bathroom.  At first I had trouble figuring out how to put it together but once I read the directions it works just as it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> For the love of Pete, do yourself a favor and do not get this product!  I ignored the other reviewers and thought this would be a great way to hold my child&#x27;s bath toys.  I figured people just weren&#x27;t installing it correctly.  I got it for her first Christmas last year since I knew she would be getting several bath toys as gifts.  My Christmas gift to MYSELF this year was to throw this thing away and buy something else!  It fell down all the time!  If it didn&#x27;t fall down in the middle of the night (scaring the bejesus out of all of us), it would fall down on my daughter during bath-time.  Save yourself a TON of frustration and get the Skip Hop Tubby Bath Toy Organizer (here on Amazon) instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this item on Amazon to try and organize my son&#x27;s bath toys. My husband and I are both pretty technologically advanced. We designed and build our own wooden fence in our backyard by ourselves, etc. We could not get this thing to work. We got it to stick pretty good, but the trap door on the bottom would not stay closed. We tried re-aligning it MULTIPLE times, but it didn&#x27;t matter. Either the door wouldn&#x27;t open at all or it wouldn&#x27;t stay closed, even when we had all of the parts put together correctly. It&#x27;s a great idea in theory-it just doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste money on this one-it didn&#x27;t even make it past the first night in our house. Also, my two-year-old son just pulled it off the wall when we let him look at it-and he was able to do that easily.</li>
    <li> this is hard to put together and keep together while its being tugged on by a toddler. good idea in theory but in my opinion could use more then suction cups to hold it up and together. its 4 sides hooking together and trusting the cups will stay put. i was hoping for three secure sides with a working door at least.</li>
    <li> Looked perfect for holding my kids toys: open to air dry; hangs on the wall; easy release catch. I could not get this to fit together and stay together at all. Even after putting the suction cups on and trying to assemble it by attaching to the wall, I could not make it work. If I did get it to stay together, the latch wouldn&#x27;t hold any more weight than a single rubber ducky bath toy... then the whole thing would fall apart again when the latch let loose. I&#x27;m returning this item... I guess its back to the old fashioned mesh bag for us.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this thing is getting such bad reviews! We love it and have had it for many years! We don&#x27;t have a problem with it sticking or falling apart. I love that you can drop all the toys in at once. Everything dries our really nicely! Best bath tub toy holder yet!</li>
    <li> Following the instructions given (with a little help from the picture) wasn&#x27;t perfectly simple, but once accomplished it has held on beautifully. It has a been a perfect solution for my daughter&#x27;s wet bath toys!</li>
    <li> i hate it!  suction cups don&#x27;t work.  well, it does but once you touch it, it falls off.  ugh!  i thought this would keep my son&#x27;s toys dry and clean without getting moldy.  too bad!</li>
    <li> Does not work. I wanted to return it but realized I misplaced the box. When I found the box it was past the allowable return date.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t perfect but it&#x27;s close and certainly the best storage for bath toys that I&#x27;ve been able to find!  Easy to install and holds quite a bit.  My only complaint is that it does fall off the wall every few months.  I just have to clean the suction cups and wall with alcohol and stick it back up for another few months.  It really is the best thing I&#x27;ve found to hold all our bath toys.  I would recommend putting lighter wait toys in this unit since it is only held up by suction cups, but that seems obvious.  Haven&#x27;t found anything better and still using it after 4 years!!</li>
    <li> I was excited to recieve this basket.....but the trap door doesnt close , and as soon as I put ALL the tiny little toys in it...they frustratingly fell back into the tub. The suction cups do not stick very well either. Poorly made. Very dissappointed.</li>
    <li> It is badly made. Very cheap will not stay together let alone on the wall</li>
    <li> Falls apart very easily! Not practical at all!!!</li>
    <li> Forget that this item can&#x27;t even be assembled properly (it really doesn&#x27;t seem to adhere to principles of physics), in the end, it simply was too heavy, even when not loaded with toys, to stick to the tile.  The things is huge, and takes up a ton of space along the wall.  It is a lousy product that is best left on the shelves of the warehouse.</li>
    <li> I received my toy bin in the mail pretty quickly...was very excited because it looked very neat.  Well, first off the box looked like it was from the 80&#x27;s, then the suction cups looked used.  I put the bin together just like the directions showed. Cleaned the tub wall &amp; let it dry.  The dang trap door kept fall off while I was trying to hang it for one thing so I had to have my husband hold it up while I pressed the suction cups to the wall.  Finally after about 15 minute wrestling with it we got it up and we left the room. About 5 minutes later we heard a loud bang...guess what it fell.  The next day I purchased some double sided brackets (that were as much as what I paid for the bin!!)at the hardware store. Got home &amp; tried that...got it up in about 10 more minutes. Then over nite heard a crash, bang, boom in the bathroom...fell down again!! Got so mad @ it i threw it away &amp; bought a new different type of toy bin from babies r us.  Would not recommend this piece of junk!</li>
    <li> would not work in my shower, couldn&#x27;t get it to line up right with the pattern of my shower surround.</li>
    <li> bought this for my sons bathroom and not only wouldn&#x27;t stay on the bathtub wall but wouldn&#x27;t stay closed as well.....don&#x27;t waste your time or money</li>
    <li> Terrible. Thought it would be good because its bigger than most tub toy storage and thought it would be sturdy enough... Not one bit. It won&#x27;t stay on the wall. Going to buy something different.</li>
    <li> I have had no problem with it falling off the wall.  Put it up and it stuck on smooth tile.  Has been up for 6 weeks now with no trouble.  I love how the toys dry out quickly. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Awful product, wish I had kept the box so I could return it. Waste of money as two adults could not even get it to stay together!</li>
    <li> Duct tape is required to make this product work.&lt;br /&gt;The suction cups slip and then the wall and bottom fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;After I added the duct tape, it stopped falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;Now it falls off the wall in one convenient piece, which made it easier to throw away.</li>
    <li> This thing is garbage- I used it once, it kept falling apart, has been sitting in storage ever since I can&#x27;t even give it away to my friends. Suction cups aren&#x27;t that great (they don&#x27;t stay &#x27;stuck&#x27; on for long) and the whole thing falls apart if one little thing (i.e. a suction cup) moves. The trap door at the bottom falls open with a slight bump, so my daughter couldn&#x27;t fill it before it would open and all the work she just did would fall out the bottom-you can imagine how frustrating that is for a young child.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS! I wanted to throw this product against the wall in sheer frustration.  In the first place the &amp;#34;parts won&#x27;t stay together and then even if by some miracle they do stay together for a short time the suction cups fall off the wall.  HATED IT.</li>
    <li> Would not stay together</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers that you need three hands to install it, but I&#x27;ve had this on my tub wall for 3+ years with my kids leaning, pulling, and hanging on it and it&#x27;s fallen maybe 4 times. I give it a high rating because (1) it is LARGE (a little larger than a gallon of milk) and will hold some weight - like 20 superheros, a half dozen cars, a plastic boat, and 6 diving sticks; (2) the trap door at the bottom was entertaining to the last; (3) the suction cups actually stick to an uneven tub wall; and (4) you can wash and rinse the whole lot with hot, soapy water without removing it from the tub. I would say definately better than the mesh bags and plastic frogs that get moldy, and better than the floor-to-ceiling pressure pole with shelves. It has started to rust a little where the plastic coating has come away, but after all this time it has absolutely been worth the value. ADVICE: Choose the height and location carefully. Little ones will bump their head.</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed in this product.  Will not stay on the wall, even with the enclosed &amp;#34;sticky circles&amp;#34; that are suppose to help keep it on the wall.  Also, the bottom will NOT stay closed, therefore will not keep toys inside.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to make it work.  Unfortunately, I had to just throw it away because my granddaughter would get so upset when trying to put &amp; keep toys in the basket at bath time.  I really hate it that this product failed......it&#x27;s a great concept and still wish I could&#x27;ve made it work.</li>
    <li> Difficult.  Will try to reuse in workshop.  DO NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> The absolute worst bath organizer ever made. I thought I would find a way to make it work, nope! I do have to say their customer service was amazing though.</li>
    <li> Seriously, the picture makes this look like such an awesome solution to the soggy wet toys in my bath tub.  It took me freaking 15 minutes to get the darn thing to STAY together.  It falls apart every time I open it, And it is just a mess to try and keep it up without my toddler ripping it off the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this piece of junk made out of recycled wire hangers -_-.</li>
    <li> Would not stick on the wall and would not close at the bottom. I am disappointed that I chose to spend my money on this and by the time I got around to trying to set it up the box had been thrown away so I couldn&#x27;t return it.</li>
