<li> Moisturizing, but not too heavy.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve got hair that usually looks like something you buy on a stick at halftime ...</li>
<li> This is one of the few things I buy pre-prepared because all my homemade conditioners and farmer&#x27;s market ones just don&#x27;t do it for my thick, unruly hair.</li>
<li> but I think the small amount both in quantity and quality  </li>
<li> and I usually buy vegan products for my hair.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t heavy or oily - it just works!</li>

    <li> Best conditioner I have ever used!!! Easy to order. My hair is in great shape now. I like sll their products.</li>
    <li> this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that manages my hair fly away hair.  Love it.  Wish it came in larger quantity so wouldn&#x27;t have to buy so often.  I buy multiple tubes to avoid that problem.</li>
    <li> I guess I had expected something a little more miraculous for my fine hair, but not so  It is perfectly OK but I think the small amount both in quantity and quality  I got for my dollars would not make me order it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the shampoo and I love them both. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy. Although pricey, you do not need very much conditioner. I am a big fan of Biomega products.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I already had it before and it does actually works! It leaves your hair very manageable &amp; silky.  I would recommend this product specially if karatine treatment has been done to your hair!  Love it! :)</li>
    <li> This is a great line of hair products and does its job.  I have used Suave conditioner prior to this.  Might be a bit pricey for me to swear off the cheaper brands that do the trick, but I do like how it leaves my hair soft and would recommend to anyone considering purchasing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this every time but love the product!</li>
    <li> Good.  Smells nice!  Pricey though!  Leaves hair shiny. Doesn&#x27;t dry hair out.&lt;br /&gt;Not really a smoothing shampoo! Lathers well! Doesn&#x27;t strip hair!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Cheaper than at the salon.  I just had a straightener put in my hair.  I had to use a product that did not have sulfates or gluten.  This was perfect.  I have been using this product for 5 months and I love it!  Awesome product</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended it ,I have  used it for over a year, very satisfied with it.good product. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is a must for detangling.  It leaves my hair really silky and smooth. Sometimes I mix it with a thickening conditioner for fuller, yet sleeker looking hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got hair that usually looks like something you buy on a stick at halftime ...Biomega conditioner really helped, especially this summer, with the humidity being in the 90&#x27;s almost daily. It isn&#x27;t heavy or oily - it just works! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve individually looked up every ingredient in this product, because I am weary of sulfates, parabens, silicones, gluten, and I usually buy vegan products for my hair. I AM NOT 100% VEGAN! I just like the idea that the product is so safe. Do not buy from an unauthorized seller though, go to a salon…worth every penny. I found it for $17 at Una Donna Piu and although I cannot comment on the shampoo, the conditioner used every 3-4 days in-between a diluted vinegar rinse once a week has made my hair AMAZING. I don&#x27;t throw that word around lightly. I am tempted to try the conditioner mist as well just to see if I can skip conditioning my hair as much. I am the all natural kinda girl and I don&#x27;t stand by many products unless it A. works B. is safe for our planet and animals and humans C. isn&#x27;t over $30! I wash my face with honey, brush my teeth with homemade pasta, use african black soap and make my own shampoo. This is one of the few things I buy pre-prepared because all my homemade conditioners and farmer&#x27;s market ones just don&#x27;t do it for my thick, unruly hair. So do yourself a favor…give this line a try and if you don&#x27;t like it go to their website and get 100% of your money back. :)</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever!  Only downside is the small size of the container.  Will buy again, along with the shampoo!  Leaves hair tangle free</li>
    <li> Works great with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s very moisturizing but unlike many conditioners it leaves my hair soft yet very manageable. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair limp like other conditioners.</li>
    <li> goes with the shampoo.........good stuff..silky hair awaits you.....i use wen but occasionally i use this for a change...it is great</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer it provides moisture without leaving it feeling greasy.  I like all of the Biomega product line</li>

    <li> My hair is color treated and very dry/porous.  I noticed no significant difference in moisture or conditioning.  I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
