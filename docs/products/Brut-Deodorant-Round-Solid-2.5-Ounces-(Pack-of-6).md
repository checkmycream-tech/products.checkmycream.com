      <li>tell me I smell good</li>
      <li>you want the most Brut scent in a deodorant and don&#x27;t have a problem with an alcohol-based product, this is the one to get!</li>
      <li>It has a nice tingly feel.</li>
      <li>leaving me with a nice surprise when I opened it.  </li>
      <li>I liked it, but it caused burns to my skin.</li>
      <li>The 6 pack is nice because you won&#x27;t run out for a while.</li>

      <li>in a Brut-ish kind of way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;duff~</li>
      <li>It smells good but its way to strong for skin..</li>
      <li>What an easy way to shop!</li>
      <li>Another plus is the light fougere scent that does not scream &amp;#34;Hey!</li>
      <li>More and more</li>
      <li>The product is the very best deodorant for my son who found our local store no longer carried this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most non aluminum deodorants I&#x27;ve tried do not keep arm pit odor away.  </li>
      <li>Just be sure you get THIS ONE which is the</li>
      <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite deo.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a waxy deodorant, though it works fine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Brut deodorant stick for many, many years</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also reminds me of my Grandfather as it was his favorite as well.  </li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s okay for work, but if you intend to and go out after leaving your office, you might want to re-apply.</li>
      <li>This deodorant&#x27;s number one ingredient is alcohol which I&#x27;m sure helps to keep bacteria from growing and making you stink</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is much better.</li>
      <li>I use this even in winter when I don&#x27;t expect to sweat because it smells nice and is a comfortable &#x27;treatment&#x27; before putting a shirt</li>
      <li>It makes it easy to use.</li>
      <li>I appreciate the easy access online.  </li>
      <li>Today scents are so strong and overpowering.</li>
      <li>and then the fragrance they use is not too strong</li>
      <li>My wife loves this scent, so I was glad to be able to find it for such a good price here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>If it works for you, fine; it did not work for me.</li>
      <li>I very happy with it and recommend it to any one looking for a good long lasting deodorant.</li>
      <li>A pack of six is a good deal, in my opinion, cuz then I will have enough for about a year of smell</li>
      <li>A true manly scent.</li>
      <li>If I neglected to do that, there is a good chance that some of them would dry out...</li>
      <li>price is exceptional as well as the exact same product!</li>
      <li>a has a fresh soap scent.</li>
      <li>This is the only deodorant that husband likes and we couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores any more so was really excited to find that it was still being made</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s right for everyone</li>
      <li>-only little gel is perfect.</li>
      <li>, make sure it&#x27;s somewhere cool and dry.  </li>
      <li>I always get positive comments like \\&quot;you always smell good\\&quot; and \\&quot;what are you wearing?\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>It has a good smell and last relatively long for deodorant that is not anti-perspirant.</li>
      <li>hard to find in stores around where i live these are great..</li>
      <li>It goes on clear, will not stain your clothes and comes with a strong, masculine scent.</li>
      <li>Usually the fragrance is strong and after awhile you get a strong mix of BO and fragrance.</li>
      <li>I like this deodorant, loved that I could get it in a 6 pack it is hard to find in some of the stores in my area</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>It is the only one that has the Brut fragrance in a package that is comfortable to apply.</li>
      <li>This is the original version of the deodorant we all grew up with, not the newer more powdery smelling stuff, with the classic round stick!</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s become increasingly difficult to find on a consistent basis at local stores, I just buy a good supply and have Amazon deliver it for free with my Prime account.</li>
      <li>The round stick has a great Brut scent and slightly wet cooling effect of alcohol.  </li>
      <li>The stick does not have a screw-type device typical of most deodorant dispensers.  </li>

      <li>my favorite, so hard to find now</li>
      <li>The twist-out version does not have anywhere near the amount of scent nor does it have alcohol as an ingredient.  </li>
      <li>and I am 70 years old and have been using Brut since the sixty&#x27;s</li>
      <li>when the tube I am currently using gets way down to the nebber-uttins, I throw away the top and put the tube on a shelf, somewhere...to use as an air freshener until it FINALLY dries out.  </li>
      <li>it comes in a cool little container.</li>
      <li>I have used the straight Brut deodorant for a LONG time now.  </li>
      <li>Instead, try the wide stick version with modern packaging that&#x27;s practical to use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A true manly scent. Not the smells of today. Today scents are so strong and overpowering. This scent goes back to a simpler time.</li>
    <li> Good product and product came just as they said it would. Bought this before and will again. It works well.</li>
    <li> This deodorant&#x27;s number one ingredient is alcohol which I&#x27;m sure helps to keep bacteria from growing and making you stink but it also burns when you put it on. It does provide a cooling effect like another reviewer said but while doing so feels like your armpits are being scraped by a cheese grater and then lit on fire. I&#x27;ll give it 2 stars because aside from the alcohol it does smell nice and it comes in a cool little container.</li>
    <li> The only one I will use.  No aluminum clorhidrate.  Works as it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> The only deod I like.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat classic Brut.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years and will continue to use. It&#x27;s a deodorant and not and antiperspirant which I prefer.</li>
    <li> This is the best underarm deodorant ever made!!!! Just be sure you get THIS ONE which is the ***COOLING*** stick and not the rectangular which is not cooling. I&#x27;ve been using this now for over 25 years. AMAZING!</li>
    <li> hard to find in stores around where i live these are great..</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY MULTI-PACKS! By the time you use the first, the rest will be all dried up!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that husband likes and we couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores any more so was really excited to find that it was still being made</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Brut for over 30 years. I like the small tube. It makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> Used this for lot of years, work construction and it works well, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, had trouble finding in local stores,</li>
    <li> Great scent, and works great, too.  Since it is a deodorant, not an anti-persperant, it is not toxic.</li>
    <li> The product is the very best deodorant for my son who found our local store no longer carried this product.&lt;br /&gt;The price is exceptional as well as the exact same product! Perfect for his needs!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite deo. Since it&#x27;s become increasingly difficult to find on a consistent basis at local stores, I just buy a good supply and have Amazon deliver it for free with my Prime account.</li>
    <li> I like the scent, since it&#x27;s not overwhelming but smells classic.

You may find the last couple sticks partially dehydrated when you go to use them.  They&#x27;ll still work, but it looks wierd.</li>
    <li> This product is not easy to find in stores.  I appreciate the easy access online.  It arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Great price and all mine were in good conditon</li>
    <li> Wanted it, got it.  All good!@</li>
    <li> Burned my under arms and I gave it someone else.  Would not buy again</li>
    <li> great for my husband, he loves this brand</li>
    <li> Well, OK...I admit it.  I am a Brut fanboy!  I have been using it since waaay back there in the else-when and I try to keep my supply well ahead of my demand.  Therefore, I shop around on Amazon to see if I can find a good deal.  A pack of six is a good deal, in my opinion, cuz then I will have enough for about a year of smell nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the package arrives, I take out two and wrap the other four in a plastic bag and put it in the freezer.  If I neglected to do that, there is a good chance that some of them would dry out...leaving me with a nice surprise when I opened it.  Huh? Where did it go?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing...when the tube I am currently using gets way down to the nebber-uttins, I throw away the top and put the tube on a shelf, somewhere...to use as an air freshener until it FINALLY dries out.  It might take a week or two but my bathroom smells great...in a Brut-ish kind of way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;duff~</li>
    <li> Having used a number of deodorant in the past, I saw this one was on sale and decided to give it a try. It goes on clear, will not stain your clothes and comes with a strong, masculine scent. Unfortunately, the scent does not last all day like it promises. So it&#x27;s okay for work, but if you intend to and go out after leaving your office, you might want to re-apply.</li>
    <li> I have used the straight Brut deodorant for a LONG time now.  My wife loves this scent, so I was glad to be able to find it for such a good price here on Amazon.  I don&#x27;t like antiperspirants - this deodorant-only little gel is perfect.</li>
    <li> The scent of the deodorant has changed and it is not as good.&lt;br /&gt;Also 2 of the 6 were bad</li>
    <li> Good product, but difficult to apply due to the packaging. The stick does not have a screw-type device typical of most deodorant dispensers. User has to literally push up the product with a finger to use. Not handy or user-friendly at all. Certainly not the vendor&#x27;s fault. Instead, try the wide stick version with modern packaging that&#x27;s practical to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for decades and it has always worked well for me.</li>
    <li> I like the deodorant will by it again soon. It work like it says it does.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks. I have used various different deodorants. Usually the fragrance is strong and after awhile you get a strong mix of BO and fragrance. This stuff is much better. It smells a little like purell at first and then the fragrance they use is not too strong a has a fresh soap scent. I very happy with it and recommend it to any one looking for a good long lasting deodorant. Also I got from Walgreen&#x27;s/Google shopping express and it was only $1.99 for each one. Great price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Brut deodorant stick for many, many years and it&#x27;s the only one I use.  I always get positive comments like \\&quot;you always smell good\\&quot; and \\&quot;what are you wearing?\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s right for everyone but my underarms seem to crave the alcohol content in the stick...it&#x27;s actually a plus for me and not a minus like some of the other comments I read.  It&#x27;s an oldie but goody.</li>
    <li> Good product, but difficult to apply due to the packaging.  The stick does not have a screw-type device typical of most deodorant dispensers.

    <li> Brut stick flat out works for me, even though this is a non aluminum deodorant.  Most non aluminum deodorants I&#x27;ve tried do not keep arm pit odor away.  They&#x27;ll work for a few hours but not all day.  This deodorant works all day for me, and I like the small diameter stick size vs. the wider bar types of deodorants.  Some would call this a travel size.  Another plus is the light fougere scent that does not scream &amp;#34;Hey!, I&#x27;m wearing deodorant&amp;#34;.  None of that here</li>
    <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t have any antiperspirant in it to gunk up your shirt sleeves. The 6 pack is nice because you won&#x27;t run out for a while.</li>
    <li> My father used Old Spice, I use Brut, my sons use a different after shave than I and my grandsons use an after shave different than there fathers I like the smell of Brut and the lady&#x27;s tell me I smell good and I am 70 years old and have been using Brut since the sixty&#x27;s</li>
    <li> The 2.25 OZ bar (bar code 27755 07002) Does contain Triclosan but this 2.5 round one (bar code 27755 07001) sold here does NOT contain the chemical Triclosan.</li>
    <li> It smells good but its way to strong for skin.. It burns underarms like Cologne... Its like wearing vapor rub under the arms 24hrs.. Burns like hell</li>
    <li> Like this small little deodorant. It&#x27;s been about 2 years using it. I still delight every time I feet it under my arm. It has a nice tingly feel. I haven&#x27;t found any other deodorant the has the same feel. I still don&#x27;t take it for granted. I think it is small enough to take on the plane. That is why I started using it.  I think this was a good buy.</li>
    <li> This is the original version of the deodorant we all grew up with, not the newer more powdery smelling stuff, with the classic round stick! Woohoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell like a man. Use this stuff! AND, it&#x27;s at a bargain price compared to CVS and the like!</li>
    <li> An old standby for an older guy.  I like the smell even today and use Brut as my default stick.  I lean towards Drakkar for those date nights but Brut is my go to brand.  More and more I see stores not carrying it any longer so glad to get a good price on the six-pack through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It also reminds me of my Grandfather as it was his favorite as well.  Some things in life need to be embraced and not changed.</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant, loved that I could get it in a 6 pack it is hard to find in some of the stores in my area thanks</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is the only one that has the Brut fragrance in a package that is comfortable to apply. However, the method of dispensing could be improved. It slides down too easily when pressed down and I have to hold it in place with my finger.</li>
    <li> I like this product and use it regularly. It seems to last quite well and recommend it for a daily use. No side effects apparent...however,  I will update on any side effects that may develop.</li>
    <li> I like this because, as of now, it doesn&#x27;t have tetrasodium EDTA in it.  It has a good smell and last relatively long for deodorant that is not anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> I liked it, but it caused burns to my skin. If it works for you, fine; it did not work for me. Yes, I smelled less bad, but I had horrible rash and one big, pus filled sore from it.</li>
    <li> The round stick has a great Brut scent and slightly wet cooling effect of alcohol.  I use this even in winter when I don&#x27;t expect to sweat because it smells nice and is a comfortable &#x27;treatment&#x27; before putting a shirt on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The round stick and the oval twist-out version are two different products.  The twist-out version does not have anywhere near the amount of scent nor does it have alcohol as an ingredient.  It&#x27;s more of a waxy deodorant, though it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the six-packs and they last for a few years in my basement without drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the most Brut scent in a deodorant and don&#x27;t have a problem with an alcohol-based product, this is the one to get!</li>
    <li> this is the only deodorant my husband likes.  What an easy way to shop!</li>
    <li> my favorite, so hard to find now</li>
