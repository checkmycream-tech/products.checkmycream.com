<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this hand lotion, moisturizes very well without being greasy.  The smell however is a very herbally, super strong and very overwhelming. Overall other than the strong smell this lotion is perfect.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is the best! It works very well and I intend to continue using for a long while.</li>
    <li> too oily and smells too strong..</li>
    <li> i use this on my super dry winter hands and new ink. It doesn&#x27;t smell  girly, but clean. Guys are not afraid to use it. It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff, makes his skin shiny and healthy looking.He couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere but on Amazon and is very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years because of the incredible - AMAZING, seriously - ability it has to keep my winter-dry hands smooth and pain free. There&#x27;s no rebound period - meaning, once it wears off, your hands aren&#x27;t worse off then when you started; I believe this actually HEALS your hands. It does go on slightly greasy, but absorbs w/in 5 minutes. I have yet to find another (natural or otherwise) hand cream that does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, the aroma is... out there. It takes quite a bit of getting used to, and even after years of use, I still don&#x27;t love it. I deal with it because it helps my hands so greatly, but I WISH Burt&#x27;s Bees would create an unscented version of this cream. It&#x27;s hard to describe the scent... earthy, slightly nutty (maybe?), herbal? I usually like herbal/natural scents, but this is quite strong, and it LINGERS. So, if you don&#x27;t like strong scents, this isn&#x27;t the cream for you. The fragrance is why this a 4 star review instead of a 5 star. Sorry Burt&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> this is great for all skin applications</li>
    <li> Have your hands ever been so dry, chapped,  and cracked that they burn when you try to moisturize them?  That happens to me frequently, especially in the dry winter months.  I tried this product out of desperation - thinking that I was paying too much.  I tried out a generous amount the first time I used it...then waited for the burn.  It didn&#x27;t come.  I had a slight throbbing sensation, but that was it.&lt;br /&gt;My hands love this stuff, and I love that it is 100% natural.  It does go on a little greasy at first, but I generally use it a night, so it is not a big deal to me.  I have been using it about a month now, and have seen a vast improvement overall in the condition of my hands - much more supple and moisturized.  I will purchase it again, and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woodworking and home handyman kind of guy, and don&#x27;t expect to have milk soft hands. But, we had twin girls six months ago, and after a few weeks of sink duty with hot water and strong soap in the middle of a very dry winter, my hands were wrecked. My knuckles were like coarse sandpaper and starting to bleed in places. I couldn&#x27;t hold my baby girls without my skin catching on their clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was beginning to fear that a skin infection would soon set in. Tried a half dozen skin creams in several brands, including a couple of Burt&#x27;s products - not much relief or else much too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, tried this hand repair cream and experienced a near miracle. Much less greasy and easy to apply - absorbs right into my skin. Nice mild medicinal smell that inspires my manly confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, the results! Great improvement within two applications. Now, I rub it on my hands last thing at night and then slip on a pair of manly jersey cotton work gloves, from Lowes hardware of course. In the morning, my hands are baby soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for winter hand issues. I used to have a lot of problems with raw knuckles cracked and bleeding an very sore. Now once the temp starts dropping (Northern VT) I start using it right on thru to April or May.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burts was bought by a large cosmetics company a few years ago and it seems to me that the smell is not quite as strong and the mixture is now better emulsified. It used to be that a squeeze would sometimes get you a bunch of liquid that was not mixed in properly. Have not had that happen on last few tubes.</li>
    <li> Good cream, but terrible smell! I recently started using it because my fingers crack and peel this time of year.</li>
    <li> Smell really horrible. I really want to return it but just too much trouble. Don&#x27;t buy it if you cannot handle bug repellent smell.</li>
    <li> CANNOT get past the smell. it is very chemical-like.  Highly recommend this alternative-- burt&#x27;s bees ultimate care hand cream.</li>
    <li> This is a nice greaseless lotion but I&#x27;m not really a fan of the smell. It doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize too much either.</li>
    <li> not what I thought. It is very thick and very hard to push it out of the tube.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and it is the best hand and is also good for cracked elbows. Expensive but worth the money.</li>
    <li> The hand cream works well but the smell is soooooooooooooooooooo bad my family is begging me to quit using it!  I paid so much for the darn stuff I hate to throw it away so my family will have to suffer til its gone.  I wont be buying it again........</li>
    <li> Very effective. Works in just a few weeks!</li>
    <li> I like most Burt&#x27;s Bees products. I did read the reviews before purchase so I should have listened. The smell is very strong and it is not particularly pleasant.  The lotion is fine, but there are plenty out there with shea butter which seems to be the best for dry skin. And most of them smell better than this!</li>
    <li> Four, not five stars?  I have to take one star off due to the &amp;#34;unique&amp;#34; aroma, of which so many reviewers speak.  Its not offensive at all, just very different and very strong.  Bottom line, this stuff WORKS!!</li>
    <li> I use this for any dry spots &amp; works wonders. Immediately my hands feel soothed&amp; though it&#x27;s a little heavy/slightly greasy at first, then your skin will suck it in &amp; will be baby soft within minutes that will last for days no matter how dry your skin is. The only other product that compares in terms of softening skin to Burt&#x27;s Bees is Neutrogena Norwegian formula, but that uses petroleum, several different alcohols, many preservatives &amp; parabens which have been proven to cause cancer. Burt&#x27;s Bees moisturizers can soften your skin deep down all natural &amp; really heal instead of just putting a protective/non-breathable layer of synthetics.</li>
    <li> Only thing that I don&#x27;t like, is fact you have to use it so much living here in dry state.  Also wish tube was designed in different material that it comes in.  Feel&#x27;s great though.</li>
    <li> I am obsessive over skin care, and I have been rewarded for it by looking years younger than I am. Burt Bee&#x27;s and other relatively natural skin care product lines are essential to my skin care regimen -- this hand creme smells perfect, and is one of my favorite, if not my favorite, Burt&#x27;s Bees product.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products are the best!</li>
    <li> Weird smell but moisturizes really well without being overly greasy.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised how much I DIDN&#x27;T like this product. It does a good job moisturizing, but I can&#x27;t seem to get past its unpleasant odor. In the past, I have been quite pleased with Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but I will not be buying this one again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve come across.  I work with paper and wash my hands frequently as well so my hands are always feeling tight and itchy.  This stuff makes that go away immediately.  Be careful because a little does go a long way and if you use too much you&#x27;ll leave greasy prints on anything you touch.</li>
    <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s, don&#x27;t love this lotion. The smell is SO strong and herbal, but not in a good way. My husband hates when I use this before bed. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because it is 100% natural and a good price. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend, unless you are not sensitive to smells in any way.</li>
    <li> This product really does have a terrible oder. It is best used with gloves overnight. Use the [[ASIN:B00013Z1BE Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Hand Creme, Almond Milk, 2 oz.]] during the day and use this at night.</li>
    <li> It has a very specific smell, but I like it. However, as other people have noted, not everyone likes this particular scent. It works well as a day hand cream.</li>
    <li> I have problems with my hands splitting open in the dry weather. This has stopped that entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why people give a hand cream one star simply because of the smell. It sounds like they should be buying Hand Perfume instead. This will fix your dry cracked hands and make you feel human again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the smell is a little strong at first, but after a couple minutes it dies down. I got used to it and have somehow continued to live my life despite the smell emanating from my hands. I brought this cream to work and keep it at my desk to use during the day as my hands dry out after washing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying it after the current tube runs out.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with hand creams. I cant stand dry hands. I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands, and this one which I got as a gift, is the best! I can see some people not liking the smell, but I love it. Its got a nutty shea smell, very soothing. SUper absorbent. price here is cheaper than walmart.&lt;br /&gt;What a treat for the hands!</li>
    <li> This repair cream may not have the most pleasant odor, but it sure does take care of chapped hands in two applications.</li>
    <li> this stuff heals the splits in my fingers like nothing else does.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother that has very dry and cracked hands from the cold MN weather.  This worked wonders for her!</li>
    <li> I am an RN in an ER.  It goes without saying I wash my hands and use alcohol hand gel countless times a shift.  I also live in Pa; in the winter my hands would get chapped, red and cracked.  I really don&#x27;t want open areas on my hands.  A colleague recommended this cream a few years ago.  I was already a huge Burt&#x27;s Bees fan but had not tried this specific product.  Yes, it does not smell like something from Bath and Body Works.  It smells very medicinal.  With that said?  IT WORKS!  My co-workers are all using it and told me all our local stores were sold out of it because of me! They were all using mine and were out looking for their own.  It&#x27;s a *bit* greasy at first.  But my hands are soft, smooth, and most of all completely intact.  I don&#x27;t care about the scent.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t burn.  I put a dab on several times in my 12 hour shifts.  I&#x27;ve tried so many hand creams over the years with mediocre results.  THIS ONE is the best.</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell and it was too greasy for me.  I gave it to my boyfriend and he likes it for his rough hands.</li>
    <li> be warned, the smell of this stuff is not an exaggeration. it really is quite terrible but tolerating the smell is a small price to pay for its amazing results. i have eczema on my hands and this creme really helps keep flare ups from happening because of how moisturized it keeps my hands. i initially used it on my heels because they get dry easily, before i found out i had eczema. i would have given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the smell. when it comes to doing your skin a favor, use this and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Easily the worst smelling hand cream I&#x27;ve ever owned. I tossed it after one use.</li>
    <li> Smells strong feels like your putting medicine on your hands. Don&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin I like L&#x27;Occitane shea butter cream better.I wash my hands frequently and my skin drys out easily. I want soft skin that&#x27;s not stinging or overpowering smell. I don&#x27;t recommend this cream. Burt&#x27;s Bees should stick to lip care because this hand cream stinks.</li>
    <li> The soap we have in our house dries out our skin so fast.  This stuff is like magic healing on the hands.</li>
    <li> Best treatment for dry hand skin I have found. Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this one is super greasy.  It leaves my hands very shiny and doesn&#x27;t smell the best either.</li>
    <li> Excellent for dry cracked hands in cold weather.</li>
    <li> I love using Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this is no exception. This has been an excellent hand cream that I usually put on at night when I am going to bed and wake up to smooth moisturized hands. It has a stronger smell, but by no means a bad smell.</li>
    <li> good cream but smells bad</li>
    <li> Fragrance is strong. You either like it or not. Smells like citronella candle bug repellent. Maybe it will repel bugs. Definitely personal preference.  I also do not like the feel after application. It leaves hands feeling sticky and greasy.  I prefer a lotion that works into skin, leaving them feeling soft with no lingering residue. This doesn&#x27;t. But it was worth a try. No other way to know until you try.</li>
    <li> Whenever I get eczema breakout on my hands I just apply this at bedtime and its resolved by morning. This cream also keeps cuticle soft so use it when doing a manicure at home. Love the natural ingredients. Glad to find it at a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> great masculine smell</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! Not greasy and I don&#x27;t mind the smell, it makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a spa.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hand cream based on a recommendation.  This Winter my fingertips have become very dry; so dry that the finger pads are rough and catch on my clothing&#x27;s material.  I&#x27;ve never experienced such dryness before, but I certainly needed to address it.  I can easliy recommend this cream on function - it quickly moisturizes my hands/fingers and keeps the moisture there with daily use.  However, it has a noxious odor, one that repells my cats.  I suppose that could be a beneficial feature for some!</li>
    <li> I just love Burt&#x27;s Bees Shea Butter Hand Cream.  Just a wonderful soothing product for my hands.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream more than any other Burt&#x27;s hand cream.  I love the smell, although it is a personal taste - some will love it, some will hate it.  The smell isn&#x27;t overbearing though and dissipates rather quickly.</li>
    <li> Good product. It has an interesting smell which I don&#x27;t care for. Other than the smell it&#x27;s a good hand cream.</li>
    <li> Good product, hydrating and easy on my sensitive skin. I like the package and it does not open even when it&#x27;s shoved in my back pack.</li>
    <li> Weird smell and too thick consistency that makes it hard to absorb. I would recommend the Honey &amp; Grapeseed Burt’s Bees hand cream instead.</li>
    <li> This stuff is heaven in a bottle for your hands! My hands get super cracked and dry in the winter. This stuff does the trick! The smell is the only complaint but who cares! I will smell stinky for 5 mins but have silky smooth hands for hours! It goes on a little greasy at first but your hands soak it up within minutes. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Shea butter is wonderful. Admittedly, it&#x27;s a tad greasy, but it does the job. Even survives a few hand washings. I like Burt&#x27;s Bees because it&#x27;s mostly natural. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so the tube lasts quite a while. It&#x27;s a good value.</li>
    <li> The best natural hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Very moisuturizing and has a great earthy fragrance.</li>
    <li> My favourite hand cream.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, the smell is strong but after awhile I liked it</li>
    <li> Has a funky smell that I did not like so have not used very much.</li>
    <li> Love this cream but it is very hard to squeeze out of the tube !~ wish they would improve the container!  I have tendinitis so I cannot use this because I can&#x27;t squeeze my hand that much.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best hand cream I have ever used.  Great for my hands and especially good for my continually dry cuticles.  My hands haven&#x27;t looked this good in a very long time.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The smell is unbearable</li>
    <li> really the best product of its&#x27; type I have ever come across.  Good feel, good scent, good protection and all quality ingredients.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now.</li>
    <li> I hate lotions. I hate that feeling of washing my hands, even hours after applying a lotion and feeling like I am rinsing it all off. It makes me feel like it has done nothing for my skin but add chemicals and fake scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, this stuff is an exception. I put it on and even if I wash my hands a few minutes later, it doesn&#x27;t rinse away. It stays with me all day and it does an excellent job of relieving cracked skin and preventing further damage. Once I discovered this, all other lotions were swiftly tossed in the bin.</li>
    <li> It helps your hands but at a cost. The cr&amp;egrave;me makes you and your surrounding area smell for a while.</li>
    <li> There is definitely a scent, but I don&#x27;t mind it, especially considering how well it works. As someone who moved to New England a few years ago from Florida, I had never experienced winter dryness on my hands and elbows and went through every product I could find. I stumbled across a sample size of the Burt&#x27;s Bees for $.99 and decided to try it. Within three days, my elbows and hands were smooth and soft again! I will never spend another winter without it.</li>
    <li> The tube came in a different color[purple]/design-that was&#x27;nt a problem because the ingredients are the same. But wait- something is different- color/smell/texture of cream is not the same as the silver tube.Does&#x27;nt feel the same on skin- Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t say that it doesn&#x27;t work as a hand repair cream but its consistency is yucky, it can barely find its way out of the tube no matter how hard you squeeze it and it stinks. Yes, with a great deal of force and manual dexterity, I was finally able to get it out of the tube into an easier-to-use jar but it still smells really awful. Typically, though, I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products. (It&#x27;s possible, of course, that it would NOT do its repair work if it were a decent consistency and smelled better.)</li>
    <li> This stuff is very good. It stays on very well even through hand washing and will soften those dried out spots.</li>
    <li> I love all Burts Bees products but this one especially is my favorite because of the scent. I love the fresh coconut scent. It was very promptly delivered to my door and if you are considering buying this I say ... do it! :)</li>
    <li> This does help, but for the price that it is set to I had expected it to be a wonder healer to a younger looking set of hands.  I have been trying Earth Therapeutics Hand Repair and it appears to do the same effect but for 50% less the amount.  I buy this product less often now since I found one that has the same effect on my hands and for far less.</li>
    <li> I really like this hand creme because it goes on thick and smooth, and then, with some rubbing, magically absorbs into my skin - it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. It makes my hands feel hydrated, but I don&#x27;t feel like I have to abstain from touching things for 10 minutes after I put it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution: the smell of this stuff may not be for everyone. I love it, but my husband thinks it stinks. :) But the aroma fades quickly after it&#x27;s applied. I keep it in my living room and apply it after every hand washing.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream not greesy or oily. Once on you can fold the finest linens and not get oil stains on them.</li>
    <li> helped my rough winter hands</li>
    <li> through subscribe and save I get this lotion for at least $3 than the drug store price.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this lotion for the winter, or whenever!</li>
    <li> Goes on thick and provides immediate relief.  Rubs in smoothly yet is not oily.  The best hand cr&amp;egrave;me I have used for dry, cracked skin.</li>
    <li> Not biggest  fan of the smell and a little greasy but works well</li>
    <li> it is suitable for everyday use and can moisturize your hands. keep skin to be smooth. I will buy it next time</li>
    <li> Love this item, not greasy at all and I have been in dental field for 33 years and can still get gloves on using this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream I have ever used. Really buttery, melts into your dry skin quickly and leaves even dry cracked hands soft and comfortable. I LOVE the scent, it&#x27;s herbal and clean smelling, to me smells like lavender. I love to put  it on at night when I go to bed, the scent is relaxing and the cream is luxurious.</li>
    <li> I work at a gas station where I have to handle harsh cleaning solutions and dry waterless concrete cleaner. My fingers get so dry the skin peels off and the outer edges of my index fingers get calloused and cracked, as do my cuticles and elbows. I immediately felt a difference. This absorbs fast- a very good thing for us computer geeks. A lot of people say they hate the smell of this- I personally like it. It smells mostly of rosemary with the faintest scent of sesame. Wonderful stuff, no wonder that was the last tube!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells horrible, and doesn&#x27;t work into your hands well. I prefer the Burt&#x27;s Bees hand salve for chapped skin, and for lotion the Aveeno Skin Relief Hand Cream</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my Jack Black Hand Healer, which I love but is very expensive.  The product feels great, and goes on very well.  It works for hours, or until you wash your hands again (which I do several times per day working in an office building).  Its not very dense and also not liquidy at all.  Consistency is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the smell.  I bought it in spite of the complaints by some users.  I thought people were just too sensitive.  Now that I have it, I have to agree with some who say that the smell is unpleasant.  It lingers, but gets less unpleasant over 10-15 minutes.  This is a shame because the price is good and it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using it, but after a few more days I will need to determine whether I&#x27;ll switch back to Jack Black (which smells only slightly better).</li>
    <li> The hand cream itself is very nourishing and helpful for dry, chapped skin. It has many kinds of oils as well as beeswax, which seals in the moisture. HOWEVER, as some other reviewers have complained, the smell is VILE. The sesame oil smell makes me feel like I have smeared a rotting Chinese dinner all over my hands! It really, really bothers me. I think I&#x27;m going to have to put it in the \\&quot;don&#x27;t use unless absolutely desperate for hand cream\\&quot; pile. But if weird smells don&#x27;t bother you, this might be one to try.</li>
    <li> It has a unique smell some might find strong. My family is not a fan but it makes my skin look and feel great. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used hand cream from many different brands, but so far this one is the best! Especially, for dry hands!</li>
    <li> My everyday handcream as I&#x27;m rough on my hands. Love this stuff. Slightly greasy but rubs in. Nice lavender scent</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how any one can stand this product. It is so sticky and stinky it is unbearable. I&#x27;m all for natural products but they also have to be pleasant to use, and this is not! First of all, it is so sticky and doesn&#x27;t absorb at all so you leave smudges all over everything that you touch. And then it has this very strong herbal scent that is absolutely stinky. If you love strong herbal scents that leave you smelling like a medicine cabinet then go for it.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty bad itch habit that always roughens my hands up more than I like and this is the only cream that actually heals the redness.  Most hand creams just moisten my hands up and provide relief for a few hours, but this stuff, with only a little bit rubbed in whenever my hands get dry, actually repairs my skin within a few days.  I highly recommend this for anyone who suffers from anything hand related.  It works.</li>
    <li> My winter hands are loving this stuff.  I keep it at my desk and use throughout the day.  It smells great!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion-- no too greasy but very moisturizing;  I recommend to anyone in the winter time who constantly is washing hands</li>
    <li> It does what you need for healing dry skin.  Love this and am very loyal to it.  I recommend to all my friends!</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this lotion, and I imagine it would work very well if I were to use it consistently.  But I cannot get beyond the smell.  I can&#x27;t even describe it, I can&#x27;t identify it...it&#x27;s just rank.  I bought this yesterday at a retail store, and upon initial use, suspected it had turned and gone rancid on the shelf.  I checked Amazon reviews this evening to see if this were true, and sure enough a good number of reviews comment on the smell.  I am baffled by the reviews that claim to love the smell; this is clearly a love-it-or-hate-it situation.  Thus, take your chances purchasing this...it could go either way.</li>
    <li> Previous review: I hate the smell. I&#x27;m usually not sensitive to smells but this is not a pleasant one to have lingering on my hands all the time. I think comparing the smell to a citronella candle is a good analogy...&lt;br /&gt;That said, it feels really moisturizing and should be good for the cooler/dryer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I started putting this on my dry/cracked heels and it works wonders!!! Its the best thing I&#x27;ve found to solve that issue so I will be buying this again for that reason. Yes, I still hate the smell but I don&#x27;t mind putting it on my feet if it&#x27;s going to make my heels nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> I like other BB products, but this one isn&#x27;t great. The smell is very earthy - but so much so that I don&#x27;t care for it. And my hands feel slightly sticky after using it. Won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
    <li> This hand creme is great for moisturizing. Leaves less of an oily feel than other Burt&#x27;s Bees products. Smells kind of weird but well worth it for soft hands.</li>
    <li> I liked the lotion and it did work on my hands, but the smell of the lotion was to stong for me. And that outweighed how well the lotion worked for me.</li>
    <li> My hands are always cracking and bleeding and this is one of the few things that works for me.</li>
    <li> Works well but the smell is awwwwfullll!!! Threw it out. Couldn&#x27;t take the smell</li>
    <li> Very emollient, but not too greasy considering how moisturizing it is. The only thing I found somewhat discombobulating about it is that even though it isn&#x27;t mentioned anywhere in the description nor the ingredient list, the cream *definitely* smells like lavender, so if you&#x27;re allergic or simply don&#x27;t like it, keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> Smell is horrible. It is not easy to apply since it is more like Crisco than lotion. What a horrible waste of money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. It does moisturizer your hands but doesn&#x27;t sink into the skin fairly fast. THIS STINKS HORRIBLY! So that being said, I&#x27;ll probably use it before bed or just toss it. The scent is very very strong &amp; chemically.</li>
    <li> Ok, so the smell of this cream is not the best, but it is not that bad.  I am VERY sensitive to smells and this cream smell does not bother me.  It has a kind of medicinal scent to it (not sure what ingredient it is).  It is 100% natural.  I have very dry hands and have to use lotion all the time.  This past winter, most of my fingertips were very dry and many were cracking.  I started using this right after I applied my normal lotion at night right before I went to bed (without gloves).  After just a few days the dryness of my fingertips was gone and a couple more days and the cracking was gone!  I also started using it on my feet at the same time (but every night and morning) and the results are just as amazing.  Now my feet weren&#x27;t extremely dry because I am constantly applying lotion to them, but the heels would still be dry and bother me.  Now my heels are just as soft as the rest of my feet...no more dry heels for me!!!  Buy this cream.  It is amazing and you will be amazed.  If the smell bothers you, then just use it at night before going to bed and you will still see amazing results.  It is worth it.  I will be using this stuff for life.</li>
    <li> Really good foot cream which is how we use this. Great for hands too of course but excellent for keeping the bottoms of our feet from getting hard and cracking.</li>
    <li> I have severe eczema on my hands.  They get so bad that I am unable to function without the use of cotton gloves during the day and at night.  I have tried all kinds  prescription and over the counter medications and lotions.  Recently my mom bought me the Burt&#x27;s Bees hand repair creme.  I have to say, I was super skeptical.  Although it&#x27;s not a cure all, I have to say my hands have not felt this good in a long time.  The creme goes on really smooth and absorbs really quickly. As thick as it is, it only leaves a bit of greasiness, which goes away rather quickly.  Although my symptoms due flare up, they are not as bad as they have been in the past.  For the time being, my creme of choice is this one.  I would highly recommend it for those who have been searching for a solution to this problem.  I now have this cream, next to my bed, in my bathroom, in my purse and in my office.  I hope this review helps someone else who is suffering like me.</li>
    <li> Great repair. I find it a little greasy to wear during the day, but I don&#x27;t even need any as long as I put on a generous amount each night before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I don&#x27;t typically write reviews.  Also, I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  Having said that, this is a horrible product.  I can&#x27;t speak to the moisturizing qualities, as I couldn&#x27;t leave it on long enough to find out.  The smell is so unbearably strong and disgusting that I had to wash it right off.  My kids wouldn&#x27;t even come near me because they said I smelled bad.&lt;br /&gt;In the ingredients it lists fragrance, but I can&#x27;t imagine why they would purposely make it smell this way.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It smells yucky, but it worked for me!  I would love to buy again. I only wish they could improve in the smell if this product. Other than that, I am please with my results.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time.The product is greasy and is not absorbed into the skin.The cream remains on top of the skin and it feels greasy..</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I tried all different kinds of creams for my dry hands and nothing worked. This product really works and I use it very day. The smell isn&#x27;t the best but it helps and I feel so much better.</li>
    <li> The smell is herbal but doesn&#x27;t bother me. The cream works great and even gives a little sheen to your hands.</li>
    <li> Good product. I used straight shea butter hand cream for years and it works wonders. I went with Burt&#x27;s Bees to try something new. It works very well keeping my hands moist and preventing cracking.</li>
    <li> I put it at the tops of my hands because it can be a little greasy, but it absorbs quickly - however, I wouldn&#x27;t trade this in for another non greasy, paraben filled cream. I appreciate this product&#x27;s natural ingredients. The scent is like one of lavender, so while one of my friends loves it, another will tend to complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to feel the smaller ounces one works a little better, but maybe this is my imagination as it&#x27;s exactly the same product. I wish it were sold in stores, for now I&#x27;ve subscribed though to save on some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you use scissors to cut the top when the bottle seems to be emptying, you will find a lot more creme inside. I put this leftover creme inside a plastic container left over and this is better than carrying around the bigger alum case, or whatever it is made from.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of housework and gardening, and add the natural process of aging (I am in my early 40&#x27;s) to the equation&#x3D; drier hands. It got to the point that my hands would feel really uncomfortable and applying generic moisturizing lotions wasn&#x27;t doing much for my hands. I saw this product at my local pharmacy and decided to give it a try, though the price seems a bit expensive for the amount that you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the splurge, and is actually a cheaper alternative than some other branded products that cost an arm and a leg. This shea butter hand repair cream with cocoa butter and sesame oil is a deep moisturizing cream and absorbs quickly into the skin leaving the skin feeling supple, soft, and smooth. A little goes a long way too - and a tube lasts me at least two months. I apply it twice a day, and whenever necessary. The sesame oil scent is a bit overpowering, but then my sense of smell has always been overly sensitive. I don&#x27;t mind it though - the benefits far outweigh the cons.</li>
    <li> Great hand creme.  Moisturizes very well, nice scent.  I have very dry hands and I don&#x27;t have to reapply nearly as often as with other lotions.</li>
    <li> At one point, my son&#x27;s hands were so dry and cracked that he looked like he had been punching a concrete wall.  Everything we put on him either stung too bad, or was pretty much just a coat of Vaseline to keep it from being exposed *cough*aquaphor*cough*  He is autistic and would absolutely refuse to let us put lotion on because he was afraid of it hurting him.  We tried this after several of my online friends suggested this exact product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is strong, i will give you that, but its an herby smell which I like and my son didn&#x27;t object to either (if he objected, he would not allow us to put it on him, he is VERY sensitive to smells and not at all shy about letting his opinion be known).  It was very thick (about as thick as toothpaste) and I worried about it not absorbing, but it disappeared into the skin in just a few minutes and didn&#x27;t leave it feeling oily or wet afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked.  In less than a week of treatment it went from being bloody and painful to completely normal.  Used less than 1/4 of the tube doing it.  The same tube has been in my cabinet for over two years now and we still haven&#x27;t needed to buy another tube.  Every time we have incredibly dry skin, we put it on and it goes away after just a few treatments.</li>
    <li> Really wonderful feeling on skin.</li>
    <li> Same Burt&#x27;s Bees high quality product I have come to enjoy. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I get this through subscribe and save monthly. My hands are constantly in water so they get dry. I use this several times a day. I prefer this creme because it is thick but not sticky or greasy. Love it!!</li>
    <li> This damaged my nails. It caused my strong and healthy nails to peel and chip. Ive never had a problem with my nails until I used this. Its been two months of trying to get my nails to stop peeling.</li>
    <li> I used this cream for years. It came in a purple 3.18 oz box/tube.  It was spectacular.  Every woman who touched my hand would comment how soft they are.  A few other reviewers complained about the oily residue and the smell, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.  The oil was part of the reason it lasted so long, and you could just wipe it off with a towel if you needed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometime in the last year the formula was changed.  It comes in a yellow 3.2 oz box now.  It looks and smells the same, but it dries up much faster to the point where it no longer feels like I put it on. It&#x27;s still a decent cream, but it drives me absolutely nuts that they took a spectacular product and changed it unnecessarily for the worse. So many companies of all my favorite products do this.  I call it the Faceb00k syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HELPFUL TIPS: BEWARE of this product page, which misleadingly shows the purple box and misleadingly gives you the option between the 3.18 and 3.2oz tubes.  When I noticed the formula changed, I wanted to find some of the old version of the cream again. That&#x27;s how I got here to Amazon. I ordered a bunch of the 3.18&#x27;s, hoping I&#x27;d get the purple box.  But no, they sent me 3.2&#x27;s anyway.  Very disappointed.  The 3.18 option is a few bucks cheaper, so you might as well order the 3.18 even though you&#x27;re still going to get the 3.2.</li>
    <li> as usual, my fave hand lotion, rich and creamy and blends right in. The price may not be low but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> I use it in winter and early spring to heal my hands, but this is very disappointing. I feel no difference between using and not using it. Besides, the nasty ginger smell also makes it unbearable. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is expensive and stinky.  Wish I could return it.  I hated the way my hands felt when I put it on.  Not sure how anyone can get past the smell. I will stick with Neutrogena hand cream.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Thoroughly Shea Butter Hand Repair Hand Crème is absolutely the best hand cream we have ever tried! I use it when I am done working out in the garden, when my hands get all torn up from pulling weeds. It simply is the best hand creame on the market. We have shared it with friends and they love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in a sterile environment so I am frequently washing my hands and they dry out. The hand cream is soothing and bring my skin back to life. A great upside is it leaves no greasy residue. Great Hand Crème.</li>
    <li> Ultra-rich hand cream good for daily use on super dry hand. Shea butter with botanical oils (including sesame, borage, macadamia, rosehip and sunflower moisturize hands nicely.</li>
    <li> Great cream. After using many lotions and hand creams, my hands finally responded well to this product. Would recommend to anyone that works with their hands and does not want to feel like they are wearing grease mittens.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 56 year old woman that was experiencing dry, flaking, itchy, cracked, swollen and bleeding eyelids (in the creases of my eyelids) and also under my eyes.  This condition started in the early winter months and it is now the middle of March (we&#x27;ve had an exceptionally mild 2012 winter here in Chicago).  I initially blamed this skin condition on lack of humidity in the air, but I&#x27;ve reluctantly concluded that my cracked eyelids are likely a result of dry skin that comes with menopause.  After trying many moisturizing products and even Neosporan, psoraisis ointments, and cordisone creams on my eyelids and under my eyes, I decided to give the Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Repair Cream a try yesterday.  I am not exaggerating when I tell you that my skin condition improved 100 percent within 30 minuutes.  The cracked, broken skin healed completely after the first application and the flaking, itching and swollen tissue literally disappeared.  After the near-immediate results, periodically throughout the day and night, I looked in the mirror to see if I was just imagining what I saw after 30 minutes of using this product.  The results were real and lasting, there is no doubt about it.  But just to make sure there would be no re-lapse, I applied the cream again at bed-time.  I looked in the mirror this morning, and PRESTO, the cracks, flaking, bleeding and swelling did not return overnight.  This product gives a whole new meaning to \\&quot;I can&#x27;t believe my eyes\\&quot;.  Absolutely amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> I am a health care worker, and am always fighting the dry cracked skin that comes from lots of hand washing. And I knit, so I really want my fingertips smooth.  This stuff it great.  It feels like it goes on greasy, but soaks in right away, and it makes a noticeable difference.  And I love the scent - an added bonus!&lt;br /&gt;And of course there is no animal testing done by this company, which is mandatory for me.</li>
    <li> Great Hand Repair Creme.  I put this on my hands before bed at night&lt;br /&gt;and it does a great job of softening them after all of the cleaning&lt;br /&gt;chemicals I&#x27;m in all day long.  Good for dry cuticles too.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is good for men or women.  Very gentle scent.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best product for my dry hands.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is really good for hydrating and repairing my hands. The only thing is tgat I didn&#x27;t expect the smell to be like that. It&#x27;s really strong and it hurts my nose.</li>
    <li> It is ok，but the smell is not so exciting……</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I first got it when I was working in a daycare and having to wash my hands very frequently. My hands got so dry, particularly during the winter time, that they were cracked and starting to bleed. I ordered this based on reviews and started putting it on after washing my hands, and this stuff made a world of difference. When I first put it on my dry hands it felt like a relief to my skin. I like that it doesn&#x27;t make your hands super greasy and is also super moisturizing. I also like that it has good ingredients as opposed to a lot of other lotions. As far as the smell goes, I don&#x27;t mind it. I wouldn&#x27;t wear a perfume of it, but I don&#x27;t dislike it. It is somewhat strong, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last forever. There have been some people who have smelled it and said that they really didn&#x27;t like the smell, but then others also don&#x27;t mind it. It just depends on your preference. I would definitely recommend this if you need something to help with dry, cracked hands!</li>
    <li> Always the best hand creme</li>
    <li> Good morning stores and cream just has a strange older i&#x27;ve gotten used to it but my wife doesn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I bought some in desperation because they had it at the grocery store and I was on vacation and forgot my hand lotion. I used it once and threw it out...it absolutely reeks. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone wanting to use this and smell like it. Seriously, it&#x27;s repellent. Weleda Skin food is SOOOO much better and smells wonderful. I wouldn&#x27;t use this one unless you have no sense of smell and want to repel people.</li>
    <li> This cream is slippery at first, but keep rubbing it in and it moisturizes for hours. Great after washing hands.</li>
    <li> I was excited after one use. It&#x27;s thin but still coats the hands nicely.</li>
    <li> The product is nice and thick.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell very much.  It seems to help with the dryness</li>
    <li> This is awesome hand repair cream.  It has the consistency of thick toothpaste.  If I do not constantly maintain my hands by putting good quality product on them, I get significant skin dryness problems.  I have tried the higher quality hand lotions and they do not work like Burt&#x27;s Bees. I also recommend trying the hand cream that comes in a small glass container; both the almond or the banana hand cream are highly recommended.  Cannot go wrong with Burt Bees products.  I also use their shampoo, deodorant, bar soap and chap stick; all worth the few extra dollars over cheaper products.</li>
    <li> Feels greasy on my hands and smells awful!</li>
    <li> works VERY well with dry hands.  Has a potent smell but the chicks dig it. &amp;#34;oh, is that Burt&#x27;s Bees?&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;You bet your sweet ass it is!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I like the lotion itself, but the odor is strong and not at all pleasant. Because of that, we prefer not to use this lotion.</li>
    <li> Stinks...smells like petroleum. Nastiest hand lotion I have ever used. No way that there is any amount of shea butter..if so it is a minute amount.</li>
    <li> Well it is exactly what is advertised...lotion. However, it&#x27;s the nastiest Shea Butter I&#x27;ve ever smelled. As soon as I put it on my husband asked me to try and wash off.</li>
    <li> This hand cream delivers as advertised. It works wonders on my hands. There is only one downfall to this product- it has a strong smell. I don&#x27;t quite know how to describe the smell(good or bad). As someone with a sensitive nose, the smell when the cream is first applied definitely bothers me. The smell fades away quite a bit after a while. I actually like the way this cream makes my hands smell after the strong scent has faded away. The consistency of this cream is about the same as crisco, but believe me, this product works as the description says it does. It does take a while to get fully absorbed into your skin, I would say about an hour or so. I apply it at night before I go to sleep and wake up with AMAZING hands.</li>
    <li> I keep a tube of this in my office and it is like aromatherapy it small so good. I offer it to. Everyone when we are meeting and they love it. Not too greasy, rubs in quickly.</li>
    <li> This hand lotion smells fresh and clean. I got it fir myself for work all of my coworkers use it and I actually ordered a few tubes for them.</li>
    <li> I like most all Burt&#x27;s Bees products... but this one is stinky. Yes, its rich, creamy and soothing to your hands, but I can&#x27;t use it at work because it overpowers my perfume or use it before going to sleep because the smell is too strong and unpleasant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to use it on my feet at night, but I&#x27;m really disappointed because my hands get dry from handling a lot of paperwork and I really need a good hand cream to use during the day.</li>
    <li> it does have a very mild smell, probably due to the Shea butter , however it is  a smell that goes away shortly ,and it is bearably , especially due to the positive moisturizing benefits of this cream</li>
    <li> I wash my hands frequently as well as having sensitive skin, and at one point last year, I noticed my hands began to peel horribly.  I tried some other lotions and even the Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Salve without result.  Then, I decided to try the Hand Repair Cream to see if it would help, and after a few days of using this product, there was an incredible change!  The peeling had lessened, and my hands were soft, smooth, and looked like I had received a fresh manicure!  After a week of using the hand cream, all the peeling was gone - NO PROBLEM!  It is not cheap, so there were times I had to wait to buy another tube, and shortly after I had not used it, the peeling, drying, and cracking returned.  (It is cheaper here on Amazon if bought as an add-on - $8.75 per tube for three tubes, so I will keep purchasing it through Amazon).  I absolutely HAVE to keep a tube or two on deck at all times.  It is a true LIFESAVER for my hands!  My husband has also started using it on his hands and is very pleased with the results.  You will NOT be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is called hand repair, but I find it is also very good for foot repair and dry legs.  I keep this coming with subscribe and save.  Do not want to be without it.</li>
    <li> The odour is not very pleasent, but the shipment is great. I will try other odour next time.  Hope it will be good.</li>
    <li> I use this at night during the winter. My hands get super dry to the point that they crack and bleed. (Yeah, I know, it&#x27;s gross.) It does smell kinda weird, and it is heavier than a lot of hand creams, but that is why I use it at night. If you use it on broken skin or skin so dry it is about to crack open and bleed, it will sting. It really does keep my hands soft and smooth though, and I will probably still be using it for many winters to come.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have ever found after trying so many that really does help prevent and heal finger cracks that are inevitable in cold weather. I apply it daily to fingertips and it really works. An excellent investment in keeping winter hands comfortable and crack free.</li>
    <li> Very useful for my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> This hand cream works well.  It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side but it absorbs quickly.  That strong odor that some refer to smells like a combination of Rosemary and Lavender.  I would buy it again but I think it&#x27;s too expensive for what you get which is a good basic moisturizing hand cream that contains a lot of nice natural ingredients. I&#x27;ll find a less expensive one or make my own which I did once before.  Just in case you&#x27;re interested I whipped Now Apricot Oil, Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil, distilled water, and Lavender essential oil together.  I purchased all the ingredients here on Amazon.  It works great.</li>
    <li> My favorite hand lotion ever! This stuff is amazing and works wonders on my dry hands.</li>
    <li> I use this hand cream every winter when my hands get super dry in Chicago weather. It smells a bit weird but it grows on you. The smell is not unpleasant but just a bit unusual - reminds me of ground sesame. As a man, I rather smell like ground sesame than the usual flowery/feminine hand cream smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, effectiveness is much more important. Of the many different hand creams I tried, this one is probably the best of all. This hand cream gets absorbed into the skin (no oily effect at all!) and keeps your hands moisturized even after hand washing. Try it!</li>
    <li> It is very good.  Makes my hands smooth.</li>
    <li> This is excellent stuff</li>
    <li> The best hand cream!!! has  a little weird scent due to natural shea butter but the best for dry hands!!!</li>
    <li> Great hand repair cream. My son has eczema and his hands get so terrible in the winter.  I have been using it on him for about a week and it has helped immensely!  It does have a strong medicine like scent which I am not crazy about.  If the scent wasn&#x27;t so strong, I would have given it 5 stars.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> My hands get extremely dry, especially in the winter.  The dry air and constant washing due to cold/flu season really wrecks them!  This lotion is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.  I use it before bed and in the morning.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Very waxy and leaves a residue that doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
    <li> It is just what I needed for my constantly dry hands. I usually apply it with my hands slightly wet and I don&#x27;t mind at all the oily touch that last for a few minutes. I still have to apply it at least a couple of times a day but I love it. Not so much the smell though :)</li>
    <li> This hand creme is great. I have very dry hands and Burt&#x27;s Bee Hand Repair keeps my hands from cracking and keeps them moist.</li>
    <li> My hands feel so much softer since I started using this cream.  It has a bit of an astringent smell, so if you are sensitive to smells you may be better off with the banana or almond milk hand cream by Burt&#x27;s Bees instead.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  My husband does too.  Doesn&#x27;t smell girly, just Heavenly!</li>
    <li> Good to use at night an hour or two before bedtime. Very thick, a little greasy, strong smell, not the best. A little goes a pretty good ways.  Will have to use a week straight if hands are real dry, after that two or three times a week.</li>
    <li> Very useful, but smells bad.</li>
    <li> I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees products and was optimistic, given the review.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product, but didn&#x27;t work well for my cracked hands.&lt;br /&gt;The hand salve is still the best for me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs well, and smells great. I gift this to every new mama in my life, and it&#x27;s always a hit with them.</li>
    <li> Why did you go up in price? Still buying.</li>
    <li> the best cream for cold weather I&#x27;ve found, for both hands and feet, though a bit pricey</li>
    <li> First found it at a store and liked the rich, thick texture so much that I went looking, but no store seemed to have it - so thanks Amazon! There&#x27;s a billion hand creams out there, but I just like the richness of this, and even the metal tube where you can get every bit out and recycle - it&#x27;s all so homey and old-fashioned. Hope BB never stops making this, and Amazon never stops selling.</li>
    <li> Not a bad hand creme but smells awful.  I can only use this at night with gloves.</li>
    <li> This cream is great!  Every time I use it, people ask what that great smell is.</li>
    <li> I am an older woman and get dark spots on my hands.  I picked up a small tube of this in an airport while waiting for a connection because my hands were dry.  Low-and-behold it reduced the darkness of the spots I&#x27;ve become to accustomed to having.  I now use it several times a day (I live in a very dry climate) and the spots are not gone but definitely faded.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It stink so bad it is completely unusable.</li>
