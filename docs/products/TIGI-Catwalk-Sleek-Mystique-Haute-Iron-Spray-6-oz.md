      <li>It smells great (almost like cinnamon spice) and leaves my hair shiny and smooth.</li>

      <li>I love this hot iron spray and it smells so nice!</li>

      <li>just like what I bought in the salon at a better price</li>

      <li>This is my favorite hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>It smells great and really adds shine to my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Catwalk? More like STREETWALK.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to smell like a stripper, go for it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I love the Catwalk products.  </li>
      <li>I would think this product is better for individuals who have thicker, coarser hair than myself.</li>
      <li>Many people seem to love the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for flat iron protection, leave hair shine but not grease.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
      <li>This is great in my hair but has made my hair greasier than normal.  </li>
      <li>When I practiced on my piece of hair, it straightened it pretty good.</li>
      <li>I was able to straighten my hair easily.</li>
      <li>off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came straight home, to shampoo, and a good thing,</li>
      <li>I got a new cut that looks best straight</li>
      <li>But this is one that I would pay full price if I had to!  </li>
      <li>It is easy to overdo this spray if you are used to drug store brands where you have to douse your hair with it.</li>
      <li>Smells like a strong candy.</li>
      <li>Works fine but the smell is so strong i need to have the bathroom fan on while i use this.</li>
      <li>I love this so much!!</li>
      <li>, to recap, this product LOOKS CHEAP AND SMELLS CHEAP.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>Used this product for a blow out on my hair and it was silky smooth in the end.  </li>
      <li>Catwalk products are fantastic.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s sleek, and smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the product.</li>
      <li>It smells great and really makes your hair straight as a pin and shiny.</li>
      <li>, it smells great, and it does a fantastic job at protecting my hair from the heat of my flat iron.</li>
      <li>seems like it&#x27;s a knock off of the original product.</li>
      <li>It does not smell as fragrant as the one I originally purchased at a retail store.</li>
      <li>Smells great and have been using this product for a long time now.</li>
      <li>It gives you a fresh smelling go!</li>
      <li>It works wonderful to give your hair a nice sheen and to keep the fly away and broken hairs down.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best flat iron spray i have found, and i have tried almost all of them!  </li>
      <li>Sometimes, even if I&#x27;m not styling my hair with heat, I spray a tiny bit in anyways because it smells SO good.</li>
      <li>Sweet.</li>
      <li>It works very well, but it&#x27;s something that I use as a finisher, since it&#x27;s more of a shine spray.  </li>
      <li>I then continued to flat iron my hair without the product (because I didn&#x27;t want to pay the price for it) and noticed I was getting a fair amount of breakage.  </li>
      <li>You can also mist a little over your whole head after you are finished styling for a great over all shine!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to my heat protector sprays and this is my new favorite!</li>
      <li>This combined with a good dry shampoo</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells AHmazing and. Protects hair just as we&#x27;ll; a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This Spray has an unbeliveable smell and it protects your hair from the flat iron leaving it shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> This product is really great. I have tried several products in the past but this by far is my favorite. Since its sprays on it does not leave any buildup or greasy feeling like some products tend to do. It makes my hair shinier and softer too! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this in her salon before she uses the hair dryer or curling iron on hair. She also sells it but at a much higher price than Amazon! So I bought it from Amazon and use it every day. Just spray it on damp or dry hair before styling and your hair will look sleek and salon worthy.</li>
    <li> I would have given this zero stars, but couldn&#x27;t figure out how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the high and low reviews for this product, I purchased it online.&lt;br /&gt;What a HUGE disappointment.  Sooo greasy and oily: left my hair limp and lifeless. Not at all what I was looking for as far as hot iron protectant and preserving my straight do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the WORST aspect of Catwalk Straight Mystique is the stench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells like CHEAP, drug store perfume-- or more accurately, like several, cheap, drug store perfumes mixed together. It&#x27;s spicy, musky, sickeningly sweet, powdery, and STRONG, and has those eye-watering, cheap undertones only fake perfume can elicit.  I often like a good cologne musk scent, but this one is just cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catwalk? More like STREETWALK.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to smell like a stripper, go for it.  I read a few reviewers who said they like the smell, so to each his own, but I have to warn you, you may not be giving off the impression you think you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To prove to you, it&#x27;s not just me... I volunteer at the local library where they have a \\&quot;no perfume\\&quot; requirement, because many patrons are allergic. I try to oblige, but perfume is often part of my daily routine, so, I occasionally come on-shift from other activities and often end up wearing my usual, high-end perfumes, discreetly, of course, while on duty.  No one has EVER commented and especially not complained. I am always self-conscious and remorseful when I break the rule, so I have often asked supervisors if they can smell my perfume, or if it has been a problem, and they have always assured me it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I was working a library shift first thing in the morning, and using this CatWalk product for the first time on freshly shampood hair.  Immediately the smell was offensive to me, but I was running late and didn&#x27;t have time to re-shower.  On my way outside, I brushed and shook my hair, hoping the fumes would dissipate. I had to run 2 errands on my way, so I drove with all the windows down (in 55 degree weather) trying to blow the stench off my hair. To no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time I came into the library (about 2 hours after first applying the CatWalk product), I could still smell it and my eyes were literally beginning to burn and tear up.  Immediately upon entering I could swear people were glaring at me as I passed. Finally, after only 15 minutes, my supervisor ASKED ME TO LEAVE because the smell was so bad. I was too disgusted with the CatWalk product to even be embarrassed-- I agreed with her--I needed to go home and wash it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came straight home, to shampoo, and a good thing, when I looked in the mirror, the greasiness was even worse.  My hair just looked greasy and dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to recap, this product LOOKS CHEAP AND SMELLS CHEAP.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  And if you already use it, I assure you, YOU SMELL BAD and people are just too kind or too polite to tell you so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few different products, and after today, I&#x27;ll be going back to Straight Sexy Hair Smooth &amp; Protect Flat Iron Hairspray by Sexy Hair.  There is one other flat-iron straightening product I LOVE, but I bought it in a trial size in a beauty supply store, and I can not find it anywhere else,... yet.  I&#x27;ll repost if I find it.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I thought this product was going to be great! Overall, I was disappointed. The product is a bit heavy and seems to give the hair a greasy appearance vs. shiny and vibrant. Smells like a strong candy. I have healthy hair and I curl or straighten regularly (with a protector) so I haven&#x27;t noticed if this product is protecting the hair follicle.  I prefer using Moroccan oil and TIGI Control freak straightening serum over this product! I will use up this product, but do not plan on buying again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped the product in a UPS soft envelope and the cap cracked.</li>
    <li> Only think I like to use to flat iron my black hair type. Great smell not oily at all great for all hair types.</li>
    <li> This is by far and away the best beauty product that I own, and I&#x27;ve tried them all! Over the past year or so, I really started buying all of my beauty products online, rather than pay through-the-roof retail pricing.  But this is one that I would pay full price if I had to!  I have long, naturally curly hair, and straightening can be a beast!  Spraying this on after blow-drying and just before straightening makes the process a breeze!  It cuts the time in half! Plus, it protects against the 450 degree temp of my straightener, which we know can be brutal.  It makes my hair very sleek and shiny. And the SMELL!  Oh my gosh, the smell of this stuff is absolutely amazing! I have been getting compliments on my hair ever since I starting using it.</li>
    <li> Catwalk products are fantastic. This shine spray makes hair look very glossy. A little goes a long way! Reasonably priced too.</li>
    <li> Super wonderful product.  I have shoulder length blonde hair.  I color to cover up grey&#x27;s.  I use this AFTER I have ran the iron through it.  It works wonderful to give your hair a nice sheen and to keep the fly away and broken hairs down.  HINT: A little bit goes a LONG way.  Spray from far away sparingly.  If not you will end up with a greasy mess.  In the past I have tried every &#x27;shine&#x27; product out there from the inexpensive (garnier fructis shine serum is my favorite among the drug store finds) to super expensive oils.  This is better than them all in my opinion.  I have tried it before I blow dried...big mistake...left my hair super dry and oily.  If that makes any sense.  I have also tried it as directed on the bottle as a spray before you use the flat iron.  Also did not work.  So, the secret to this product is to use it AFTER you are finished styling.  This combined with a good dry shampoo helps me to be able to only straighten my hair about 2 times per week.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings over this product.  The smell of the product is just ok compared to some of the other TIGI Catwalk products I love (dry shampoo and finishing hairspray).  I use it after I blow dry my hair and before I curl or straight iron if my hair is particularly dry or frizzy otherwise it tends to weigh my hair down.  It does add shine but also tends to make my hair look greasy as well.  Probably will not reorder this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other drug store heat protectant sprays and this blows all others out of the water. I use this in combination with the Sleek Mystique Blow Out serum. I use this on my touch up day before I use a hot iron. You need very very little of this product. A little goes a long long way. My hair is naturally curly, and color treated, and I use a 419 degree setting on the flat iron and this spray and it&#x27;s sleek, and smooth and shiny. As long as you go easy on it - remember a little goes a long way - it doesn&#x27;t look greasy or feel greasy. It is easy to overdo this spray if you are used to drug store brands where you have to douse your hair with it.</li>
    <li> The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because of the smell. It is really strong and reminds me of an old lady. Fortunately, the smell wears off of your hair quickly, but it is nauseating the entire time you are using it.</li>
    <li> As long as I use a small amount and spray it from the farthest distance possible, it works as advertised and makes my hair soft after using the straightening iron. However, I don&#x27;t recommend using it on dry hair eventhough the label says you can. If I concentrate too much in one area or use it when my hair is dry, it makes that section of hair look extremely greasy - and I do not have thin, fine hair. Used just right, it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron spray i have found, and i have tried almost all of them!  Makes my hair super shiny and soft.  Goes on a lil greasy at first, but that goes away after you flat iron it.  You can also mist a little over your whole head after you are finished styling for a great over all shine!  Awesome product!  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and I feel like this product really weighs it down. I only spray it on the ends of my hair before straightening or curling it with my curling rod, but i don&#x27;t feel it makes my hair look as good as when i use other products. It is a very shiny, greasy product that comes out out an aerosol can which makes it hard to limit the amount of product being used. I would think this product is better for individuals who have thicker, coarser hair than myself. I will not be buying this product again and won&#x27;t even finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> Awesume product got it in retail when I found on amazon I guda jus fell out. Great price great hair product. Protects your hair from heat from styling ull luv how it makes ur hair feel!!!</li>
    <li> I just love the smell and the way it protects my hair from using a curling iron,&lt;br /&gt;flat iron, and waver. I Highly recommend this product as it is much cheaper&lt;br /&gt;from this company rather than buying it at a salon. I will buy more when I am running low.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product. I have used several different heat protectants over time and I definitely like this one best. I use it in conjunction with the Sleek Mystique Blow Out Balm, and the combination delivers great results. Both of them require a light hand, however; if I use even a tiny bit too much, my hair looks greasy. As long as I don&#x27;t use too much, though, it&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about this product because I read that it was greasy, weighs your hair down and has a strong smell. Well rest assure I didn&#x27;t experience these things. It left my hair very smooth and light. It&#x27;s not greasy at all. I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to my heat protector sprays and this is my new favorite! It does have a scent but it&#x27;s not too over powering. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Weighs my hair down. I have thick hair and this just felt thick and left a weird texture to my ends.</li>
    <li> Spray lightly on dry hair just prior to using a flat or curling iron. Prevents damage from heat of hair appliances.</li>
    <li> I am sort of disappointed with it seems like it&#x27;s a knock off of the original product. It does not smell as fragrant as the one I originally purchased at a retail store.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell and I don&#x27;t notice anything amazing about this product. There are so many products out there that I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, makes your hair manageable.</li>
    <li> The first time I spray this, I was testing it out on a piece of my hair. When I walked into my mom&#x27;s room, she immediately noticed the smell. When I practiced on my piece of hair, it straightened it pretty good. I look forward to using it on my whole head.</li>
    <li> I use the blowdryer and flat hot iron every other day.  This spray really helps to add shine and smooth out my hair.  Not much is needed, otherwise, you may get an oily look to your hair.  Many people seem to love the fragrance.  I&#x27;m not a fan of it.  Too &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; for my taste, but it&#x27;s bearable.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to make a different look on my hair and it did not. My hair looked thick and not thin.</li>
    <li> I ordered three at a time because it is so good. It smells great and really makes your hair straight as a pin and shiny. It also protects your hair from burning and making it break.</li>
    <li> This is the best heat protectant I have ever used. It is truly amazing and I highly recommend it. Just be careful not to flatiron immediately after spraying it on as it is highly flammable.</li>
    <li> One of the best products that I know of.</li>
    <li> I spray this on my hair before I flat iron it. It smells great and I have noticed that my hair isn&#x27;t as dry and brittle as before I started using it.</li>
    <li> I love this so much!!</li>
    <li> I use this product a lot. Being that it is cheaper to buy off of the internet than through my hair dresser. The bottle last for awhile so the next time I need it, I know where I can go to get it.</li>
    <li> REALLY Great Product! Thank you to all those who reviewed before me.  I went off the reviews when I felt I needed to purchase something different than what I was using.  I work the heck outta my hair, coloring, blow drying, flat iron...this has been fantastic! I use high end products for most everything regarding &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;, I was thrilled this was a great price and a great product!</li>
    <li> I have course and thick hair. This product works miracles on my hair. One of my favorite  hair products. I can&#x27;t  wait to try other similar  products from this brand.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff it smells amazing and leaves my hair so shiny!</li>
    <li> The product works great. I was able to straighten my hair easily. However, the smell... ugh. I kept hoping the smell wouldn&#x27;t linger (which doesn&#x27;t) or that no one leaned over for a hug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did NOT have the TIGI citrus scent.</li>
    <li> I use this for my semi wavy hair and it works wonders with the flat iron. If you get static fly aways like me this product really helps tame your hair and keep it straight throughout the day. My hairdresser who has perhaps the most well known salon in town uses it religiously!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Smells awesome. Don&#x27;t use too much though. You only need a small spray.</li>
    <li> I actually received the wrong can. It&#x27;s ok but i payed $17 for the sleek mystique. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I tried this first as directed on the bottle.  The result was the flat iron sticking a I tried to run it down my hair, giving my hair a crimped look.  Not good.  I tried some different applications on my own and the result was the same. I use a high quality flat iron and have never had this problem before this product or since I&#x27;ve stopped using this product.   I do not care for it at all.</li>
    <li> Used this product for a blow out on my hair and it was silky smooth in the end.  Love it.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser always uses this on my hair and I decided to get my own. Smells great and somewhat leaves your hair shiny.</li>
    <li> It works very well, but it&#x27;s something that I use as a finisher, since it&#x27;s more of a shine spray.  After I&#x27;m done flat ironing, I mist this product through my hair, and then flat iron the top quickly to seal in this spray.  Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> I really like Catwalk products especially this one if you use hair dryer and flat iron this will help not damage your hair.. Been using this product almost 2 years now, recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I 1st purchased this product at a local hair salon for a price more than double what Amazon is selling it for.  I used the product, loved it and ran out of it.  I then continued to flat iron my hair without the product (because I didn&#x27;t want to pay the price for it) and noticed I was getting a fair amount of breakage.  I realized my hair breakage was because I was not using a protecterant on my hair!  I then found the same exact product I purchased in the salon on Amazon for a great price and ordered several cans!  I have very fine, dry hair that needs oil, but not a lot or it will just go limp.  This product provides the protection from the flat iron and the moisterizer that I need to make my hair look healthy and shiny, but like other reviews have indicated, you only need a little.  I usually lightly spray my hair all over prior to flat ironing, making sure I get the edges of the hairline which are more prone to breakage.</li>
    <li> I love the Catwalk products.  This is the only heat protectant that I have found that does not make my hair feel sticky!</li>
    <li> This smells good and works well.  I use it when I flat iron my hair and it does protect, while leaving a shine.</li>
    <li> Received quickly and in great condition. Love the scent and with the cold, dry air, I finally found a product that controls the static in my hair :)</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great smell as well! Must have!</li>
    <li> Works fine but the smell is so strong i need to have the bathroom fan on while i use this.</li>
    <li> This is great in my hair but has made my hair greasier than normal.  It does make it shiny!</li>
    <li> I nver do reviews but this product is amazing I have african american relaxed hair and it works on my long locks,it also smells amazing</li>
    <li> I love this heat protectant! It smells great and really adds shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> good styling agent-over priced</li>
    <li> Perfect for flat iron protection, leave hair shine but not grease.&lt;br /&gt;Best product to protect hair from high temperatures ( flat iron)</li>
    <li> This is my holy grail of hair products. I use it every day before flat ironing my hair and it does a great job protecting my hair from heat damage. I would not use a flat iron without it.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product. It dries out your hair but weirdly at the same time makes it sticky.  The smell is just terrible, I gagged on it as I was spraying my hair while styling it. I wish I could return it but apparently I cannot. It&#x27;s outrageous that the seller didn&#x27;t note this. BEWARE!!!   I&#x27;ve used other products such as Nexxus, Alterna, Aveda to add protection and make my blow-out/flat-ironing easier. When compared to those products this one is an epic fail. I have the sister product, TIGI catwalk blowout balm, which works better but does not eliminate flyaway and frizzes.  Based on my experience, TIGI products are all marketing hype but without the performance to back up the claims. I will no longer purchase this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> I use Living Proof straight, but hate the price so I started looking for something similar that I could use when I flat iron my hair when its dry.&lt;br /&gt;TIGI Catwalk Haute Iron Spray, smells really good and works pretty well. The only down side is it makes hair kind of greasy. It definitely makes my hair straight, but just need to be careful how much I use.</li>
    <li> This item was paid for and shipped to a different address than mine. Have not received credit or item still yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually purchased this twice from Amazon because I liked it so much after the first use. It works really well, I only wish that the can was bigger.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist recommended this spray to help with winter static and cowlicks, and I&#x27;m glad she did! I have fine, naturally wavy shoulder length hair that I flat iron every day, so a heat spray that works is essential. I love this spray because it&#x27;s a fine mist that doesn&#x27;t build up and weigh my hair down. You can use it before blow drying or on dry hair before flat ironing, which is what I prefer to do. It smells great (almost like cinnamon spice) and leaves my hair shiny and smooth. I definitely recommend this spray.</li>
    <li> Great price . Love the smell and shine it leaves your hair . Is to use for all types hair, only need a little spray it goes along way.</li>
    <li> This keeps my hair from drying out while blow drying and flat ironing.  The smell is good and sweet and lasts.  Not greasy as some other heat protectors have been.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other products and this one really works well!!! I would buy this again. Really tames the frizz.</li>
    <li> just like what I bought in the salon at a better price</li>
    <li> Smells great and have been using this product for a long time now. It gives you a fresh smelling go!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past couple of years, and I can&#x27;t imagine switching to anything else! A little bit goes a long way so it lasts quite a while, it smells great, and it does a fantastic job at protecting my hair from the heat of my flat iron. I style my hair at the highest heat setting, but you would never know. My stylist is always amazed at how healthy my hair is. I definitely recommend it. I have straight/slightly wavy hair that is medium in thickness. I recently bought one for my mom, who has thinner hair, and it works well for her too. Sometimes, even if I&#x27;m not styling my hair with heat, I spray a tiny bit in anyways because it smells SO good.</li>
    <li> Love this product and will buy more!  It really leaves your hair soft and silky.  It&#x27;s not sticky like some other products.</li>
    <li> I have dry, somewhat frizzy, wavy hair with several cowlicks.  Ever since I coupled a deep conditioner with this product, my hair looks professionally blown out; it is shiny and straight but not greasy.  In fact, this product is so effective that I have been able to stop using the flat iron except for second day touch-ups.</li>
    <li> I love this hot iron spray and it smells so nice!</li>
    <li> This product has rejuvenated my hair from dye and frizzy to shiny and healthy! They were a lil late on shipment but made up for it with an extra bottle and tote bag. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the product. I like that it is a spray as it helps keep from using too much such as accidental over pour, etc.</li>
    <li> This product is the best!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!  It smooths perfectly, and I&#x27;ve had more than enough compliments about how great my hair smelled.</li>
    <li> I recently got my hair debulked a LOT bcz its so heavy and hot in summer. I got a new cut that looks best straight but i am naturally wave/curl on the underside. So then i didn&#x27;t have much weight to hold the straight after ironing. Without product this summer it still looked dry bcz of the frizz factor even w the afyer styling gloss serum and a heat protecting creme by morrocan oil. I had a massive frizzed out wad of air-dried in humidity, in a pony all day hair last night that i decided to test out my new product on. I worked in my usual way in three layered sections from bottom up. I sprayed a light mist and just finger combed it thru each section at a time and flat ironed. It was great. Little work produced a smooth straight style that shined like crazy. I slept on it and it looked the same in morning without even brushing it...i dont brush often tho usually only after washing.&lt;br /&gt;I proceeded to the beach today in a pony again. No frizz developed. I took it out this evening and about an hour later the ponytail crease fell out on its own!! I have yet to brush it. Looks like i just styled it again! Sweet. I love a low maintenamce hairdo. I have a newborn and toddler so airdry followed by 10-15 min to be set for 3 days is awesome.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will not flat iron my hair without it. Protects hair and makes it very shiny - the closest thing I have found to getting salon results at home.</li>
