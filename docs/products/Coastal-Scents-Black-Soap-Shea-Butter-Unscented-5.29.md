      <li>This one I am very pleased with, I am on my second bar.</li>
      <li>I tied it in plastic netting (the kind produce sometimes comes in) and hang it where it will stay dry, then I wet my hands to rub the bar until I get some lather and use the lather to wash - works great</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s nice soap, but, very drying, so I can&#x27;t use daily....</li>
      <li>First time I tried this product.</li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase again, intentionally this time :)</li>
      <li>The Bar was HUGE and will last like 1 year.</li>

      <li>Really.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really helped reduce my cystic outbreaks.</li>
      <li>They dontt seem to do much for my complexion.  </li>
      <li>Amazing, cut a small chunk to keep in my shower.</li>
      <li>However, it was really messy (very drippy) and not the most appetizing looking soap to be hanging out in my shower.  </li>
      <li>I wash my face with this bar and it gets it clean, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
      <li>I like this bar of soap for my face, it is large enough to last a long time, and it seems to really help my skin stay clea and look healthy.  </li>

      <li>and I have no problem with the bar getting too soft or melting away.</li>
      <li>It gets really soft and squishy in the shower...</li>
      <li>and I decided to try it to see what&#x27;s up with it since ive decided to use natural products and</li>
      <li>but I simply love this soap I usually use Cetaphil due to my dry skin issue but this soap was fantastic.</li>
      <li>Does not dry the skin and mild smell, but they do not last long.  </li>
      <li>maybe she just threw it out to spite me, or to make it clear that she is the only one permitted to buy anything unless her permission is asked for first.&lt;br</li>

<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never really tracked my spending on the various skin treatments as I had deemed them all necessities, however, as I&#x27;m writing this review and looking around at all the bottles, maybe $150</li>
<li> Helps with cystic acne, doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry.</li>
<li> It helps with clearing brown spots on your face it wont dry out your skin</li>
<li> I have super-sensitive, dry skin</li>
<li> It also seems to be helping to fade some dark scar spots that I have on my arms, back and face -</li>
<li> but it cleanses and rinses hair without stripping or leaving a residue, even in the hard water where I live.</li>
<li> Especially my arms, as I&#x27;ve tried every home remedy I could find over the past several years to no avail until this soap.</li>
<li> Coastal Scents Nuna Black Soap Unscented that does not leave my skin feeling dry and itchy.  </li>
<li> I see a difference in my lips, my stretch marks, cuticles, nails,feet, my dark spots are fading</li>
<li> I was given a sample of Black soap and have been using it as a face soap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing, cut a small chunk to keep in my shower. My face feels soo clean.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Used almost a whole bar already</li>
    <li> soft soap but it&#x27;s stimulate the face skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice soap, but, very drying, so I can&#x27;t use daily....which is what I was hoping to do. GREAT cleansing soap, though. You are SQUEAKY clean. It gets really soft and squishy in the shower...so keep in a container, if possible.</li>
    <li> Helps with cystic acne, doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry. I use twice a day - morning and night and it&#x27;s really helped reduce my cystic outbreaks. Note: definitely get a container of sorts to store this as it leaves a brown residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased black soap before and I was not disappointed with this.  I use it head to toe.  It&#x27;s my shampoo, soap, and facial cleaner (with an exfoliant).</li>
    <li> Smells good and moisturizes. I tied it in plastic netting (the kind produce sometimes comes in) and hang it where it will stay dry, then I wet my hands to rub the bar until I get some lather and use the lather to wash - works great and I have no problem with the bar getting too soft or melting away.</li>
    <li> Really nice soap. With the store brands I get out of the shower and my skin is tight, not with this...  Put on a little homemade Shea butter lotion and my skin is oh so soft...results which are hard to get in the dry Rockies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using black soap of different types/brands for years, and I feel that this is the best that I&#x27;ve found.  Because I chose another brand as a subscription and wouldn&#x27;t receive it for three weeks, I got this bar as an interim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is silky soft, and I&#x27;m totally in love. This is luscious and beautiful, and is perfect for my skin.  I&#x27;m 61 at the time that I write this and this doesn&#x27;t strip at all. Not only that, but it cleanses and rinses hair without stripping or leaving a residue, even in the hard water where I live. As an aside, I&#x27;ve used black soap as a toothpaste.  I don&#x27;t care for the artificial, sickly sweet flavor of regular toothpaste, and because this is all natural, it doesn&#x27;t have that sharpness of regular commercial soap.  It doesn&#x27;t taste like anything, so if I brush my teeth and then have orange juice, there&#x27;s no tastebud pain involved. So for me, this one soap takes the place of skin cleanser, shampoo, and toothpaste. And for what it costs, a bargain at twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting ready to order the four-bar pack [[ASIN:B00ATDE2IO Coastal Scents African Black Soap Set]] so that I can share with friends, and I will be canceling the subscription.  Of a soap that I liked until I got this by accident. Who knew.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but it works the best! Always leaves my skin clean and well moisturized after use.</li>
    <li> The soap looks so funky the wife threw it in the trash. Really. Boy was I angry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I managed to use the soap three times before it was trashed. It does have hard particles in it. It was quite shocking to rub it on the body and suddenly feel like I was scratching myself with something hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I liked it. I can&#x27;t really say though since I only got to use it three times. You might want to notify anybody else in the house that the ugly looking chunk in the shower is a piece of soap and not something disgusting that needs to be thrown away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still cannot figure out what she was thinking. I do mechanic work so maybe she thought it was a white soap covered with grease and oil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is mean and controlling, so maybe she just threw it out to spite me, or to make it clear that she is the only one permitted to buy anything unless her permission is asked for first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like it would be obvious that it was not a white soap covered with grease and oil, doesn&#x27;t it?..............</li>
    <li> after you shower you can feel the difference,</li>
    <li> Nice soap, well ive heard people talk about the soap so and I decided to try it to see what&#x27;s up with it since ive decided to use natural products and wow its amazing would order some more.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my S/O based on reviews that it would help with acne. He doesn&#x27;t use it on his face, but said that it leaves a filmy residue on his body. He also hasn&#x27;t seen any improvement or difference in his skin. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work the way we hoped.</li>
    <li> Ah, now THIS is what I was looking for!  Only used it once so far but was impressed with the ingredients and was happy that it truly IS unscented!  I&#x27;ll be buying again :)</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of Black soap and have been using it as a face soap. It is great It helps with clearing brown spots on your face it wont dry out your skin and you dont need fancy soap products. I will be buy more of this when I run out. The Bar was HUGE and will last like 1 year.</li>
    <li> Get it! Get it, now!  Day one my skin was like &amp;#34;THANK YOU!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve gone from using  one soap for my face, one soap for my body, one soap for my &amp;#34;v&amp;#34;, exfoliating scrubs and various peels, ingrown hair treatments, lip scrubs, plus many more fixes to just this one bar.  I see a difference in my lips, my stretch marks, cuticles, nails,feet, my dark spots are fading, the black heads on my nose are gone - all from this one bar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so soft.  My skin is nourished.  My skin looks healthy. All with this ONE bar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Black soaps in the past. I&#x27;ve used Shea butter.  I absolutely love Moringa Oleifera.  These are each excellent as stand alone products and together just - whoa, absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried this on my hair.  If this replaces my Wen, I will be the spokesperson!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never really tracked my spending on the various skin treatments as I had deemed them all necessities, however, as I&#x27;m writing this review and looking around at all the bottles, maybe $150 -$200 a month savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, well, I am thoroughly impressed.  I hope you have the same amazing experience.</li>
    <li> This soap will not strip your skin, is pretty moisturizing, and I loved that it was a natural product.  However, it was really messy (very drippy) and not the most appetizing looking soap to be hanging out in my shower.  If you can contain it, it works!</li>
    <li> I received this soap by accident after placing an order for a Coastal Scents brush set. After I got over the initial shock of not getting what I ordered I decided to give the soap a try... I don&#x27;t know if it is because I had no expectations but I simply love this soap I usually use Cetaphil due to my dry skin issue but this soap was fantastic. I used it all week while staying at a hotel with the ac blasting each night and I did not have to reason to itch as I usually do when in an air conditioned room... The moisture and lather level in the soap was terrific... I will definitely purchase again, intentionally this time :)</li>
    <li> The boxes were sealed and the soaps were busting out of them.  It made me afraid to even use the soap.</li>
    <li> I wash my face with this bar and it gets it clean, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out. Definitely will order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of Shea Butter soaps in the past, and I&#x27;ve got to say, this is great stuff, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Coastal Scents Black Soap leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without any irritation because my skin is so sensitive. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> love the smell....good soap</li>
    <li> Does not dry the skin and mild smell, but they do not last long.  Not my preferred soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome! It is helping to fade spots on my face and hands and it is non drying. It is NOT an overnight cure, but it works, if you are patient.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  A good size for a decent price and is quite gentle.  I have super-sensitive, dry skin and this is moisturizing enough without being greasy/creamy/hard to wash off.  Leaves your skin feeling very clean and light without drying it out.  It also seems to be helping to fade some dark scar spots that I have on my arms, back and face - I didn&#x27;t realize this was going to happen, and I&#x27;ve had those spots for years.  The only thing I changed recently was my shower soap.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> I ordered this soap to see if it helped my rosesea. I found that dead sea mud soap or sulfur soap did a better job and was less messy. Otherwise, for body, it I liked it.</li>
    <li> Coastal Scents Nuna Black Soap Unscented that does not leave my skin feeling dry and itchy.  I have eczema and this winter my skin has been extremely dry until my best friend gave me this wonderful gift.  I was reluctant to try it and now I am so glad I did.  I recommend this  to anyone that has sensitive skin.  This is the one!</li>
    <li> First time I tried this product. It is excellent and leaves you feeling squeeky clean.</li>
    <li> I like this bar of soap for my face, it is large enough to last a long time, and it seems to really help my skin stay clea and look healthy.  Most of the face cleansers I buy I never finish because They dontt seem to do much for my complexion.  This one I am very pleased with, I am on my second bar.</li>
    <li> Love this soap, have it on auto ship.</li>
    <li> Melted away too fast.</li>
    <li> I had forgotten I ordered this. I started using it. It feels like my skin is drying while I am in the shower, but once I get out of the shower, I am left with smooth, hydrated skin &amp; don&#x27;t need to apply a lotion. I like it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even be sure it helped my skin at all, because it melted, became a soft blob and I couldn&#x27;t even handle it. I tried to find a soap dish that was big enough for it, but couldn&#x27;t. This thing is HUGE. I wound up putting it into a tupperware bowl, but it never got firm again. I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> This soap has been a miracle for my hormonal acne, redness, and bumpy skin on my upper arms. It&#x27;s natural, gentle, yet deeply cleansing. I use this once a day in the morning and a microfiber facial cloth or cold cream at night to remove make up and my skin has never been happier! Especially my arms, as I&#x27;ve tried every home remedy I could find over the past several years to no avail until this soap.</li>
