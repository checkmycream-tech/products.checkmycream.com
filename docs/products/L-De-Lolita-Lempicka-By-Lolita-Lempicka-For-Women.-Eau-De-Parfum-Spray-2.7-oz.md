      <li>I love this scent!</li>
      <li>absolutely LOVE this perfume!</li>
      <li>Love this scent!  </li>
      <li>but unfortunetly I cannot which kind of upsets me.</li>
      <li>Like warm cotton candy, but better.</li>
      <li>It is even more amazing than I remember.  </li>
      <li>I am hesitant to say, but this is the most amazing smelling perfume ever.</li>
      <li>This perfume just smells great though, its light and refreshing and sweet smelling.</li>
      <li>Elegant bottle.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I love this perfume.....</li>
      <li>I have received many compliments on it from both men and women.</li>
      <li>I had a baby, I thought it was a great, very feminine,</li>
      <li>Warm fragrance that both of you will enjoy.</li>
      <li>I can smell the vanilla more than anything else.  </li>
      <li>After seeing the prices I was not going to get it, almost $80.00 or more for this size.</li>
      <li>&amp; very unique &amp; sophisticated.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just the most amazing delicious smell ever and the dry down is wonderful</li>
      <li>although very sweet fragrance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too sweet and cloying!</li>
      <li>It is a lighter scent than the original Lempicka, has a more salty vanilla smell to it along with underlying notes which I can&#x27;t describe.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet and spicy, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Very layered scent, depth is amazing.</li>
      <li>It is rich and delicious with a little bit of a citrusy opening and a divine mix of vanilla, amber, musc, and immortelle.</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews on this perfume I was excited to order it and at such a great price.</li>
      <li>Its light and work friendly and something I reach for reguarly.</li>
      <li>I bought this product and I&#x27;m pretty sure its a knock off.</li>
      <li>If you like a lighter scent which smells sweet but not too sweet or cloying</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet and soothing.</li>
      <li>So, now I have a full bottle that is never used.&lt;br</li>
      <li>like when you go to church and there are too many old fashioned strong perfumes in one place</li>
      <li>I like to wear it for romantic dinners, but it would be nice even for day wear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big vanilla person but with the other scents in this it is very beautiful and sensual.  </li>
      <li>I was super excited to receive my new perfume from lolita lempicka</li>
      <li>it is long lasting, has a clean smell, and an attractive bottle</li>
      <li>it was delivered today and I have to say it smells pretty good but a little bit to sweet.</li>
      <li>Item is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>I thought I would look at Amazon because I get most of my stuff on here, low and behold it is $39.00</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that there were many different names for this perfume</li>
      <li>I ordered this expecting the orange carton and blue bottle, but what was shipped to me was not the vanilla scented dream I know and love.  </li>
      <li>Arrived super fast and WOW!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I would much rather return it</li>
      <li>Every person (male or female) that comes near can not resist telling me how good I smell.</li>
      <li>This is similar in that it is soft, sensual and sweet, but not too sweet, and not flowery.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for something similar to the original Evening in Paris fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I have the other lolita lempicka in the apple shaped bottle and love it....</li>
      <li>Big fan of the original, this one is a bit sweeter.  </li>
      <li>I am not sure what it is about it, but i LOVE It!  </li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes, the smell is a little vanilla with maybe nag champa or patchouli, if you know what that smells like it is very sensual smelling.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite fragrances and the nose behind it is the incomparable Maurice Roucel.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite scents but disappointed when bottle started leaking perfume from the top so probably just cheaply made.</li>
      <li>If you are not sure if you want it you can go to Sephora and smell it, if you love it buy it here, not only will it be free shipping</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear it because the smell is not the normal smell.</li>
      <li>I probably should have purchased 2 because Im sure I will be wearing this everyday!  </li>
      <li>My husband leaned in close and said, &#x27;Wow!</li>
      <li>No longer making this fragrance, so was worried about scent being old.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too strong like the Si Lolita, it drys down to a slightly earthy vanilla, almost like a vanilla pipe tobacco.</li>
      <li>I would rather be the only one on the planet who gets to smell this good, but suppose that would be unfair!</li>

<li> sorry l de lolita. :(</li>
<li> I threw away money on this! :(</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a flowery disgusting scent</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Big fan of the original, this one is a bit sweeter.  I always get compliments on my perfume when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
    <li> Not what I wanted but not the sellers fault  I got the names mixed up</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, the smell is a little vanilla with maybe nag champa or patchouli, if you know what that smells like it is very sensual smelling. The best part is that Amazon has the best deal of all, I had looked everywhere for this scent thinking maybe someone would have it. After seeing the prices I was not going to get it, almost $80.00 or more for this size. I thought I would look at Amazon because I get most of my stuff on here, low and behold it is $39.00 I mean you can not beat it. If you are not sure if you want it you can go to Sephora and smell it, if you love it buy it here, not only will it be free shipping but you will save money, and who doesn&#x27;t like that!</li>
    <li> Warm fragrance that both of you will enjoy. Like warm cotton candy, but better. Elegant bottle.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this and let me just say I am very happy I purchased this....it&#x27;s just the most amazing delicious smell ever and the dry down is wonderful I sprayed it this morning at 8 am and its now 1pm and still going. Its by no means over powering just very delightful. I have the other lolita lempicka in the apple shaped bottle and love it....but this is even better!</li>
    <li> I sampled this sent on a recent trip to Paris.  I didn&#x27;t purchase it there because it was a bit expensive for me in Euros so I decided to try to find it in the US.  I am so happy I did.  It is even more amazing than I remember.  It&#x27;s sweet and spicy, and I love it.  I probably should have purchased 2 because Im sure I will be wearing this everyday!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample with a perfume purchase while in Paris awhile back.  I have been using it when I travel and recently ran out.  I wasn&#x27;t aware that there were many different names for this perfume and it is sort of difficult to differentiate between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE this perfume! i want to wear it every day of the rest of my life. I am not sure what it is about it, but i LOVE It!  it is long lasting, has a clean smell, and an attractive bottle (it took awhile to figure out where the spray comes out).  i hope they never quit making this!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely fragrance.  I was looking for something similar to the original Evening in Paris fragrance.  This is similar in that it is soft, sensual and sweet, but not too sweet, and not flowery.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering.  People don&#x27;t smell me before they see me when I am wearing L De Lolita Lempicka (which is usually).  But, when people hug me, they almost always say, \\&quot;mmmmm, you smell so good!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Item is exactly what I wanted.  I&#x27;ve used this perfume before and it&#x27;s not real easy to find.</li>
    <li> Another favorite!  I like to wear it for romantic dinners, but it would be nice even for day wear.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! My husband leaned in close and said, &#x27;Wow! Is that you?&#x27; It&#x27;s not too strong like the Si Lolita, it drys down to a slightly earthy vanilla, almost like a vanilla pipe tobacco. It&#x27;s sweet and soothing. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this scent along with a bottle of Lolita Lempicka.  It is a lighter scent than the original Lempicka, has a more salty vanilla smell to it along with underlying notes which I can&#x27;t describe.  Its not musky or overpowering.  If you like a lighter scent which smells sweet but not too sweet or cloying this is for you.  I can smell the vanilla more than anything else.  I&#x27;m not a big vanilla person but with the other scents in this it is very beautiful and sensual.  Definitely a day perfume though.  I highly recommend it.  Sorry if my description is not very good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this expecting the orange carton and blue bottle, but what was shipped to me was not the vanilla scented dream I know and love.  It&#x27;s a flowery disgusting scent and now I can&#x27;t return it.  I will not be recommending this purchase to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a perfume person, I&#x27;ve always just did scented body lotions or body sprays. This perfume just smells great though, its light and refreshing and sweet smelling. I have asthma and I can wear this with no problem. The price is a great deal too.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this perfume I was excited to order it and at such a great price. Arrived super fast and WOW! I love the scent, the bottle is gorgeous too! It will be a must have for me in the future.</li>
    <li> No longer making this fragrance, so was worried about scent being old.  It is perfect!  Desperately wish Lolita Lempicka still made the fragrance my daughter loves on me...calls it my &amp;#34;cookie dough&amp;#34; perfume.  Very layered scent, depth is amazing.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances and the nose behind it is the incomparable Maurice Roucel. It is rich and delicious with a little bit of a citrusy opening and a divine mix of vanilla, amber, musc, and immortelle.</li>
    <li> Love this scent!  It  is hard to see where the perfume sprays out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this scent for years and now that sephora stopped selling it, found it here and very happy I did</li>
    <li> The fragrance is absolutely wonderful.  Subtle and rather powdery, but does not last on me like I wish it would.  Could be my chemical makeup.</li>
    <li> My review is for the parfum that was purchased at a department store, not the seller on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Before I had a baby, I thought it was a great, very feminine, although very sweet fragrance. I used it occasionally and only in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;After I had the baby, I still like the way it smells, however, it gave me a migraine every time I wore it. So, now I have a full bottle that is never used.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too sweet and cloying!</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent. Every person (male or female) that comes near can not resist telling me how good I smell. It makes me feel so sensual. Its the best fragrance I have ever worn and worth every dollar.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents but disappointed when bottle started leaking perfume from the top so probably just cheaply made. Didn&#x27;t return it since sprayer still works and I just keep the bottle on a small plate so it doesn&#x27;t ruin my dresser</li>
    <li> kinda reminds me of that avon lady type of smell. like when you go to church and there are too many old fashioned strong perfumes in one place and you get nauseated. sorry l de lolita. :(</li>
    <li> I love this perfume..... Its light and work friendly and something I reach for reguarly. I have received many compliments on it from both men and women.</li>
    <li> I am hesitant to say, but this is the most amazing smelling perfume ever. I would rather be the only one on the planet who gets to smell this good, but suppose that would be unfair!</li>
    <li> Smells...amazing. &amp; very unique &amp; sophisticated. Smells like a mixture of lemons,vanilla, and something else I cannot put my finger on. Imagine being on an enchanted island with mermaids and fairies. The bottle is very beautiful too.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to receive my new perfume from lolita lempicka it was delivered today and I have to say it smells pretty good but a little bit to sweet. I would much rather return it but unfortunetly I cannot which kind of upsets me. So I guess im going to have to keep it and spray a tiny bit everytime I use it.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!! Everyone asks me what perfume I am wearing everywhere I go because they love it too!!</li>
    <li> Muy bueno, para que la mujer quede con un olor y una fragancia muy agradable y seductora para el hombre mayor</li>
    <li> I bought this product and I&#x27;m pretty sure its a knock off. I&#x27;m now stuck with this huge bottle of fake product. I don&#x27;t wear it because the smell is not the normal smell. I threw away money on this! :(</li>
