      <li>buy-2  don&#x27;t be like me and buy -1 and wished you would of purchased more .</li>
      <li>And was ok for the price.</li>
      <li>When applied before workout i def.get alot more sweat.</li>
      <li>I always think that alot of these types of firming creams helps and is better than nothing some are better than others though.</li>
      <li>maybe a couple more weeks</li>
      <li>This one is more like a bengay sensation but still like it.  </li>
      <li>Those who claim it does work are probably just seeing the effects of exercise and healthy eating habits instead.</li>
      <li>they always send me along with my purchase a sample cream which is lovely:).</li>
      <li>One night I was browsing on amazon for a product that was able to help me with cellulite issues and I came across this product.</li>
      <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to love it.</li>
      <li>Love the line</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a week now and am already noticing smooth thighs!</li>
      <li>and I am satisfied - it works!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>it seals it in more</li>
      <li>which makes it even more tingly</li>
      <li>It sure does give you the cooing effect,</li>
      <li>I am using this item with a waist trimmer, and it makes me sweat more in the area</li>
      <li>Works like magic.</li>
      <li>It works better than the ones you buy at the store.</li>
      <li>:)&lt;</li>
      <li>I have weighed in at 210 for two or more years.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>So i have not been able to use it.</li>
      <li>I have seen a drastic change in the amount of cellulite on my thighs, and i have more defined muscle tone as well as smoother skin on my legs and stomach.</li>
      <li>I could notice better results using this slimming lotion.</li>
      <li>The lotion smells okay and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I spend the $.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve found the sunless tanner to have more of a impact on minimizing the appearance of cellulite than this.  </li>
      <li>As a lotion is ok but slimming nope.</li>
      <li>it increases more my appetite.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see more results on my thighs.</li>
      <li>I love this anti-cellulite serum.</li>
      <li>Works really fast and is very effective.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> really fast delivery and a good size for the price. feels really tingly and cooling after you put it on, havnt had it long enough to see a huge difference but the caffeine should do the job.</li>
    <li> I liked this product very much really helped me with what i wanted it for would recommend this product to any one thank you</li>
    <li> I used this product on my arms and noticed a difference right away!  My dimply skin appeared smoother - I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
    <li> Purchased Jan. 21st and I got it Jan. 25th!!!!!! A week faster than the delivery date!!!!! It is bran new, clean, big, and even came with a skin protectant in case of sensitive skin!!!! So happy</li>
    <li> This product is the best for removing cellulite ***</li>
    <li> I place this on after my morning/nightly showers. It smoothes the cellulite look on the back of my thighs, an had greatly diminished so stretch marks, quicker than my Bio-Oil.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I thought &amp;#34;What the heck!&amp;#34; I used lotion religiously and saw no drastic change in appearance. Sadly, I failed for another cream that can&#x27;t take away what the good Lord gave me! 😔</li>
    <li> You start to feel it working right away! Its a good product and I&#x27;m very impressed with it! I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this product! But I&#x27;m happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews I was expecting something good to happen. The first time I used this it was a disappointment.  I have used other firming creams and felt a tightening sensation on my skin, this was just another skin lotion.  Do not waste your money the company does not refund if you are not satisfied.</li>
    <li> love this stuff it has a cooling sensation I wrap my belly then work out its great! worth a try for the price</li>
    <li> I apply this anti-cellulite serum under my thermo capris before exercise. I have definitely noticed a significant reduction in those ugly bumps and dimples via using this serum combined with exercise. In addition, my thighs, buttocks, and hips have slimmed considerably. Only place that has really shown no change with using this serum is in that belly poach I&#x27;ve been trying to lose. Impossible. However, I like this brand so much that I plan to purchase the thermo serum, also. I received a sample of the thermo serum with purchase. Boy, you can actually FEEL the burn using it!  I&#x27;ll continue using both. The price of these are much lower than the competitors and I think these are more effective.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about 2 weeks and so far i have not noticed any changes :(</li>
    <li> Even though I do have a few of my favorite anti cellulite products, I am always on a look out for the one that delivers a miracle. Right, ladies? So I&#x27;ve purchased this one along with the one thermo action one. I have to say that I liked this one better. I could feel the cooling sensation and it almost felt like it&#x27;s penetrating my skin. To get a better feel for these two products I was using each on a different side of the body. After 3 weeks, I can say that I liked this one much better than the other. I could notice better results using this slimming lotion. Using thermal action lotion on the other side, I did not feel any heat or even warming effect. Not sure what everyone is on about. I will probably purchase this product again when I am out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference only purchased once</li>
    <li> Did not show any improvement after daily use morning and night. I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Just got this less than a week ago.  I&#x27;ve lost a little weight on my own, so I&#x27;m not sure if the results I&#x27;m getting are from that or from the serum.  Even if it&#x27;s not from the serum, I love how my skin feels after using this.</li>
    <li> This source is very reliable, everything came on time and I had no trouble with the payment and tracking my package once delivered.</li>
    <li> great product easy to use once I have results i will let you all know just waiting to see how fast it works.</li>
    <li> Great product, love the cooling effect!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion although i don&#x27;t think it has done anything for cellulite. It has a great cooling feel about a minute after application. It also absorbs into my skin nicely.</li>
    <li> I loved this product as well as other eveline cosmetic&#x27;s line the smell is amazing I had a baby about a year ago and I could see and feel a difference within the first 10 days! I would and have recommended to all my friends and family!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was a lite skeptical on spending money on this product but I&#x27;m glad I spend the $. Smell is good. I use it Mostay on my thighs so when I put this on it feels like a tingling sensation. I can&#x27;t wait to see more results on my thighs.</li>
    <li> I really just started to use it. But so far I see a slight improvement on my thighs.</li>
    <li> I am on my second tube of this stuff. I can definitely see a difference.  I use it on my legs and abdomen area.  Highly recommended, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Works really fast and is very effective.  However, exercise is required for better effect. It met my expectations. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the cellulite aspect of this product.  I purchased it (instead of Sweet Sweat) because I wanted something to boost my workouts.  I put this on my stomach and hips and then used a neoprene wrap, ran for 30 minutes on my elliptical and I&#x27;ve NEVER sweat so much before.  I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll help to reduce the trouble areas in my belly, after having a baby things are harder to get rid of.  It smells like menthol and does tingle a little when you first put it on.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cream...you have to work with it, it won&#x27;t do the work for you.  But I plan to continue to use it...to get my sweat on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few of these Slim Extreme products now. I think the red is my favorite because it gets hot.  This one is more like a bengay sensation but still like it.  They are best out of the shower and they feel like they are working.  Not sure if i visually see results but I&#x27;ll probably continue to use.</li>
    <li> I wasted my money on this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working yet or not. I may need to try a second tube.  I didn&#x27;t measure before using it.</li>
    <li> The smell is not so bad, but there is a kinda mentholy smell to it.  I used the product on the hamstrings., I dont see incredible changes but I am willing to stick it through and hope I see some positive changes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a week now and am already noticing smooth thighs! I workout a lot too so that probably helps but before I started using this even all of my workouts wouldn&#x27;t do much to reduce the appearance of my cellulite. It tingles when I put it on. When I wear my tummy tuck it seals it in more which makes it even more tingly and I think more effective. It sometimes feels a bit sticky on my skin at first but it does give my skin a nice glow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m at the end of my first bottle and enjoying it. When I actually use it everyday (which I forget to more than I should) it seems to work pretty well, and I really like the feel of the cooling effect. It arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t read the instructions on the back, because they were not in  English. So i have not been able to use it.</li>
    <li> I believe this is working, combines with exercise and a quick massage! Smells really great and feels really nice too, specially after a hot shower, it feels refreshing :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing to write home about. I still have cellulite and my skin is not any firmer. The lotion smells okay and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It was not &amp;#34;intensely slimming + firming&amp;#34;. I hate it when a beauty product does not do what it says it will. I used up the bottle, but will not purchase again. Just because it did not work for my 40+ year-old thighs, does not mean it will not work for someone else.</li>
    <li> As a lotion is ok but slimming nope. it increases more my appetite. bloating too. so i didnot use it anymore.</li>
    <li> works! Firms skin REALLY well. Didn&#x27;t lose any inches, but still happy.</li>
    <li> I will try this. I am in love with red one, I was reading that this is good cream for summer days. Very fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I ordered this and got it in about 3 days so I&#x27;m very pleased with their shipping rates. :)&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the product. Tbh I loveeee this stuff. I&#x27;ve bought it before but ran out but I began using it again and I&#x27;ve applied it for 2 weeks now and I can really tell the difference. My skin has tightened considerably so I have less cellulite hanging about XD. Additionally, I like the cooling sensation it leaves when u apply it. I usually use this after I shower and before my workouts (ab/core exercises and running). I would definitely buy this again and the bottle lasts a good while as compared to how some other products come in small bottles and run out easily.</li>
    <li> It made me feel tighter and definitely less cellulite but it just felt weird that cold sensation kinda gave anxiety but it would go away after like half an hour I saw a difference for sure but I don&#x27;t like that&amp;#34;cooling sensation&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> With HIGH hopes of eliminating or reducing cellulite, I purchased two tubes, especially after reading other reveiws.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two months and NOTHING has changed.  I&#x27;m even exercising.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.  I will say, after you apply the cream, there is a menthol smell and a cool feeling on your skin which does fade.  Your skin is soft, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I love this anti-cellulite serum. And it seems like it lifts the skin. However, don&#x27;t expect it&lt;br /&gt;to work, if you lay on the sofa all the day. This kind of cosmetic creams work only in complex with&lt;br /&gt;physical training and healthy nutrition.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m the one in my family to buy weird off brand things. The box it came in was so messed up that the UPS man could have taken it if he wanted to. LOL! The actual product was sealed though. About the product: As most cellulite products aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;good smelling&amp;#34;, this one doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. Just very chemical-like. It goes on very easy and absorbs right in! It started to tingle after a few seconds. WASH HANDS! Tip: Take a shower and exfoliate the part of your body you want to tone and then apply this product. It will work ten times better! Promise. I use this on my thighs and lower bottom and on my abs. I have noticed a slight difference in my thighs but haven&#x27;t been consistently working out like I should.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t do anything for cellulite.</li>
    <li> It works alright - not as good as some of the other products I&#x27;ve used.  But there&#x27;s never a quick and easy solution.</li>
    <li> I did notice my cellulite go down.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing .. Works like magic. My sister ordered it and I had to get my own</li>
    <li> I rated this a three because I needed to click a star. Since I am sending the other back I rather not even try this.</li>
    <li> I like the tingling that I feel when I use this, it looks like very little is firming but it really is too soon to really tell, been using for almost a week maybe a little longer I will be able to tell.  Price was not bad and I&#x27;ve spent more for products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> its cooling to the touch. im not sure if it helps with cellulite just yet . used for 1 week.. but smells ok and makes me skin smooth. so bunus.</li>
    <li> I tried this product with and without exercise several times and saw no results. I think it is another scam.</li>
    <li> This burned a bit when i put it on, it tingled.&lt;br /&gt;I never noticed any difference in the cellulite on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;:/ just no patients to use this everyday so I set it aside.</li>
    <li> Love the line but this doesn&#x27;t seem to work</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 days and so far I&#x27;m already starting to see a slight diffrence in my skin texture! I have tried every cream under the sun, I&#x27;m a mother of three and have lost all the baby weight but have still struggles with streatch marks and cellulite. So far I&#x27;m in love with this product!!!</li>
    <li> It did not worked for me as advertised! I won&#x27;t buy it again!</li>
    <li> Smell good but didnt work</li>
    <li> This is the first cellulite cream I ever bought and I was curious how long before I could see results. I start to notice less visible cellulite lines on my upper legs after 2 weeks of use, day and night... I followed that routine, religiously! :) My skin started to look firmer, and I find it more effective using it right after my yoga/pilates sessions to burn fat tissues faster. There is an instant mix of cooling/warm sensation right after applying it over the skin. I&#x27;m very happy this is the first cellulite cream I chose without trying others over the counter.</li>
    <li> so far so gd I can feel wut is n tis slim extreme I hope it wrks az gd az it feels i like a lot thanx</li>
    <li> I have been trying to lose weight and get rid of my cellulite, which was veryyy bad. I used this cream along with diet and exercise (5x/week), and of course lots of water. This product really does work, and you feel it working instantly, like penetrating in your skin, its like a tingly cooling feeling. I apply it before i workout, and it makes you sweat a lot as well. I have seen a drastic change in the amount of cellulite on my thighs, and i have more defined muscle tone as well as smoother skin on my legs and stomach. Very happy, and i will purchase again. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have had cellulite most of my adult life. I have firmed my body but the cellulite would not go away. I have tried sweat belts but the cellulite did not diminish. I&lt;br /&gt;have used this product for a month and there is noticeable difference in the firmness of my skin. Thanks for a product that really works. I have been able to wear clothes that wouldn&#x27;t fit because of the cellulite, but now they fit. This product works.</li>
    <li> Wow.. I am so happy with this product it came so fast. Thi is my first day using it and it smells devine.. I will post in week to tell you my results!!!! And the size OMG!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for one week (twice a day). Works great in my stomach area. The thigh area doesn&#x27;t work that good but I am still waiting for a surprise.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for two weeks and it looks like it is working. It works better than the ones you buy at the store. I will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> I am using this item with a waist trimmer, and it makes me sweat more in the area applied. I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days so I cant see a true result yet.</li>
    <li> OMG!&lt;br /&gt; Try using this product after working out and taking a shower, I sweat so much, it burns!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if my cellulite will go away but the heat definitely works.</li>
    <li> this product is okay. i thought i would see a little results.</li>
    <li> I will admit, this product has a VERY powerful cooling effect.  It&#x27;s like rubbing menthol lotion on your skin.  It can make your eyes water and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite, but I was using it on fatty areas to see if it would have a difference.  I did not notice a difference in my fat, as I&#x27;d hoped, but it did make my skin very soft.  It also really cooled my skin down during a workout so I didn&#x27;t feel overheated.  If you want to have a nice cool sensation while working out, then you will like this.  I just don&#x27;t know if it will help you lose any cellulite or fat.</li>
    <li> I really like this line of creams, Hot sensation on skin is very pleasant. Good before exercise, after shower or in sauna to get that extra water out of your body.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work.it smells like ben gay. product shouldn&#x27;t promote smoothing of celluite,such a crock, whoever came up with product appraently doesnt have cellulite. i should know better than to order such a product that reads for suckers!!!!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Slim Extreme 3D Intensely Slimming + Firming&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product! This is my second time buying it. Am in love with all Eveline products, unique and elegant, the smell is refreshing, the bottle looks fancy. great deal for the price and delivered on time. they always send me along with my purchase a sample cream which is lovely:). I use it 2 times a day, preferably after shower. My skin is much firmer and cellulite is defiantly reduced! Of course with a good work out and low-calorie diet. I am more confident about my body since I start using this amazing, high quality cream.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over a year. It works wonderfully in making my skin less dimpled due to weight loss. It does not help weight loss but my &amp;#34;hanging skin&amp;#34; has been firmed-up after weight loss It has helped me to lose about 1/4 inch in my tummy and buttocks per week. I use it four times per week. Slim Extreme works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I always think that alot of these types of firming creams helps and is better than nothing some are better than others though.This one 1st off came in a pump bottle instead of the picture of the squeeze tube.Which i like anyways so that was a plus.And the seller gave me a coupon on future oders which again was a plus.1st off the this is like a light serum lotion that soaks in fast which again i like because i usually put my regular lotion on top.It has alittle cooling feel to it.Not much though and no heat.Which to some people matters.When applied before workout i def.get alot more sweat.After my workout i really dont like to apply this one.I rather apply one that has the cooling and heat to it.(it really feels better after an intense workout plus i feel like its working in the skin faster.)Anyways ive been trying to use this as much as possiable its been over 30days now.I always use it after my shower which is every day but after about 2 and 1/2 wks stopped after my workouts and @ night.So really once a day 2wks and the 1st 2 wks was using it 2-3 times a day.Every 3 days i would measure myself (before i ate,after i used the bathroom,after workouts,and naked)and noticed the hip area and belly area it really helped in.Now when i say helped i mean like .2,.5 etc. never a whole inch or anything but unless i change my diet i really dont think that number would change.But my skin feels firmer and i will use it tell its gone.And was ok for the price.But i personally will not buy again.</li>
    <li> works effective if used twice a day! but label is un readable. WORKS GREAT, LOVE IT, BUY IT! (:&lt;br /&gt;CATHERINE (:</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t make any substantial difference. I tried it for 2 weeks but I finally put it on my bathroom counter with the rest of my opened lotion bottles to be forgotten.</li>
    <li> I use this for tummy wraps. I place a generous amount and cover my stomach with plastic wrap. I have seen a difference and lost inches from my belly.</li>
    <li> I have been using and I think after a couple of week with massage everyday and twice a day I lost nearly an inch...it is very good...thanks</li>
    <li> so far has worked pretty good, has a nice cooling affect. is perfect to put on for a work out</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product so i hope it works as well at the thermo active slimming cream does</li>
    <li> Not as good as the 4d lotion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for the last 3 months with absolutely no noticable difference.  It smells like Bengay as well.  So basically, if you want to smell like an old lady and still have cellulite, use this product.  NO topical cream can reduce cellulite.  If you want to reduce cellulite, only diet and exercise can actually make a difference.  I feel like an idiot for falling for the hype...might as well throw the money in the street.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.. I finish the bottle, doing exercise, diet but still no effect. Won&#x27;t buy again&lt;br /&gt; 😧😥</li>
    <li> I received my order in the mail on 4/30/2012, started using it that day. But before I did, I took measurements of myself to see exactly where I was at. On 4/30/2012, I measured in at 42 inches around the waist and 210 in lbs. Okay this morning when I woke up, I measured my waistline yet again and it is down to 39 inches and my weight is down to 204, and today&#x27;s date is 5/4/2012. Prior to using Slim Extreme 3d, I had already began to alter my diet somewhat. I cut out sodas of any sort, I still eat what I want but in moderation (less desserts though), I drink plenty of water. I still drink tea (the herbal kind, caffeine free), and maybe a little juice. Before I started using this product my weight remained at a stand still no matter what I did. I have weighed in at 210 for two or more years. I could just not loose the weight. With results like this, I plan to reorder. I am 5&#x27;6\\&quot; in height and I should be weighing at least 60 lbs less. Oh yeah, I have not been exercising at all other than what I do at work and normal household chores and I am still seeing results. Everyone&#x27;s body is different, what may not work for some will work for others. I read all the reviews while waiting on my order to arrive, and see the product did not work for all who used it in the past. Well it has worked for me and I am going to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m soo excited to use this , hopefully the results are amazing.</li>
    <li> It does NOT help you lose weight by reducing fatty tissue, but, it is excellent for help with cellulite and stretch marks and shhhh, even some scars. Lol. All in all, I really like this product. It really does help firm and sculpt your body. Now if only it could really help you lose weight I would give it a five star. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a week now and w/in the first 2 days I felt smoothness over all areas that I applied this cream to. I am 33 yrs old and noticed very small signs of cellulite around thighs and under my buttocks so I purchased this for those reasons as well as preventative ones.  Do I notice a decrease on cellulite previously seen? This early? SLIGHTLY I do....so yes I will continue to purchase this product.  I would have given 5* but it&#x27;s just too early. (Smoothness however is 5* and better than any lotions purchased w/hopes of the same silky smooth result )!!</li>
    <li> I like product , has a slight warming effect . Great to use while walking. If you decide to buy this product buy-2  don&#x27;t be like me and buy -1 and wished you would of purchased more .</li>
    <li> I got this item because it helped with cellulite,I started using the product as soon as I got it,I hate cellulite and wanted it gone before it got worse so I thought I would try this product to see how it worked, I used a couple others but didn&#x27;t work all that well and I can say after using this I will buy again for sure, I love it!  I have a friend that has it really bad and I will recommend it to her and anyone else that&#x27;s looking for a cellulite/slimming product..When you use this product you should also expect to sweat alot! It is really good to use when you are planning on working out! since using this product I have lost about 3 inches and I have also lost about 5 pounds,I started losing inches and weight pretty much as soon as I got the item that was less then a month ago..</li>
    <li> I really liked the price, not overly expensive and comes in a large bottle, compared to the other products you get barley 2oz for a small fortune. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now, and I see a change in my skin, my thighs appear tighter and less bumpy where the cellulite areas are. Over all I like everything about this.</li>
    <li> i was kind of lazy these days , so , i did not keep using it everyday , but i feels good than the spicy ones</li>
    <li> i decide to give this a try because of some good reviews and boy do i regret it...it does not work period..........wont buy ever again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in combination with exercise, diet, and occasional sunless tanner.  On a very positive side, this serum helps skin feel very smooth and soft.  Definitely noticed a difference there.  However, I&#x27;ve found the sunless tanner to have more of a impact on minimizing the appearance of cellulite than this.  I have felt some difference in firmness, but not confident it&#x27;s due to this product, or the difference in diet and exercise.  Also, after application, it remains sticky for a long time.  I like the cooling effect.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this online and we&#x27;ll see how it goes. I supposed to receive this item by tomorrow so I&#x27;ll give an update about this product after usage. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 06/06/2013 and I want to give you guys an update about this lotion. Well... I am very satisfied with the results. I mean, I don&#x27;t just rely on this lotion that it will gonna do a magic but it really worked for me after using this product for couple of days. Application of course base on the instruction of the product and a healthy balance diet giving me the best results. I like this product a lot! I bought three kinds of lotion under this brand and what I can only say is, keep up the great work of putting this out the  market. It is really a big hit! it&#x27;s affordable and effective. :) Good luck</li>
    <li> While this product does make my skin very soft and the cooling effect is nice, it does not give the results it claims to reduce the appearance of cellulite. Those who claim it does work are probably just seeing the effects of exercise and healthy eating habits instead. Would maybe buy just as a regular lotion. Don&#x27;t expect much else from it.</li>
    <li> I used the thermal one with no results, I saw this and figured I would give it a try.  I am not even halfway through the tube but it works wonderfully!! It works so well I ordered 2 more tubes.  I tried a lot of different products over the years but have never found anything like this!</li>
    <li> I too bought this product based on the reviews, it&#x27;s a waste of money. Does absolutely NOTHING!! and I mean !!NOTHING!! yes it has a cool tingling sensation and that is it, OH! it smells pretty good as well. I bought 2 of them. I will give you my 2nd one for free just contact me. I should have listen to the other negative review, they were correct. I use things exactly as it directs, no deviations. Don&#x27;t waste your money, just exercise and change your diet. Oh and it didn&#x27;t come in a pump either.</li>
    <li> Will not purchase again. I did not see a difference.</li>
    <li> I usually use the thermo heat one, but decided to give this cooling spa one a try. It sure does give you the cooing effect, especiay if you apply it after a warm shower you will really feel the cooling. Overall I prefer the thermo heat one instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item long time and I am satisfied - it works!&lt;br /&gt;But you have to massage it on twice a day every day! smells freshly and cools your body, be careful not to rub it in your eyes&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
    <li> I was surprised that the product was from Poland.  Makes me question the ingredients and if they&#x27;ve been approved for use in the US.  I used it twice, got a rash both times.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t request a return in time, and now I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t slim or firm for me, but I liked the scent and the feel as it was applied.  Basically, just a kind of expensive lotion.</li>
    <li> I received the pump bottle rather than a tube.  I prefer the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived ahead of the projected schedule.  It seems to work.  I see a little definition forming after only 3 days of use.  If it continues to work this way I&#x27;m going to love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and I like the cooling sensation, especially in the summer.</li>
    <li> This lotion/serum is pretty good.  within a week a noticed the firming. it has a strong smell but that wears off.  Its also a great moisturizer.  seemed to outlast any lotion i&#x27;ve used.  And i did use after showers.  best i can describe is it resembles putting icy-hot on your skin.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these products! I have seen so much improvement in my skin!</li>
    <li> The skin on my thighs feels very soft and smooth when using this product.  I like the mentholated feel you get when you first put it on.  I just wanted to try this in addition to the exercises I do.</li>
    <li> I like this cooling version vs. the thermal effect one. I have been using this for a few months, it is not a miracle, but noticed it is does have some smoothing effect.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ll been useing slim extreme 3d intensely for only 1 week now and haven&#x27;t seem any real change..like weigh loss inch or firming toneing tighing of my skin around my abdomen and thighs area..maybe a couple more weeks maybe i&#x27; ll will start seeing some kind of change in my  skin tighting up and firming up or tone.surely&amp;#34; hope so..</li>
    <li> I will never ever again purchase any of these products. They&#x27;re waste of money and they do not do anything. I have been using this for five months now and I could see no difference at all. It is a rip off. Please do not waste your money on that crap!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Okay, you have to use it constantly to see the change.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this product for over two weeks and I see results. my cellulite in my legs has been reduced about 50%, my skin looks tighter, I&#x27;m getting rid of some stretch marks on my arms but it seems that it takes longer for the arms to get some results. Have in mind that i go to the gym 4 to 5 days a week.</li>
    <li> First of all, i got the wrong thing and second of all, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.. waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> really works , I love it</li>
    <li> it smooth and tone the skin but after I used few of them I can&#x27;t see a difference and my cellulite has not diminished</li>
    <li> It worked pretty well. Did notice a difference in my legs. Used it before working out. You have to work out to see a difference like I did. My legs look pretty good. I can wear shorts with confidence.  Will purchase again</li>
    <li> One night I was browsing on amazon for a product that was able to help me with cellulite issues and I came across this product. It was the best thing I ever did to myself. I used it every single morning and night as described on the directions and this product worked pretty well on my skin. Not only were the cellulite smoothing out I also noticed my stretch marks were diminishing as well. It left my skin feeling extremely radiant</li>
    <li> it was wrong one but still use it</li>
    <li> I ordered two tubes.  I used them both, and don&#x27;t see a bit of difference.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Just got it hopefully it works</li>
    <li> I love this cream it works wonders</li>
    <li> Already seeing results after using twice daily for about a week!! Arrived within days of ordering!! Very, very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> I got this just 2 days ago so I can&#x27;t talk about results but I can say it smells great and it feels like it burns something! So let&#x27;s see what happens. Will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. It has helped reduce my cellulite, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it has helped with my belly fat (I don&#x27;t have a lot, but it has reduced it, in my opinion). It is very cool, so putting it on right after a hot shower feels really nice, and the coolness lasts for quite a while. It seems like it&#x27;s a moisturizer as well, as it made my skin very smooth! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> al primer dia se siente la piel mucho mas suave, aunque en la disminución de las estrias no he notado mucho cambio</li>
    <li> It improves the appearance of cellulite that means it won&#x27;t remove it but it ll make you skin tighter and softer looking which will create the illusion of firm and not so uneven skin.</li>
    <li> I think this product works a treat if you&#x27;re trying to lose weight by exercise at the same time. It helps firm up skin and the tingling assures you its working.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for two weeks, but my skin tone is much more even immediately after use. Also, the cooling effect is definitely there and it intensifies after a shower. I am still looking out for more toned skin and less cellulite, but I have high hopes for this product.</li>
    <li> I had a severe allergic reaction to this product and it did nothing but feel cold I feel stupid for even thinking that this would work</li>
</ol>
