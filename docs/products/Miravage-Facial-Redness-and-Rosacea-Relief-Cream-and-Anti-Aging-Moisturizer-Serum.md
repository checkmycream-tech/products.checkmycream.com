      <li>but it is very moisturizing and smells pleasant</li>
      <li>What I like about Miravage: the serum has a pleasant citrus scent that isn&#x27;t too strong and doesn&#x27;t linger; it feels good on my skin and is soothing and calming immediately as I apply it; it absorbs nicely and dries matte, keeping my face moisturized without becoming greasy or shiny, which has been a problem for me with other products.</li>

      <li>Excited about continued results.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light, and evaporates quickly.  </li>
      <li>I was offered an opportunity to test the product at a discount in exchange for my true review.</li>
      <li>It has a very light citrus scent, moisturizes without feeling oily and leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>The next day, she told me that this serum is amazing.</li>

      <li>It is literally worth</li>

      <li>The redness has subsided nicely, and no new breakouts in weeks.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a huge difference, but it is a light lotion that goes on easily with a light fragrance too.</li>

      <li>It seems to be transforming my skin for the better - less red, smoother, more even.</li>
      <li>I am really liking this serum.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this serum for about two weeks and really like it.</li>
      <li>This serum is very lightweight, but also very hydrating.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ready to order again, and the price has increased $10.  </li>
      <li>She loves the texture and the feeling, it smells very soothing too.</li>
      <li>This product works better than the other serums I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I have a mild case of Rosacea and this definitely reduces redness in my cheeks.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my mom, and so far she has had positive reviews.</li>
      <li>I have large pores, adult acne and redness that travels around my face like a circus.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t have a sticky or wet feeling but rather a smooth silky one.</li>
      <li>She looks more glowing, her skin looks brighten and firm.</li>
      <li>The traveling red patches have retired, and my skin is finally calm and clear.  </li>
      <li>It is very soft too.</li>
      <li>It soaked into my skin very well and dried quickly.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no reaction or breakouts from it.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my face really soft.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for tighter, younger looking skin as well as those who like me, are seeking a simple solution for smaller and more refined pores.</li>
      <li>My 6 month old yorkie loves to smell my face and give me kisses in the morning.</li>
      <li>I stopped using it and everything went back to normal.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using Miravage twice a day for about three weeks.  I have subtype-2 Rosacea, and this product has noticeably reduced facial redness, and my pores appear smaller.  Breakouts are greatly reduced, as well.  The expensive prescriptions my dermatologist gave me couldn&#x27;t do that!  I am very happy with Miravage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using 2x daily and this stuff is awesome. My skin is glowing and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Started working after just 2 days. Thank you</li>
    <li> So far I love it, I see that my face seems clearer and softer. I love the way it looks with my makeup.</li>
    <li> This product works better than the other serums I&#x27;ve tried.  It is a nice consistency and wears well under tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great smooth texture fantastic light sent.  Makes my skin feel fabulous</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! Not too heavy or greasy...  Just the right consistency.  I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no reaction or breakouts from it.  I&#x27;ve also noticed less redness in my skin tone.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell its effectiveness but it is very moisturizing and smells pleasant</li>
    <li> this works awesome according to a friend...who I purchased it for</li>
    <li> So far this is the only anti-redness product I have tried that actually works. It seems to be transforming my skin for the better - less red, smoother, more even. I am less red all the time, not just after using the lotion. It has a nice light scent and absorbs easily. I am thrilled with this product and would recommend anyone with redness concerns to try it.  Even if you don&#x27;t have redness concerns, you should try it!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a huge difference, but it is a light lotion that goes on easily with a light fragrance too.</li>
    <li> Love this product! This bottle is super sexy and tall. I love when a company puts their product in a great package that I can leave out on the counter. This is a good sized bottle for this product. The serum is more of a cream and comes out of the bottle easily thought the pump. It has a pleasant light scent and goes on smoothly. It soaked into my skin very well and dried quickly. It didn&#x27;t have a sticky or wet feeling but rather a smooth silky one. I&#x27;ve begun to use it in my daily routine. I&#x27;m a fan of this and love the product.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this serum.  It leaves my face really soft.  I can&#x27;t say that I have been using it long enough to see any anti-aging or anti-wrinkle benefits.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It calms my skin and began reducing redness after only a week of use; it is also beginning to lighten age spots on my face and hands (since it was working on my face I started using it on the backs of my hands). What I like about Miravage: the serum has a pleasant citrus scent that isn&#x27;t too strong and doesn&#x27;t linger; it feels good on my skin and is soothing and calming immediately as I apply it; it absorbs nicely and dries matte, keeping my face moisturized without becoming greasy or shiny, which has been a problem for me with other products. I am optimistic about good  results over time and I plan to introduce Miravage to friends.  Update 4/22/15  See Photos!  Amazing results!</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and goes on smooth.  Leaves my face looking fresh all day.  Controls my dry patches.  And I have only been using this product for a week!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks now and I just love how it is making my skin feel and look!  It has reduced a lot of redness in my skin and the fine lines I have around my eyes and lips are softer - almost like they have been evened out.  The scent of the serum is very pleasant to me - just a light citrus scent - very gently invigorating.  The serum is just the right consistency - not too runny and it absorbs quickly without leaving any oily residue behind.  I love this product and will use it for many years to come!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks and so far my skin is so soft. I have not noticed any &amp;#34;age rewind&amp;#34; but that may be due to the limited amount of time I&#x27;ve been using this product. Overall, a great light moisturizer. I have sensitive skin, multiple allergies and rosacea and have had nothing but great results this far. I will update my review after using this at one month.</li>
    <li> While at 25 years old, I may not be in the typical age group of other users of this product, I bought with high hope of reducing the size of my pores as well as restore a natural balance to my face. Within minutes of me using this serum, I immediately felt a tightness, smoothness, and saw an overall complexion improvement. It&#x27;s been a couple of days since I&#x27;ve received this product and I can already see and feel a huge difference. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for tighter, younger looking skin as well as those who like me, are seeking a simple solution for smaller and more refined pores.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom, and so far she has had positive reviews.</li>
    <li> Anti-aging creams are predominantly moisturizer-based cosmetically skin care products</li>
    <li> Very Effective.. Thank you!</li>
    <li> A light-weight cream for the face and neck...  Let me begin by saying I have horrible skin.  I have large pores, adult acne and redness that travels around my face like a circus.  I have a drawer full of face creams claiming to &#x27;make me look younger&#x27;, with Olay being my &#x27;go to&#x27; when the rest fail.  Many of them make my skin worse, and irritate the already red patches.  This cream is different.  The redness has subsided nicely, and no new breakouts in weeks.  The fragrance is light, and evaporates quickly.  The lightness of the cream feels good on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t clog my already large pores.  I don&#x27;t know if I look any younger, but my skin has definitely improved.  I will continue to use the Miravage daily, and update this review with any improvements or disappointments.  Stay tuned...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 7 weeks later...  I just ordered my second bottle of the Miravage Anti-Aging Serum.  The fact that I&#x27;ve ordered 2 bottles should say enough, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve found the creamy goodness found in this little package to be a small miracle.  The traveling red patches have retired, and my skin is finally calm and clear.  The constant struggle to find a product that my face will tolerate is over.  Kudos to the Miravage team...  You hit a home run with this one!&lt;br /&gt;I am not affiliated with this company, nor have I been asked or paid to review this product.  I&#x27;m simply a satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;m ready to order again, and the price has increased $10.  That is aggressive, in my opinion.  I may have to rethink this...</li>
    <li> Nice anti aging moisturizer. Skin feels good after application. Dispenses from a pump. Absorbs well. Not sticky or greasy. 1oz bottle. I&#x27;ll need to continue use to better judge it&#x27;s antiaging benefits, but so far it seems to give me more of a glow.  Excited about continued results.</li>
    <li> It broke my face out really bad.  I do not have acne problems, however after using this product, I developed awful huge pimples.  I stopped using it and everything went back to normal.</li>
    <li> Great product! If your looking for a great anti-aging cream/serum give this product a try</li>
    <li> I have used this for almost two weeks now. Am seeing results around eyes and mouth. The smoothness of this is amazing. Such a small bit goes a long way. The smell of this is light and citrus. My 6 month old yorkie loves to smell my face and give me kisses in the morning. I am pleased with this product and cannot wait to see the results over the next two weeks!</li>
    <li> Loving this serum/cream. Feels nice and light weight and I don&#x27;t feel the need to add another moisturizer before applying my make up. The smell is pleasent so that&#x27;s a bonus! Just turned 31 so let&#x27;s see if it can turn back time</li>
    <li> I love this serum. My skin feels soft, smooth, and hydrated. I love the fact that this product line is fragrance free! This serum is very lightweight, but also very hydrating. This could be used by itself as a moisturizer in warmer months. I have somewhat sensitive skin but mainly purchased this because it was fragrance free. Product provided for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I was offered an opportunity to test the product at a discount in exchange for my true review. The bottle is so pretty. I gave it to my coworker, a woman just turns 70, to try on her birthday. The next day, she told me that this serum is amazing. She loves the texture and the feeling, it smells very soothing too. A week later, I could see a big great change on her face. She looks more glowing, her skin looks brighten and firm. It is very soft too. Her husband even noticed the change. We both think that this product is amazing and very nice. She can&#x27;t wait to see more improvement on her face. She plans to buy some for her daughter to use too. Great serum! You won&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> removes the red out of my cheeks. it makes my skin nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*DISCLAIMER: I purchased this specific product at a discount. This review contains my honest and unbiased feedback. All thoughts/opinions are my own entirely. Everything written above is the result of my time testing the product and my personal opinion on it. I have no affiliation with this brand or company; The product was simply purchased and received by me as a tester. Thank you for reading, I hope I helped you make an informed decision. :)</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product because I&#x27;ve been searching for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my Rosacea flare up.  I love this stuff!  Not only does it keep my skin from drying out, but it also appears to be smoothing the lines a little bit too.  Bonus!  No Rosacea problems at all, no break outs and it has a pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t linger.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have a mild case of Rosacea and this definitely reduces redness in my cheeks. I also love the smell and it feels great on the skin. The only negative is that I&#x27;m nearly sure this is giving me a couple pimples around the mouth area... but the benefits for me definitely outweigh the cons, and I&#x27;ll be sure to order again.</li>
    <li> makes skin super soft - good moisterizer</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about two weeks and really like it. It has a very light citrus scent, moisturizes without feeling oily and leaves skin feeling soft. Perfect moisturizer for under makeup. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Miravage is as good as it gets ... I don&#x27;t know what they put in here, but you will never use another anti-aging serum. It has worked wonders on my skin, making it smoother and more evenly-toned. It is literally worth it&#x27;s weight in gold, so anything cheaper than 1 ounce of gold&#x27;s value is a bargain :-)</li>
