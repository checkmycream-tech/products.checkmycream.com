      <li>I love the blast of pepper in the opening, but the drydown is the same old same old.  </li>
      <li>Do NOT wear this in the winter unless you live in the bahamas for the winter or in a climate hot enough to merit the name, THE SUN!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but, not what I expected based on posted reviews.   </li>
      <li>I like the masculine smell of it</li>
      <li>Not that it smells like the beach, but when I wear this I can imagine being submerged in the cold, blue waters of the north pacific ocean with dolphins doing backflips around me and a blue whale giving me a high five b/c I smell so good.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using coolwater for some time, and tried Armani Code and some other fragrances. However, I ordered this one on Amazon and it&#x27;s definitely by far the best EDT that i&#x27;ve ever tried. It gives a light and refreshing smell, which is also very pleasant. It is a pleasant smell that you want a fragrance to give......</li>
    <li> Product is just ok. You can tell it&#x27;s of quality ingredients, I suppose? Understand, I&#x27;m not a big cologne guy and have never purchased a scent on line based on just reviews, and I won&#x27;t again!   My ofactory is well developed and acute. I know what smells good/manly and what doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s a bit too feminine for me...It&#x27;s not bad, but, not what I expected based on posted reviews.   If your unfamiliar w/ a scent, take the time and hit the dept store before you buy, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful product in the men&#x27;s fragrance aisle. The bottle&#x27;s elegant shape and the color of the cologne seduced me into spraying it on myself. Oh my word! It smells like boiled cabbage with an overtone of cat urine. I thought I was going to have to cut my arm off if I couldn&#x27;t find soap and water. And it wasn&#x27;t just me. My daughter and her friends agreed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it for the bottle. But don&#x27;t dare let a drop out.</li>
    <li> I love the blast of pepper in the opening, but the drydown is the same old same old.  It is definitely a great spring/ summer fragrance. Do NOT wear this in the winter unless you live in the bahamas for the winter or in a climate hot enough to merit the name, THE SUN!</li>
    <li> Hello first of all please excuse my bad english, i am from Austria. But lets go to the facts! This fragrance is great,  for me it was love on the first sniff!     First time i have experience it, it was through a specimen in a Mens Health magazin, after i have experienced the armona i knew i have to have it.     Since then ( this was about 2 Years ago or longer) this is my favorit fragrance. I cant explain it but i just adore it.     Try it for yourselve and you will see it is a great fragance, it is not sweet its smells.... its smells... just like a man should smell.   Besides my GF like it too, she also bought me one. :)</li>
    <li> At one of the highest prices for cologne, you would think Bulgari would get it right, but not so with this product.  The smell is heavy on musk and unpleasant unlike the original Bulgari for men.  Plus the bottle will not even stand upright.  Bulgari may think that is fancy, but it is just plain dumb!</li>
    <li> The ladies love it. I get complimented ALL the time, and i&#x27;m not even that great looking, lol.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> The bottle of Bvlgari Aqva looked really cool sitting on it&#x27;s little stand so I gave it smell and sprayed it on my wrists. It smelled very lovely. It has a salty, oceanic smell. It smells very fresh and reminds me of going to the beach. Not that it smells like the beach, but when I wear this I can imagine being submerged in the cold, blue waters of the north pacific ocean with dolphins doing backflips around me and a blue whale giving me a high five b/c I smell so good. The longevity is pretty good at around 6 or so hours. The product I received was legitimate and it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I just smelt this in In Style magazine and it smells so good!!!</li>
    <li> the scent is amazing and women love it as well.  Proven again and again.  works for me and should work for you</li>
    <li> Hi,  I got my BVLGARI AQVA fragrance today. It smells really nice and fresh, the fragrance do not fade away in few hours. I like the masculine smell of it and I am happy with the purchase. It&#x27;s a great buy, $36 for 100ml against $75 in the malls. I recommend this product from Amazon.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Ok doesn&#x27;t feel like a real cologne but makes you feel fresh and clean.  doesn&#x27;t exactly remind mind you of ocean either but definitely laundry detergent plus some lemon and sweet acidic smell.  I paid [...] for this so it was exceellent buy.  prob wouldn&#x27;t pay more than [...].  It&#x27;s still not my favorite, which is Zegna</li>
    <li> i got bvlgari as a birthday gift and it smells great, tha women LOVE it, i get a grip load of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> With so many positives reviews I thought this cologne would be great. Its just okay. It smells like so many other cheaper colognes (remember aqua velva?) If you want to smell like your dad or grandfather then this may be fine for you. I should have sampled it in a store first. I&#x27;m going back to Hugo Boss no.6, now there is a great smelling cologne that&#x27;s second to none. Hugo will have the girls wanting to hug you just to get a whiff of this marvelous scent. This Bvlgari however will have you running away from yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  It has a very fresh scent.  Not musky or flowery but fresh.  My sons like it too.  I recommend this fragrance for men of all ages.</li>
    <li> I use to not wear cologne, but I was shopping for women&#x27;s perfume as a gift a few years ago. So I asked a woman to give me her opinion on women&#x27;s scents. After a while, I started looking at men&#x27;s just to waste time. She went straight to this fragrance and said you cant go wrong with this one. Five years later, this is the only thing I wear, unless I&#x27;m around only men. Women love this stuff. Every single time I wear it, I get compliments. I was in a crowded restaurant just this past weekend, and walked thru the waiting customers. Every woman in line did a double take and gave me \\&quot;the look\\&quot;. Even a server there walked past me and said, D_mn, you smell good\\&quot;. This is the 1. a good runner up for general purpose is Usher for Men.</li>
    <li> Ordered it on a Monday, received it Saturday that same week.  My favorite cologne now and I will definitely be buying another one for the holidays!</li>
    <li> Cologne smells great!! The scent stays on you all day long and isn&#x27;t overwhelming. It became my favorite fragrance instantly.</li>
