### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a great product!  </li>
      <li>Perfect for dental emergencies while hiking and traveling.</li>
      <li>tweezers are not the greatest for working with teeth.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It may be for just a week-end or a longer term emergency, but for tooth pain, relief is priceless.  </li>
      <li>I do not have the best teeth in the world</li>
      <li>The Oral Pain Relief was great for a tooth ache</li>
      <li>The dentist said I did a great job.</li>
      <li>necessity was pointed out by an experienced survival expert I admire.   </li>
      <li>The emerency dental kit is good to carry with my husband and I in  motor home in case of emergencies</li>
      <li>It is good value for the money.</li>
      <li>Not even close, and I don&#x27;t mind spending up a bit for a good kit that saves me time running around.</li>
      <li>The cement works really good</li>
      <li>and if they happen on a weekend or holiday good luck finding a dentist.</li>
      <li>This makes me feel so much better!</li>
      <li>Looks nice.</li>
      <li>I hope I never have to use this, but it has a nice array of items in it.  </li>
      <li>The kind you get at any pharmacy for pennies each.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>This kit would have come in handy till I got to the Dentist.</li>
      <li>If you have any kind of emergency kit, \\&quot;Go</li>
      <li>Like the kind you meds would be delivered to a patient in at the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;- 4 Cotton rolls</li>
      <li>The price was fair, and it fit nicely in the emergency duffel bag.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent and very complete kit which should be within the emergency supplies of all families.  </li>
      <li>then that I think this is a great addition to my BOB first aid kit!</li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised to find this dental kit to be the perfect item for traveling, keeping in the RV, and stashing in my backpack.</li>
      <li>Packaging could be better.</li>
      <li>Glad I have not used it yet</li>
      <li>Meh...This kit is better than having -nothing- to take with you camping or to put in your emergency kit.  </li>
      <li>Well, &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; happened to me when I had a tooth crack and most of it fell off.</li>
      <li>This is making me type too many words</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel better with this kit just being in the house.</li>
      <li>and I even bought some more because I had my grown kids coming to me for this.</li>
      <li>Hope to never need it. :)</li>
      <li>They are very useful and effective.</li>
      <li>No one thinks about a leaky filling or cracked tooth before an emergency, but when the pain hits there is nothing more important than relief.  </li>
      <li>If you are the kind of person who thinks about what&#x27;s in your first aid kit, you have to have a dental kit.</li>
      <li>I also had another tooth crack while I was waiting, so filled it.</li>
      <li>If you have a dental problem in the middle of a flood or severe snow storm, this kit is a good tool to have available.</li>
      <li>I travel don&#x27;t always have access to dental care in many of the places I travel and this seems to be what I would need to do a temp filling until I could get to a real dentist.  </li>
      <li>Good enough to get by.</li>
      <li>not bad for the price</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have dental care, so I took this out and was able to repair the tooth and it stayed until I was able to get into the dentist over a month later!</li>
      <li>Fortunately we had no such difficulty, but we did talk to someone who had lost a filling and didn&#x27;t have this kind of filler.</li>
      <li>and I used the little pain liquid, is like Clover Bud and worked really great for numbing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The tools are, well, cheap, but I augmented with a real dental kit.  </li>
      <li>However, now that I&#x27;ve got this handy kit, I can just sit back and relax, knowing that if my teeth rot out of my skull I can take care of it.  </li>
      <li>is well worth the price if you need it in an emergency.</li>
      <li>It certainly seems to be adequate to  handle any dental problems until you can find a dentist.</li>
      <li>First Aid Kits too since dental problems can happen anywhere</li>
      <li>It is in my first aid kit.</li>
      <li>Frankly, I hope I don&#x27;t ever have to use it, but if I do ever have a dental emergency, this will really help me out!</li>
      <li>Overall, pleased.</li>
      <li>are the included items I would consider almost without worth or better substituted for your normal bathroom kit item or similar description:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Put this kit with your First Aid supplies and be ready just in case....</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s the deal, if you&#x27;re (say) going on a 10 day hunting expedition into the wilds of Alaska...I&#x27;d certainly be looking for an upgraded version of this kit.  </li>
      <li>I readily endorse this product.</li>
      <li>Do not buy clove oil at a drug store though, it costs 10 times as much.</li>
      <li>What you are really paying for with this kit is the temporary filling material.</li>
      <li>I learned that mouth pain can be very debilitating.</li>
      <li>As described, fast shipping</li>
      <li>And there is really nothing else that you need: it covers it all.</li>
      <li>Thanks for your support.</li>
      <li>These are absolutely garbage.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Predators in the wild die mostly from reasons related to their teeth, you read me?</li>
      <li>Looks like a pretty complete kit.</li>
      <li>High Quality - survival bug out bag item</li>
      <li>If I had it to do over I would spend a little more on a nicer kit</li>
      <li>Great online buying experience from Amazon, as usual!!!</li>
      <li>I bought this after reading the great reviews here on amazon, boy am I sorry I did.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have ready access to dental/medical care, this product offers solutions for what could otherwise be a catastrophy.  </li>
      <li>Comes with enough to handle most basic dental emergencies, although I imagine you&#x27;d only need it when medical assistance isn&#x27;t readily available.</li>
      <li>It is small and can be easily added to your first aid kit.  </li>
      <li>Because it is not uncommon in Nepal to be literally a week&#x27;s walk away from ANY civilization, much less a dentist, the opening in his tooth became a very distressing problem that would otherwise (with this kind of kit) been easy to temporarily repair.</li>
      <li>so I purchased this kit to augment our First Aid Medical kit.</li>
      <li>I got this to keep in the RV next to a well equipped first aid kit.</li>
      <li>However, I would only use this is an emergency, but that is what it is made for in the first place.</li>
      <li>I had never considered dental a first aid issue until I knocked out a filling on a Sunday, outside of my dentists&#x27; office hours.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, the kit didn&#x27;t come with everything, naturally, so</li>
      <li>It will hold you until you can get to a dentist and get professional help.</li>
      <li>The cost was intermediate against other kits, so I was wondering if I should have spent more - not the case at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve told Scouts that if we ever had a need to pull someone&#x27;s tooth while out camping far away from civilization, we would use this product rather than a pair of official \\&quot;tooth-puller pliers.\\&quot; Highly recommend that you have an emergency back pack with you at all times and in that backpack, carry one of these!</li>
      <li>While it does come with a reusable stiff and compact (for the amount of stuff in it) plastic container, it would be nice to have a little nylon zip pouch with soft edges to store the bits.</li>
      <li>This one takes up les space than the old one that I had to replace but almost the same amount of supplies</li>
      <li>Relatively compact design, appears to be a complete kit to buy you time until you can make it to the dentist for proper treatment.</li>
      <li>In 2001 we spent over 8 weeks on the high back trails in Nepal with a similar kit.</li>
      <li>really don&#x27;t need to spend a premium for what little tiny amount you&#x27;re getting (paper cups, cotton rolls, gauze, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(rough estimate) clear plastic box, all items are in description of this item already</li>

<li> Someone seams to always mess up their teeth when we are out in the wild&#x27;s...</li>
<li> , I went down to my local Walgreens and added a couple of supplemental items.  </li>
<li> Of course all you have to do is repackage it into something that wont get crushed in my backpack.</li>

<li> This is not a real dental kit.</li>
<li> Before I bought this product, I had been using a toothbrush and toothpaste like some kind of moron.  </li>
<li> you can see, this stuff is either just plain garbage (tweezers, spatulas, and mirror), or is such an item</li>
<li> OTher</li>
<li> On the other hand if you just need something to keep around the house to repair a crown that popped off until you can get to the dentist on Monday...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been in situations where a filling fell out; not fun.</li>
<li> In a pinch, if you need to do some tooth repair, this will at least help till you can get to a dentist, I also have a big bottle of &amp;#34;Oil of Cloves that I got from a nutrition store, like GNC.</li>
<li> I broke a tooth in half eating tortillia chips a couple years ago.  </li>

    <li> In a pinch, if you need to do some tooth repair, this will at least help till you can get to a dentist, I also have a big bottle of &amp;#34;Oil of Cloves that I got from a nutrition store, like GNC. Do not buy clove oil at a drug store though, it costs 10 times as much.</li>
    <li> The wife got me a pre-packed emergency duffel from Amazon for Christmas, after listening to me say for years how \\&quot;I need to start an emergency kit...\\&quot; Anyhow, the kit didn&#x27;t come with everything, naturally, so I figured I&#x27;d add to it. One of the items I purchased was this dental kit. The price was fair, and it fit nicely in the emergency duffel bag. Comes with enough to handle most basic dental emergencies, although I imagine you&#x27;d only need it when medical assistance isn&#x27;t readily available. I&#x27;ll be keeping it in the emergency kit, and maybe bringing it along when we do our annual karate camp in the Sierras (just in case).</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re full-time RVers and often visit places off the beaten path and away from immediate medical &amp; dental care so I purchased this kit to augment our First Aid Medical kit. I haven&#x27;t had to use it yet but I did review the items and included instructions. It certainly seems to be adequate to  handle any dental problems until you can find a dentist. I also recommend  the kit for home First Aid Kits too since dental problems can happen anywhere and if they happen on a weekend or holiday good luck finding a dentist.</li>
    <li> This one takes up les space than the old one that I had to replace but almost the same amount of supplies</li>
    <li> A must for a bug out bag.</li>
    <li> This is what I needed for my bug-out kit. Thanks for your support.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised to find this dental kit to be the perfect item for traveling, keeping in the RV, and stashing in my backpack. The cost was intermediate against other kits, so I was wondering if I should have spent more - not the case at all. While it does come with a reusable stiff and compact (for the amount of stuff in it) plastic container, it would be nice to have a little nylon zip pouch with soft edges to store the bits. I&#x27;ll find something around the house to serve that purpose. If you are the kind of person who thinks about what&#x27;s in your first aid kit, you have to have a dental kit. And there is really nothing else that you need: it covers it all. Overall, pleased.</li>
    <li> This product is as expected and described.  I have not used this yet so I am not sure on quality yet.</li>
    <li> Looks a quite a bit lower quality than expected</li>
    <li> Just the ticket for if you&#x27;re traveling and worry about the \\&quot;what ifs\\&quot; of dental problems on the road.  Relatively compact design, appears to be a complete kit to buy you time until you can make it to the dentist for proper treatment.</li>
    <li> The product came higly recommended, and it came on time and as advertised. I hope that I never need to use it, but it&#x27;s comforting to know it&#x27;s there!</li>
    <li> If you have a dental problem in the middle of a flood or severe snow storm, this kit is a good tool to have available. It will hold you until you can get to a dentist and get professional help. Added it to my emergency kit to insure that all the bases were covered.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the great reviews here on amazon, boy am I sorry I did. For a moment, will put to the side that the package was missing two items that were listed on the packing list and just concentrate on the contents, of lack thereof. Here is what you get:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the included items I would consider almost without worth or better substituted for your normal bathroom kit item or similar description:&lt;br /&gt;- Plastic tweezers. These are absolutely garbage.&lt;br /&gt;- Plastic dental mirror. Again, total garbage, even listed as disposable.&lt;br /&gt;- 5 yrds of floss&lt;br /&gt;- 2 flat plastic \\&quot;spatulas.\\&quot; Again, these are just tiny sticks of plastic, garbage.&lt;br /&gt;- 2 paper dishes. Like the kind you meds would be delivered to a patient in at the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;- 4 Cotton rolls&lt;br /&gt;- A VERY small amount of dental wax&lt;br /&gt;- 2 gauze pads. The kind you get at any pharmacy for pennies each.&lt;br /&gt;- 4 200mg tablets of ibuprofen&lt;br /&gt;- 2 skin wipes like you get after a meal of ribs or chicken wings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, this stuff is either just plain garbage (tweezers, spatulas, and mirror), or is such an item you A) either already pack (floss, ibuprofen, wipes, etc), or B) really don&#x27;t need to spend a premium for what little tiny amount you&#x27;re getting (paper cups, cotton rolls, gauze, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some items would be useful:&lt;br /&gt;- A VERY small amount of temporary cement and temporary filling&lt;br /&gt;- 1 CC of Eugenol. You read that correctly, ONE CC. Don&#x27;t spill any!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, you can get this stuff at your local pharmacy for WAY, WAY cheaper. Not even close, and I don&#x27;t mind spending up a bit for a good kit that saves me time running around. This one is just plain poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are laughably silly. This is not a real dental kit. Save your money!! Traveler&#x27;s supply, expect my return request!</li>
    <li> I have not been forced to use this kit, but I like the idea of having it just in case.  It is small and can be easily added to your first aid kit.  I broke a tooth in half eating tortillia chips a couple years ago.  This kit would have come in handy till I got to the Dentist.</li>
    <li> What you are really paying for with this kit is the temporary filling material. In 2001 we spent over 8 weeks on the high back trails in Nepal with a similar kit. Fortunately we had no such difficulty, but we did talk to someone who had lost a filling and didn&#x27;t have this kind of filler. Because it is not uncommon in Nepal to be literally a week&#x27;s walk away from ANY civilization, much less a dentist, the opening in his tooth became a very distressing problem that would otherwise (with this kind of kit) been easy to temporarily repair.</li>
    <li> Looks nice. Glad I have not used it yet</li>
    <li> The emerency dental kit is good to carry with my husband and I in  motor home in case of emergencies</li>
    <li> Before I bought this product, I had been using a toothbrush and toothpaste like some kind of moron.  However, now that I&#x27;ve got this handy kit, I can just sit back and relax, knowing that if my teeth rot out of my skull I can take care of it.  Take that, corporate toothpaste conglomerate running dogs!</li>
    <li> Looks like a pretty complete kit. Packaging could be better. Will definitely find a home, repackaged of course, in my medical emergency kit. Hope to never need it. :)</li>
    <li> This is an excellent and very complete kit which should be within the emergency supplies of all families.  Emergency temporary filling materials, some instruments, and disposables are supplies probably all dentists wish families would have.</li>
    <li> Recieved in 4 days from order date! Comes in 4\\&quot; by 8\\&quot; by 3\\&quot; (rough estimate) clear plastic box, all items are in description of this item already so no need to go into! Looks like it&#x27;s got all the essentials for a broken tooth or loose filling, etc.! Only thing I added was Sensi Gel Instant Toothache Pain Relief Gel Pen .07 Oz. (1 Pack) just to relieve the pain instantaneaously! OTher then that I think this is a great addition to my BOB first aid kit! Great online buying experience from Amazon, as usual!!!</li>
    <li> not bad for the price</li>
    <li> Have you ever had a filling fall out at 3am in a hotel on vacation? No? Me either.....But if I did I would want this around....</li>
    <li> No one thinks about a leaky filling or cracked tooth before an emergency, but when the pain hits there is nothing more important than relief.  It may be for just a week-end or a longer term emergency, but for tooth pain, relief is priceless.  I do not have the best teeth in the world and I do not see a dentist every year.  I bought this kit because it&#x27;s necessity was pointed out by an experienced survival expert I admire.   If you have any kind of emergency kit, \\&quot;Go Bag\\&quot; or survival preparations, you should have this dental kit.</li>
    <li> I hope I never have to use this, but it has a nice array of items in it.  The tools are, well, cheap, but I augmented with a real dental kit.  Good enough to get by.</li>
    <li> I got this to keep in the RV next to a well equipped first aid kit. I&#x27;ve been in situations where a filling fell out; not fun. This little kit will help in those situations until you get to a dentist.</li>
    <li> The kit is what is promised and was delivered on time.  It is a basic emergency dental kit my only real complaint is the case that it comes in; it&#x27;s a little (a lot) flimsy.  Of course all you have to do is repackage it into something that wont get crushed in my backpack.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and small.  Perfect for dental emergencies while hiking and traveling.</li>
    <li> High Quality - survival bug out bag item</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve broken a tooth before and exposed the nerve, I HAVE NEVER FELT PAIN LIKE THAT BEFORE OR SINCE, I ACTUALLY WENT BLIND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel better with this kit just being in the house.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve told Scouts that if we ever had a need to pull someone&#x27;s tooth while out camping far away from civilization, we would use this product rather than a pair of official \\&quot;tooth-puller pliers.\\&quot; Highly recommend that you have an emergency back pack with you at all times and in that backpack, carry one of these!</li>
    <li> As described, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Emergency Dental Kit  I had never considered dental a first aid issue until I knocked out a filling on a Sunday, outside of my dentists&#x27; office hours. I learned that mouth pain can be very debilitating. It is good value for the money. Put this kit with your First Aid supplies and be ready just in case....I readily endorse this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my bugout bag but a crown fell out and I started using it. It works. Now I need another one.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a comprehensive quality kit.  Haven&#x27;t used it and hope I never have to, but it did come with everything it said it did and I now have it stored in my mega first-aid kit.  Please familiarize yourself with it so you&#x27;re not trying to read directions in an emergency.</li>
    <li> Meh...This kit is better than having -nothing- to take with you camping or to put in your emergency kit.  That being said once it arrived and I had taken stock in what was actually in the kit, I went down to my local Walgreens and added a couple of supplemental items.  Here&#x27;s the deal, if you&#x27;re (say) going on a 10 day hunting expedition into the wilds of Alaska...I&#x27;d certainly be looking for an upgraded version of this kit.  On the other hand if you just need something to keep around the house to repair a crown that popped off until you can get to the dentist on Monday...Then yeah, this kit will fill the bill.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to my friends. It is in my first aid kit. You never know when you would need it.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  This is making me type too many words so this is just three words left and that is it.</li>
    <li> I had this for a &amp;#34;just in case.&amp;#34; Well, &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; happened to me when I had a tooth crack and most of it fell off. I didn&#x27;t have dental care, so I took this out and was able to repair the tooth and it stayed until I was able to get into the dentist over a month later! I also had another tooth crack while I was waiting, so filled it. The dentist said I did a great job. The Oral Pain Relief was great for a tooth ache and I even bought some more because I had my grown kids coming to me for this. The cement works really good and I used the little pain liquid, is like Clover Bud and worked really great for numbing.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are not the greatest for working with teeth.&lt;br /&gt;This is well worth the price if you need it in an emergency. I will be ordering another one!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t need this, yet. I hope I never have to find out how well it works. That being said it appears to have enough to get you by in an emergency but as for how it works I don&#x27;t know. Still I&#x27;ll keep this in my B.O.B.</li>
    <li> I travel don&#x27;t always have access to dental care in many of the places I travel and this seems to be what I would need to do a temp filling until I could get to a real dentist.  However, I would only use this is an emergency, but that is what it is made for in the first place.</li>
    <li> I got this with the hopes of never needing it.  Well I&#x27;ve had to replace about half of it because I&#x27;ve had to use it when out hiking, hunting, and camping.  Someone seams to always mess up their teeth when we are out in the wild&#x27;s...</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I would buy one again!  You should consider buying this.  They are very useful and effective.</li>
    <li> All you need...just in case!</li>
    <li> This should have the extractor in it to consider it compleet</li>
    <li> Product was excactly how they described it but it is very low quality stuff. If I had it to do over I would spend a little more on a nicer kit but thats my fault. They gave me what I paid for.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have ready access to dental/medical care, this product offers solutions for what could otherwise be a catastrophy.  Predators in the wild die mostly from reasons related to their teeth, you read me?</li>
    <li> It seems like it is always a holiday or weekend when we have a tooth emergency. This makes me feel so much better!</li>
    <li> I will keep this kit in my travel luggage. It is a simple, but well thought-out concept. Frankly, I hope I don&#x27;t ever have to use it, but if I do ever have a dental emergency, this will really help me out!</li>
