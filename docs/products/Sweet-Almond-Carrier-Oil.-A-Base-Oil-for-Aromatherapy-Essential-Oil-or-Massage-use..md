    <li> perfect just what I ordered and even better it was thru Prime!</li>
    <li> It is always rewarding to receive a quality product. You can never know when you&#x27;re a first-time buyer. I love the color and the subtle hint of almond in this oil. I purchased it as a carrier oil for my personal care products. After adding my own essential oils I allowed the blend time to bond. The result was amazing and I will definitely purchase this oil again.</li>
    <li> Works well. Doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to.</li>
    <li> Love PT products,  I&#x27;ve purchased several from Amazon, arrived on time and this almond oil I use with other PT oils,</li>
    <li> This works well as a carrier oil for essential oils. Ive also added it to lotions. It absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t sit on the skin too long. Arrived on time, smells fresh, no real odor.</li>
    <li> Excellent oil for giving massages--especially after heating it up. Absorbs very well and lasts.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works great as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great for use as a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> I love that almond oil is slightly sweet and thick.  As I drop it on my skin it doesn&#x27;t immediately roll off and I feel it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.  Almond oil has become my preferred carrier oil for my YL essential oil blends.</li>
    <li> Needs more fragrance.  Needs more almonds oil.  Light viscosity good for massage. Clear color but needs to really kick the almond frGance.</li>
    <li> Good and reasonably priced</li>
    <li> super fast shipping and excellent product used this for a body scrub i was making turned out excellent</li>
    <li> The bottle was leaking when received. Outer package was intact. Only reason didn&#x27;t give all stars was leakage.</li>
    <li> We use this as a carrier oil and it&#x27;s great, absorbs very quickly without any oily residue and no scent to overpower the essential oils.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell. Can be used to make whipped shea butter or used as a moisturizer by itself</li>
    <li> Great product, just with it had some of the natural fragrance</li>
    <li> I exclusively purchase Plant Therapy for my carrier oils. I love the almond oil and fractionated coconut oil. They blend with my eo&#x27;s really well and are lovely on my skin (and my baby and husband&#x27;s skin, too!) Great prices, prime eligible, great product.</li>
    <li> Great option for buying sweet almond oil. Used in self care products. Very pleased with the quality and price point.</li>
    <li> Love plant therapy products</li>
    <li> Pleasant neutral oil, beautifully balanced. Used a lemon essential oil as a mixer and cannot say enough good things about it. 8 drops essential oil per bottle will do you. Excellent light oil for massage.</li>
    <li> great carrier oil, works as supposed to</li>
    <li> First time user and I thought there would be the aroma of Almonds but there is not. It did everything it was supposed to but was a bit disappointed</li>
    <li> Received in good condition without any leakage.</li>
    <li> arrived on time.  Love this oil.</li>
    <li> No instructions provided for how to use it with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great oil!!! Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect carrier oil for my essential oils!</li>
    <li> I was really expecting a much stronger smelling product than this is, and really had hoped it would be so because I do love the smell of almond.  However, the scent is not very strong.  What I DO like very much is that it makes an excellent hand and body emollient as well as an essential oil for a diffuser.  It is excellent for keeping rough skin away, especially during these cold months.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because its scent is not as strong as I&#x27;d hoped it would be.  Aside from that, this is a great product and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, though in a diffuser, its scent is obviously not so strong.  I still recommend this product despite the less than perfect score.</li>
    <li> Even though the lid was on and there was  plastic sac around the bottle, oil stained the inside and outside of the cardboard box. More than an ounce was spilled.  Not acceptable.</li>
    <li> Good oil for face and body. Better than any moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was looking for but the seal broke on the bottle in shipping so some of the oil leaked out and was all over my package :(</li>
    <li> I have always loved this oil. Plant Therapy is a new product. The oil itself in perfect. When it arrived in its own separate baggie I was very glad - for it had leaked-- about a 1/4 of the bottle was empty. The bag saved the rest of the order. Oh well.........</li>
    <li> I use this with my essential oils to make little roller bottles of various blends. Works great!</li>
    <li> Bought this as an alternative to fractionated coconut oil, but this one is still about as oily. My favorite carrier oil I&#x27;ve tried is grapeseed oil instead. I have used this almond oil in some skin care products I&#x27;ve made, and it feels nice.</li>
