    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product. I&#x27;ve purchased from this company before and received awesome articles. However, I was hooked on the idea that it would cure my canker sore that I&#x27;ve had for years due to an I&#x27;ll fitting piece. Noooooooooooo! This is a crystal, first of all. Anyway, the pain subsided after a few minutes but lasted a few hours. I tried it again, with no avail. So, guess what? I finally took a B.C. Powder that took away everything in less than five minutes. Aaaaahhh! Suffice it to say, I&#x27;ll stick to the B.C. powder for pain and try the alum for other things from my fellow reviewers. It just didn&#x27;t do it for me. If something happens, I&#x27;ll update.</li>
    <li> It came quickly and has many uses. Nice size, nice price. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what I was looking for and a pretty good deal, but the product weight section listed this as 1 pound rather than the actual 4 ounces it is.  Looks like an administrative mistake on the details, but really needs to be corrected.  I would have bought from another vendor had I know this was only 4 ounces, as I needed 1 pound.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF REALLY TAKES THE PAIN AWAY IN AWFUL TOOTHACHES RIGHT INSTANT, I USE IT AS NEEDED, ME DON&#x27;T CARE FER DENTIST TRIPS.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  It is seems similar to Armisol that I purchased from Canada but much less costly.  I have trouble with underarm odor.  My regular deodorants don&#x27;t always do the job.  I put on my regular deoderant and then some of this as well and no odor.</li>
    <li> Advertised as powder, it is NOT. It is granulated like salt  -disappointed as I have purchased actual powdered product elsewhere before.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that when I opened the jar it was only half full.  I am waiting to order some raw organic cocoa butter to melt then mix with for my facial lines.  Will find out those results after I order the butter to mix.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> We use this for diaper rashes.Works everytime.My husband uses this for chafing from sweating.Puts some in a cloth &amp; carry in his pocket.He swears on it.</li>
    <li> 100% satisfied and I will order again for this product when I run out of it, Thanks for all of your help.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s crystal-growing science fair project.  It was just what she needed, and a lot cheaper than buying it in the little bottles at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alum, it can be used for numerous purposes, I forgot which I used it for.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for those wanting to boil water and add the powder to grow crystals overnight. I got about 25 small ones overnight, and my next experiment is to work with crystal batteries and use the \\&quot;seed\\&quot; crystals to grow bigger ones around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape is beautiful and they grow very clear and very hard, almost look like quartz crystals. I assume if you grow them in a shaped container, you could probably make some very beautiful jewelery of this stuff, or grow stronger crystal batteries. Overall I was impressed with the price, and how quickly the crystals formed, took only one night. Cool stuff!</li>
    <li> Great for growing Alum crystals with my grandson.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for Alum for many rears..they use to sell it at the corner drug store then I was told they did&#x27;nt make it any longer</li>
    <li> It is  crystals -- not POWDER.  works as expected... but I would have preferred the POWDER like the label indicates.</li>
    <li> Really not a powder, more a granular product.</li>
    <li> Was listed as a powder but it came as crystals. I wanted to use it to apply to canker sores in my mouth.  The crystals do not stick like the powder did.</li>
    <li> I bought this Eko Alum Powder as a home remedy to deal with a mouth sore. It did not work at all and I&#x27;m fairly certain it&#x27;s due to the quality of this product as every testimony to this home remedy has been positive with great results. I will be trying a more expensive Alum powder as I believe it comes down to &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Alum is widely used in Southeast Asia as a water decontaminant. When pounded into powders, it also kills odor producing bacteria in shoes. This was how I was taught to deal with foot odor during my teen years; now it is my son&#x27;s turn, so I go shopping for alum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alum chunks or granules can be purchased in bulk, but hammering them into powder form is tedious work. I am glad to find this item. It contains particles the size of fine sands. A user can definitely feel their presence in the shoes, but they should not be too bothersome. My son is able to get used to them in no time. My nose gets a reprieve. We are both happy.</li>
    <li> This so-called powder is NOT A POWDER, but rather a salt-like substance which was not adequate to treat my ailment in any shape, form or fashion.  The description of this product is false and misleading and should be corrected immediately.  It was my intention to return this item, but the shipping cost was 3x more than the actual cost of the item itself.  I was and still am deeply disappointed.</li>
    <li> Used in canning things like pickles, this product is great at making them very firm. There are many uses for this product .</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I will buy it again.  Is very useful.</li>
