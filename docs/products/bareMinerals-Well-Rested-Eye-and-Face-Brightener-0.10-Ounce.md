### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful product.</li>
      <li>Awesome product.</li>
      <li>I think the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Love it!!!!!</li>
      <li>The name perfectly describes how I look when I use this.</li>
      <li>However, I did find that this is truly one of the best highlighters on the market.</li>
      <li>Great alternative to creme version</li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Use with concealer, this is not a concealer on its own.</li>
      <li>, you have to pay for your own return shipping</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
      <li>So easy to use, eyes look nice and bright.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and creamy and light weight!  </li>
      <li>It takes time to get the right formulation of the two, but when done right they seem to work perfectly.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more of a trail size</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m so pleased with the delivery system also...</li>
      <li>I will be using this forever :)</li>
      <li>I like this better than the Eye Brightener.</li>
      <li>I use it underneath my make-up, even though it states on the package insert that you can use it on top of make-up as well.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I would say its just OK, i do like alot of the products from this makeup line, but this one is overpriced for what it claims to do, way better out there like balm, and marylou.</li>
      <li>But if you want a great, natural looking highlighter, then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
      <li>Very light with a brightener in it, so it has a shimmer to it, to difuse light, which is why it works so well.  </li>
      <li>Easy to carry..</li>
      <li>So bottom line: If you&#x27;re looking for a dark circle concealer, skip this and get the Well Rested powder instead (which is awesome btw).</li>
      <li>I really liked it, though I wish it provided just a little more coverage, so that it could be more effective when used on</li>
      <li>Again, amazing product, I love bareMinerals but make sure to buy the bigger size!!</li>
      <li>Fabulous product.</li>
      <li>smooth.  </li>
      <li>So far so good with using the Well-Rested.</li>
      <li>I originally assumed I could replace my Well Rested powder with this pen version.</li>
      <li>Considering it is a Bare Minerals product I thought it would be as good as I have</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and cool.</li>
      <li>I do not see anything special in this product vs the powder version.  </li>
      <li>Very creamy, goes on easy.  </li>
      <li>Great product for making the eye area a little brighter.</li>
      <li>This is a great item for everyday use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a shear coverage with highlights that get picked up by natural sunlight, creating a lightened and well rested look.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the investment.</li>
      <li>I love this produc,t helps fade some of my spots and wrinkles for a 59 year old</li>
      <li>I use it fter sunscreen and before my Ready Bare Escentuals powder foundation and my face looks amazing.</li>
      <li>Why create a product with an ingredient that many women are sensitive to when the old version works just fine?</li>
      <li>I love Bare Escentuals</li>
      <li>What can I say I love bare minerals</li>
      <li>The item arrived very fast.  </li>
      <li>and now I can easily use the bands to grip and open quickly.  </li>
      <li>It much more natural and subtle looking than most highlighters out there, and I love the consistency.</li>
      <li>No joke, this makes your face really radiant!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but this is a must!  </li>
      <li>You are better off putting regular lotion on your face.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my married daughter.  </li>
      <li>The first day I wore the Well-Rested Face and Eye Brightener I got a compliment.</li>
      <li>If I had a lot of salt before bed or not enough water and wake up puffy, it takes longer to apply because it wants to settle in the crease more.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>As far as packaging is concerned, the click and apply applicator is really useful and efficient.</li>
      <li>and I put too much on..</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like I am wasting as much as I do with the pen.</li>
      <li>This product works really well to hide under eye circles.  </li>
      <li>I had already purchased several bare minerals products and was pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>yes, this eye brightener does help look rested and bright and can be used anywhere on the face to give a little pick up as needed, such as under brows, tip of nose.</li>
      <li>Wish there was a little more in each applicator.</li>
      <li>Does very well at diffusing light and hiding my dark circles</li>
      <li>Application goes on smooth and covers my unsightly dark circles with ease.</li>
      <li>The lid got extra suctioney somehow and became more and more difficult to remove each morning.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this.  </li>
      <li>Instructions are clear and concise.</li>
      <li>It provides very minimal coverage, but does have some shimmery properties to it which deflect light and definitely does brighten overall.  </li>
      <li>and you can get 5x as much for the SAME price from a different seller.</li>
      <li>This is my second bottle and when I don&#x27;t use it I can really tell a difference with the circles under my eyes (Especially during allergy season).</li>
      <li>I had a major reaction to it, probably because it contains silicone.</li>
      <li>I am a Bare Escentuals fan</li>
      <li>A couple glasses of water and a quick eye massage usually do the trick with that though.  </li>
      <li>works well under my eyes it helps hide the dark circles really well  </li>
      <li>It really removes any shadows or dark circles.</li>
      <li>and I would highly recommend this for anyone with dark circles under their eyes.</li>

<li> Is subtle but powerful.  </li>
<li> I am finding that careful application helps the product last longer.  </li>
<li> Have been using this for a long time.</li>
<li> I agree that you don&#x27;t get a lot of product for the money; however I have decided to only use it under my eyes and dapping just a few drops does the job.</li>
<li> IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE EYES TO MATCH YOUR HEART, THEN YOU&#x27;VE GOT TO CAREFULLY PLACE</li>
<li> but I expected some sort of brightening effect.  </li>
<li> A huge rip-off!!</li>
<li> I pair this with Bare Escentuals concealer powder, and you have to be careful and not too heavy handed with the powder or else the two cause heavy under eye creasing.</li>
<li> My product was completely EMPTY!</li>
<li> I was HUGELY disappointed in this AND to top it off</li>
<li> I think it is broken, but such a pain to deal with sending it back and forth.</li>
<li> works well on my dark circles ..</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles</li>
<li> helped quite a bit with my dark circles</li>
<li> It brightens but I wouldn&#x27;t use it without the well rested powder to cover my dark circles.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t bother with it half of the time.</li>
<li> little caveat.</li>
<li> Wasted $20.</li>
<li> I guess I wasted my money...</li>
<li> If you buy anything that says that you must use every day for a minimum of 30 and just maybe you&#x27;ll notice a difference, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I was disappointed that this wasn&#x27;t the full size product, it&#x27;s a mini size.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> This product was a waste of money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No more dark circles and 7 be tried it all! !!!!  I look awake and rested</li>
    <li> helped quite a bit with my dark circles</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!! Thank you.</li>
    <li> works well on my dark circles .. put it over my eyelids too. Easy to carry.. small compact.. I wish it wasn&#x27;t a turn and load container -- sometimes it splats and I put too much on.. but I can&#x27;t think of one thing wrong with it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference when I use this! I guess I wasted my money...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a brightener for a while and decided to try this one. It works great, I&#x27;m so pleased with the delivery system also...a little twist and the product reaches the brush!</li>
    <li> IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE EYES TO MATCH YOUR HEART, THEN YOU&#x27;VE GOT TO CAREFULLY PLACE THIS ESSENTIAL IN YOUR MAKEUP CASE.</li>
    <li> What can I say I love bare minerals</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim. I had already purchased several bare minerals products and was pleased with the results.  It provides very minimal coverage, but does have some shimmery properties to it which deflect light and definitely does brighten overall.  I use it underneath my make-up, even though it states on the package insert that you can use it on top of make-up as well.  I use this, followed by the BM concealer (powder form), and then my foundation.  I really liked it, though I wish it provided just a little more coverage, so that it could be more effective when used on it&#x27;s own.  As far as packaging is concerned, the click and apply applicator is really useful and efficient.</li>
    <li> It brightens but I wouldn&#x27;t use it without the well rested powder to cover my dark circles. Also, the lid is incredibly difficult to get off the pen when you have just used moisturizer. I don&#x27;t bother with it half of the time. I have been using the &amp;#34;eye Rev-ver upper&amp;#34; instead. Works just as well and I don&#x27;t feel like I am wasting as much as I do with the pen.</li>
    <li> I am a Bare Escentuals fan but this did nothing for me.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles but I expected some sort of brightening effect.  No different than applying lotion.  Wasted $20.</li>
    <li> I originally assumed I could replace my Well Rested powder with this pen version. Wrong. This isn&#x27;t anything like the powder version, and quite frankly, it&#x27;s pretty terrible at concealing under eye circles. However, I did find that this is truly one of the best highlighters on the market. It much more natural and subtle looking than most highlighters out there, and I love the consistency. So bottom line: If you&#x27;re looking for a dark circle concealer, skip this and get the Well Rested powder instead (which is awesome btw). But if you want a great, natural looking highlighter, then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
    <li> If you buy anything that says that you must use every day for a minimum of 30 and just maybe you&#x27;ll notice a difference, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Is subtle but powerful.  Love this product.  brightens up my eyes and face.  smooth.  Doesn&#x27;t sit in lines or wrinkles.  I like the applicator.  Definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> The name perfectly describes how I look when I use this. A subtle effect, just what I was hoping for. People do not comment how tired I look when I have this on.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to creme version</li>
    <li> I like this better than the Eye Brightener. Just a touch of glimmer without the color.</li>
    <li> Great product! Have been using this for a long time.</li>
    <li> works well under my eyes it helps hide the dark circles really well  my only problem is with the size of this it&#x27;s more of a trail size</li>
    <li> Use this with well-rested powder.</li>
    <li> It does had some lightening and some sparkle</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this.  It does something to help my undereye circles, but it is really subtle and I never look &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;- even if I apply in a hurry.  The lid got extra suctioney somehow and became more and more difficult to remove each morning.  I put matching rubber bands on the body and lid and now I can easily use the bands to grip and open quickly.  If I had a lot of salt before bed or not enough water and wake up puffy, it takes longer to apply because it wants to settle in the crease more.  A couple glasses of water and a quick eye massage usually do the trick with that though.  I think the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes!</li>
    <li> This is a full-priced yet mini travel version with a much lesser quality brush.  I was HUGELY disappointed in this AND to top it off, you have to pay for your own return shipping AND they don&#x27;t take back cosmetics!  A huge rip-off!!</li>
    <li> Considering it is a Bare Minerals product I thought it would be as good as I have the rest of their products are, but I was wrong.  I do not see anything special in this product vs the powder version.  Would not recommend to anyone!!  Was a waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> I agree that you don&#x27;t get a lot of product for the money; however I have decided to only use it under my eyes and dapping just a few drops does the job. I am finding that careful application helps the product last longer.  I may look for another product before purchasing this one again.</li>
    <li> This is a great item for everyday use.  I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but this is a must!  It really removes any shadows or dark circles.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that this wasn&#x27;t the full size product, it&#x27;s a mini size.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I will never use anything else. But this is .02 fl oz and you can get 5x as much for the SAME price from a different seller. DO NOT BUY FROM At Your Door! I am so angry! Such a joke. Again, amazing product, I love bareMinerals but make sure to buy the bigger size!!</li>
    <li> I love Bare Escentuals and I just started using the makeup so I decided to try this after the rave reviews.  The first day I wore the Well-Rested Face and Eye Brightener I got a compliment.</li>
    <li> The item arrived very fast.  It&#x27;s nice and creamy and light weight!  Does very well at diffusing light and hiding my dark circles</li>
    <li> I would say its just OK, i do like alot of the products from this makeup line, but this one is overpriced for what it claims to do, way better out there like balm, and marylou.</li>
    <li> Great product for making the eye area a little brighter.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my married daughter.  She loves  it.  She uses it all the time to brighten up her make up.</li>
    <li> Why do companies insist making sequels that stink? The pen product, \\&quot;Face &amp; Eye Brightener\\&quot; is horrible. I had a major reaction to it, probably because it contains silicone. Why create a product with an ingredient that many women are sensitive to when the old version works just fine? I&#x27;m sticking with the powder (Well-Rested Eye Brightener PSF 20).</li>
    <li> I could not get the product out of the tube. I read the directions and reread the directions and clicked the bottom part and nothing has ever come out. I think it is broken, but such a pain to deal with sending it back and forth.</li>
    <li> Poor coverage. I will not purchase again. This product was a waste of money. Very disappointed in the overall quality of Well-Rested.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Application goes on smooth and covers my unsightly dark circles with ease. Instructions are clear and concise. Definitely buying again and I would highly recommend this for anyone with dark circles under their eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I carry it with me to apply in the afternoon/evening to help freshen up. Use with concealer, this is not a concealer on its own.</li>
    <li> I love this produc,t helps fade some of my spots and wrinkles for a 59 year old</li>
    <li> No joke, this makes your face really radiant! I use it fter sunscreen and before my Ready Bare Escentuals powder foundation and my face looks amazing. I will be using this forever :)&lt;br /&gt;One little caveat. It doesn&#x27;t last too long :(</li>
    <li> Totally pointless. won&#x27;t purchase again</li>
    <li> So far so good with using the Well-Rested. It wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, it is not a traditional concealer. It&#x27;s more of a shear coverage with highlights that get picked up by natural sunlight, creating a lightened and well rested look. I pair this with Bare Escentuals concealer powder, and you have to be careful and not too heavy handed with the powder or else the two cause heavy under eye creasing. It takes time to get the right formulation of the two, but when done right they seem to work perfectly.</li>
    <li> This product works really well to hide under eye circles.  Very light with a brightener in it, so it has a shimmer to it, to difuse light, which is why it works so well.  Very creamy, goes on easy.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> So easy to use, eyes look nice and bright.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t do anything.  You are better off putting regular lotion on your face. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. Wish there was a little more in each applicator. Goes on smooth and cool.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and when I don&#x27;t use it I can really tell a difference with the circles under my eyes (Especially during allergy season).</li>
    <li> yes, this eye brightener does help look rested and bright and can be used anywhere on the face to give a little pick up as needed, such as under brows, tip of nose.</li>
    <li> My product was completely EMPTY!</li>
