      <li>I love this lipstick!</li>

      <li>so it add a nice touch to my lips.</li>
      <li>The lipstick is nice and creamy</li>
      <li>Nice creamy feel.  </li>
      <li>nice creamy formula that applies evenly</li>
      <li>Since it is a light color it is also great for a top coat over a bit darker shade of lipstick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair with blue eyes and brown hair and it is absolutely perfect.  </li>
      <li>It compliments my med to fair skin tone;  blonde hair and brown eyes perfectly.</li>
      <li>I tried so many lipsticks and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>Cute color however.</li>
      <li>I love clinique&#x27;s texture and creamyness.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad that Amazon carries it</li>
      <li>Favorite color of all time.  </li>
      <li>This is a great color for me - strawberry blond hair, fair somewhat freckled skin, blue eyes.</li>
      <li>I love clinique</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>Color is between a rich rose and brown.</li>
      <li>Moisturizing Lipstick Formula in a Pretty Rosy Nude Shade that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm a fair complexion.  </li>
      <li>I love the moisturizing texture and how smooth it is.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to find an alternative that is just as good, but keep coming back to this product, my favorite!</li>
      <li>put my original and the one I just received , on the top of my hand .</li>
      <li>I especially love this particular shade of lipstick since it is very natural looking yet becoming.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a light brown closer to a clear-ish gloss, this will be fine for you.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes and looks fantastic</li>
      <li>It is smooth and nourishing.</li>
      <li>Adds a nice natural color when my lips are dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The true Tender Heart Ive been getting is in a silver metal tube with ridges and comes in a sealed box .&lt;br</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t like colors that look bold.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m over 60 and don&#x27;t wear bright or dark colors, so this soft and natural shade is great for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great neutral, mild color for pale skin.</li>
      <li>Love this lipstick, it is soft and moist and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
      <li>but this wasn&#x27;t really worth the money, even at the discounted price.</li>
      <li>My mom has light skin with red hair, my sister has tan skin with blonde hair, and I have fair skin with brunette hair.</li>
      <li>It is very smooth, does not dry your lips and the color is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I like very much because it is creamy and give me shine on my mouth.</li>
      <li>Fast Service!</li>
      <li>Nice color, not too dark.</li>
      <li>I keep coming back to this, pair it with a clear  stay long lip gloss coat and very pleased!</li>
      <li>The color is only a little darker than my lips, which is great for day use.</li>
      <li>For the money, it is a reasonable buy.  </li>
      <li>really like the color and the $$$$</li>
      <li>This is moisturizing and a fine quality Clinique product but it is just too flat brown for my tone.</li>
      <li>Smooth and lasts a long time when paired with matching lip liner.</li>
      <li>Hands down, this is my favorite lipstick shade.  </li>
      <li>It goes with anything and it is a clinique classic.</li>
      <li>But it wasn&#x27;t really worth the price, especially since I discovered a much cheaper duplicate - E.L.F. Fantasy(ONE DOLLAR).</li>
      <li>It takes MANY coats of this to show much color at all (and this is coming from someone who really doesn&#x27;t go for thick layered color...</li>
      <li>Mostly natural looking but also a little more mauve for those who want to not be tooo nude.</li>
      <li>Came promptly and was new as described.  </li>
      <li>Not to dark or light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this same exact lipstick for years--</li>
      <li>Fortunately the tube still last a long time.</li>
      <li>This is natural.</li>
      <li>Clinique is a good brand and it doesn&#x27;t run into the lip lines and look scary like some lipsticks.</li>
      <li>This product was old smell and dry</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Favorite color of all time.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this color since...well, it&#x27;s been about 10 years, I think, maybe longer.  It&#x27;s a great neutral, mild color for pale skin. I&#x27;m fair with blue eyes and brown hair and it is absolutely perfect.  It moisturizes and looks fantastic--it&#x27;s also not too obvious.</li>
    <li> Does not appear to be the same color as I had purchase in the store. I am disappointed with the Tender Heart.</li>
    <li> Nice color, not too dark.</li>
    <li> It takes MANY coats of this to show much color at all (and this is coming from someone who really doesn&#x27;t go for thick layered color... so just to get enough to see it) . It takes about ten times over for me to get some tint. I love the moisturizing texture and how smooth it is. But it wasn&#x27;t really worth the price, especially since I discovered a much cheaper duplicate - E.L.F. Fantasy(ONE DOLLAR). Same thing and the color shows up in a fraction of the time and coats! Cute color however. Can be dressed up or down. Nice components of hydration but the color showing aspect isn&#x27;t raveworthy. If it only does what chapstick does it should be closer to chapstick prices. I love clinique but this wasn&#x27;t really worth the money, even at the discounted price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this same exact lipstick for years-- I&#x27;m talking a decade or longer. It&#x27;s the best feeling lipstick ever, and I LOVE the color. My mom has light skin with red hair, my sister has tan skin with blonde hair, and I have fair skin with brunette hair. This shade looks great on all of us. I can&#x27;t rave enough about this lipstick. I&#x27;d give it 6 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing Lipstick Formula in a Pretty Rosy Nude Shade that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm a fair complexion.  I&#x27;ve tried to find an alternative that is just as good, but keep coming back to this product, my favorite!</li>

    <li> I love this lipstick! It goes with anything and it is a clinique classic. You can wear it year round.</li>
    <li> This product was old smell and dry</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick. Adds a nice natural color when my lips are dry.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like colors that look bold. This is natural.</li>
    <li> This is a great color for me - strawberry blond hair, fair somewhat freckled skin, blue eyes. I&#x27;m over 60 and don&#x27;t wear bright or dark colors, so this soft and natural shade is great for me. Clinique is a good brand and it doesn&#x27;t run into the lip lines and look scary like some lipsticks.</li>
    <li> I have my doubts that this is actually Clinique and not a knock off . I&#x27;ve been buying mine for years at a dept store . The true Tender Heart Ive been getting is in a silver metal tube with ridges and comes in a sealed box .&lt;br /&gt;This came in a see thru zip lock Baggie , no box and no seal for safety .&lt;br /&gt;I looked on Cliniques website and it shows the silver tube , not the green plastic tube .&lt;br /&gt;I put my original and the one I just received , on the top of my hand . The color is similar but texture is very different . The one I ordered on Amazon ( I ordered 3 tubes! ) is slicker , not creamy , and very sheer .&lt;br /&gt;The labels on the tubes are different .&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not taking any chances,especially since these were not sealed  . These are going in the trash .</li>
    <li> I tried so many lipsticks and this is by far the best. It is very smooth, does not dry your lips and the color is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The color wasn&#x27;t the same  as the pictur,</li>
    <li> Hands down, this is my favorite lipstick shade.  I am so glad that Amazon carries it and it is 1/3 of the cost.  I will definitely be coming back here to reorder once I start to run out again.</li>
    <li> The lipstick is nice and creamy but you do need several coats for it to last a couple hours .  Fortunately the tube still last a long time. Since it is a light color it is also great for a top coat over a bit darker shade of lipstick.</li>
    <li> Awesome Color! Fast Service! Very Happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> really like the color and the $$$$</li>
    <li> nice creamy formula that applies evenly</li>
    <li> I love this color. I wear it everyday.</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick, it is soft and moist and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
    <li> I use diarly. I like very much because it is creamy and give me shine on my mouth. I recommended it.</li>
    <li> I love clinique&#x27;s texture and creamyness.  I especially love this particular shade of lipstick since it is very natural looking yet becoming.  I recommend this product hughly.</li>
    <li> Loved this product! It was delivered on time, works well and attended our expectations.</li>
    <li> Not a very good lipstick! It doesn&#x27;t keep my lips moist,:((</li>
    <li> Smooth and lasts a long time when paired with matching lip liner.</li>
    <li> I have used this color for years.  It feels wonderful on and is a great color for all seasons.  I bought two.</li>
    <li> My wife like this, its great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian with tan olive skin and medium tone lips so it add a nice touch to my lips. Not to dark or light. Just perfect...will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Clinique Tender Heart is a very nice lipstick and a beautiful color. It compliments my med to fair skin tone;  blonde hair and brown eyes perfectly. The only issue I have with the product is that it is shipped unsealed. No box or tamper proof taping which leaves me uneasy about using it. Not sure I will purchase again because of this alone.</li>
    <li> I have olive skin and skin tonned lips. This is moisturizing and a fine quality Clinique product but it is just too flat brown for my tone. If you&#x27;re looking for a light brown closer to a clear-ish gloss, this will be fine for you. Good neutral for day wear.</li>
