      <li>It is working great.  </li>
      <li>they are misrepresenting a good product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the product I received.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still loving both the [[ASIN:</li>

      <li>It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Feb 15 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I order more.</li>
      <li>I HAD to have more.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;With very small product amounts needed, one pass cleaning (shampoo) and excellent results I think the shampoo/conditioner combination is a quadruple win:</li>
      <li>The conditioner isn&#x27;t perfect at preventing tangles in wet hair but combing it out under the shower head while rinsing takes care of that for me and my below-shoulder length</li>
      <li>healthy, smooth and silky hair.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo.</li>
      <li>But happy surprise: it&#x27;s like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money.</li>
      <li>have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full.</li>
      <li>I also can rise this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water.</li>

      <li>I love this shampoo and the price is worth ordering it.  </li>
      <li>There are a lot of shampoos and conditioners in the stores, and they are marketed with colors and fancy lettering to give the impression that they are fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping and very accurate product description.</li>
      <li>I recommend that you talk to your hair dresser first to make sure what product that you need.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation</li>
      <li>Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice.</li>
      <li>I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress</li>
      <li>I ordered this same item about 6 months ago and loved it.</li>
      <li>My hair feels healthier than ever, I&#x27;ve tried several of  Biolage&#x27;s products all with good results.  </li>
      <li>i would consider this product smells good and my hair feels healthy again less breakage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for</li>
      <li>/&gt;First impressions are very positive and hopeful.</li>
      <li>This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many salon brands but this one makes my aging course,and graying hair look and feel young, strong and soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this brand in general!</li>
      <li>As always, this product is super hydrating (even for my natural black hair) and smells great.</li>
      <li>The combination of Matrix Shampoo and Matrix Conditioner leaves my hair soft and actually smooth.</li>
      <li>This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear</li>
      <li>I love it, when I get low</li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years and love it as well as the shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective.</li>
      <li>I have dry frizzy hair, this product made my hair softer and more manageable.</li>
      <li>I found this large bottle and bought myself a pump for the shower.  </li>
      <li>I love this conditioner because I have very long, straight hair</li>
      <li>Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected.</li>
      <li>But it really does work.  </li>
      <li>it lasts forever as you do not use as much of the conditioner as the shampoo.</li>
      <li>but I am very fond of this one.</li>
      <li>They cover the real UPC codes and the product smells like POISON.</li>
      <li>She loves this product and highly recommends it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I am very disappointed because I love Fortetherapie and was happy when I thought I was ordering the right stuff, I won&#x27;t ever order from Matrix again</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review with observations about the \\&quot;strengthening\\&quot; properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner</li>
      <li>The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older.</li>
      <li>I purchased a small bottle of this on clearance (normal price was $22 - got if for $7) and fell in love.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to gals of all ages and I&#x27;m living proof that it&#x27;s not just for the young.</li>
      <li>so I thought this would help to curb the damage that the perms cause, but it did the exact opposite of what the label says</li>
      <li>In either case, the same positive result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy, but I can certainly feel the strength that is back in my hair.  </li>
      <li>All of Matrix&#x27;s products have done me well so far</li>
      <li>It is still a good product, but it is now a foam that is difficult to completely wash out after I rinse with it, and my hair is rougher in texture when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m amazed how little shampoo and conditioner I need to clean my hair in one pass and then condition it.</li>
      <li>love Biolage products and will look for an alternative conditioner in the line, but this was not a happy surprise</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fortunate in that I have thick hair and Matrix</li>
      <li>My hair has been fairly brittle lately (the hard water here does a number on my blood hair).  </li>

<li> My hair has been fairly brittle lately (the hard water here does a number on my blood hair).  </li>
<li> If you have ever used biolage products before, you know that they smell mild and pleasant--not so with this thick, congealed, grey, toxic substance.</li>
<li> Stores do not seem to stock much of it and is pricy for a small bottle.  </li>
<li> I re-ordered (actually clicked on re-order from my old order to be sure I got the same thing) last month and have been somewhat disappointed.</li>
<li> This supplier was fast and efficient and received the product in a few days, unless some of the other vendors.</li>
<li> (which had a scent I didn&#x27;t like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  </li>
<li> /&gt;Update: Jan 9 2014&lt;br /&gt;Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  </li>
<li> I purchased a larger bottle for about the same price as a small one in a store; plus, I will not have to buy another for a longer period of time.</li>
<li> After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right</li>
<li> This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair.</li>
<li> /&gt;Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected.</li>
<li> You&#x27;ll save money too because just a little shampoo will cover your hair even if it&#x27;s long.</li>
<li> I was skeptical of their claims when I first bought the conditioner.  </li>
<li> I use the conditioner after each shampoo and leave it on for a few minutes to give it a little extra push to prevent any frizz.</li>
<li> It does not weigh you hair down or make it oily.</li>
<li> the price out here is $10 less than at the store.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m Black and get my hair relaxed every 3 months</li>
<li> think I&#x27;m using a little less than in the January update.</li>
<li> A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I can hardly shake it our of the bottle.  </li>
<li> The wife likes it and she hasn&#x27;t complained to me about it, so</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s so thick</li>
<li> I used that small bottle and voila!  </li>
<li> This product is FAKE.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As always, this product is super hydrating (even for my natural black hair) and smells great.</li>
    <li> I have been using Fortetherapie  for years and can&#x27;t find it at any salons so I ordered it from Matrix, I don&#x27;t know what the heck is in this bottle but it&#x27;s not Fortetherapie, it&#x27;s so thick I can hardly shake it our of the bottle.  I am very disappointed because I love Fortetherapie and was happy when I thought I was ordering the right stuff, I won&#x27;t ever order from Matrix again they are misrepresenting a good product.</li>
    <li> I truly like this product for my hair.  Stores do not seem to stock much of it and is pricy for a small bottle.  So I decided to have a look see on Amazon.  I purchased a larger bottle for about the same price as a small one in a store; plus, I will not have to buy another for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> The wife likes it and she hasn&#x27;t complained to me about it, so I say it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> I started using the strengthening shampoo and conditioner about 2 yrs ago. I&#x27;ve tried many salon brands but this one makes my aging course,and graying hair look and feel young, strong and soft and shiny. Don&#x27;t want too use anything else</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and love it as well as the shampoo. Will use nothing else.  It does not weigh you hair down or make it oily. it lasts forever as you do not use as much of the conditioner as the shampoo. This supplier was fast and efficient and received the product in a few days, unless some of the other vendors.</li>
    <li> This product is FAKE. They cover the real UPC codes and the product smells like POISON. If you have ever used biolage products before, you know that they smell mild and pleasant--not so with this thick, congealed, grey, toxic substance. Please--save your hair. Mine was almost destroyed.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of their claims when I first bought the conditioner.  But it really does work.  Actually gives my hair a lot of body without making it feel all sticky like some can do.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using [[ASIN:B0007NIRUU Nexxus Humectress Conditioner]] for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula [[ASIN:B0007NIRUU Nexxus Humectress]] conditioner and [[ASIN:B00AE07FUE Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo]] (which had a scent I didn&#x27;t like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with [[ASIN:B003V2P32Y Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo]] which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It&#x27;s not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I&#x27;m slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is using [[ASIN:B003V2P32Y Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo]] and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review with observations about the \\&quot;strengthening\\&quot; properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Jan 9 2014&lt;br /&gt;Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I&#x27;m now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it&#x27;s like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Feb 15 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can rise this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. In either case, the same positive result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 26 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still loving both the [[ASIN:B003YV2PYQ Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo]] and matching conditioner. I&#x27;m amazed how little shampoo and conditioner I need to clean my hair in one pass and then condition it. The conditioner isn&#x27;t perfect at preventing tangles in wet hair but combing it out under the shower head while rinsing takes care of that for me and my below-shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With very small product amounts needed, one pass cleaning (shampoo) and excellent results I think the shampoo/conditioner combination is a quadruple win: save time, saves money, saves water, and gives great results!conditioner combination is a quadruple win: save time, saves money, saves water, and gives great results!</li>
    <li> I purchased a small bottle of this on clearance (normal price was $22 - got if for $7) and fell in love.  My hair has been fairly brittle lately (the hard water here does a number on my blood hair).  I used that small bottle and voila!  healthy, smooth and silky hair.  I HAD to have more.  I found this large bottle and bought myself a pump for the shower.  It is working great.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy, but I can certainly feel the strength that is back in my hair.  Thank goodness!</li>
    <li> I have dry frizzy hair, this product made my hair softer and more manageable. I love it, when I get low I order more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this same item about 6 months ago and loved it. I re-ordered (actually clicked on re-order from my old order to be sure I got the same thing) last month and have been somewhat disappointed. It is still a good product, but it is now a foam that is difficult to completely wash out after I rinse with it, and my hair is rougher in texture when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I love Biolage products and will look for an alternative conditioner in the line, but this was not a happy surprise and I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the product I received. I would definitely do business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> I am a Biolage user.  I love this shampoo and the price is worth ordering it.  I recommend that you talk to your hair dresser first to make sure what product that you need.</li>
    <li> This product is damaged. My hair became sticky after using it.</li>
    <li> i would consider this product smells good and my hair feels healthy again less breakage. compataple with biolage bamboo shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair feels healthier than ever, I&#x27;ve tried several of  Biolage&#x27;s products all with good results.  Not only that but the price out here is $10 less than at the store.</li>
    <li> I can tell my hair is stronger since using this conditioner. All of Matrix&#x27;s products have done me well so far but I am very fond of this one. I would recommend</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and very accurate product description.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the biolage products, but the very first time I used the strengthening shampoo and conditioner set my hair immediately started breaking off. I&#x27;m Black and get my hair relaxed every 3 months so I thought this would help to curb the damage that the perms cause, but it did the exact opposite of what the label says</li>
    <li> I love this brand in general! I love this conditioner because I have very long, straight hair and it helps from breaking. Every time I brushed my hair, my hair would break and fall out, but w this its actually working</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter.  She loves this product and highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> At 76, my hair has a tendency to frizz a bit when it never did before. The combination of Matrix Shampoo and Matrix Conditioner leaves my hair soft and actually smooth. I&#x27;m fortunate in that I have thick hair and Matrix is the only thing I&#x27;ll use in my hair. There are a lot of shampoos and conditioners in the stores, and they are marketed with colors and fancy lettering to give the impression that they are fabulous.  They&#x27;re not. Matrix is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve had a lot of years to use a lot of different hair care products. You&#x27;ll save money too because just a little shampoo will cover your hair even if it&#x27;s long. I use the conditioner after each shampoo and leave it on for a few minutes to give it a little extra push to prevent any frizz. It does the trick and if I do say so myself, and I do, my hair is actually beautiful. I highly recommend it to gals of all ages and I&#x27;m living proof that it&#x27;s not just for the young.</li>
