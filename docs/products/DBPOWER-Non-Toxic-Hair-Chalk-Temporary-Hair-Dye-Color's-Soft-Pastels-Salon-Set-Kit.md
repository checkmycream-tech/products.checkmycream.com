      <li>Because they are so bright, they show up really well in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>chalk is ideal for youngsters&#x27; playtime or teenagers&#x27; raves, for Halloween or theatrical costumes, or just for brightening up a dismal day.</li>
      <li>The best part about this kit is that each stick of hair chalk is carefully packaged in a neat, orderly way.</li>

      <li>I ended up playing with them as well and had a lot of fun!</li>
      <li>This product would be great for cheer leading, supporting your favorite sports team, or just to add a little flair to your hair!:)</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this product when I received it just from the totally cool packaging alone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super fun to have on hand for summer!</li>
      <li>Thank you so much :)</li>
      <li>It was great but doesnt show as much in black hair</li>
      <li>After using artist&#x27;s pastels with less than spectacular results, I just love this set.</li>
      <li>Let your creative side go wild...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fun way to play with color in your hair without committing to a permanent hair dye.</li>
      <li>Lots of fun.  </li>
      <li>Really fun, we will use them again</li>
      <li>As my profile photo shows, I&#x27;m no stranger to fun color in my hair.</li>
      <li>They had fun putting it on and showed it off to their friends.</li>
      <li>The color gets softer when the hair is dry but it still stands out and is pretty bright.</li>
      <li>Right now it&#x27;s summer</li>
      <li>Washes right out.  </li>
      <li>Do not be fooled by the positive reviews!</li>
      <li>/&gt;These chalks are non-toxic - it is very important to only purchase non-toxic hair</li>
      <li>It definitely shows up on my highlights better but you can still see the color in the darker hair.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought it was because I have brown hair...</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and communicating with the buyer was effortless!</li>
      <li>chalk is non-toxic and water soluble, and the hair should be dampened and brushed first for easy application.</li>
      <li>A few of my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s friends have been using chalk to color their hair for a while now, so my daughter was excited to get a set to use on her own hair.</li>
      <li>Easy for short makeups.</li>
      <li>Very impressed...especially for such a cheap price.</li>
      <li>My only concern at first was that my hair was too dark and it wasn&#x27;t going to come out bright.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product for kids or adults!</li>
      <li>As soon as we were done I gently blow tried to pieces of hair that we colored.</li>
      <li>The process went much quicker after I dampened my hair.</li>
      <li>Such a cool look but its a bummer</li>
      <li>The possible effects are really unlimited and it is so much fun to experiment with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>... I don&#x27;t even know how this would work on long hair... When it hardly worked on my short hair... The concept of new colors every day is awesome...</li>
      <li>By applying a little bit of water to my hair, I got the colors to adhere with much greater vibrancy.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend buying this chalk if you are a fan of wearing fun colors at a low price!</li>
      <li>I have purchased other products similar to this, and this one has a much better color selection.</li>
      <li>Only complaint was if love to have had more white and for the chalk to be bigger.</li>
      <li>Colors are very vibrant and last all day, without rubbing off on clothes.  </li>
      <li>My nephew, who is a high school junior, wanted some color for his next high school track meet.</li>
      <li>Next time I reuse this, I will not have to worry about any mess, and the chalk dries nicely for future uses.</li>
      <li>Then after she&#x27;s colored and braided her hair, she goes over it one more time with a little extra color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;The texture and natural curl of my hair</li>
      <li>It took about 3 washes for it to come completely out of our hair.</li>
      <li>For a low price, you are really getting a LOT of product.</li>
      <li>It washes out completely.  </li>
      <li>would recommend a  towel or something under it while your hair dries completely.  </li>
      <li>You HAVE to wet your hair first</li>
      <li>She puts the braid in when her hair is wet, so now she also uses the chalk on that section of hair first, before putting in her braid.</li>
      <li>Normally, I do not dye my hair different colors, but I decided to try this for fun.</li>
      <li>these are fun to use &amp; will even work with dark hair depending on the color</li>
      <li>I have light, reddish blonde hair &amp; didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need to wet it, but it was taking forever to transfer any color from the chalk when my hair was dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought these for my son to use for crazy hair day at school. I ended up playing with them as well and had a lot of fun! My son is dark blonde and I have medium brown hair with blonde highlights. The color took well on both of us. You HAVE to wet your hair first otherwise it&#x27;s really hard to get the color to apply well. As soon as we were done I gently blow tried to pieces of hair that we colored. The color gets softer when the hair is dry but it still stands out and is pretty bright. The yellows and oranges didn&#x27;t pop as much as the darker colors (blue, green, purple, pink, red). If you over apply the chalk it will create dust on your clothes, so try to brush it out a bit once it&#x27;s dry and don&#x27;t wear a white shirt just in case. It took about 3 washes for it to come completely out of our hair. Really fun, we will use them again I&#x27;m sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the reviews saying that these aren&#x27;t hair chalks. Mine definitely were - they were labeled as such and came with instructions.</li>
    <li> I have dark hair and I got it to hold some color after a bit of work, but no matter what I did it usually just ended up all over my clothes. It also made my hair stiff and unmanageable, flat-ironed or not. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This 36-piece set of hair chalk comes packaged in a plastic tray to keep it organized and protected and it arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chalk is non-toxic and water soluble, and the hair should be dampened and brushed first for easy application. A curling iron can be used to help set the color and it can also be sealed with hair spray. It is easily removed by a thorough shampoo and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each stick is about 3/8 in square and over 1 1/2 inches long. There is quite an array of intense colors, from black to white with a whole rainbow in-between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This chalk is ideal for youngsters&#x27; playtime or teenagers&#x27; raves, for Halloween or theatrical costumes, or just for brightening up a dismal day. The possible effects are really unlimited and it is so much fun to experiment with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DBPower provided chalk for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Let your creative side go wild...these are fun to use &amp; will even work with dark hair depending on the color you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair chalk works best &amp; quickest on damp hair. I have light, reddish blonde hair &amp; didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need to wet it, but it was taking forever to transfer any color from the chalk when my hair was dry. The process went much quicker after I dampened my hair. Oh my gosh, be prepared for messy hands...even when using the chalk on dry hair, my hands got messy. It was even worse when I started dampening my hair. You might want to wear gloves when you&#x27;re applying the chalk. Also, the chalk can, probably will, get on your clothing until it&#x27;s set with hair spray or by heat styling...and even then, after setting the color, there&#x27;s a chance the color might rub off onto your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might not want to use hair chalk on rainy days...I have a sneaky suspicion that the chalk/color will run onto your face, neck, clothing, etc. if it gets wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are numerous you tube videos demonstrating how to use hair chalk. I learned quite a bit when I watched the you tube video by Kandee Johnson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These chalks are non-toxic - it is very important to only purchase non-toxic hair chalk.&lt;br /&gt;These non-toxic hair chalks are similar to the pastel chalks used by artists. However the artist&#x27;s pastels might contain ingredients that the FDA does not allow to be used for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
    <li> Easy for short makeups. Costume party, Halloween parties made easy!  Very easy to use. A sample was provided for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I have dark hair and was very skeptical when researching chalk for my hair color.  There are instructions on the back that say can be used on dry or wet hair.  Your hair has to be wet.  It was so easy to use.  I soaked my hair twisted and used the chalk in a downward motion( one direction).  When my hair dried I could see the color.  It definitely shows up on my highlights better but you can still see the color in the darker hair.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> My girls real loved this hair chalk... They had fun putting it on and showed it off to their friends.</li>
    <li> Lots of great colors. Only complaint was if love to have had more white and for the chalk to be bigger. Otherwise my daughter loved it</li>
    <li> Nice colors, they are pretty nice, even when my daughter&#x27;s hair is black most of the color shows pretty good.</li>
    <li> As my profile photo shows, I&#x27;m no stranger to fun color in my hair. From Manic Panic to Crazy Colour, temporary or permanent, experimenting with color is fun. After all, it&#x27;s only hair, it grows back.&lt;br /&gt;Chalking is for the commitment shy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although chalking has been around for a while, finally we&#x27;re starting to see pastels made just for hair chalking. After using artist&#x27;s pastels with less than spectacular results, I just love this set. The colors show even on dark hair. It also seems to flake less than art pastels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample product provided for review</li>
    <li> this product is amazing lovee it!!  works great</li>
    <li> So fun! I can&#x27;t wait to get the hang of these.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I had no problems with the shipping process either. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have short blonde hair.  Colors are very vibrant and last all day, without rubbing off on clothes.  I wet strands of hair, before applying and then blow dried.  Very impressed...especially for such a cheap price.</li>
    <li> I received a free set of these to examine and test for y review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wonderful selection is not only excellent for Halloween hair and party hair, it is super for wearing for sporting events when you can temporarily color your hair in your team colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that mine stayed best if I used slightly damp hair when applying it, then covered it with a bit of hair spray.</li>
    <li> So many choices and so easy to use.  Lots of fun.  I have been matching my outfits with the chalk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jawjab</li>
    <li> This product was amazing. It&#x27;s super fun to have on hand for summer! The color is temporary and washes out very easily. I would highly recommend this product for kids or adults! The shipping was fast and communicating with the buyer was effortless!</li>
    <li> Not only does it not work well on dark hair, it leaves your hair matted &amp; stiff feeling.</li>
    <li> This is not cool at all. I have brown hair, I wet it and applied the chalk and the chalk messed up my hair I could not brush it and the color came out all over my face and clothes and hands even after I blow dryed and ironed. I&#x27;m very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> ... I don&#x27;t even know how this would work on long hair... When it hardly worked on my short hair... The concept of new colors every day is awesome... But as with most temp colors best results on bleached hair...rather only results on bleached hair</li>
    <li> These were useless. At first I thought it was because I have brown hair... but I let my very blonde friend use them and they did nothing but rip hair out. We tried the wet method and the dry method of application.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, really loved it</li>
    <li> Every color you can think of,  goes into my daughters brown hair really well, and this is a really good price for the quality of the product. I would have given these 5 stars if they came in something that wasn&#x27;t a pain in the butt after you open it. Hard to keep them all together now. They are constantly sliding about and coming out of the box just from picking it up</li>
    <li> It was great but doesnt show as much in black hair&lt;br /&gt;Mainly brown like in the photos</li>
    <li> does not transfer color to hair easily or evenly</li>
    <li> Do not be fooled by the positive reviews! This chalk was completely useless and messy. Not only did it make my hair dry and stiff but it got all over my clothes and skin. The chalk also broke easily when using it. Take my advice and don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> chalk gets everywhere after you put it in- got on my clothes, couch, etc. (Even with hairspray). Such a cool look but its a bummer it&#x27;s so messy.</li>
    <li> Hair chalk is one of the most fun things I have tried this year!:) The product comes in a variety of colors that allow you to transform your hair from boring to a conversational piece of art. The chalk works just like it&#x27;s stated on the back of the packaging. Dampen your hair and let the fun begin!!!!! I was so excited to try this product when I received it just from the totally cool packaging alone. I have black hair and the colors showed up perfectly. This product would be great for cheer leading, supporting your favorite sports team, or just to add a little flair to your hair!:) The hair chalk is great for all ages and genders. My nephew, who is a high school junior, wanted some color for his next high school track meet. This product is a must buy!!!!!! A great gift for any occasion!</li>
    <li> A few of my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s friends have been using chalk to color their hair for a while now, so my daughter was excited to get a set to use on her own hair. There is a LOT of chalk in this set and there are tons of really bright colors. Because they are so bright, they show up really well in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter styles her hair with a single small braid in the underside of her hair that peeks out one side of her head . She puts the braid in when her hair is wet, so now she also uses the chalk on that section of hair first, before putting in her braid. Then after she&#x27;s colored and braided her hair, she goes over it one more time with a little extra color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the chalk washes out each day when she takes a shower, she&#x27;s able to switch colors out to match what she&#x27;s wearing. Right now it&#x27;s summer and my daughter is playing softball each week. Her team&#x27;s colors are royal blue and white. So for game days, she&#x27;s able to put some blue streaks in her hair to match her uniform. Whatever color you&#x27;re looking to put in your hair, this set will have it. There&#x27;s just about every color you can imagine inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Normally, I do not dye my hair different colors, but I decided to try this for fun. Immediately upon viewing this item, I was pleased by the spectrum of beautiful colors! For a low price, you are really getting a LOT of product. Since my hair is dark, the colors showed up very well, and I do think they would show up on lighter hair colors as well. By applying a little bit of water to my hair, I got the colors to adhere with much greater vibrancy. The best part about this kit is that each stick of hair chalk is carefully packaged in a neat, orderly way. Next time I reuse this, I will not have to worry about any mess, and the chalk dries nicely for future uses. After washing it out, I was happy to notice that no residue remained in my hair. I would highly recommend buying this chalk if you are a fan of wearing fun colors at a low price!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so awesome! I have dyed my hair often because I love changing my hair colors. With this Chalk, i don&#x27;t have to keep it permanently, I don&#x27;t have to damage my hair with chemicals, and there are so many colors. My sisters and I are addicted to this pallet . My only concern at first was that my hair was too dark and it wasn&#x27;t going to come out bright. It wasn&#x27;t like the pictures but it still comes out really nice. I have mixed a couple of the blues, reds, and tried the yellows. I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Easy on, just wet the chalk a little and rub on hair. Washes right out.  Great colors!  I have purchased other products similar to this, and this one has a much better color selection.</li>
    <li> Great product, the colors are beautiful and very easy to apply. The colors last all day.</li>
    <li> This hair chalk comes in a variety of colors.  It washes out completely.  The downside is it will get on your clothes if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend a  towel or something under it while your hair dries completely.  It&#x27;s a fun way to play with color in your hair without committing to a permanent hair dye.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and used this out of the shower with hair still damp but it ruined&lt;br /&gt;The texture and natural curl of my hair</li>
    <li> Omgosh I soooo LOVE this product!!!! It arrived very quickly. I even got a message from seller asking if I received product and if I was happy with it!! I have never had that happen before!! Excellent customer service! I had many compliments on my hair when I tried it out.. I even had to order another one for a friend of mine!! Will definitely be referring people for this product and this seller!! Thank you so much :)</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughters, but I did not like it leave dry hair</li>
