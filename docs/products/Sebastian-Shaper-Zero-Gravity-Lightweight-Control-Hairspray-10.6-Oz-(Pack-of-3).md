<li> I have baby-fine, thin hair and this is the only hair spray which helps it hold shape without weighing it down or making it oily in between shampooing.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if this is how this smells now, or if I just got received a bad shipment, but I would NEVER buy this horrible smelling product again!</li>
<li> Awful.</li>
<li> It smells HORRIBLE!  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for years since my hairdresser recommended it for my hair type.  Not oily or sticky, but yet it holds.  I prefer a lightweight hairspray for my fine straight hair and this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that works perfectly in every way.  For awhile I had difficulty finding it, so glad to see several merchants who offer this product on Amazon.  Makes ordering easy and delivered to my door.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite hair spray. The only one that I have found that keeps your hair in place &amp; is so light,&lt;br /&gt;&amp; not sticky. Can&#x27;t tell you even have it on. They charge so much more if you buy it at Beauty shops too&lt;br /&gt;Hurrah for Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> This hairspray is so sticky. After using it, you can&#x27;t brush or touch your hair or run your fingers through it. Awful. Will not buy again!</li>
