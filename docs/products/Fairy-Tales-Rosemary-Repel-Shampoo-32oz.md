      <li>I think it smells nice</li>
      <li>you own research to find the side effects of those chemicals.</li>
      <li>The shampoo smells wonderful and is pretty and cute...</li>
      <li>However, after being rinsed out it leaves a pleasant clean scent.</li>
      <li>This shampoo, by far, performed the best of any me and my family have ever come across.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo makes my very fine hair have body without overdrying it.  </li>
      <li>Bottle arrived quickly and I was pleasantly suprised wth the size and included pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
      <li>It seemed too good to be true, for a non harmful shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this shampoo to friends, in fact I have mentioned it at her school many times.  </li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>glad I did</li>
      <li>Fantastic!  </li>
      <li>Ok, so maybe that&#x27;s somewhat melodramatic, but i was truly freaking out.  </li>
      <li>We haven&#x27;t had any more lice scares, but she goes to preschool</li>
      <li>Best descision i could have possibly made!    </li>
      <li>If not, i had already decided i was going to nuke my head with all the pesticides the rid had to offer and more.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out where they are getting it, but I suspect school.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.  </li>
      <li>We also got the conditioner and the spray conditioner and love them all.  </li>
      <li>The nit comb is metal and very fine, not the cheap plastic ones that come with lice kits.  </li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the smell</li>
      <li>Turns out that i was kind of right.    </li>
      <li>Lice have not returned and my daughters hair is shiny and easy to comb.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a bit strong for me, but it seems to be working</li>
      <li>I wish I had looked at the ingredients before buying this product because it has many toxic ingredients right at the top of the list.</li>
      <li>I read several reviews about how great the products were.</li>
      <li>With all the mortification in the world, i sucked it up, went to work, and proceeded to check myself in every reflective surface available, worrying if there were any lice crawling around on my clothes.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s job of keeping her lice free.  </li>
      <li>After combing through my hair for 45 mins, my sister in law proclaimed me bug free, and we started looking at the towel.  </li>
      <li>It is not harsh or stripping and I believe the herbal oils are good for your scalp</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
      <li>I originally bought this shampoo and conditioner and spray around June of 2010 (</li>
      <li>This shampoo has a nice essential oil fragrance to it and after all the damaging lice treatments on my daughter, this was like a refreshing drink for her hair.  </li>
      <li>and I know it doesn&#x27;t matter how clean you are</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know how well it will protect if she does come into contact, but it&#x27;s natural, smells nice</li>
      <li>If you want to smell good then buy this if you don&#x27;t want lice buy a mint shampoo that is the only thing that keeps lice away!</li>
      <li>and I love when I use the spray because my hair really smells like sweet rosemary then.  </li>
      <li>We got rid of the lice quickly.  </li>
      <li>If you have long hair though, use a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s totally worth every penny...</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth the purchase.  </li>
      <li>Ok, I have four young girls</li>
      <li>, is natural and their hair looks healthy.</li>
      <li>you know it&#x27;s a problem with kids in elementary</li>
      <li>even though I am thin and have great blood pressure/great cholestrol levels so now this makes sense that I would have the skin issues as my blood sugar runs higher than is healthy.   </li>
      <li>Thankfully, i came to amazon.com pretty early in my search, and while looking up lice shampoos&#x27;s, i saw that this one i had never heard of, had more reviews than the rid</li>
      <li>It smells really nice, doesn&#x27;t seem to bother their eyes, and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so rich that a conditioner is not needed, and yet it leaves my fine oil-prone hair wonderfully soft and full of bounce and body- never limp or greasy.</li>
      <li>but once I used it on the kids a few times, it really does smell great.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much, I used some of the shampoo that was left over for myself.</li>
      <li>All natural, easy to use, and it keeps them away instead of having to put pesticides on your kids hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it before, but this was the first time purchasing it thru Amazon.</li>
      <li>After our fifth infestation I was willing to try anything</li>
      <li>Plus, to top it all off, it&#x27;s completely safe to use everyday!  </li>
      <li>This product gets rid of lice and can be used daily to make sure your child does not get reinfested if attending a school or daycare that has lots of recurrences.  </li>
      <li>After reading the first couple reviews, i was almost sold on buying the shampoo, untill i came to the most recent ones.  </li>
      <li>The first letter home in preschool that there was lice</li>
      <li>My family is still clean and clear, and we&#x27;re all using the shampoo, leave in conditioner and spray.</li>
      <li>I have continued to use this shampoo on a daily basis just because I love it so much.  </li>
      <li>My hair is left baby soft and smooth (but I do have fine hair anyway).  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing everyday shampoo.</li>
      <li>I also bought the conditioner, but really don&#x27;t even need it</li>
      <li>If you like herbal smells like rosemary or lavender (real lavender/rosemary) than you will like this.  </li>
      <li>And the smell does stay on your hair in a gentle manner..</li>
      <li>(none too gently, she was quite frusterated), yanking on it to keep me awake, asking me if I thought this was what she wanted to be doing at 4 am...  </li>
      <li>So, it REALLY get everything out.  </li>
      <li>Those dodn&#x27;t seem too promising.  </li>
      <li>Our neighbor kids had lice, so I bought this to treat my kids to keep them from catching it, and it also said it could be used as an everyday shampoo.</li>
      <li>I used this shampoo and so far my two in kindergarten have been lice free, even with one having super long hair.  </li>
      <li>She first took them to a professional who exclusively uses the Fairy Tales brand in her practice.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Alot of lice today are immune to the NIX and other chemical products.  This is all-natural and lice HATE the scent of rosemary!  The natural oils of rosemary and lavendar keep lice from coming back.  This product gets rid of lice and can be used daily to make sure your child does not get reinfested if attending a school or daycare that has lots of recurrences.  The shampoo smells wonderful and is pretty and cute...little girls will think it&#x27;s \\&quot;special\\&quot; for fairy tale princesses.  I had a friend who&#x27;s daughter kept getting lice over and over.  She was so frustrated she didn&#x27;t know what to do.  I recommended this product and she has thanked me for 2 years!  Her daughter was the only child attending the daycare that didn&#x27;t have future infestations.  I liked it so much, I used some of the shampoo that was left over for myself.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I&#x27;ve used it before, but this was the first time purchasing it thru Amazon. Great experience with the seller and the product.</li>
    <li> I became paranoid about my kids getting lice when I heard of other children at their daycare having it so I started looking online to see if there was a product available to deter lice since I had heard of it previously. I came across this and read the reviews and decided I have to have shampoo anyways and it&#x27;s all natural so why not try. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the smell but once I used it on the kids a few times, it really does smell great. I use the conditioner and conditioning spray also and the kids&#x27; hair looks great. Soft and manageable. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s preventing them from getting lice but I like the fact that it just might, smells good, is natural and their hair looks healthy. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Lathers up great, smells nice and helps keep the bugs away!  We also got the conditioner and the spray conditioner and love them all.  Gives me a little piece of mind when lice is going around school.</li>
    <li> Look at the ingredients in this shampoo and they are high quality natural ingredients..then look at how much shampoo you get for the price.  Check out other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoos and their main ingredients and compare the ounces to the price.  This can&#x27;t be beat.  I originally bought this shampoo and conditioner and spray around June of 2010 (its now almost November 2010) and I have two teenage boys.  They both came home from middle school prior to school ending with lice, telling me I needed to check their heads because everyone at school had lice.  I remembered going through this when I was a kid and my brother had lice.  I was upset understandably.  I am a nurse and I know it doesn&#x27;t matter how clean you are but I was still upset.  I ran out and bought the Nix products after first trying generic lice product and it failing.  Along with the Nix product I bought the Nit comb.  I can&#x27;t emphasize enough that it is firmly my belief that the NIT comb is what really got rid of the lice (not the NIX products).  The nit comb is metal and very fine, not the cheap plastic ones that come with lice kits.  I realized through that experience last year that these lice are not responding to Nix and pesticides and have grown considerably worse along with the bed bug epidemic hitting the U.S. due to the banning of DDT.    Anyway this is supposed to be about the shampoo.  I looked at the ingredients and I wanted to try the shampoo because I was afraid of getting lice from my kids too.  I love the smell.  If you like herbal smells like rosemary or lavender (real lavender/rosemary) than you will like this.  And the smell does stay on your hair in a gentle manner..not overpowering where someone might wonder why you smell like a rosemary bush.    The shampoo does not have sulfates and therefore if you want heavy lather like with traditional shampoo you will be disappointed.  We all know sulfates are what cause the lather.  This shampoo makes my very fine hair have body without overdrying it.  A lot of times I do not even have to use the conditioner.  Sometimes my ends get dry for whatever reason and I can use the spray and I love when I use the spray because my hair really smells like sweet rosemary then.  My hair is left baby soft and smooth (but I do have fine hair anyway).  I have considered trying other shampoos that are organic but I keep coming back to this gigantic bottle sitting in my shower...not because I have lice but because it is a great shampoo!  I would recommend it for every day use.  It is not harsh or stripping and I believe the herbal oils are good for your scalp and I have had problems with itchy oily scalp in the past that was only cured by Nizoral in the past as i believe this flaky oily scalp was the result of an overgrowth of fungus that grows on skin oil specifically killed by the active ingredient in Nizoral.  It is very similar to yeast but it feeds on oil instead of just moisture.  I just found out I am pre-diabetic even though I am thin and have great blood pressure/great cholestrol levels so now this makes sense that I would have the skin issues as my blood sugar runs higher than is healthy.   So if you have scalp problems I believe this shampoo and the occasional use of Nizoral could really help.  I no longer get the itchy scalp or acne type flaking on my scalp that was starting to get severe before I discovered Nizoral and this shampoo.  Its embarassing to say that and if you saw me you would never know I had those issues.  I am posting this to try to help anyone who might be needing the information.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a nice essential oil fragrance to it and after all the damaging lice treatments on my daughter, this was like a refreshing drink for her hair.  After shampooing, hair was soft and shiny.  I have also been using it because I like the smell and I have even used it on our poodle.  I would recommend this shampoo to friends, in fact I have mentioned it at her school many times.  I will say though that it does seem to be losing a bit of it&#x27;s scent, but maybe the bottle just needs to be shaken.  I would definitely get the Fairy Tales Leave-in Conditioner as well and forget the regular conditioner as it has much to be desired!    We have not yet had another outbreak of head lice since using it, however at school, I keep her long hair in a bun at all times and have purchased a zipper close dustmite pillow case to keep her coat in.</li>
    <li> Bought this in hopes of keeping bugs off at pre-school and out in the woods.  So far it has worked.  It has a very nice smell to it too.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this shampoo.  It smelled nice, too, but we still got lice even while using it.  Too bad, I really wanted to avoid lice in my 2 year old daughter and hoped this was the answer.  Now we are on our second week of intensive lice ridding treatments complete with angst, tears and tangles.</li>
    <li> This shampoo, has totally, blown me away!  It&#x27;s amazing!  Here&#x27;s my story:    I am a 24 yr old female, who had lice when i was very young ( around 11) and it was a DREADFUl experience.  Truly traumatizing.  I remember my mother slaving on my hair, for 5 hrs (none too gently, she was quite frusterated), yanking on it to keep me awake, asking me if I thought this was what she wanted to be doing at 4 am...  It was the 3rd time i had gotten lice in 1 year, and we were both at our wits end.  I am surprised she didn&#x27;t just shave it all off like she frequently threatend.  Regardless, that was the last time i got lice in 12 years.  After that night, i never got close to any of my friends at school, and didn&#x27;t let anyone touch my hair.  Things were good for years, until 1 week ago...    Last week, as i was combing my hair (and i have really long hair), i happened to look down at my lap, and what do i see but a strange little bug crawling around...  I was shocked.  What was it?  I had no clue.  I figured somehting had gotten into my hair from being outside, brushed it off and called it a day. However, the next day, i was brushing my hair out again, and once MORE, there was a little bug crawling on my lap...  I started to panic.      Having been to young to remember what lice looked like, i couldn&#x27;t immediately identify what the bug was.  However, i DID remember the tiny popping noise they would make when my mother would squeeze them between her nails.  Dreading what would occur, i proceeded to take the tiny bug between my two thumb nails, i proceeded to smush it, and low and behold, it popped.  Whats worse, there was a tiny speck of blood left behind.  I started to freak out.    How was this possible?!?  Here i am, 24 yrs old, brushing my hair in my car, about to go to work, and i had just found out, i had lice...  Cue the apocalypse.  Ok, so maybe that&#x27;s somewhat melodramatic, but i was truly freaking out.  How could this have happened?!?  With all the mortification in the world, i sucked it up, went to work, and proceeded to check myself in every reflective surface available, worrying if there were any lice crawling around on my clothes.  Thank God, there weren&#x27;t.  That day, after work, i debated whether going straigh to the store to buy a bottle of Rid, as thats what i remember my mother using, but i was too embarassed to do so.  Instead, i hit the net, and proceeded to scour the web until i had an answer.      Thankfully, i came to amazon.com pretty early in my search, and while looking up lice shampoos&#x27;s, i saw that this one i had never heard of, had more reviews than the rid i was planning on buying.  After reading the first couple reviews, i was almost sold on buying the shampoo, untill i came to the most recent ones.  Those dodn&#x27;t seem too promising.  After thinking it over, and failing to find something else with as many possitive reviews, or the same combination of ingredients that lice apparently hate (te atree oil, lavendar, etc) i decided to give this and the terminator comb i found on this site a shot. Best descision i could have possibly made!    At first, i was a little apprehensive about whether the shampoo would work or not, because all the directions say is:  \\&quot;use to keep bugs, lice, and other insects away from your childrens hair\\&quot;.  There is nothing in there about killing the bugs when they are already there.  However, having nothing to lose, i proceeded to try it, abd hope to God it would work.  If not, i had already decided i was going to nuke my head with all the pesticides the rid had to offer and more.  Warning labels be dammed!  I HAD to get rid of this problem.      As it happened, i could tell something was happening, because as soon as i put on the shampoo, my head started to tingle a little.  Then, even though the instructions don&#x27;t say it, i rinsed it out, lathered myself up again, and chose to leave it in for 10 min.  After that, i rinsed it out, hoping to God it had worked.  Seeing as how i have so muchhair, i enlisted my sister in laws help in combing it out.  She used a gerber comb on my hair that she had from when my nieces got lice (turns out i got it from them, because i didn&#x27;t KNOW the had lice), and she was stumped.  She started combing through my hair, and what she found was amzing.  It seemed to her, that all she was looking at were dead lice.  She was cleaning off the comb on a separate towel after every brush, and telling me how when she had combed through my nieces hair, that bugs had still been alive when she&#x27;d used the rid.  She couldn&#x27;t believe it, and neither could i.  It seemed too good to be true, for a non harmful shampoo.  Jokingly, i said that maybe they were only stunned.  Turns out that i was kind of right.    After combing through my hair for 45 mins, my sister in law proclaimed me bug free, and we started looking at the towel.  It was then i realized, some of the bigger bugs, were moving.  I had been right to think they were stunned, so we killed them.  However, i was NOT dissapointed.  This shampoo, by far, performed the best of any me and my family have ever come across.  It totally KILLED the smaller lice, and stunned the bigger bugs, for at least 30 mins.  Ample enough time for someone, with help, to remove any bugs from their hair.  Plus, to top it all off, it&#x27;s completely safe to use everyday!  It doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals like other shampoos out there.  Needless to say, my family and i have decided to use it everyday.  On everyones hair.  Bugs or not.    Currently, i am on day 3 of using the shampoo, and the past 2 days, i have started using the terminator comb.  Fantastic!  It works superbly!  The space between the teeth, is virtually non existent.  So, it REALLY get everything out.  I have never seen anything like the terminator comb, or this shampoo, in stores, and its mind boggling!  Why isn&#x27;t this out there?!  It&#x27;s something that ACTUALLY works, and isn&#x27;t harmful.  I will never use anything else again.    I&#x27;m not someone who normally writes reviews, but here i am writting this one, in hopes that anyone else who finds themselves dealing with the situation i faced, either as a child or as an adult, can find some relief.</li>
    <li> My kids have been using this since my oldest started pre-school. My family had a lice scare 2 weeks ago. One of my daughter&#x27;s playmates was over the house with her mother and the father tells us 3 days later that they realized that their daughter and the mother had lice! We were going crazy for the next week cleaning, washing, vacuuming, etc. The girl was every where, on my daughter&#x27;s bed, trying on her hats, rolling around on the couch and carpet! My family is still clean and clear, and we&#x27;re all using the shampoo, leave in conditioner and spray. Personally I don&#x27;t like the scent, it&#x27;s a bit strong for me, but it seems to be working and it does leave the hair very soft so I&#x27;ll continue using this for my family.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo to battle lice that had come into our home.  Between this shampoo and the best nit comb ever we have been able to keep our home lice free.  I have continued to use this shampoo on a daily basis just because I love it so much.  It&#x27;s so rich that a conditioner is not needed, and yet it leaves my fine oil-prone hair wonderfully soft and full of bounce and body- never limp or greasy. This is an amazing everyday shampoo.</li>
    <li> Used this as a follow-up to getting rid of lice on me and my 2 young girls. Bottle arrived quickly and I was pleasantly suprised wth the size and included pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made the girls hair smell great. Made my hair a little heavy feeling (I have very fine blonde hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My oldest seemed to break out around the neck area while using this product, so we have stopped using it. The bumps would go away about an hour after use, so figured it was some type of allergy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I broke this out of the closet the other day because I freaked when I saw my daughter itching her head. Luckily, no lice, but have been suing this again on and off just to keep buggies away. I really like the smell and lather, still has the heavy hair affect. Makes me think I followed it with leave in conditioner or something, but it works out well for daughters thick hair, just not my fine hair. I&#x27;ve also used on pets (hoping it would keep buggies off them, too?). My daughter DID NOT break out again, maybe it was something in the bath water at the time, we have moved since then.</li>
    <li> We have had two encounters with lice @ school.  Once when our child was 5yrs and again when he was 7yrs.  This is truly the only product that works.  We tried every product recommended by pharmacists, pediatricians, grandparents, and other parents.  Until our child&#x27;s hairdresser suggested this line of products.  We used the lice treatment set, shampoo, conditioner, spray/repel........all at the same time.  We got rid of the lice quickly.  The second time we received a warning from the school that there was another outbreak.......we went right to the shampoo, conditioner and spray/repel.......and never got the lice the 2nd time!!!  GREAT PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo and detangler it smells great but does not stop lice!  We have been using it for two months and now we officially have lice something we have never had before.  If you want to smell good then buy this if you don&#x27;t want lice buy a mint shampoo that is the only thing that keeps lice away!</li>
    <li> I feel this is an excellent product that works. I wish I could find it locally. All natural, easy to use, and it keeps them away instead of having to put pesticides on your kids hair.</li>
    <li> We had a major lice outbreak at my son&#x27;s school and someone suggested this shampoo. We use it daily on both of our kids and managed to avoid lice all year - no way to know if it&#x27;s the shampoo, but no reason not to believe in it! It smells really nice, doesn&#x27;t seem to bother their eyes, and the bottle lasts a long time. I was hoping the 32 oz came with a pump dispenser as some reviews indicated, but it did not.</li>
    <li> We bought this when lice was going around the school. I think it smells nice but others have told me it won&#x27;t solely protect you from getting lice. I think if you keep that in mind, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. If you have long hair though, use a good conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a back up for the shampoo for my grandaughter and it does not condition curly hair very well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product...it does the job. Keeps the lice away...&lt;br /&gt;As you know it&#x27;s a problem with kids in elementary school.&lt;br /&gt;This product works well, my kids have avoided head lice since getting this prouct.&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t let them use a regular conditioner after...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t KNOW if it&#x27;s the shampoo, but I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years on my daughter since she was in kindergarten and even though several of her very close friends have come down with head lice she has never gotten it (let&#x27;s hope I don&#x27;t jinx myself).  It smells great, has a good lather, and I believe it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s job of keeping her lice free.  I recommended this to several moms and they all use it now too.</li>
    <li> I saw this product in an organic online information, glad i can get on amazon, all the family use it everyday and it&lt;br /&gt;really works we SEE the results. now we will stay with it , because kids in school still have it., and we alse get the&lt;br /&gt;rinse protector, great product , every parent with kids in schools must have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve battled lice, you know how awful it is!  This was our last resort and seems to be working.  We like the effectiveness of killing and preventing lice while not putting all those chemicals in the hair.  Leaves hair looking great and smells okay.  We use it with the conditioner and leave in spray all the time for the entire family.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research for lice and thought I&#x27;d try it even though it had mixed reviews.  The smell is definitely something to get used to, and it doesn&#x27;t work to repel lice.  It&#x27;s expensive too!</li>
    <li> Our lice did not reappear, so either the shampoo did the trick or it was the medicated treatment we did beforehand. In any case, with the lice now a part of ancient history, my 13-year old daughter (who this was ordered for) will not longer use it because \\&quot;it stinks.\\&quot; While I would not go that far, the scent is not especially pleasant. Be forewarned if you have a girly-girl who loves fragrance and products that smell good.</li>
    <li> My Three year old came home with nits in her hair from daycare.  She cave it to my other two children.  Three girls long thick hair....it was a nightmare.  This shampoo was a lifesaver.  We could use it every day and it did not leave a sticky residue like the chemical shampoos.  It is definitely worth the purchase.  I will keep it in the house along with the conditioning spray just in case!</li>
    <li> Ok, I have four young girls and we have battled lice once every couple/few months for the last year now. I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out where they are getting it, but I suspect school. After our fifth infestation I was willing to try anything and I found this shampoo. I can tell you that we have not had lice again and have been using this product for 6 months. However, even if it did not repel lice I would not stop buying this shampoo at this point! Since we started using this product (I have been using it too,) our hair is so soft and shiny it&#x27;s unreal! I also bought the conditioner, but really don&#x27;t even need it (and I have always NEEDED conditioner before!) I haven&#x27;t even had to use any other hair products like mouse or de-frizzing spray for a week or so now. The longer I use this shampoo the healthier and less frizzy my hair gets! The shampoo smells a little like pine straight out of the bottle. I assume that&#x27;s the rosemary. However, after being rinsed out it leaves a pleasant clean scent. I highly recommend you try it. I think it&#x27;s totally worth every penny... even if we get lice again!</li>
    <li> I purchase the Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel Shampoo and conditioner after my kids brought lice home from school.After getting rid of the lice I was looking for a way to never see them again. I read several reviews about how great the products were. I spent over forty five dollars purchasing and having the products shipped to me. They didn&#x27;t smell hugely natural the Fragrance overwhelmed any of the natural oils that are in there.I used the products once I broke out in a rash and a bad case of dandruff as did my two kids. I do not recommend this product if you are the least bit sensitive</li>
    <li> Lice was going around our school.  I used this shampoo and so far my two in kindergarten have been lice free, even with one having super long hair.  Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Love how this smells and my kids use it everyday! Would recommend this for everyday use to be double sure your kids have some protection.</li>
    <li> I use this on my toddler since she did have lice, which we got rid of with the amazing LiceFree Spray and Nit Terminator Comb. We haven&#x27;t had any more lice scares, but she goes to preschool and I just use this on her as what I hope will be a preventative measure against reinfection by lice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how well it will protect if she does come into contact, but it&#x27;s natural, smells nice and I have to use something to shampoo her hair, so it might as well be something that has the potential to protect her from lice.</li>
    <li> Friend swears by it and I got it on her recommendation...really glad I did! I don&#x27;t want a repeat of kids coming down with it either...glad I did</li>
    <li> Our neighbor kids had lice, so I bought this to treat my kids to keep them from catching it, and it also said it could be used as an everyday shampoo. I wish I had looked at the ingredients before buying this product because it has many toxic ingredients right at the top of the list. I ignorantly believed the \\&quot;organic\\&quot; claim without researching it further. If my kids do come down with lice I will use it to treat that, but I am not going to put this on their heads every time they wash their hair.</li>
    <li> The first letter home in preschool that there was lice i did some research and found this wonderful shampoo. We dont use anything else! 2 years and no lice after a few letters home. all kids love it, smells great, all NATURAL/ORGANIC ingredients, couldn&#x27;t be happier!! love the pump and this bottle lasts months!</li>
    <li> Lice have not returned and my daughters hair is shiny and easy to comb. A bit on the pricey side  but cheaper than the alternative and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is nice on my daughter&#x27;s hair. Not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t weight it down. So far no lice, so I assume it&#x27;s working. Bought it with the conditioner and detangler. All have worked great.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this on her three daughters after an outbreak at their school. She first took them to a professional who exclusively uses the Fairy Tales brand in her practice. She also spritzes their hair lightly with the leave in conditioner every day, to protect them from other children who may have an outbreak in the future. Good insurance policy!</li>
    <li> The description stating that this item is devoid of harsh chemicals is a lie. Here are the chemical not listed in the description:&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Methyl-2 Sulfolaurate&lt;br /&gt;Disodium 2-Sulfolaurate&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate&lt;br /&gt;Cocamidopropyl Betaine&lt;br /&gt;Decyl Glucoside&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Choride&lt;br /&gt;Polyquaternium-7&lt;br /&gt;Benzophenone-4&lt;br /&gt;Polysorbate 20&lt;br /&gt;Polyquarternium-10&lt;br /&gt;Tetrasodium EDTA&lt;br /&gt;Dehydroacetic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Benzyl Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Do you own research to find the side effects of those chemicals. This is no better than any $3 shampoo from any drugstore to which you add a few drops of essential oil and it would be much cheaper.</li>
