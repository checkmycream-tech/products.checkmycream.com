    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I see a big difference but my skin love the moisture.</li>
    <li> Absolute junk that smells as bad as it works. Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised. Product does not work period DO YOUR RESEARCH, smells bad and for the money you could buy several other products that work better.</li>
    <li> the night cream was half full....</li>
    <li> Nerium is a wonderful product, I have been using it for nearly 5 months.  My skin is much softer and the deep wrinkles are lessening.  You must be faithful using this product and have patience for results.</li>
    <li> This creams  are excellent, I love them, it makes my skin look beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love the product but never got it in the mail.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference on my hands. Can&#x27;t see a lot of difference on my face so far. But it is noticeably making my hands softer.  I have been using it every day for 2 months.  I will keep using it until I empty the bottles. Jury still out on whether I will order more.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I AM USING THIS PRODUCT AND I HAVE SEEN A SMALL IMPROVEMENT TO THE LINES AROUND MY MOUTH SO I AM GIVING IT SOME TIME SO I CAN SEE REAL RESULTS.I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRICE OF $78.00 FOR BOTH ITEMS,</li>
    <li> I REALLY CAN&#x27;T TELL A DIFFERENCE, BUT MY SISTER, WHO ONLY SEES ME EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS, SAID SHE COULD SEE IMPROVEMENT WITH MY SKIN. I DON&#x27;T THINK I&#x27;LL BUY ANYMORE OF THIS BRAND, IT&#x27;S JUST TOO EXPENSIVE FOR NO MORE RESULTS THAN I GOT.</li>
    <li> The night cream, so far, is doing a great job, some dark spots are fading. The day cream I can do without so I will not reorder.</li>
    <li> This product did not produce any results that I could see,,,,I was hoping for too much I think.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for 3 months and I can tell a big difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> These creams do wonder ; I highly recommend to all the woman above 40s</li>
    <li> Very happy with product</li>
    <li> You have to keep using</li>
    <li> used it every day for 1 week, so far nothing. very expensive but the jury is still out. will use to the end of the bottle but probably will not buy again. also have had a headache on the right eye ever since i started it</li>
    <li> night time cream was very thick and had a bad odor.</li>
    <li> great product and delivery service</li>
    <li> The price is a little high but I really like the product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product it helps my face.</li>
    <li> I love the night cream and the day cream thank you very much</li>
    <li> Was a little skeptacle of the product. Not just with result, but the cost was a little hard to swallow. I have tried it for two weeks and I love it. The texture of my skin has changed. My dry spots are gone and my dark spot I have on my cheek is diminishing. The night time product is a little stiff. You feel like your skin is going crack if you smile and their is a slight stinch to it, but the smell quickly goes away and the skin obviously does not crack. The day time moisturizer is light. I definitely recommend this. I&#x27;m anticipating what other good things I see in my skin as I continue to use it?</li>
