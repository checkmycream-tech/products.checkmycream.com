      <li>This is very nice and works great.  </li>
      <li>This is the best and most convenient wall mount hair dryer that was made.</li>
      <li>Looks nice and having the retractable cord is great.</li>
      <li>For the price it works well, looks good.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product for the bathroom to eliminate clutter and actually works the best of others we have tried, permanently mounted or not.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied off the counter works wonderfly</li>
      <li>clock is a nice plus.  </li>
      <li>I have had wall mounted dryers for 15 years and this is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>Replaced a old one, it is great !</li>
      <li>maybe just a it more power</li>
      <li>I love my wall mounted Sunbeam hair dryer.</li>
      <li>and I am glad that you can turn it off.  </li>
      <li>Plug-in is much better, then you don&#x27;t have to go into the household wiring to install it.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>The cord retracts easily; has a night light and clock!</li>
      <li>I love everything about it, including the night light</li>
      <li>Likes having a hair dryer out and easy to use whenever needed.</li>
      <li>It is the same we have used at many hotels and we are happy with the performance.</li>
      <li>It would have been nice if the older plug-in model was still available, but my hubby took care of that!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the night light feature</li>
      <li>This one is great because you can wire it up to the wall socket and it keeps the receptacles free for use with other electrical items.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, I had a selection of drywall anchors and screws.  </li>
      <li>The option to turn off the light is much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>last dryer screwed directly to the electrical box, making installation very easy.</li>
      <li>My wife absolutely loves her Sunbeam Hair Dryer and the fact that she doesn&#x27;t have to fuss with cords hanging all over the place.  </li>
      <li>My last dryer had a LED night light that was a cooler color and most likely would have lasted for decades as opposed to the standard incandescent bulbs in this unit.  </li>
      <li>I like this one better than the previous one.  </li>
      <li>This is a bit expensive, but finally purchased and very happy that we did.</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t even use the high setting.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t actually used this yet, as it is TOO BIG for the half-wall space we had available for it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference between the hi and low settings.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised to find that it used a battery, and was NOT powered by the AC connection.  </li>
      <li>The unit is powerful enough for my short hair.  </li>
      <li>This unit replaced an older, lower wattage one, that was installed by the prior homeowners.</li>
      <li>cool shot is a little tricky to use.</li>
      <li>but the finished product was well worth the trouble.</li>

<li> I suppose this is a minor issue</li>
<li> I got this one for my Husbands bathroom because his space is limited.  </li>
<li> It only took a few minutes to make the connections, screw the mounting plate to the wall, and attach the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This one required anchors or other fasteners, depending on your wall material, as it attached to the wall.  </li>
<li> if I did not have this product hard wired into my bathroom, I would send it back!</li>
<li> I also like the fact that you have to hold the button down to make it work.  </li>
<li> I like the fact that you have to be pressing the button for it to run, so when I lay it down it isn&#x27;t still blowing.  </li>
<li> the cool down button is awkward to handle if you have small hands.</li>
<li> One star only because I missed the part about having to hard wire the house!</li>
<li> I find this to be a bit annoying, but others may be fine with it.</li>
<li> Also, the retractable cord, does not retract after just a few uses....</li>
<li> The hard wiring took my son about 45 mins.</li>
<li> I purchased this hair dryer and had an electrician hard wire</li>
<li> this product...which was expensive to do.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately this hair dryer is no longer made, so I bought this for a spare.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this hair dryer!</li>
<li> I was deeply disappointed, as there is no on or off button to turn the dryer on, you have to keep your hand on the button to keep the dryer running.  </li>
<li> I hate to see cords dangling everywhere.  </li>

    <li> I already had this dryer in my bathroom and I love it.  I got this one for my Husbands bathroom because his space is limited.  This one is great because you can wire it up to the wall socket and it keeps the receptacles free for use with other electrical items.  My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> This is very nice and works great.  Installed in our guest bath during construction.  The retractable cord is a great feature.</li>
    <li> One star only because I missed the part about having to hard wire the house!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. No cord in the way. It would have been nice if the older plug-in model was still available, but my hubby took care of that! Plug-in is much better, then you don&#x27;t have to go into the household wiring to install it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied off the counter works wonderfly maybe just a it more power</li>
    <li> For the price it works well, looks good.  The clock it a pain to set and the cool down button is awkward to handle if you have small hands.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an existing hard-wired hair dryer.  I like this one better than the previous one.  The unit is powerful enough for my short hair.  I don&#x27;t see much difference between the hi and low settings.  I do like the no heat setting.  I also like the fact that you have to hold the button down to make it work.  It seems like an extra layer of safety to prevent fires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clock is a nice plus.  I was surprised to find that it used a battery, and was NOT powered by the AC connection.  I suppose this is a minor issue and I would have bought it anyway.  I don&#x27;t use the night light feature and I am glad that you can turn it off.  The bulbs look like the miniature Christmas bulbs, but seem to put off a somewhat amber glow. My last dryer had a LED night light that was a cooler color and most likely would have lasted for decades as opposed to the standard incandescent bulbs in this unit.  The option to turn off the light is much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last dryer screwed directly to the electrical box, making installation very easy. This one required anchors or other fasteners, depending on your wall material, as it attached to the wall.  The instructions referred to included screws, but my box did not include hardware.  Luckily, I had a selection of drywall anchors and screws.  It only took a few minutes to make the connections, screw the mounting plate to the wall, and attach the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had the unit a few weeks, and I am very please overall.</li>
    <li> Wife has been using for a month with no complaints.  Likes having a hair dryer out and easy to use whenever needed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the bathroom to eliminate clutter and actually works the best of others we have tried, permanently mounted or not.</li>
    <li> This is a bit expensive, but finally purchased and very happy that we did. This unit replaced an older, lower wattage one, that was installed by the prior homeowners. It is the same we have used at many hotels and we are happy with the performance. The only issue I have with it is that you have to squeeze the handle to keep it on vs having an on/off switch. I find this to be a bit annoying, but others may be fine with it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this hair dryer is no longer made, so I bought this for a spare. This is the best and most convenient wall mount hair dryer that was made. Looks nice and having the retractable cord is great.</li>
    <li> Excellant hair dryer. Just remember you will need an electrician to install since unit does not have a plug in cord. Features are the best for any bathroom.</li>
    <li> Great Hair Dryer, but cool shot is a little tricky to use. I wired mine with a corded plug. Hotel Quality!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t actually used this yet, as it is TOO BIG for the half-wall space we had available for it.  We may use it, though,  even though it will stick up a bit against the frameless shower glass that is yet to be installed.  Had I realized it was as big as it is, I would have opted for a smaller dryer, assuming there is one out there.</li>
    <li> The hard wiring took my son about 45 mins. but the finished product was well worth the trouble. My wife absolutely loves her Sunbeam Hair Dryer and the fact that she doesn&#x27;t have to fuss with cords hanging all over the place.  Just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> I love my wall mounted Sunbeam hair dryer. I have had wall mounted dryers for 15 years and this is by far the best.  I like the fact that you have to be pressing the button for it to run, so when I lay it down it isn&#x27;t still blowing.  It has alot of power (I don&#x27;t even use the high setting.  The cord retracts easily; has a night light and clock! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this hair dryer!</li>
