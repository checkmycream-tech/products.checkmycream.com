### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>this compact one is the best for me!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>product makes my skin looks so good!</li>
      <li>I also use Milk of Magnesea on my face to control oil (which works amazing!)</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, it is a good product</li>
      <li>Colour&#x27;s a good match.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great coverage and good quality</li>
      <li>Anyway, this is a good powder</li>
      <li>more compact (great for travel) and provides better/smoother coverage.</li>
      <li>I ordered this from Lotsa Beauty Bargains and this seller is excellent, the shipping was very fast, the packages were clean</li>
      <li>Goes on nice and looks great throughout the whole day.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bare minerals foundation looks great and has good coverage.  </li>
      <li>Cheaper here though :)</li>
      <li>I ordered this color thinking it was a deeper brown and then discovered it was more yellow-tinted.</li>
      <li>It offers great pore coverage, but emphasizes dryness of the skin.</li>
      <li>Product itself if great, love Bare Minerals.  </li>
      <li>reading the other reviews, I went up a shade and lucked out for the perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>I am 30, have fine lines around my eyes and some blemishes on my chin.  </li>
      <li>If you are willing to go back to using pressed powder compacts, this is a good product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but I don&#x27;t like how it wears after a few hours.</li>
      <li>Overall coverage is very light and does not cover blemishes.  </li>
      <li>I use the ELF brand studio kabuki brush which is the best foundation brush for your money - no need to buy any expensive brushes from Sephora or ULTA ever again.    </li>
      <li>Product says it is build-able but unless you want a splotchy look only use 1-2 coats at the most.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought 20 of these because I love it so much, from here and from my local ULTA beauty store.</li>
      <li>Yes to me this is better than the MAC full coverage powder, but they&#x27;re both too much for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>Moisturise really well before putting this on.</li>
      <li>This not the real thing but a cheap imitation.</li>
      <li>If you have larger pores or wrinkles, fine lines even, it seeps in and you can actually see the powder.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use this alone, I usually wear it on top of my NYX liquid foundation.</li>
      <li>and I received an unexpected discount!    </li>
      <li>I thought the Golden Medium was more yellow, and a little lighter than I expected.  YMMV.</li>
      <li>Very similar to its original loose powder in color and texture.</li>
      <li>I am currently awaiting a THIRD compact, the first two arrived shattered.</li>
      <li>This works great at covering up all the ugly parts, you know, my face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased this item because I like Bare Minerals</li>
      <li>I always use bare minerals....</li>
      <li>Go one shade darker in your skin tone that you would have normally used in Bare Minerals loose powder if you use this dry.</li>

<li> Compared to the Bare Minerals powder foundation, it is less messy (less wasted product), easier to apply onto your brush/control the amount you wish to use,</li>
<li> (I&#x27;ve ordered this product from other sellers and the compacts were powdery messes and one had crumbled foundation!)</li>
<li> like how it stays on all day, but if you get sweaty, or oily throughout the day, you will notice it will smear a little bit.</li>
<li> but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for everyday use unless you like to look like you&#x27;re wearing a lot of make up.</li>
<li> It was the color i always use but the loose powder seems to look less thick on my skin, i have oily skin and by the time my work day ended the makup appears thick.</li>
<li> At least for me.</li>

    <li> Product says it is build-able but unless you want a splotchy look only use 1-2 coats at the most.  Overall coverage is very light and does not cover blemishes.  If you have larger pores or wrinkles, fine lines even, it seeps in and you can actually see the powder.  I am 30, have fine lines around my eyes and some blemishes on my chin.  I would not purchase this foundation again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but I don&#x27;t like how it wears after a few hours. If you&#x27;re used to liquid foundation, it might take some getting used to. Also, to get the correct match, I would go into a cosmetic boutique to have them match you.</li>
    <li> cheaper than the department store for the same product! I always use bare minerals....this compact one is the best for me!</li>
    <li> It was the color i always use but the loose powder seems to look less thick on my skin, i have oily skin and by the time my work day ended the makup appears thick.</li>
    <li> This works great at covering up all the ugly parts, you know, my face.&lt;br /&gt;Great coverage and good quality, I have used this for years.</li>
    <li> I ordered this color thinking it was a deeper brown and then discovered it was more yellow-tinted. I contacted the seller to ask about the return policy as I just want to exchange for different color. Never heard back. Wouldn&#x27;t reccommend</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this alone, I usually wear it on top of my NYX liquid foundation. If I wear it alone, it&#x27;s starts to look cakey and flakey on my skin for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how it stays on all day, but if you get sweaty, or oily throughout the day, you will notice it will smear a little bit. This is the reason I only wear this as a setting powder during the winter. Because I don&#x27;t sweat and my skin is dry all day. In the summer, especially in humid climates, I don&#x27;t recommend this. I&#x27;ve bought 20 of these because I love it so much, from here and from my local ULTA beauty store. Cheaper here though :)</li>
    <li> If you are willing to go back to using pressed powder compacts, this is a good product. Very similar to its original loose powder in color and texture. For me, I prefer filling my loose powder in an all-in-one dispenser and having one gizmo to do the job, especially when travelling. Nevertheless, it is a good product and I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do which is offer medium coverage. My only issue is the caked on look it leaves you with after the application. This powder manages to stay put for about 5 hours or so with the use of primer. I also use Milk of Magnesea on my face to control oil (which works amazing!) and this powder was NOT having it! It adhered only to the areas I had applied the milk of magnesia to. I guess the milk of magnesia has to be used with BB cream or foundation only. Anyway, this is a good powder but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for everyday use unless you like to look like you&#x27;re wearing a lot of make up. Yes to me this is better than the MAC full coverage powder, but they&#x27;re both too much for everyday wear. At least for me.</li>
    <li> This not the real thing but a cheap imitation.</li>
    <li> The color online is nothing like the color of this foundation. The foundation looks completely yellow in person.</li>
    <li> Bare minerals foundation looks great and has good coverage.  Stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Great product! Go one shade darker in your skin tone that you would have normally used in Bare Minerals loose powder if you use this dry. However, if you use this wet (with a wet beauty blender sponge), you can use your normal Bare Minerals foundation color. I have been using Bare Minerals loose powder foundation for 15+ years and have been waiting for a pressed powder foundation. Compared to the Bare Minerals powder foundation, it is less messy (less wasted product), easier to apply onto your brush/control the amount you wish to use, more compact (great for travel) and provides better/smoother coverage. It is matte which I prefer over the regular/original powder foundation which is too glittery/sparkly for my taste. FYI: I use the ELF brand studio kabuki brush which is the best foundation brush for your money - no need to buy any expensive brushes from Sephora or ULTA ever again.    I ordered this from Lotsa Beauty Bargains and this seller is excellent, the shipping was very fast, the packages were clean (I&#x27;ve ordered this product from other sellers and the compacts were powdery messes and one had crumbled foundation!) and I received an unexpected discount!    Updated 2/5/15</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I like Bare Minerals but when I received it, opened it and found the cmakeup was all crumbled. Didn&#x27;t bother returning-just threw it a way.</li>
    <li> Colour&#x27;s a good match. It offers great pore coverage, but emphasizes dryness of the skin. Moisturise really well before putting this on.</li>
    <li> Color is very yellow, texture is very chalky, just as messy as the mineral powder containers.</li>
    <li> Product itself if great, love Bare Minerals.  Seller needs to reevaluate shipping policies.  I am currently awaiting a THIRD compact, the first two arrived shattered.</li>
    <li> This is only foundation I use that does not cause any skin troubles.&lt;br /&gt;This product makes my skin looks so good!</li>
    <li> I thought the Golden Medium was more yellow, and a little lighter than I expected.  YMMV.</li>
    <li> Goes on nice and looks great throughout the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;By reading the other reviews, I went up a shade and lucked out for the perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use this product!</li>
