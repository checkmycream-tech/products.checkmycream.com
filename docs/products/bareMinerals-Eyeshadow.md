      <li>Perfect and great price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product by for the price, I would like it to laste longer than a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>and it looks great, if I have time for eyeshadow</li>
      <li>Nice bright eye shadow!</li>
      <li>It is a very easy to apply creamy liquid eyeshadow that almost looks like it turns into powder on the lids.</li>
      <li>It is very smooth.</li>
      <li>It has a very light shimmer to it</li>
      <li>I was hoping the &amp;#34;Peach&amp;#34; would look more, well, PEACH, but it was also just a very light color.</li>
      <li>I went to Ulta and they paired me up with a concealer that is actually appropriate for under the eye, love it.</li>
      <li>I just put it on top of this.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Really love this product.</li>
      <li>Goes on nice and smooth &amp; blends easily - color lasts.</li>
      <li>I really like bareMinerals 5-in-1 BB Advanced Performance Cream Eyeshadow because it is easy to apply, has great coverage and</li>
      <li>Applies easily and doesn&#x27;t crease.</li>
      <li>how easy it is to apply and blend not to mention</li>

      <li>It goes on smoothly and you get great coverage with a very small amount.</li>
      <li>It feel&#x27;s amazing on the lid and gets rid of my dark eyelids and leaves me with a clean canvas.</li>
      <li>I was &amp;#34;iffy&amp;#34; when ordering this because I&#x27;ve never used a wet shadow before, but I am in LOVE with this product!  </li>
      <li>It is easy to apply, easy to blend, is not thick and heavy and stays on all day without touch-ups.</li>
      <li>I received a sample of the 5 in 1 BB eyeshadow and really like the feel and</li>
      <li>This is not full size and more like a sample size.</li>
      <li>My one and only complaint is that the light colors are SO light that I really can&#x27;t tell much difference between one color and another!</li>

      <li>These have replaced my MAC Paint Pot&#x27;s in Soft Ochor and Painterly.</li>
      <li>I got this at Bare Minerals, the makeup lady told me I could use this as concealer too for under my eyes,</li>
      <li>I now use Naturally Bare and Linen as my eye shadow primer/base.</li>
      <li>There is either not much product in the container or it dries out even with the most careful attention paid to closing it tightly after each use.  </li>
      <li>I was looking specifically for this color in a creme eyeshadow and Bare Minerals was the only brand I found that had it.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s wasted product and pretty pricey.  </li>

    <li> I was looking specifically for this color in a creme eyeshadow and Bare Minerals was the only brand I found that had it. It is easy to apply, easy to blend, is not thick and heavy and stays on all day without touch-ups.</li>
    <li> I really like bareMinerals 5-in-1 BB Advanced Performance Cream Eyeshadow because it is easy to apply, has great coverage and it lasts all day. It is a very easy to apply creamy liquid eyeshadow that almost looks like it turns into powder on the lids. It is very smooth. My one and only complaint is that the light colors are SO light that I really can&#x27;t tell much difference between one color and another! I was hoping the &amp;#34;Peach&amp;#34; would look more, well, PEACH, but it was also just a very light color. I do recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is a use everyday, must have in your makeup bag item. I use this instead of eyeshadow primer. My eyelids are dark and this takes all of that away. I have the soft linen and wear natural 05 complexion rescue on my face. Some days if I don&#x27;t have time for eyeshadow I just pop this on with eyeliner and mascara and it looks great, if I have time for eyeshadow I just put it on top of this. It has a very light shimmer to it so it&#x27;s not so plain. One do not do. I got this at Bare Minerals, the makeup lady told me I could use this as concealer too for under my eyes, (I have a weird vein that encircles one of my eyes). This is FALSE. If anyone says you can, don&#x27;t, you cant. I did this for my sisters wedding and in all the photos it was incredibly obvious. I went to Ulta and they paired me up with a concealer that is actually appropriate for under the eye, love it. Naked Skin Urban Decay Light Neutral. Whatever you do add this creamy eye shadow to your everyday wear.</li>
    <li> Really love this product. I use it as an eye shadow foundation.  Helps to not get eyeshadow creases on your eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It goes on smoothly and you get great coverage with a very small amount. Although the container is small I have found that it lasts a long time. It also makes a great cover-up and blends in well with facial makeup.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s decent, it still creases tough.</li>
    <li> Perfect and great price</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is now part of my daily make-up routine. It can be used by itself for a natural look or it can be used under another eyeshadow. It creates a smooth finish. Will be getting other colors.</li>
    <li> I was &amp;#34;iffy&amp;#34; when ordering this because I&#x27;ve never used a wet shadow before, but I am in LOVE with this product!  Goes on nice and smooth &amp; blends easily - color lasts.</li>
    <li> I like the product but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  The design of the tube doesn&#x27;t allow you to move the wand around to get it off of the sides so it&#x27;s wasted product and pretty pricey.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Nice bright eye shadow! Applies easily and doesn&#x27;t crease.</li>
    <li> It settles in and show&#x27;s any small (anything) on eye lid&#x27;s. Terrible</li>
    <li> Love bareMinerals - I wear this everyday!</li>

Not to mentioned all the benefits for your eyes. Let&#x27;s face it at 33 I want to keep wrinkles a way for as long as possible. These have replaced my MAC Paint Pot&#x27;s in Soft Ochor and Painterly.</li>
