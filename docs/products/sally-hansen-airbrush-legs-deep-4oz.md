      <li>Great for women of colr.  </li>
      <li>Great for us women of color.</li>

      <li>Sally Hansen has a good product here if you have skin that burns rather than tans as I do and want to hide that fact.  </li>
      <li>nice product, good delivery time nice quality</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>Unless you have perfect legs, I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>I must say, I am surprised at how impressed I am with this product.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your legs and make them look really good!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more of a tan makeup for your legs it washes off my legs with soap and water</li>
      <li>I used this to smooth out my legs and bikin area and it works wonders!</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t rub off on seats or clothing.</li>
      <li>But I guess its better than nothing</li>
      <li>So much better than the spray.</li>
      <li>The more you add the more coverage this product will provide.  </li>
      <li>So, when I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review, I gave it a shot.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Am so in love with Sally airbrush lotion</li>
      <li>- I was extremely pleased.</li>
      <li>I feel so much more comfortable showing my legs since using this product.  </li>
      <li>It washes from your hands easily, it doesn&#x27;t stain, and it does not give an orange color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>Perfect blend for dark skin</li>
      <li>Goes on easy and smooth.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great covers all imperfections and give legs and are even a tanned glowing color not orange or yellow tinted</li>
      <li>Awesome as usual.</li>
      <li>I can see using this for special nights out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall good product .</li>
      <li>do need to be aware of the product transferring to other surfaces such as your clothing, but I&#x27;m impressed that it doesn&#x27;t rub off that easily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>.looks great on my skin for a medium brown African American .</li>
      <li>It also held up to a full day of being outdoors in high humidity.</li>
      <li>A finished look without the discomfort of stockings during hot weather.</li>
      <li>Covers imperfections in legs great and looks natural , gives a slightly darker tan look</li>
      <li>I will say, whatever you are trying to cover up is barely noticeable this product will work, if you want your legs to just look smooth the product will work.</li>
      <li>and i actually i really like it</li>
      <li>I use it often, this hides blemished VERY well.  </li>
      <li>This product goes on very easily over a little moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Does not completely hide scares but it smooth out</li>
      <li>I feel free now because I&#x27;m not wearing stockings, long skirts, or slacks in 90 degree weather unless I want too!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for hiding tan lines on occasion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two years now and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>other than that product was fine</li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised it works!</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>The color is good though and I would probably purchase it again if it cost just a little less.</li>
      <li>so i opted for dark so their would be significant color.</li>
      <li>The color is quite natural with just the amount of sheer/translucency so that you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;see&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve got to say it really surprised me.</li>
      <li>I am naturally very light-skinned, but I work outside all day and get major tan lines on my arms and ankles.</li>
      <li>This product worked surprisngly well on the run when i needed to wear skirts or dresses out last minute, if your concern is color then dot be as it looks like a natural tan not orange or too green and washed off really easily with a loofa and soup.</li>
      <li>I bought this product before going to hawaii in may of 2014, the main reason was that i wanted to hide minor stretch marks on my stomach</li>
      <li>I am a senior (over 65) and stopped going bare leg years.</li>
      <li>The downside is that is does rub off on your clothes and furniture if you are not careful.  </li>

<li> I had high expectations, the product did slightly cover up the discoloration but not as well as I hoped.</li>
<li> It works looks like regular make up but does not smudge as much however, it appears kinda chalky on your skin but too much just make your legs looks fake...</li>
<li> also i waited a while this time to let it dry last time</li>
<li> Should have bad better instructions...</li>
<li> It partially covers a tattoo I have on my leg and my &amp;#34;strawberry legs&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> I did apply it with 1/2 lotion, but I am not sure that was necessary.</li>
<li> The &amp;#34;DEEP&amp;#34; is probably too dark for me, even wen used sparingly.</li>
<li> It is like rubbing dark makeup on your skin.  </li>
<li> As a black woman I normally don&#x27;t find leg makeup/tanners that can actually cover my blemish and scars, from a nasty bout of childhood eczema, but this does and I was receiving compliments the whole evening on my legs.</li>
<li> but it covers leg imperfections like scars and slight varicose veins</li>
<li> I take a tissue after my legs have dried and buff off the &amp;#34;dust.&amp;#34;  </li>
<li> and when i tried this product in hawaii it was messy and my stomach itched .</li>
<li> even when i apply a few layers i still see them.</li>
<li> It made my legs look ashy and pale.  </li>
<li> what a bummer and in my case a waste of money!</li>
<li> It is very thin, even thinner</li>
<li> My tan lines were very faint</li>
<li> I am very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <li> I can finally wear short skirts. I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Should have bad better instructions... other than that product was fine</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen has a good product here if you have skin that burns rather than tans as I do and want to hide that fact.  It is like rubbing dark makeup on your skin.  The downside is that is does rub off on your clothes and furniture if you are not careful.  I take a tissue after my legs have dried and buff off the &amp;#34;dust.&amp;#34;  This helps quite a bit.  The color is good though and I would probably purchase it again if it cost just a little less.</li>
    <li> I used this to smooth out my legs and bikin area and it works wonders! Love this!</li>
    <li> I feel so much more comfortable showing my legs since using this product.  I am a senior (over 65) and stopped going bare leg years. I feel free now because I&#x27;m not wearing stockings, long skirts, or slacks in 90 degree weather unless I want too!</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! A finished look without the discomfort of stockings during hot weather. Grea coverage for those unsightly veins and scars.</li>
    <li> Now this is a great product.  I use it often, this hides blemished VERY well.  I think I will buy another and gift it to my mom.</li>
    <li> I love it !!!! A +++++&lt;br /&gt;Super RECOMMEND !</li>
    <li> My 3 sons (ages 25,19 &amp; 18) do not like it on me. And I respect their opinion. The &amp;#34;DEEP&amp;#34; is probably too dark for me, even wen used sparingly. However, a shade lighter would probably be great!</li>
    <li> I am not a tanner. I have never been to a tanning bed, and I do not lay out in the sun. I get my tan while doing outdoor activities I like. So, when I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review, I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt; I must say, I am surprised at how impressed I am with this product. It is easy to apply and is not greasy. There isn&#x27;t a drying time, it instantly absorbs.&lt;br /&gt; It also held up to a full day of being outdoors in high humidity. It does not transfer to clothing or seat cushions.&lt;br /&gt; It washes from your hands easily, it doesn&#x27;t stain, and it does not give an orange color.&lt;br /&gt; I can see using this for special nights out.&lt;br /&gt;‪#‎SallyHansen‬ ‪#‎AirbrushLegs‬ ‪#‎Influenster‬ ‪#‎InfluensterVox</li>
    <li> After teaching ballet for over 40 years, my legs had many spider veins and I was unable to hide them until I discovered this Sally Hansen product.</li>
    <li> This product goes on very easily over a little moisturizer.  It looks as though I&#x27;ve had a week of sun.  I even use it on my hands and arms.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two years now and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> nice product, good delivery time nice quality</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your legs and make them look really good! The color is quite natural with just the amount of sheer/translucency so that you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will even use a bit on my face as a bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to be aware of the product transferring to other surfaces such as your clothing, but I&#x27;m impressed that it doesn&#x27;t rub off that easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep in on hand year-round.</li>
    <li> So much better than the spray. Covers imperfections in legs great and looks natural , gives a slightly darker tan look .looks great on my skin for a medium brown African American .</li>
    <li> product says deep dark..did not do anything for me..bummer!!</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time this past weekend on a night out and I&#x27;ve got to say it really surprised me. As a black woman I normally don&#x27;t find leg makeup/tanners that can actually cover my blemish and scars, from a nasty bout of childhood eczema, but this does and I was receiving compliments the whole evening on my legs. I will definitely repurchase this product and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product. It is very thin, even thinner then some facial liquid make up. this product did not conceal any of my scars on my legs...what a bummer and in my case a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Used it to bleach knots on lace front. Awesome job!</li>
    <li> Perfect blend for dark skin</li>
    <li> Flawless legs will buy again</li>
    <li> I wished it was a bit heavier to conceal my veins in their entirety even when i apply a few layers i still see them. But I guess its better than nothing</li>
    <li> This stuff works great covers all imperfections and give legs and are even a tanned glowing color not orange or yellow tinted</li>
    <li> I had high expectations, the product did slightly cover up the discoloration but not as well as I hoped. I will say, whatever you are trying to cover up is barely noticeable this product will work, if you want your legs to just look smooth the product will work.</li>
    <li> Overall good product . It&#x27;s not a sunless tanner but it&#x27;s more of a tan makeup for your legs it washes off my legs with soap and water but I had to use soap because it&#x27;s water resistant but it covers leg imperfections like scars and slight varicose veins give a more flawless appeal and look.</li>
    <li> It works looks like regular make up but does not smudge as much however, it appears kinda chalky on your skin but too much just make your legs looks fake...Does not completely hide scares but it smooth out the texture of your legs scares are still visible especially deep scares.</li>
    <li> Great for women of colr.  I use it for spots on my legs and feet.  Pleasantly surprised it works!</li>
    <li> Goes on easy and smooth. Covers all imperfections and doesnt have the shimmery glitter effects like the spray on version. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> As a woman of color, this looks great on my legs!  I use it every time I wear a dress or skirt.  It stays put too.  The more you add the more coverage this product will provide.  It partially covers a tattoo I have on my leg and my &amp;#34;strawberry legs&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I am a medium complexion so i opted for dark so their would be significant color. This product worked surprisngly well on the run when i needed to wear skirts or dresses out last minute, if your concern is color then dot be as it looks like a natural tan not orange or too green and washed off really easily with a loofa and soup.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I love that it doesn&#x27;t rub off on seats or clothing. Stays all day. I can&#x27;t wait to go swimming with it on. It&#x27;s waterproof...wow! Unless you have perfect legs, I highly recommend this. Great for us women of color. The &amp;#34;Deep&amp;#34; is perfect for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Am so in love with Sally airbrush lotion it&#x27;s work wonderful.</li>
    <li> It made my legs look ashy and pale.  Threw it out after a couple of use.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product before going to hawaii in may of 2014, the main reason was that i wanted to hide minor stretch marks on my stomach and when i tried this product in hawaii it was messy and my stomach itched . I basically did not give the product credit because i thought it wasnt for me also i waited a while this time to let it dry last time i tried it i rushed to the beach and it got all over my boyfriends clothes when we posed for a selfie lol, while cleaning i found it a year later read trhe instructions and rubbed it on, it blended well and i actually i really like it and i will be using it on my legs as well.&lt;br /&gt;i am latina caramel coffee skin and although is a tiny bit darker just blend and rub and its perfecto!!&lt;br /&gt;i will be trying the spay one</li>
    <li> Awesome as usual. Literally, the best thing that has happened for me</li>
    <li> I am naturally very light-skinned, but I work outside all day and get major tan lines on my arms and ankles. I recently had an event to go to that would show these lines, and I was looking for something to hide them. This product worked great! My tan lines were very faint - I was extremely pleased. I did apply it with 1/2 lotion, but I am not sure that was necessary. Highly recommend for hiding tan lines on occasion.</li>
