      <li>It was very light, and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
      <li>I was looking for the older Herbal Essence rinse that I guess has been replaced by this one.</li>

    <li> I love this product!!!  The scent is to die for... And overall the product is just amazing. The shipper did a wonderful job  delivering the product.  Definitely would buy more products through this company</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner not only because of the great result, actually I love the scent. Makes u feel nice and fresh all day long. ..</li>
    <li> I was sent a free sample of this from Influenster and honestly it works amazingly. Within just a few washes I could definiltey see a difference in my hair. It was way shinier and healthier! It is a fabulous drugstore product that compares to many higher end drugstore brands. I am absolutley in love with it!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioerand use it ever day!</li>
    <li> This does a great job and the scent is wonderful, lasts for a long time. I&#x27;m happy to have found it&#x27;s still being made.</li>
    <li> It works good on first bottle</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Leaves my hair soft and smelling great.  Love all the herbal essences products!</li>
    <li> I almost had a coronary when I discovered they were bringing this back. I have been sulfate &amp; silicone-free for about 8 years so for me to use something with both those things means it&#x27;s pretty spectacular (I actually only use these to wash out coconut oil after I&#x27;ve done a deep conditioning treatment, to soften the damage). Well, as a shampoo and conditioner it is nothing at all special. But that smell certainly takes me back. Now I just need to watch if Bath &amp; Body Works brings back Plumeria. Then I&#x27;ll be set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy Herbal Essences brought back this line. This conditioner has an irresistible scent and gives my hair major shine with no buildup. I have fine hair and this conditioner is perfect for my hair type because it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. There is a lot to love about this conditioner, but the scent is really the best part...it&#x27;s divine and doesn&#x27;t fade all day. Love it!</li>
    <li> I find it kind of misleading that their sulfate-containing shampoo advertises &amp;#34;0% silicone,&amp;#34; and the dimethicone-containing conditioner advertises &amp;#34;0% sulfate.&amp;#34; I figured both descriptions applied to both the shampoo and conditioner.
