      <li>If Clairol discontinues Brass free I will dye!</li>
      <li>After rinsing, most of my hair was a rust color, with blaze orange at the temples.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE the lightest brown.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair so shiny, strong and healthy, even my hairdresser complimented it (and he&#x27;s against store-bought hair color, not surprinsingly).</li>
      <li>Easy to use, virtually on odor, and lasts the 28 washes or maybe even more.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I also feel it is easy on my hair.  </li>
      <li>This color fades very, very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Fine, arrived in timely manor</li>

      <li>(i ordered the light brown color.)</li>
      <li>My hair color is brass free light brown.</li>
      <li>My hair was dyed really light blond though.</li>
      <li>I get good coverage till the next application.</li>
      <li>It gives me my true hair color and washes out after 28 washes.</li>
      <li>Great color- doesn&#x27;t cover grey very well.</li>
      <li>I just used the color refresher for the first time, yuck!</li>
      <li>But after only the first use, my hair is even more brassy, with more golden/reddish tones than it had before.  </li>
      <li>and it really is brass free plus</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a very gentle nonpermanent color.</li>
      <li>It is hard to find this color in stores, so I am happy that Amazon carries this shade.  </li>
      <li>Great deal but slow shipping</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d better leave well enough</li>
      <li>I would like to wash it a couple more times, but it&#x27;s already starting to break.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Clairol Brass Free Natural Instincts hair coloring for over a year now.  </li>
      <li>I debated between 4 and 5 stars but decided to give 5 stars because I never like my hair at first.</li>
      <li>I love this product and it is the only one that does not makes my hair brassy over time.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
      <li>I have used Natural Instincts for several years with fairly good results, except that after a couple of weeks the color fades to a brassy golden brown, not my natural ash brown color.      </li>
      <li>love this color, hard to find brass free anymore!</li>
      <li>The main 1st step color was fast easy and accurate color on dry hair.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply and lasting.</li>
      <li>So, you&#x27;re left with something that just fades very, very quickly.  </li>
      <li>That would have been the smart thing to do.</li>
      <li>The product is not totally brass free, I still have coppery highlights.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad this company went back to its old product.</li>
      <li>I really like this particular shade.</li>
      <li>I tried the color refresh the first time I ever used natural instincts and</li>
      <li>Not good since my skin color is so fair.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t give the refresher a rating, because 1 is too high.</li>
      <li>But at the time I chose a much darker color than my natural color</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it recently, so I tried this product, putting some on the roots 5 minutes and then putting the rest on the long strands of my hair for an additional 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I used this as an opportunity to try a new shade.  </li>
      <li>As it is brass - free,  my hair doesn&#x27;t get that brassy look that other hair color products do to my hair even professional coloring.</li>
      <li>It turned out way too red and totally different than the original shade.  </li>
      <li>I usually pay quite a bit more in the drug store, unless it&#x27;s on sale</li>
      <li>had the impression that the refresher wasn&#x27;t specific to each color, but I expected it to be brass free.</li>
      <li>I use a shade that&#x27;s a bit darker than my natural color</li>
      <li>I use once a month, shampoo frequently and it lasts.</li>
      <li>Looks and feels natural.</li>
      <li>I tried just the regular natural instincts in a lighter color and it only lasted 2 weeks which is kinda what I expected, then I decided to try the brass free version</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product highly to any one who doesn&#x27;t want red hair color.</li>
      <li>Works very well to cover grey.  </li>
      <li>They recently retired my Natural Instincts color</li>
      <li>This gets too me quickly and both my Wife and I use the same color, hers on dark brown hair and mine on white hair.</li>
      <li>Hard to find locally, and I like the brass free aspect.</li>
      <li>Had a social engagement</li>
      <li>so even when it starts washing out the grey strands look like soft highlights.</li>
      <li>Wanted a light brown, minimal redness and I throw out the touch up having tried it a few times with different colors but the touch up is all the same regardless if borwn or blod turns you hair read so throw out the touch up, use the regular color and hope they don&#x27;t stop making this one</li>
      <li>I have thin hair, easily damaged.</li>
      <li>so naturally I wanted something a little closer to my natural color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My daughter likes the end result. I see a hint of red in the sunlight. My hair was dyed really light blond though. Maybe this has something to do with it. I debated between 4 and 5 stars but decided to give 5 stars because I never like my hair at first. I have to say I do like the hair color. I&#x27;m just not sure if it is the correct color for me but that has nothing to do whether the color is nice or not and it is. My biggest concern with dyeing my hair was to not have any red tint. I dyed my hair once brown and it was as red as could be. Not good since my skin color is so fair.</li>
    <li> Great deal but slow shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used the product yet, but I have used the brand MANY times so I know it well. The price was great! I usually pay quite a bit more in the drug store, unless it&#x27;s on sale and I have a coupon too.</li>
    <li> I just used the color refresher for the first time, yuck! My hair color is brass free light brown. The refresher is dark orange brown. I shampooed immediately and got most of it out but will never use it again!I had the impression that the refresher wasn&#x27;t specific to each color, but I expected it to be brass free. If it hadn&#x27;t been for the refresher I would have given it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> Demi permanent is the way to go.  Won&#x27;t damage hair. Grey shows as highlights!</li>
    <li> Love this product but can no longer find it in stores, so finding it on Amazon was great!</li>
    <li> I have used Natural Instincts for several years with fairly good results, except that after a couple of weeks the color fades to a brassy golden brown, not my natural ash brown color.      I tried this product hoping it would remove the brassy tones from the faded previous color. But after only the first use, my hair is even more brassy, with more golden/reddish tones than it had before.  I followed the directions exactly.  I could not be more disappointed and now I&#x27;m going to have to shell out bucks to a colorist to fix it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a number of years.  I really like this particular shade. I also feel it is easy on my hair.  I use it once per month, and then never have exposed gray roots.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for those that like to color their hair but not dye it. Color doesn&#x27;t last 4 weeks. Usually have to ally color to roots every 2 weeks</li>
    <li> I love this product and it is the only one that does not makes my hair brassy over time. If Clairol discontinues Brass free I will dye! Get it? dye.</li>
    <li> Love the color!  Great product!  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> The main 1st step color was fast easy and accurate color on dry hair.  After 2 weeks, per directions, in the shower applied the 2nd step touchup product.  Turned my hair orange red.  Had a social engagement so did emergency recolor with Loreal. Called 1-800-Clairol with product package lot number for the stuff that made orange hair - they said they would mail me a refund check.  Never again.</li>
    <li> They recently retired my Natural Instincts color and I used this as an opportunity to try a new shade.  LOVE LOVE LOVE the lightest brown.  The color was not brassy at all and looked great.  But...when I tried the &#x27;week 2 color fresh&#x27; pouch after two weeks...I was soooo disappointed with the results.  I carefully read the instructions and followed them.  It turned out way too red and totally different than the original shade.  I don&#x27;t understand why they would think I want a completely different color!  It makes zero sense.  I plan to continue to purchase the product but not use the pouch.</li>
    <li> I used natural instincts for the first time about nine months ago and loved it! But at the time I chose a much darker color than my natural color so it lasted a lot longer, this time around I was trying to grow my roots out so naturally I wanted something a little closer to my natural color. I tried just the regular natural instincts in a lighter color and it only lasted 2 weeks which is kinda what I expected, then I decided to try the brass free version and it really is brass free plus its been two weeks already and its hardly faded! I tried the color refresh the first time I ever used natural instincts and it was okay but like other reviewers said it turned my hair a bit orange so since then I&#x27;ve just put it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Great color- doesn&#x27;t cover grey very well.</li>
    <li> Hard to find locally, and I like the brass free aspect. Pleased with this purchase. Also recommended to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this products for many years.  I love it!  It always produces great results.  I have troubles finding my color in my town so it is awesome this online option is available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad this company went back to its old product. Easy to apply and lasting. I use once a month, shampoo frequently and it lasts. Looks and feels natural. Have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> The product is not totally brass free, I still have coppery highlights.  Overall, I like the color and except for a few gray hairs I get good coverage till the next application.</li>
    <li> One way or other this is not the quality it should be...two weeks later and color is gone.  Not the usual quality from this brand.</li>
    <li> This color fades very, very quickly.  Apparently, Clairol knew this and in the past included a two week color booster.  The color booster is gone now.  So, you&#x27;re left with something that just fades very, very quickly.  Unless you want to color every two weeks, I suggest you skip this product.  I bought it for years and I&#x27;ll be moving on.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Nice color IF it covers.  Does not cover grey well at all even after leaving on for the maximum time.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair, easily damaged. I tried this product years ago and have been using it ever since. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s for people with lots of grey hair but for me it&#x27;s perfect. It covers, lasts about 4 to 5 weeks and I wash my hair every day. I use a shade that&#x27;s a bit darker than my natural color so even when it starts washing out the grey strands look like soft highlights. It leaves my hair so shiny, strong and healthy, even my hairdresser complimented it (and he&#x27;s against store-bought hair color, not surprinsingly). My hair turns orange very easily, but not with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clairol Brass Free Natural Instincts hair coloring for over a year now.  I love this product and so does my beautician.  I take this to my hairdresser who mixes this up and puts it on for me.  I think she can do a better job of getting it through my hair than I do.</li>
    <li> Finally something that doesn&#x27;t put red in your hair color. I would recommend this product highly to any one who doesn&#x27;t want red hair color.</li>
    <li> love this color, hard to find brass free anymore!</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry and brittle due to a medical condition. I&#x27;ve been using a very gentle nonpermanent color. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it recently, so I tried this product, putting some on the roots 5 minutes and then putting the rest on the long strands of my hair for an additional 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were a little darker than I expected, but acceptable. There was a minimal reddish tint, but less than with the color I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural Instincts was a little harsher than my previous color. I&#x27;ve had some breakage since coloring my hair. The conditioner included in the kit helps a lot, but there was only enough for a couple of applications. If I could buy a bottle of the conditioner, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward two weeks. Gray was beginning to show at my temples, so I opened the refresher packet and found a product that reminded me of shoe polish. I almost discarded it. That would have been the smart thing to do. Instead, I put it on my hair for three minutes. After rinsing, most of my hair was a rust color, with blaze orange at the temples. I shampooed vigorously twice more, and now my hair is a coppery color with faintly orange temples. I would like to wash it a couple more times, but it&#x27;s already starting to break. I&#x27;d better leave well enough alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could rate the components of this kit separately, I would give the color a 4 and the conditioner a 5. I wouldn&#x27;t give the refresher a rating, because 1 is too high. It&#x27;s like that useless little packet of artificial flavoring that comes in a package of ramen noodles. Throw it away.</li>
    <li> Color is perfect for me. Wanted a light brown, minimal redness and I throw out the touch up having tried it a few times with different colors but the touch up is all the same regardless if borwn or blod turns you hair read so throw out the touch up, use the regular color and hope they don&#x27;t stop making this one</li>
    <li> Works very well to cover grey.  It is hard to find this color in stores, so I am happy that Amazon carries this shade.  Easy to use, virtually on odor, and lasts the 28 washes or maybe even more.</li>
    <li> Fine, arrived in timely manor</li>
    <li> Made my grays look blonde, not brown. (i ordered the light brown color.) It looked like I got highlights instead of covering the gray. I bought a 3 pack and tried each one for longer than the last. Same results. I would buy a more potent brand/version.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for several years but is hard to find in the store. This gets too me quickly and both my Wife and I use the same color, hers on dark brown hair and mine on white hair. Gives us both the effect we want without the brassiness.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a couple of years. As it is brass - free,  my hair doesn&#x27;t get that brassy look that other hair color products do to my hair even professional coloring. It gives me my true hair color and washes out after 28 washes.</li>
    <li> This haircolor always turns out perfect when I use it.  It never turns reddish on me like all other brands I&#x27;ve used. This product is simple to use and the color is as reflected on the box.</li>
</ol>
