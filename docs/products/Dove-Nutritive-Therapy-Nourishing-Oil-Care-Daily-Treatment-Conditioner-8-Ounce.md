      <li>so I order it in large quantities whenever I find it at a good price.</li>

<li> So apparently the images got a bit mixed up...</li>
<li> My only complaints are that I wish a tube lasted longer and that, because the consistently is so thick, I need to clean out globs that don&#x27;t wash down the sink from the tub in a regular basis.</li>
<li> Only need about a Quarter sized dollop for my long hair.</li>
<li> My hair is long and can get frizzy if not managed correctly.</li>
<li> I like the way this product makes my hair feel, but I have stopped using it, due to the warnings on the EWG Skin Deep website, the website that tells you which cosmetic chemicals will hurt you.</li>
<li> I have naturally curly hair and need a conditioner that is thick &amp; heavy enough to weigh it down without making it stiff.</li>
<li> It conditions well, without weighing hair down.</li>
<li> Does not weigh hair down.</li>
<li> Unfortunately this item has become harder to find in the last 6 months</li>
<li> I have been using this conditioner for a few months.  </li>
<li> Waste of money even if its brandnew.</li>
<li> This product weighed down my hair like crazy.</li>
<li> As the cementary of products under my bathroom sink can attest to my curls are very hard to control.</li>
<li> I use it on my kids hair and no more tangles!!</li>
<li> Tried all kinds of expensive stuff.</li>
<li> So disappointed that I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore :-(</li>
<li> Piece of crap! .</li>

    <li> it&#x27;s excellent.  good shipping.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for a few months.  It conditions well, without weighing hair down. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it smells great too.</li>
    <li> Very nice conditioner.  Light weight but makes your hair soft and manageable while combing.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great! I use it on my kids hair and no more tangles!! However, I have to say that the ad was a bit misleading... The picture shows 2 bottles.. I only received 1.. Come to find out when I chose the quantity of 2, only 1 bottle shows.. So apparently the images got a bit mixed up... So I might have held off purchasing this for the price of just one, but the product itself is fabulous.</li>
    <li> As the cementary of products under my bathroom sink can attest to my curls are very hard to control. But this product is amazing!! I use it as a leave in and do not need anything else. So disappointed that I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore :-(</li>
    <li> What strange is that the version they sell in asia is much better quality. Texture, smell, and overall effectiveness is better with the asian version.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this conditioner. My hair is long and can get frizzy if not managed correctly. This is the only conditioner that I feel actually makes a difference. My only complaints are that I wish a tube lasted longer and that, because the consistently is so thick, I need to clean out globs that don&#x27;t wash down the sink from the tub in a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Tried all kinds of expensive stuff. This is the best! Leaves hair so soft and manageable for days.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and researched a good conditioner to help with tangles and conditioning my curls.  I read good things about this and it really is a great product!  I don&#x27;t get tangled curls and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or slimy after using it.  It&#x27;s very dense but still washes out well.  I think it smells amazing too!!</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner that work for me. My hair as never been so soft and manageable !!!!!!!!!!!  I will buy again</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and need a conditioner that is thick &amp; heavy enough to weigh it down without making it stiff. I use it as a leave-in conditioner. Unfortunately this item has become harder to find in the last 6 months so I order it in large quantities whenever I find it at a good price.</li>
    <li> This product weighed down my hair like crazy. I don&#x27;t have super fine hair at all, but this product was just too heavy.</li>

    <li> Works as well as much higher priced conditioners that I have tried. Does not weigh hair down. Great price. Only need about a Quarter sized dollop for my long hair.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner and as I have recently been unable to locate it in any retailer near me, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. Bought several, and hope dove continues to manufacture this product. Works great!</li>
    <li> Really good product! Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Best Hair Conditioner so far</li>
    <li> Waste of money even if its brandnew. Save your money and get a stereo type headphones. Piece of crap! .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice conditioner that leaves hair soft and with a shine.  It has some flagrance when you apply it, but it goes away once hair dries.</li>
    <li> Best thing for my dry damaged hair! Just wash and leave it in as a leave-in-conditioner!</li>
    <li> Love this very thick conditioner controls frizz very well. will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> BEST CONDITIONER I HAVE EVER USED. BETTER THAN PRICEY BRANDS</li>
