      <li>COOL !!</li>
      <li>I liked this better, and my hair felt better.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why they made the bottle four times as large with lots of air space, but the product is great if you like space-age synthetic silicone in your hair.</li>
      <li>(yes the one for cooking), Paul Mitchell and many others</li>
      <li>I tried this stuff and my hair has never felt so healthy.</li>
      <li>Yes, if you use this you WILL have to shampoo with something stronger than a co-wash or lo-poo shampoo to get rid of the silicone buildup, but for me personally, it&#x27;s worth the exchange to get my hair looking this good.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS</li>
      <li>Using more, or putting it on dry(er) hair may be why some people had issues.</li>
      <li>Frizz Ease Crme, ( made it feel better ) but</li>
      <li>OK THATS</li>
      <li>So most days I can not make more than 2 hours without looking like something the dog just dragged in.</li>
      <li>Without it, I would not be able to untangle my hair.</li>
      <li>For once I enjoyed being out in humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff is AWESOME, I have finally found something that works for my hair!!!</li>
      <li>I love to use it on my curly weaves</li>
      <li>This stuff is wonderful; my hair was totally unmanageable before I started using this product.</li>
      <li>Tames my hair so I&#x27;m not a big, ole fuzzy head and makes me look great!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Mostly rain.</li>
      <li>I love it and will continue to buy more.</li>
      <li>Love using this product</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>but this product seems to be the most reliable.  </li>
      <li>is my favorite go to product because it is so reliable.  </li>
      <li>I have also noticed that using it over time helps with it working better.</li>
      <li>I started using this product more than 15 years ago</li>
      <li>This is a great product I recommend for anyone looking to try a new product that helps control frizz or hair that sometimes does not want to fall into place.</li>
      <li>This is wonderful for dry damaged hair.</li>
      <li>Love this product and hope it is always available.</li>
      <li>Received early and great price.</li>
      <li>Great for naturally curly hair that frizzes up with moisture in the air.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work perfectly, but I naturally have very frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Tames the frizz and makes hair easy to comb through.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant about this type of product because my hair is fine.  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m thinking with more time and familiarity I can get that number even higher!</li>
      <li>noticed a huge difference in the way my hair responded to blow drying.</li>
      <li>ordered a free sample of this stuff, and</li>
      <li>Smells great and definitely tames around 70% of my unruly hair.</li>
      <li>it makes it so smooth and shiny and since it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair at 420 degrees</li>
      <li>I have light weight curly hair that will frizz without this product.</li>
      <li>frizz free.</li>
      <li>so I use two, mostly on the ends, and the bottle should last a good while at that rate.</li>
      <li>The serum holds up nicely and also gives my hair a nice healthy shine without weighing the hair down.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still golden blonde, still flat-ironing and curling and damaging my hair as we all do, but it looks shiny and gorgeous and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Try pure argan oil instead--it&#x27;s much better for your hair.</li>
      <li>I apply one pump to wet hair and blow it out and it feels and looks great.</li>
      <li>Plus I like it better straight.</li>
      <li>Defrizzes but made my fine straight hair look greasy even though I had just washed it!</li>
      <li>Make sure you use only a pea-sized amount, anything more will leave your hair looking greasy.  </li>
      <li>Works quite well for my super frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the serum, you put it on and notice instant difference in the way your hair feels.</li>
      <li>Just smooth the dot of product out on your palms first, then work it into your hair.  </li>
      <li>I live across the street from the Cumberland River so it&#x27;s safe to say that humidity can sometimes be a problem.</li>
      <li>it is good, make my dry hair looks silk.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair very shiny and makes it easy for me to comp myself.</li>
      <li>this product is worth a try.</li>
      <li>An old favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
      <li>My friend liked it a lot, but having no computer skills, she couldn&#x27;t order it without external help.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight formula keeps my hair looking fresh while making it easier for me to style my hair.</li>
      <li>lol I really couldn&#x27;t have moved down here without it</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now, however, even my stylist comments on how long, silky and strong my hair is becoming.  </li>
      <li>For some reason, I found myself buying this when I went back to the states to visit family and started using it again - and from the first, my hair was amazing - just like it used to be when I first started using it all those years ago.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works quite well for my super frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Love using this product</li>
    <li> I live in Houston where it is very humid. I apply one pump to wet hair and blow it out and it feels and looks great. I use the hairspray when I&#x27;m finished and it does the job. Highly recommend both.</li>
    <li> No one can beat John Frieda in the hair frizz business &amp; he deserves the Nobel prize for this wonderful bottle of clear jel,</li>
    <li> It works well enough. Doesn&#x27;t eliminate frizz but tames it somewhat. What I don&#x27;t understand is why John Frieda chose to redesign the bottle when product volume has remained the same. The new packaging is much bigger, less environmental-friendly and takes up more space in a travel case than it used to. Why would you do that?</li>
    <li> I tried Frizz Ease because the hair around my forehead is really frizzy.  I saw a little improvement but it made my skin breakout badly.  I decided it didn&#x27;t work well enough to be worth the skin problems.</li>
    <li> I got this to use for travel. Does what it&#x27;s mean to do so will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this every time I wash my hair. It makes my hair very shiny and makes it easy for me to comp myself. Without it, I would not be able to untangle my hair. It doesn&#x27;t make the hair too fatty looking and keeps the frizz away.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and live in a very humid area.  This product made my hair super soft and actually had curls in the summer and not a head full of fuzz :)</li>
    <li> Great for thin hair. It tames my flyaways but doesn&#x27;t weight the hair down.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have known about this 40+ years ago. Until this year, I thought that my wavy, frizzed out hair, was just a fact.  This makes my hair feel healthy and it lays flat.  I use it all the time and now my hair is predictable.</li>
    <li> I no longer need to accept my frizz as something I cannot change. With a little squirt of this stuff right after a shower, I&#x27;ve got curly and manageable locks I can be proud of. The serum never feels greasy, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and it smells nice. I&#x27;ll never go without it.</li>
    <li> Have used Frizz-Ease Original Serum for a long time.  Love this product.  Tames the frizz and makes hair easy to comb through.  This is a great price!</li>
    <li> Great product. Really smooths hair and reduces frizz. Better than Living Proof for a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me my first bottle of Frizz-Ease several years ago.  My hair actually started growing, finally.  I thought it would just grow that little bit and that was it.  Frizz-Ease Serum protected the ends of my hair and allowed my hair to grow.  Now I am an avid fan of this product.  Now all my hair-care products are John Frieda.</li>
    <li> This stuff works just as well, if not better than all the expensive salon stuff...and I&#x27;ve used them all. Only use a small amount or it can make your hair stringy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!! I have literally tried almost all the salon brands for smoothing serum and they all seem to weigh down my hair. I tried this stuff and my hair has never felt so healthy. You just can&#x27;t get anything better for the price either! I have short hair and use two pumps after quickly towel drying my hair. I hope they never stop selling this stuff. The best part is the price and that you can get it at almost any grocery/drug store!!!</li>
    <li> Works like a champ, highly recommend for damaged frizz hair</li>
    <li> The picture is what I thought i was going to receive but I didn&#x27;t I got something different...don&#x27;t buy this product it&#x27;s because  false advertisement .</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for ten years now. It makes my hair very shiny and protects it from the abusive hairdryer and curling iron.It&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great if you have curly hair that looks like you stuck your finger in an outlet. I have what you may want to call kinky- curly and just plain nasty hair. I have had to pray for not rain or snow or high humidity and they all happen where I live. So most days I can not make more than 2 hours without looking like something the dog just dragged in. I have been using this for almost 10 years and it is made so much difference that I can handle most days and the hair looks good (not perfect but workable) . I wish they sold this in larger sizes but this will work.I would recommend this to anyone who has wild hair like I have.</li>
    <li> This product is filled with silicones which build up on your hair and won&#x27;t let new moisture in, making it more dry than it was before using it. Try pure argan oil instead--it&#x27;s much better for your hair. (Just make sure to get PURE argan oil, not one that&#x27;s mixed with other stuff like silicones.)</li>
    <li> Tames my hair so I&#x27;m not a big, ole fuzzy head and makes me look great! And only takes a couple of dabs. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help tame my absolutely wild and frizzy hair and have not been disappointed. My hair is smooth and tame, allowing me to keep my naturally curly hair without worrying about looking like I just bathed in oil or walked through a wing tunnel. It&#x27;s lightweight formula keeps my hair looking fresh while making it easier for me to style my hair. I have not noticed any oily or sticky residue, and as an individual with scalp psoriasis, this product has not irritated or made my condition worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister started using this product to help protect her hair from the damage caused by her hairdryer and straightener, and she loves it as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!</li>
    <li> this is the only solution to southwest Florida hair days lol I really couldn&#x27;t have moved down here without it</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work perfectly, but I naturally have very frizzy hair. I think that this product has helped a lot with taming it. I have also noticed that using it over time helps with it working better.</li>
    <li> I have that unfortunate hair that isn&#x27;t straight but also isn&#x27;t curly. Its the awkward wavy frizzy type if it isn&#x27;t blown dry and styled. I can use this serum and not blow dry my hair and it doesn&#x27;t turn into a frizzy mess which is a miracle. I also use this if I am going to blow dry it and it helps my hair look super shiny and straight with no fly aways. I love it and will continue to buy more.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the serum, you put it on and notice instant difference in the way your hair feels. Does not weigh it down.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for calming my frizzy hair.  I have thin, curly hair.  I squirt of this product keeps my hair curly and cuts down a bit of the frizz.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product coincidentally happened to be one of the rainiest, most humid, sticky, windy and messy days ever.  Torrential downpour and blustery gusts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally it would all be over,  and my head of hair would turn to complete frizz, to the point where I wouldn&#x27;t be able to even comb or brush it: essentially hopeless and horrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe it when my hair stayed soft and simply got a little curly.  I also couldn&#x27;t believe the relief that was.  For once I enjoyed being out in humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only question for long time users:  does it damage hair if used over prolonged periods of time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: instructions say to use only an amount equal to the size of a dime and to work it into completely WET hair.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that would be enough for my long hair.  But it definitely was.  Just smooth the dot of product out on your palms first, then work it into your hair.  Using more, or putting it on dry(er) hair may be why some people had issues.</li>
    <li> A must have for curly hair. Tames my frizz immediately. If I straighten my hair after using this, it looks soooo sleek and shiny. I use this everyday, I can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to get that wiry gray middle aged dry hair and though I color it, it still looks pretty rough most days, particularly after a wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff goes in your hair just after you wash it, while it&#x27;s still very wet (the bottle says soaking wet). You don&#x27;t use much at all--it suggests one pump but I have long thick hair so I use two, mostly on the ends, and the bottle should last a good while at that rate. It doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair like leave-in conditioners do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it in combination with John Frieda Frizz-Ease Touch-Up Creme (which you put on when your hair is dry) and my hair is pretty smooth; I&#x27;d say 90% smoother than it was, but I probably could use a haircut to get rid of split ends. The best part is that my hair feels soft and natural as opposed to weighed down and sticky like it is when I use a wax.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product. My friend liked it a lot, but having no computer skills, she couldn&#x27;t order it without external help.</li>
    <li> This product can revitalize a perm that has been slept on in seconds. Great for nursing home professionals. It makes the ladies beautiful in a couple comb through.</li>
    <li> I use this as directed and it works great.  Tames fly-aways and makes hair shiny.  My daughter borrowed it and bought it for herself because she also loved it.</li>
    <li> Omg let me start of by saying I use this product everytime I use any heat stylers on my hair and wow not only does it protect my long hair from heat it makes it so smooth and shiny and since it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair at 420 degrees that&#x27;s a ++++ lol it also makes your hair smell great!love it never travel anywhere without it!!💜💜💜💜</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  Works great and you don&#x27;t need a lot.  Price is consistent with what I pay at Target.</li>
    <li> I just received this product only to find that a third of it was spilled all over the inside of the box it was packed in.  Unfortunately, this is an item that is classified as &amp;#34;non returnable&amp;#34; so I paid full price only to receive 2/3&#x27;s of the quantity.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and got it. Mine is dry frizzy hair. This did nothing to my hair. I just wasted money. Anyone with dry and frizzy hair, please dont waste money</li>
    <li> The reviews were promising, but I think it made my hair worse. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but I also have pretty frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I love to use it on my curly weaves</li>
    <li> Great for naturally curly hair that frizzes up with moisture in the air.</li>
    <li> John Frieda has wonderful products.  I like frizz-ease for my curly, fly-away hair!  I am a repeat customer and will continue to be one!</li>
    <li> I love John Frieda&#x27;s hair products! Smells great and definitely tames around 70% of my unruly hair. Sometimes I have to use two pumps - one with wet hair and a touch-up later on dry hair. Not a fan of the greasy residue it leaves on my hands, but that&#x27;s not unique to this serum.</li>
    <li> Defrizzes but made my fine straight hair look greasy even though I had just washed it!</li>
    <li> I have long dark hair that tends to be frizzy and wavy without any product applied.  In humidity I totally give up and keep my hair in a ponytail with lots of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product actually keeps my blow outs for 2 days and prevents light humidity from bringing the waves and frizz back.  However, in high humidity there is no solution that I have found except braids and tight ponytails with lots of hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite go to product because it is so reliable.  I currently have tried Moroccan Oil, Redken Glass, olive oil (yes the one for cooking), Paul Mitchell and many others but this product seems to be the most reliable.  I know it doesn&#x27;t have amazing ingredients that condition hair but it is what works best for me and it isn&#x27;t crazy expensive like many other products I have tried that have ended up in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the small size and price this product is worth a try.</li>
    <li> Product made my hair gummy and like I needed to wash it again to remove the film that was left from this product.  I did not give it one star because I think it was not for my hair type (fine but heavy).</li>
    <li> I WISH I was exaggerating. I&#x27;m not though. After I cut my hair really short it kept sticking up in the back in the way that my cousin called \\&quot;a peacock\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a free sample of this stuff, and oh my word. The peacocky-ness was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I live in Washington State where the weather is either windy or rain. Mostly rain. As any good frizzy haired lady of the West knows, this is hell on your hair. The smell is amazing and I would compare it to the salon, as should be expected from the Frieda&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME, I have finally found something that works for my hair!!! I will be purchasing this again!!!</li>
    <li> Product is not as good as the serum that I have purchased in the past. I should have ordered that instead</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 20 plus years. I have light weight curly hair that will frizz without this product. I can blow it out with a round brush and have it come out frizz free. I follow it up with the finishing spray. (gloss spray)</li>
    <li> Love this product -- it definitely relaxes my hair, leaving no frizz (and is not the least bit greasy).  I only wish the bottle was bigger!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2004ish. It takes my bunk wavy, frizzy hair from what the _ to looking sleek. It also helps my hair air dry much quicker so I can skip blow drying and just use a flat iron.</li>
    <li> So nice to be able to control the frizzies - my hair is wavy, and frizzes pretty badly. Without it, my hair is flyaway and messy, with it, tangles are controlled and my hair is much more shiny and smooth. This product does not completely control my hair, but it makes it so much more manageable and pretty. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for years and have to say it never fails to do what it is supposed to do. My ordering experience was excellent, quick, and easy. The serum lasts forever if you use it according to the directions on the bottle. I only have to use a small amount and as I style my hair it works wonders. I live across the street from the Cumberland River so it&#x27;s safe to say that humidity can sometimes be a problem. The serum holds up nicely and also gives my hair a nice healthy shine without weighing the hair down. This is a great product I recommend for anyone looking to try a new product that helps control frizz or hair that sometimes does not want to fall into place. I use this with wet or dry hair and have had great results.</li>
    <li> Is more oil based than the other John Frieda Frizz Ease in the yellow container, which is more silicone feeling.  I liked this better, and my hair felt better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read other reviews and decided to try this product.  It works great!  I learned to put it on while my hair was still wet, but it really cuts down the frizz while keeping my curls.</li>
    <li> I started using this product more than 15 years ago and I loved it. Then I decided to go the curly girl route (lo-poo to no-poo, no sulfates, no silicones, etc... in an effort to make my hair healthier) and so stopped using this product due its silicone content. Over the years I&#x27;ve found a few really great products that made my hair look pretty good, a lot of useless products that did nothing for my hair, and pretty much had hit or miss hair days ever since. For some reason, I found myself buying this when I went back to the states to visit family and started using it again - and from the first, my hair was amazing - just like it used to be when I first started using it all those years ago. My curls clump like no tomorrow and dry bouncy and shiny. I wish now that I&#x27;d never stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a nickel sized dollop (about 5-6 pumps) to SOAKING wet hair and work it thru, than apply generous Curl Keeper, followed by a couple pumps of AG Recoil then plop my hair with a t-shirt while I shower or otherwise get ready for work, take off the t-shirt, scrunch out the excess water with my pink hand dry hair gloves and then either air dry or diffuse - giving me a great hair day 9 times out of 10 instead of 1 time out of 10. Yes, if you use this you WILL have to shampoo with something stronger than a co-wash or lo-poo shampoo to get rid of the silicone buildup, but for me personally, it&#x27;s worth the exchange to get my hair looking this good. Love it!</li>
    <li> just as bad as the  Strength one ...smells bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not enough wordsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss so I am just going to do this</li>
    <li> Love it for my super curly slightly frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I use this instead of a styling gel or mouse.  It takes the frizz out of my hair and lets my slight natural wave come through.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why they made the bottle four times as large with lots of air space, but the product is great if you like space-age synthetic silicone in your hair. I do. Great stuff. If you want something slightly less effective but 100x more natural, get John Masters Organics.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a huge difference in the way my hair responded to blow drying. 80% less frizz! And I&#x27;m thinking with more time and familiarity I can get that number even higher! Down with frizz, up with Frizz-Ease!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. It really helps to tame the frizz and calm down my hair making it manageable.  Gives good shine too.</li>
    <li> Works the same as the same product I&#x27;ve purchased from the drugstore. A little goes a long way, but too much will make hair greasy. It helps with frizz, and gives some definition to my thin wavy hair.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without this stuff after i curl my hair. one bottle last foreverrrrrrr</li>
    <li> It works. I use it in wet hair and it dries without frizz. Will absolutely continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> This product cuts down frizz a little but for the sticky, greasy mess my hair feels and looks when blown out its definitely not worth it. No I did not apply to my roots, stayed far away applying mainly to my ends and yes, I only applied a dime amount if not less. It&#x27;s a no go for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like my hair to get frizzy. Plus I like it better straight. This product seems to help with both.</li>
    <li> reduces frizz, but does not get rid of it. too much can leave hair greasy and flat</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Worth every cent spent!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years.  It works well at reducing frizz without making your hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about this type of product because my hair is fine.  It is not heavy and just keep my hair soft and helps control frizz. My hair can still curl naturally.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried this serum and it works really well.  I have dark wavy hair and the serum helps tame it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it both before and after blow drying, and it did nothing. My hair was still poofy all over, and frizzy. All this made it do was look oily, even though I didn&#x27;t put it on the roots. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s the same as any other product for curly hair&#x3D; full of lies.</li>
    <li> it is good, make my dry hair looks silk.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful; my hair was totally unmanageable before I started using this product.I will be buying several more.</li>
    <li> Received early and great price.</li>
    <li> Love it works great for my child. Great product  happy happy</li>
    <li> I wish I had known about this product years ago.  My hair has always been on the thick side, but dry and brittle (yes, I color it frequently.  I like to be blonde, what can I say?).  Previously it wouldn&#x27;t grow past my shoulder blades - it kept breaking and I would get split ends and have to trim it constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, however, even my stylist comments on how long, silky and strong my hair is becoming.  It isn&#x27;t an overnight result, although the smoothness did happen overnight, but the length is definitely extending and the strength of my hair is unbelievable.  I&#x27;m still golden blonde, still flat-ironing and curling and damaging my hair as we all do, but it looks shiny and gorgeous and healthy.  Love this product and hope it is always available.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping works as intended.</li>
    <li> An old favorite. I have dense, frizzy, and naturally curly (kinky in the humidity) hair. It&#x27;s very long and very hard to brush without help. Frizz Ease does the trick and has saved me a lot of pain and discomfort. It tames the frizz and makes it much, much easier to brush when wet. I can even comb it when wet without any problem. That&#x27;s almost a miracle. Just sayin&#x27;....</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of the Frizz-Ease Serum, and I really like it.  Make sure you use only a pea-sized amount, anything more will leave your hair looking greasy.  This small amount will actually cover all of your hair.  I have long hair, down to the middle of my back, and this serum is great for protecting my hair from the straightener and calming down fly-away hairs.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for dry damaged hair.I would certainly buy again and recommend it to my friends.Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months, and my little bottle is almost empty. I have naturally dark curly medium-length hair, and I just add about a dime-sized amount to my hair after I get out of the shower. It is an extremely light-weight product, it does not leave behind a residue and it has no scent (at least, that I have noticed.) It really makes a difference and controls my frizz. Sometimes I tell myself I don&#x27;t need it, and then I go without it, and big mistake! My hair is quite frizzy without it. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I usually can find this at walgreens,  heres what happened,&lt;br /&gt;i had my Grey roots  Done at a  Beauty parlor, LOL&lt;br /&gt;I bring my own color in,  been doing that for 3 years  LOL&lt;br /&gt;Well,.  i got a DIFFRENT  hair dresser,  &amp; she left the color on to LONG  grrrrr,&lt;br /&gt;Then that night my hair was ITCHING !!!!&lt;br /&gt;tonight i walked to our walgreens,&lt;br /&gt;They only had frizz  ease Creme,  OK THATS COOL !!&lt;br /&gt;but i like the classic one better,&lt;br /&gt;I put in my hair Frizz Ease Crme, ( made it feel better ) but Wet look  Haaa&lt;br /&gt;So i said HECK with it, Im going to amazon &amp; look it up !!&lt;br /&gt;&amp; here i found it !!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is super life saving,&lt;br /&gt;i have real long hair,&lt;br /&gt;Thank God For amazon !!!
