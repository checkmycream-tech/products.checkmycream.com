<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;To the company please don&#x27;t change formula, this truly works as is.&lt;br /&gt;So often we see a product work and become in high demand to the point where the price becomes ridiculous and the formula much weaker.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a super great product and great Customer service.</li>
    <li> When i first opened foxbrims orange blossom water toner the smell really hit me, because it really does smell like oranges, the scent is just amazing! My biggest problem is that my skin is really really oily, and because of that my skin breaks out very easily. Sense i have started using this product i can really feel and see a difference. My skin feels very smooth, and at the same time not oily. Even my mother has started using it and she absolutely loves it. There are many different ways you can use this. I like to put it on my face and i can pour a little on my hands and just rub it on, or the easiest way is to put it on to a cotton ball and apply it that way so you don&#x27;t make a mess. Then there are a couple of other ways you could use it if you would like to. For starters you could add it to a mask that you put on, this will add additional skin healing and clarifying properties. You can also add a little to your bath water for a soothing and relaxing bath, and it is great for your skin. A few other uses could even be for aromatherapy, hand fresher, room scent, facial steam, and anything else you can think of using it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i think it is a truly great product and i love how it makes my skin feel, and as a bonus it makes my skin smell great. I would definitely recommend this product especially to people who care about there skin.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described</li>
    <li> I really love the scent. Very effective as a toner. I used this product with a mask and felt very refreshed. I added this product in with my bath water also and it was very refreshing and left my skin with an overall smoother and hydrated look and feel. The aroma is very soothing. I feel like a pretty flower.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the smell of this product, its subtle and pretty. I used it in my bathwater and it was really relaxing. Also made me smell pretty, and my skin soft. Never really heard about this products,  but glad I tried it!</li>
    <li> I always use a toner, and this is one I just love.  I like the ingredients.  They are all natural, and it has a great light scent.  How well does it work?  It refreshed and balanced my skin after washing.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this Orange Blossom Water Toner! It is light and absorb fast. My face looks soft and bright after using it. Great deal. Will recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> The Foxbrim Orange Blossom Water Toner leaves the skin feeling clean and fresh.  I added a few drops to my favorite lotion to add a subtle fragrance.  Great product which I look forward to using in my bath and facial mask. Great product.</li>
    <li> This Foxbrim Orange Blossom Water Toner is wonderful. It smells like orange blossoms and it tones and acts as an anti-microbial, which is good if you have troubled skin. This gives you a nice, clean feel and restores the natural ph of your skin. It is also guaranteed also, which makes the investment worthwhile.</li>
    <li> I ordered this toner as a sample for review and evaluation and I really like it! I have been looking for a new toner for quite some time and this one was so appealing to me because of the natural ingredients. I need something like this to pick up all the extra oil and dirt after I use my cleanser and as a refresher during the day and it has been great. Some days I don&#x27;t apply my make up right after my shower and by the time I am ready my skin as a bit of oil and dirt on it but I don&#x27;t need to wash it again I just use this toner for a fresh start then apply my make up. It&#x27;s very soothing and dries quickly. I think my only complaint is that it is a bit difficult to get out of the bottle but it&#x27;s really not that big of an issue, I&#x27;d rather have that than it constantly spilling out I guess! Overall I am very happy with this it&#x27;s exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> Loving this toner so far! You can barely smell the orange extract. So far it has not broke me out and i have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;So far, i&#x27;m impressed!!</li>
    <li> This smells SO DELIGHTFUL! The scent is no overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t linger on your face. I use it after washing my face to help remove anything I didn&#x27;t get. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful!! It refreshes my skin, seems to help the oily parts without over-drying the dry parts. Therapeutically it really helps with my anxiety, i just spray myself a few times a day and go about my business :)</li>
    <li> Love this toner. Use it every day.</li>
    <li> Smells delighful and I use it in between face cleanings. I use some as a spritz at work for a nice refreshing pick me up. The good part is not only has it offered a nice smell but it hasn&#x27;t dried my face out. Sometimes when I need that extra little kick to pick me up I use this. I like how it makes my pores feel and look. No one wants to look at big clogged pores yuck!! This is a very nice toner and I have not 1 bad thing to say about it. I love the pick me up it gives, the clean feel it leaves behind and the scent. I love the products from this company!! I was given a discount on my honest feedback of this. My own honest feedback is reflective above by my own purchase and use.</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing and works great!  After only few applications of usage, I have noticed my skin is tighter and pores have been diminished.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love the fresh scent and may face felt clean and fresh. I have noticed my pores are getting smaller.</li>
    <li> This smells so good! It feels very refreshing on the skin and it removes any left over makeup residue. It definitely feels luxurious too. The only thing I wish it had was a spray top. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal but I think it would be great to mist this over my face before and after makeup application. I do really like the dark glass bottle it comes in. I have heard that will help the ingredients maintain their potency longer. How I use this is I apply some to a cotton pad and the sweep it all over my face, neck, and chest. It think it helped with the little blackheads on my nose and chin area too. An important thing I really love about this product and company is that their products are cruelty free. I am very pleased with this toner and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> First off this water smells so good. A soon as I opened it I applied to my wrist 😍&lt;br /&gt;As a toner it works very well it calms down my skin before I put make up and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;But God did I mention it smells good? Lol</li>
    <li> I wished it had a little more orange smell but what can I say I love it as is.  Customer service is great too.  Came fast and happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I am in love with the scent of this toner!</li>
    <li> Love this toner! I didn&#x27;t realize that it had more uses than toner. As a toner, its great and I will buy again. I have sensitive skin due to dermatitis and this didn&#x27;t string. I also have allergies where flowers and pollen are concerned but this didn&#x27;t bother my sinuses at all. I&#x27;m able to enjoy the orange blossum scent(its spa like!) without sneezing and watery eyes.</li>
    <li> This toner has a different smell and feel to it than the toners I&#x27;ve used before.  Other toners seem to have alcohol or some witch hazel which creates a &amp;#34;zingy&amp;#34; feeling when you apply it to your face--they also burn my eyes if the toner gets too close to them.  The orange blossom scent is somewhat pungent as opposed to being a subtle scent.  It does not burn my eyes, so I can do an effective job of removing eye liner.  It removes excess makeup that didn&#x27;t get removed with just washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidentally, some acne broke out right before I started using this toner, but the blemishes disappeared quickly.  I like the natural acidity of the toner which matches the mantle of our skin.  Very few people realize that it is pH balance our faces needed, but a slightly acidic wash for our whole body.  I think this will keep my face healthier and looking better with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In return for providing a candid review, I received a discounted price on this product.</li>
    <li> help minimize pores and very refreshing!</li>
    <li> I love this. Feels, wonderful and has the most beautiful scent!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! I love how my face feels after using this toner, clean soft and fresh! I love starting the morning off with this!</li>
    <li> LOVE! I used to use a toner by Neutrogena but it was a bit strong and smelled too much of alcohol. I love how this smells and how it feels on my skin. I have added this to my nightly regime. Also, I have noticed my skin improving!</li>
    <li> I really like how this product leaves my face feeling. I have tried other toner&#x27;s and they leave my skin feeling dry and tight. This product leaves my skin feeling soft, supple and smooth. Dries quickly so no waiting to complete my daily facial routine. The nice clean light scent is a bonus!</li>
    <li> THIS SMELLS AWESOME!!  IT MAKES MY FACE FEEL SO CLEAN AND REFRESHED.  IT IS NOT HARSH LIKE THE TONERS I GREW UP USING.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels on my face, so refreshing. I use it 2 or 3 times a day for a nice treat for myself.</li>
    <li> I love it great smell and leaves my ski feeling great!!!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and already see results! Have dry sensitive skin and this works wonders. Alcohol free which is so important! Will repurchase!</li>
    <li> Like everyone else mentioned, the smell is amazeballs!  It feels so refreshing on my face! I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Works great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS and it smells so good. You can really see the big difference my pores are so tight after spraying this product, I will order again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful natural skin toner with aromatherapy fragrance...nothing unnatural here.  I use this on my face after cleansing; the scent is so uplifting!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! It&#x27;s the best brand around --- Will always buy this brand! Fast Shipping too!</li>
    <li> This has a musky, forest-y smell when applied.  I don&#x27;t get much of an &amp;#34;orange blossom&amp;#34; scent but it&#x27;s definitely not bad nor too masculine.  From the description I would expect something more perfume-y or flowery but that&#x27;s not what I got.  It smells like walking through a forest with a little bit of spice mixed in.  I used it on my face and was surprised at the instant smoothness afterwards.  Usually my skin is dry after a wash but this seemed to negate that effect.  It also seems to have allowed my moisturizer to more fully penetrate my skin, though further testing is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed one part with two parts witch hazel to create a nice, soothing room spray.  It&#x27;s refreshing without being overbearing.  I think I like it more as a room spray than as a toner.</li>
    <li> I love this toner. I have used harsher toners shoot years and didn&#x27;t like how they bothered my skin. This still does what I need it to for a toner but feels great too.</li>
    <li> Love this facial toner!!!!</li>
    <li> Light scent, gentle on skin with improvement after 5 days in clarity of skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
    <li> I have always had problem skin. Thought my early teens, all the way into my current 30&#x27;s. It&#x27;s horrible and embarrassing. I have tried every product on the market. Some things would help for a while and then stop working, or they would make my skin worse. I decided after reading all the good reviews for FoxBrim Orange Blossom Toner Water, to give it a try...what would I have to lose. I received my order on Thursday of last week, and all I can say is my skin is starting to look great. I wash my face like normal, then I use the toner. I do this twice a day. Since it&#x27;s summer I haven&#x27;t been wearing makeup, so I do apply some of the toner when I feel I need a refresher. It&#x27;s not alcohol based, so it doesn&#x27;t burn your skin. It&#x27;s refreshing and clean. My skin texture has changed in just the short time I&#x27;ve been using the toner. My face is so soft and moisturized, and I don&#x27;t have that bumpy feel of underlying acne/blackheads/whiteheads anymore. The acne I did have is healing at a rapid rate. I&#x27;ve also used this on my 12 year old son that is dealing with breakouts. He loves it! Hopefully he won&#x27;t have to deal with the lifetime of bad skin that I&#x27;ve had to deal with...because this works!</li>
    <li> Add the toner to your facial mask for additional skin healing and clarifying properties or add it to your bath and let it whisk you away to the wonderfully relaxing scent of the Mediterranean waters in your own bathtub.  Some of the other uses are aromatherapy, room scent, facial stem, and hand freshen.  I challenge you to find more uses for this toner and see just how many you can find. Please note I have received this product for free for testing and review.</li>
    <li> First off I love this company Foxbrim. They make a lot of organic and natural products that are fabulous for your health and skin. The orange blossom water toner is great to use after washing your face or when you want your face to feel fresh. It is soothing to the skin, no irritation, no dryness, no chemicals or no tightness.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, great product, so refreshing. Even with sensitive skin there is zero irritation!</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is amazing!  Seriously, my skin felt so good after using this just once! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This toner is wonderful!! It smells amazing and makes my skin so soft. I&#x27;ve only used it for three days but so far it is one of my new favorite products.</li>
    <li> I love this toner! It smells beautiful with light floral notes.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> very good product.  My pores were instantly smaller and skin was very smooth to the touch.  I&#x27;ve just started using this but with continuous use I am sure to see a big difference.</li>
    <li> Love it, great product</li>
    <li> I just received this product for review and you have to get this if you&#x27;re prone to acne. Rose water didn&#x27;t help much but I loved how the orange blossom water felt after applying to my face! So refreshing !</li>
    <li> its great. good for my skin</li>
    <li> Light and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I make my own bath and beauty products and sell them, so rarely do I purchase something like this. I have to say that I love this toner. It&#x27;s so refreshing and it smells great. It leaves my skin feeling lovely. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and my skin feels so soft and refreshed after I use this!</li>
    <li> Soothing toner, refreshing for the skin. I love the scent. Perfect for the summer.</li>
    <li> It smells great, but I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin.  But seriously, it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Toning has always been a part of my essential skin care routine before I hit the sack. Cleansing, toning and moisturizing - that has always been my routine. I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with picking out a toner that would work for my troublesome and sensitive skin....and let me tell you that I could not be happier when I was given a chance to try Orange Blossom Water in toner form!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orange Blossom Water is rich in Vitamin A, Vitamin C and Anti-Oxidants. It balances the oiliness of the skin and hydrates it in a mild manner. It works great in hydrating, firming, reduces redness/puffiness/acne and improving acne scars. It also works well in removing excess oil and dirt from my skin that mere cleansing can&#x27;t get rid of. It works for sensitive skin and mine didn&#x27;t turn beet red or flare up with hives (yes, it has happened to me before with a supposedly expensive brand of face toner in the past) when I used it! You did it again, Foxbrim! Two thumbs up for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin feeling fresh and cleansed.  The scent is mild and absolutely lovely.  I do not like though astringentes on my skin or strong perfumes. This toner is perfect for me. Mild yet effective with a beautiful scent.  Well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty hard to please when it comes to toners, some are too drying, some leave a sticky film and some just don&#x27;t do anything.. This seems to remove that extra residue/dirt gently. My skin just has a very clean feeling afterwards. The smell is amazing, I look forward to using it everyday!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any additional breakouts since using this.. My skin seems to look a little better than it normally does.</li>
    <li> This is a refreshing toner. The scent is quite strong, but does not linger for a long period of time. I use this before any other facial products. It leaves my face fresh and cool. My face feels ready to take in my other serums right away. The tinted glass container does have a large opening. I use a cotton round to apply this to my fave, but I would love it more if it has a spray pump. You do need to be careful when using as to not spill it. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
    <li> Yummy smell!!! Good product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing, non-drying and I love the scent! I live in a desert area and dry skin is a constant problem. This toner is perfect as it leaves my skin refreshed but never tight and dry.</li>
    <li> Since I am now in my mid 30&#x27;s, my face has decided that it wants to behave like a teenager. Literally I am breaking out like never before. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s hormones or what but I really can&#x27;t control  the breakouts with anything. So when I was offered this Orange Blossom Water Toner from Foxbrim for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered because I am getting desperate. It has been just about a week now and my face is actually clearing up. I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts or a reaction to the orange blossom water. I am going to continue using this on my face and fingers crossed, it continues to work for me. I definitely recommend trying this Orange Blossom Water Toner from Foxbrim for anyone who is looking to balance their skin.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product; I love it! I also received excellent tips from the seller, as well. I am very pleased! Thank you so much!  (I love using this in my bath water!)</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful. I put it in a mist spray bottle so I can mist my face and pillow with it.</li>
    <li> ThFoxbrim Orange Blossom Water is a really lovely skin toner. Non-astringent, but still gently clarifies and tones the face and neck.  I like to put mine in a small spray bottle and refrigerate for a quick pick-me-up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is luscious -- very orange-citrus -- but doesn&#x27;t overpower.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that this toner is NOT oily at all.  It&#x27;s more like water (if just a bit thicker). After a few uses, the skin begins to take on a nice, healthy-looking glow.  It has helped brighten my face and neck, too.  I love that!&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer a toner that doesn&#x27;t sting or redden the skin, this is a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Orange Blossom Toner for the purpose of review. All opinions are my own and based on my own use of and experience with the item.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and feels so nice on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Got this yesterday.I really like this product. It has a mild  pleasant smell and made my skin feel light and clean. It works as toner should and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> Return customer.  My first bottle I received free to give a review.  Well I liked it so much that I have bought it at full price this time.  I really like this toner, first the smell is wonderful and it really makes my skin feel good, seems to get off any remaining makeup that I didn&#x27;t wash off, and also my skin has had fewer breakouts using this twice a day on a cotton ball.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product. I love the scent and love that it&#x27;s alcohol free. I will purchase more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of the smell but it had a tone of uses &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to see if it makes my nails grow faster.</li>
    <li> This is one of 4 Foxbrim products that I use.  I am a 25 year old male that has some skin issues, and after just 14 days, I am seeing real results.  My skin feel more full and tight.  With continued use, I can only imagine the results in the months to come!</li>
    <li> This calms my skins especially after a wax or tweezing.</li>
    <li> amazing! refresh your face! and smell is heaven! :))</li>
    <li> This has to be my absolute most favorite recent purchase! I&#x27;ve added it to my skincare routine and it has made such a difference! Even my son said my face smelled so nice and it even seemed to make it smoother! Want to try their other products!</li>
    <li> Having really sensitive skin can be a problem when it comes to finding products to keep skin clean, clear and as young in appearance as possible. I love the way this toner makes my skin feel and smell. Other Toners leave a medicinal smell and can be harsh on skin and are expensive as well. This Orange Blossom Water Toner has become the Number One ( #1) Choice.</li>
    <li> Wow I was not sure about this but after using it I love  it!!&lt;br /&gt;Can tell a big difference! !</li>
    <li> Very nice product.. I love applying it after my shower.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, gentle enough on my skin while still cutting through my oily t zone</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and an astringent toner is too harsh for me to use.  This Orange Blossom water is the perfect solution, and it smells amazing.  I can safely use the toner frequently to get a clean fresh and hydrating feeling.  We purchased this toner in a promotion for testing and review.  We love that this toner is 100% all natural and that it is alcohol free.</li>
    <li> So refreshing- I really liked the feel and smell of this product- so gentle! This bottle is huge as well so, I know it will last me a long time! I also like to use this as a make up setting spray. My secret is to keep this in the fridge and when I get super hot take it out and give myself a spritz!</li>
    <li> The Orange Blossom Water Toner has exceeded my expectations for this product. It&#x27;s gentle yet very effective and I highly recommend it .</li>
    <li> I have been using this product about 5 days,I use after cleansing my face then apply this with cotton pad and I felt my skin was tighten and clean  after using this toner..But I don&#x27;t like the smell. I read many reviews they love the smell so I bought this toner but not for me. Hope there are more choices for this toner.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say whether or not this works as a toner, but as a fragrance it is amazing! It&#x27;s like magnolias, honey, and warm citrus. It lasts all day and just melds with the skin perfectly. I also bought the Rose Water by the same company, and both are fragrant with a scent true to their names</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner almost every night and sometimes in the morning as well. It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin. Not tinkling like some other toners. It does a good job removing dirt and makeup and it also has a pleasant smell. I think it works pretty well for those with sensitive skin since I do have relatively sensitive skin. I do feel a difference.</li>
    <li> This orange blossom water toner smell very nice. It feel so refreshing on my skin. I love it.</li>
    <li> When I first got Foxbrim&#x27;s Orange Blossom Water Toner in lieu of my honest opinion I opened the jar immediately to use it. I must say that the scent was not my favorite but as time went on I had no problem with it. It may have been many reasons why I felt that way at first because your environment can effect your senses. I know how important it is to take care of your skin and adding a toner to my skincare regimen is a must. oxbrim&#x27;s Orange Blossom Water Toner does the job that it was created to do in simple and effective manner. For some reason I am suffering with adult acne but this toner is helping in a tremendous way.</li>
    <li> I like really like the smell and how it makes me feel refreshed after i used it, didn&#x27;t feel greasy or anything.</li>
    <li> I like to use this in my bath water... It has a light scent that calms me and helps me to relax.  It makes my bath water feel softer and my skin feels rejuvenated after a soak in the tub with a few drops of this.  When I get out I am more relaxed and ready for almost anything.  I made my wife try it tonight and she was like oh wow hunny ... now I now why you have been taking so many bathes instead of showers.  Guess I should share my secrets more...lol.  Thank you so much for the chance to review this product and give me honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice and works well as a toner.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my Orange Blossom Water Toner.  The scent is very pleasant.  Leaves my skin looking and feeling very refreshed.  It did not irritate my skin at all.  But please be sure to test a small amount on your own skin, since your skin type may vary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m OBSESSED with this tone it is so much more gentle than chemical ones but works JUST as well!!</li>
    <li> I love this toner so much!!! I use it mostly at night before bed. It takes all the grime of the day off and makes me feel refreshed. I put my night cream on a clean face and I feel so much better</li>
    <li> Smells really pretty, I add to my sons bath to help his eczema.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really big on how products smell and the citrus scent on this way too strong.  It lingers after I use my serum and moisturizer.  I only used it twice for this reason.  On the plus side,  I have oily skin and using this did help eliminate some of the oiliness I usually experience.  If not for the strong fragrance I would continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This the first toner that I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t feel like water.  I could actually feel my face tighten.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would replace my favorite rose water toner but I&#x27;m not completely sold yet. It works great but the smell isn&#x27;t to my liking. I was expecting a more citrus type smell and it is a little off from that. I have still been using it because I do think that it works slightly better as an under the makeup toner. I wouldn&#x27;t let my sniffer deter you away from this though because like I said, it does work better than my old brand.&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> this smells great and feels great on your skin- not overly drying nor leaving a sticky feeling. Just clean and fresh with a lasting hint or orange.</li>
    <li> I used this entire bottle without ever even using it for it&#x27;s intended purpose as a toner.  I added some to a humidifier, which left the room with a nice fresh orange blossom sent.  I spritzed it on couches, beds, and pillows, to freshen them up, and provide a calming aroma therapy.  I even used a cotton ball to apply some around window and door frames to discourage bugs.  The only draw back is that after using it all up, my wife was mad she did not get to try it on her face...she can try the next bottle I get!</li>
    <li> Good smell, light and easy to use. So far I&#x27;ve been using this for a while.  Pretty happy about it.</li>
    <li> I use this with jojoba oil for my skin care it helps so much.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  You may use iy for other than toner. It gives me a lift first thing in the morning. I splash a little my face,  neck and hair.  Not overpowering at all.</li>
    <li> My skincare shelf looks like a Foxbrim display because I use and love SO MANY of their products, but this may be my favorite for the simple reason that it smells DIVINE. It has a light, very slightly floral, somewhat earthy fragrance that immediately calms and relaxes me every time I open the bottle. The fragrance is subtle, but perfect...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you&#x27;ll want to buy it for the results, which are also amazing - it&#x27;s soothing, calming on my skin (I can just hear my skin cells saying  ahhhhhhhhh every time I use it,,,), leaves my skin supple, and refreshed, with no residue, dryness, or tightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And did I mention the fragrance? ;)</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I have loved it from the time of opening it.</li>
    <li> I hate washing my face. This stuff is amazing though.  This stuff gives my face a fresh clean glow.  I know it sounds cheesy but that&#x27;s the only way I can describe it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I think this will be a helpful addition to my face cleansing regime. Can&#x27;t tell too much yet. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. I have oily skin and this toner makes my face feel fresh and hydrated without feeling greasy. It smells amazing and I use it twice daily without it drying out my skin. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This water toner is magnificent. I&#x27;m using this for almost two weeks now and it really works great!It&#x27;s not harsh in my face and It clears up all my white and black heads and even those little tiny dark spots on my face.I got this product with a discount but I&#x27;m not giving a good review just because of the discount,The product itself is really amazing.I will surely, definitely, recommend this product.A+++++ product and seller!</li>
    <li> Does not sting when applied. Love the smell</li>
    <li> I saw one of the questions asked on this product and decided it was an excellent idea. I put it in a spray bottle and keep it on my table so I can spritz my face several times a day. I live in Florida and facial sweat is a skin killer. This works great to refresh my skin and keep that icky plastic feeling away.</li>
    <li> Love the smell..used on sunburn to soothe. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> The Orange Blossom Water Toner is really effective really clean your open pores and moisturize it.. very refreshing to skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really enjoying it so much&lt;br /&gt;Worth of what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd time buying this Product&lt;br /&gt; seriously 100% recommend this to you guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xx&lt;br /&gt;Buying it again and again ..I just can&#x27;t stop really good for me.&lt;br /&gt;better than any product that I had in the past .&lt;br /&gt;feeling great to found this kind of water toner th 100% clear your face everytime you use it.</li>
    <li> Refreshing and smells great.  Kind of a small bottle for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Feel so refreshed and clean</li>
    <li> I really love this toner and i have been using on my skin and it feels so nice.</li>
    <li> review free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i loved this product i used for massage also been using it for my dry skin . and it has made a real diference i not having to use moistizer cream every few hours any more . the smell is so exciting i some times use it just for the smell good stuff</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t tell any difference</li>
    <li> This smells great and feel awesome too! I love the extra clean feel but can&#x27;t afford to lose the moisture that some toners strip away. This rocks!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, works nice, and left my skin refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love having an all-natural alternative toner. I don&#x27;t know about you but when I think of toners I tend to cringe because I think of having very dry skin which needs to have a boatload of moisturizer in order to compensate for it. It wasn&#x27;t until I got this toner that I realized not every toner needs to strip your skin. This leaves my skin soft but still gets all the excess dirt and grime off my face. It has a slight herbal and orange-y scent which I don&#x27;t mind in the slightest. I love that this is only one ingredient so I am not putting a ton of chemicals on my face all the time. The only thing on the ingredients list is &amp;#34;Citrus Aurantium Amara Distillate&amp;#34; which is orange blossom. Overall I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Has a wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this product it left my face feeling fresh and clean. I really like the smell as well.</li>
    <li> This toner leaves my skin smooth and regreshed. Perfect before I apply moisturizer. Thanks for a great product. Oh and it smells wonderful too!!</li>
    <li> I love this. It smells really good and does not dry my skin.  I tried this from a  Foxbrim&#x60;s special promotion and have added this to my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Smells just like legit orange blossom and feels great on the skin. Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Slight rosey smell but i love this toner.  It leaves my skin feeling really nice and clean!</li>
    <li> It is amazing what a toner does after you have cleansed your skin. I just place the orange blossom water toner on a cotton pad and wipe my entire face. Foxbrim Orange blossom water toner is imported from Morocco. It has a strong scent that will fade after minutes. Not only does the  toner cleanse your skin but it hydrates and moisturizes it as well.  I use a  facial moisturizer after I am finished w/the toner.</li>
    <li> This toner makes my face feel amazing. I can already tell that it is evening out my skin tone and my face is so soft. You think you have all of the dirt off once you clean and dry your face. But no after using this toner I am so surprised how much was still on my skin. I feel clean and happy after using this. I will be buying more for sure.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toner on my face and hands and have even put a little in my bath water it smells great light and fresh.I am very pleased and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Left my skin feeling soft and smooth! Does not have the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; of some toners. And really removed excess dirt.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of freshness, it&#x27;s so light and refreshing.  Must buy</li>
    <li> This smells heavenly.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the second item I have ordered from Foxbrim and I am once again very pleased with the quality of their products. As I&#x27;ve grown older, I&#x27;ve been wanting something that was kinder to my skin that plain soap and water or alcohol when doing my morning cleansing. The orange blossom water toner was perfect. It not only does a great job for cleansing, but doesn&#x27;t strip the skin making it feel dry and tight after use. It has a very pleasant scent as well. I&#x27;ll be using this as part of my regular morning routine from here on out.</li>
    <li> I love the Orange scent and I&#x27;ve using this toner for almost a week now. Makes my skin fresh. Would definitely buy another one.</li>
    <li> Was broken on arrival</li>
    <li> I enjoy the Bulgarian Rose water and other floral waters, and was excited about this orange blossom water toner. Got it, opened it, ugh. The smell of blooming orange blossoms in the air is a delight; this is nothing like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 4/23/15 update -  The supplier contacted me and informed me that this product is made from Moroccan bitter orange, not the more familiar sweet orange blossoms.  You may try this and think it smells perfectly lovely; I didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service and product quality are fine, no complaints there. My return was authorized and processed asap as well. I appreciated their contact and concern.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I use it twice a day. I don&#x27;t know if it tones my face but my bf said it did look clearer. I wakes me up and has me feeling fresh on every use, will be ordering another soon :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this everyday on my face after washing it.  It takes off alot of dirt that is still left behind from my soap cleaners.  Love how my face feels after I apply it.  Smooth and soft&lt;br /&gt;received the Orange blosson water toner for reviewing purposes and to give my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> I tried this product on a whim and I am very glad I did.  The aroma is pleasing but not overwhelming (it is floral, don&#x27;t expect it to be a citrus scent) and it leaves my face feeling so soft that even my spouse noticed.  Now that says something!  There are no harsh chemicals, which I like very much since I have sensitive skin; this did not cause me any problems, not even on the delicate areas around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s good for someone with dry skin. It didn&#x27;t work for my oily skin. My face felt oily just a couple of hours later.</li>
    <li> Very good toner gentle on the skin</li>
    <li> Best toner ever! It smell great, doesn&#x27;t cause irritation  for my skin (my skin is extremely sensitive), feel fresh !</li>
    <li> Just opening the bottle makes me smile and think of being on vacation. The orange scent is so lite and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner applies so easily and doesn&#x27;t burn or draw up on my face. I like the scent that lingers but it isn&#x27;t over powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Orange Blossom Water has long claimed to offer skin healing and nourishing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the features include:&lt;br /&gt;- Clarifying skin for a radiant glow&lt;br /&gt;- Nourishing skin moisture&lt;br /&gt;- Restoring vitality and suppleness&lt;br /&gt;- Smoothing skin while reducing pore size&lt;br /&gt;- Stimulating healing&lt;br /&gt;- Promoting skin regeneration&lt;br /&gt;- Healing scars&lt;br /&gt;- Reducing inflammation&lt;br /&gt;- Treating sun-exposed skin&lt;br /&gt;- Hydrating and soothing skin&lt;br /&gt;- Balancing pH levels with natural acidity&lt;br /&gt;- Fighting oil build-up and acne-inducing bacteria&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the toner is alcohol free. It would make a great addition to you daily facial cleansing routine. Because it is alcohol, it can be used on sensitive skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you can use this in other applications. I will diffuse it and I will drop just a little into my bath for a relaxing soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> I received this Orange Blossom Water Toner from Foxbrim for review purposes. It has been many years since I have used any kind of facial toner. My skin has gone from oily to normal to the state of being normal to dry. It seemed like an unnecessary step to my skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has changed my mind on that subject. There is a long history of Orange Blossom Water dating back to ancient times. It was a particular favorite of Marie Antoinette.  This particular one is steam distilled. That is what you want to look for. It is pure and contains only one ingredient, Citrus Aurantium Amara, which is the essential oil of the bitter orange blossoms tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Morocco, it is offered to guests as a hand freshener upon arrival in one&#x27;s home and used in cooking as well. This particular product is not food grade as far as I know.  It is complete with Vitamins A and C  and powerful anti-oxidants.  It clarifies the skin and also has antibacterial properties as well.  It is alcohol free and can help reduce the size of your pores as well as smooth your skin.  It is also an anti-inflammatory and can help reduce redness from acne. It also aids in balancing the ph levels in your skin with its mild acidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about two weeks. In the morning, it is wonderful to apply to a cotton pad and remove the grime accumulated over the night. The scent is light and lovely, and very refreshing.  I also use it at night, after cleansing to remove any residue left over on my skin. I honestly can say it is not drying in the least. I have done some experimenting with it, and decided to fore-go my moisturizer and found my skin to remain soft and moisturized.  I have also noticed a difference in the size of my pores since using it. They are reduced. I truly enjoy this product and realized I have been missing out for many years on this step in a skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can also be used if mixed with water as an all -natural air freshener. I may try that this summer.  Another possible and fragrant use it to add it to your bath water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing , I think you will be delighted by this Orange Blossom Water Toner, I know I am, and it is quickly becoming one of those products  that I do not want to be without. Highly recommend!er. I may try that this summer.

    <li> Lovely toner without the harsh chemicals or smells.  I used this to remove makeup and as a toner following daily wash or weekly exfoliating.  Gentle to the skin without drying, this is acceptable for daily use on dry skin.  A great pH balance for those high oil sections in the T-zone.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Light weight and seems to make my fave brighter. Great way to wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really loved how my skin felt after using this product for about a week. I don&#x27;t have acne but I do have some pores on my cheeks that I have constantly battled and while using this, it seemed to help them be less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try this on my scalp and then shampooed my hair. It left my hair smelling fresh and clean. Wherever I went I had people asking me what kind of shampoo I used because they couldn&#x27;t place the scent. I just smiled and said it was a natural remedy!</li>
    <li> I especially like this when my skin ia oily.  It works great its not over dryer.  I highly recommend this toner</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and clean.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin feeling super refreshed, and doesn&#x27;t try it out like other toners. I have super sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had a problem.</li>
    <li> Not only does it smell amazing, but it just leaves your skin feeling really fresh.</li>
    <li> Very effective to my sensitive skin thats why i like it. The smell is good and surprisingly its not sticky.Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and not too drying</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with orange blossom water toner (also known as Neroli water)! This smells amazing and makes my face feel wonderful. This is actually my first time ever using this but I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to using anything else! I put the toner in a small spray bottle and spritz some on in the morning before applying any makeup, sometimes during the day for a refresher, and at night after I wash my face. This is now my favorite toner to use because of how lovely it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes.

    <li> I love it. I got a high discount code then I bought it. before I use other toner, this time I tried this toner. It is good. I feel my face more moisture.</li>
    <li> Still trying it out but so far I like it.</li>
    <li> So far Foxbrim is on a roll.  Every product I try I&#x27;m liking.  My face has been overly oily lately and my pores are clogging more than usual. This is making my skin feel so clean and helping heal any blemishes.  Definitely WILL buy this again</li>
    <li> The Orange Blossom Water Toner smells so divine that not only am I using it on my face, but I&#x27;m using it as a hair freshener and a body spray too! I&#x27;ll confess that I added a few drops of Bergamot EO because the blend of Neroli and Bergamot is one of my very favorite summer scents. I highly recommend it simply because of the smell, but it&#x27;s a fantastic toner as well.  I received a bottle of the Orange Blossom Water Toner free in order to provide a review. All opinions are mine!</li>
    <li> Love!came on time I personally love the smell!</li>
    <li> Great product. I will definitely be using it all UP!</li>

    <li> I love the smell of this toner.  I have been using if for nearly a week now and notice my skin looking brighter and my pores smaller.</li>
    <li> I really LOVE this toner! I have used so many others and have not gotten the results I have with this one! I love how it feels on your face when you are donr using it and the smell is nice! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Very refreshing, lovely scent.  One suggestion- I personally like glass, but a spray bottle may make for easier use, however I will rebuy when I run out.  Love their product line.</li>
    <li> I received the orange blossom water toner a few days ago and am extremely pleased with it.  It has a nice light scent that is not overpowering like a lot of the toners.  It also does not sting or dry like some.  My skin actually feels much more hydrated since I started using it. It is wonderful and I will keep as part of my daily beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> Really great for cleansing my face before bed!  Love it after a hot, busy day!</li>
    <li> Loved the product.  Left my skin extremely soft and the smell is very relaxing.  Will buy the product again !!</li>
    <li> I love how fresh and clean this toner makes me feel. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a Huge difference in the appearance of my skin since using this for just a week! It smells pleasant and has no harsh effects. Love it!</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing! It makes your skin feel amazing!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a toner in years and after using this product, feel I&#x27;ve been missing out.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months now.  Its the first product I apply to my skin after cleansing my face in the morning and evening.  It&#x27;s wonderfully refreshing, tightens the skin and does seem to reduce my relatively large facial pores.  It does not sting/burn, feels very clean, and does not leave a &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; or cause dryness.  I think it has actually brightened up and improved the health of my skin as I have been receiving  favorable comments on my appearance of late.  I would recommend trying.</li>
    <li> Really great toner. I love the floral scent. It feels great on my skin. I just apply after washing my face and my face feels softer and smoother. My skin looks brighter and less blotchy. I also like to add a bit to my bath water. I love the product. I just wish it came with a spray pump to apply easier. *sample provided to review</li>
    <li> This is a nice orange smell and works great in helping tone my skin..love how its making my skin feel..great product..</li>
    <li> Feels clean in your skin. Nice smell.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this product.  I have always hated using toners because they do not smell good, but this one does. It really leaves my face feeling tight and clean.  It is almost like a can feel my pores closing after I use it.  It leaves my skin feeling great and I do not feel any kind of stickiness or residue like I have with other toners.  I will definitely be adding this to my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> i do not like the smell at all, but it works great and the smell goes away quickly</li>
    <li> My go to toner for the longest time is the Morrocan Rose Water, because it is so gentle in my skin and it smells really good and relaxing. I ran out of my rose water and gave this a try. This orange blossom water toner smells really good and it&#x27;s as gentle as my rose water. A little goes a long way, a full bottle of 4 OZ will surely last me for months. Whenever I use this, I feel like my skin is so fresh and moisturized. I also took some of this and placed it on a spray bottle to use as a facial mist throughout the day. It is so crucial to have a moisturized skin especially that it is the summer already. The sun tends to dry out our skin, so keeping yourself hydrated and moisturized is best. The orangey scent is also perfect because I feel so refreshed when I smell it. I purchase this using a promo code for review.</li>
    <li> Talk about dual purposes!!! I use this with a cotton ball on my face every night and it leaves my skin feeling fresh. I also put it in my oil diffuser for a great smelling house.</li>
    <li> This product has a strong orange blossom scent if you smell directly from the bottle, but the scent is lessened and transcent when applied to the face.  It relaxes my face right away after washing, get rid of the tightness sensation, and gives my face smooth feeling.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Was not sure about a toner.  I was afraid the toner would dry out my skin.  Boy, was I ever wrong.  I love the smell, I could use it as a fragrance.  I will be telling friends and family about this product.</li>
    <li> This toner smells amazing! It reminds me of my grandmother&#x27;s honeysuckle plants. It feels great on my skin and leaves it feeling soft and refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb into the skin yet the smell lingers for a while longer, which I love. It brings back great memories.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this brand period... im using it to clean my face to get access dirt off that the day will bring and i actually love it.. my skin gets shiny when i sweat and it clears that right up so i use it a lot during the day cleans my skin well... my skin was two toned and im seeing some improvement on the tone of it and that is tops to me so i will be repurchasing it.... thx</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to buy a toner like this for a while and when I got a chance to try this for discount is was really excited. But when I got to use it I cannot believe how good it was/is my skin is very sensitive even though I&#x27;m 35 but this does not burn or dry out my skin at all. The aroma is amazing to me but it&#x27;s always been one of my favorite scents. I would truly recommend this product, it is the first toner I found in years that actually feels good and works.</li>
    <li> I love this toner water! It smells incredible and feels great on my skin. I usually experience some tingling or burning with others because I have sensitive skin, but not with this. Love it.</li>
    <li> I received the Fox Brim Orange Blossom Toner Water Free and for Review.  I was really excited as FoxBrim is one of my favorite companies and I have immensely enjoyed their products.  The first clarification with this product is that it is NOT an astringent.  It is a toner to refresh and hydrate your skin.  It has a lovely, pleasant orange scent and is 100% natural.  It truly leaves the skin feeling refreshed, and does not burn, sting or irritate.  I find it nice to use after cleansing my face at night after a long day.  The scent lingers fresh feeling does linger.  The toner comes in a generous 4 oz size bottle which is best applied with a cotton ball.  This is a great product, one I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this refreshing, wonderfully scented toner!! After cleaning my face I sweep a cotton square with this toner on it across my face. Not drying whatsoever and  am thrilled with it&#x27;s anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
    <li> I really like this so far so good. Depend on the progress in couple of months I might get more.</li>
    <li> Smells good, shrinks pores and even cleans what my makeup remover missed, without making my face too dry. Good stuff</li>
    <li> Face feels clean after using.</li>
    <li> Works great on my face and it smells so good. I use it before applying my makeup and I can smell the orange blossom all day!</li>
    <li> This is my first non-alcoholic based toner that I tried and i recieved a discount for my unbiased thoughts. I honestly thought it would not be as effective as the clinique toner ive been using for years. I was surprised I did not feel a slightly tingly sensation initially, but I ended up really liking that. It felt it was more soothing to apply and it felt good, especially coming fresh out the fridge.I did not know how harsh the previous toner I was until switching and trying this. My skin normally feels really sensitive and red for a good 20-30 minutes after a toner application, but not with this. The only thing I wish were different is the bottle. There is no control over the amount you pour, the opening is too wide. It is not too big of a deal to me though, I can always add the product in different bottles. I also tried this out with mud facials and think the combination is excellent! I am a fan of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love a good toner, and this one is great. The bottle has a simple design and I really like that it is in a dark, glass bottle for better preservation. The information and directions on the label are very informative and helpful. This smells wonderful; it has a light orange and floral scent aka orange blossom.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, mostly oily, and my skin is very acne prone.I use this toner every morning after my gel wash and before my face oil. Instead of a cotton ball, I use a face cloth to dab the toner on my face. My gel wash is very mild and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling refreshed like it needs to be in the morning, but when I use this toner my skin feels much better. As I apply this, it makes my skin feel very refreshed and clean. It absorbs the excess oil and leaves my skin looking smooth and feeling soft. It has seemed to lighten my acne marks and brightened my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this toner, and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I thought it would have a sweet orange smell and it&#x27;s very floral. I wash it off after using it Bc I don&#x27;t like smelling it. Can&#x27;t tell a difference in my skin yet.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of the smell. It is a really light toner. Applies easily with a cotton pad.</li>
    <li> Smells so great and I love how it feels on my face! I will buy again. It arrived in a glass bottle surrounded by a protective box.</li>
    <li> This toner is awesome.  It smells like your walking through a garden full of roses. It makes your face so soft. I use every morning and night and it has done wonders for my complextion.  This toner is unique, because not only can you use it on your face, you can put it in your bath water and it makes your body so soft and smelling fresh. Plus, if you are a user of air difusers/misters, you can use this toner in your diffuser and it puts a light refreshing sense in your home!  I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Great product, will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I think I got a bad bottle - after reading all of the reviews that rave about the fragrance, I can&#x27;t even believe it&#x27;s the same product!  Mine does have a bit of an orange overtone, but there&#x27;s also something chemical/solvent about it - smells like a cleanser or a furniture cleaner.  Rather plastic-y.  I am not from Florida and am not familiar with the smell of orange blossoms, but I can&#x27;t believe that they would be so popular if they smelled so industrial rather than sweet/floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No expiration date on the package, so I can&#x27;t tell, but it has to have turned.  With sensitive skin, I usually buy things that are fragrance-free, but the thought of orange blossoms (much more attractive-sounding to me than roses) was appealing and now I&#x27;m disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it 3 stars rather than fewer because I do like the lightness of the toner (some are much more viscous), the pH balance, and the fact that it does leave my skin feeling fresh and clean and ready for my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Smeels good feels refreshing 😊</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a natural skin tonic kick. Reading the other reviews helped me to choose this toner for its healing properties, blackhead conquering results and scent. When you first open the bottle, it&#x27;s knock-you-back-in-your-chair sweet but the scent mellows considerably upon use. That said, my daughter gave me a hug and lingered with her nose on my face since the smell was very appealing to her. She&#x27;s now using it as a pillow spray because she just can&#x27;t get enough. Oddly enough, orange blossoms have hypnotic and tranquilizing properties that may make this the best pillow spray you&#x27;ve ever used! Plus, its antibacterial composition would theoretically help keep your pillow fresher. After learning about the hypnotic qualities of orange blossom distallate, I sprayed this toner on my dog&#x27;s bed. (He suffers from anxiety because he recently went blind.) Not only did his bed smell 100% better, the toner had the effect of calming his nerves and helping him relax. He was actually nuzzling his bed in a romantic sort of way. ha! Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this toner because it can be used in many different ways around the house but is also a treat for my skin.   This is 100% natural orange blossom distillate, so you can buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> I really like this toner! I have very sensitive skin, but I can use this. It seems to visibly improve my skin too. I just use this for cleansing and coconut oil for moisturizing. It would be five stars, but the smell is somewhat overpowering. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but I have some family members with allergies and I have to keep my distance when I first put it on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks now and i really love it! It smells so good, is super gentle on my skin, didn&#x27;t break me out at all. Its a really soothing toner, which surprised me. It does the job and doesnt leave your skin feeling tight. Your skin feels clean, smooth and soft. I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It makes my face feel so fresh and makes my skin less red. I love using it before bed, it smells so good and makes me feel so relaxed at night. I have very sensetive skin and this is very gentle. Highly recomend this.</li>
    <li> pricey but smells heavenly</li>
    <li> This is an amazing toner! I never used one before but now I&#x27;m addicted. What a difference in my complexion. Plus I love the smell. I use this morning and night I like it so much. Thank for the chance to try this product!</li>
    <li> I have never used a product like this before so I was unsure of what to expect but I am happy to say I am very satisfied with it. First of all, it smells good. Really good. Opening the bottle in the morning has become one of those simple pleasures that gets me going. Also, when I ordered this toner I thought that maybe it would sting some when applied but it doesn&#x27;t bite at all which was a relief. My skin tends to be more on the red side around my cheeks and forehead and when I use this toner it really cuts down on that. I am happy I took advantage of the product promotion and I can say I would probably try other products as well. Big thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This has been a great toner. I have been applying it to my face after washing. My face usually get really dry so I like using a toner to restore my skin&#x27;s PH balance and moisture. It has been great for that as well as my face always feels refreshed after it is applied. And you can&#x27;t go wrong with all natural ingredients. I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I hate to admit this, but this my is the first time ever using a toner. But I honestly do not know how I&#x27;ve gone so long without it! This stuff is amazing. This stuff makes my skin feel absolutely amazing and somehow a lot more clean even right after I&#x27;ve washed my face. I can&#x27;t wait until I&#x27;ve been using it for a while to see if it has any effects on my face because it sure feels like it&#x27;s doing wonderful things! The only complaint I have is the scent. It&#x27;s not bad at all, it&#x27;s just way too floral for me. But it&#x27;s Orange Blossom water so it smells exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to and that&#x27;s a good thing. It&#x27;s just not the scent for me. I&#x27;m still using it every day either way! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product happily received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Good smell, good clenser. I put it in a spray bottle, i spray my face and i leave it there so my skin absorve it.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased Foxbrim&#x27;s Vitamin C moisturizer and came across this as a recommended item. I&#x27;ve never used toner before and I looooove this toner. The scent is light and wonderful. I apply this on my face with a cotton round. As I let the product dry, my skin slightly tingles and has a nice clean feeling. I would definitely recommend this product. In addition, the company is great. They contact you right away to make sure you&#x27;re happy with the product and will promptly send replacements if there are issues with your order (I had ordered a moisturizer and the container was broken - they sent me a new one right away, no questions asked).</li>
    <li> Admittedly I never spent a lot of money on health &amp; beauty products, but decided to give this a try.  I&#x27;ve tried other toners in the past and never liked the harsh chemical smell or the &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; feeling on my skin... and was prepared to expect the same here.  Boy was I wrong!  This is a true 100% natural toner, NOT an astringent.  It smells light and fresh and just the perfect scent to get you moving in the morning.  I use a little cotton makeup pad instead of a cotton ball and just wipe gently.  Sometimes I throw on a light moisturizer, but most of the time it&#x27;s just wipe and go.  Helps your skin feel clean and healthy all morning.  Definitely glad I decided to try.</li>
    <li> Perfect all natural toner...no harsh alcohol or chemicals! Soothing....</li>
    <li> I am in love with this toner. I have more expensive high end toners and I honestly felt like they either did nothing at all or left my skin dry. I even have pore reducing toners which have not helped and I have been highly disappointed. What I noticed was it left my pores tight and smaller. My face felt firmer but not dry. I feel like it has helped my acne and also smells soooo good; smells edible. You do not need as much as other toners so this will last awhile. I am so happy that I decided to try this out because I often switch my toners trying to find the right one. My skin tone looks better and more even. I had it a week before trying it because I have other toners. The best difference for me is how my pores look smaller which is rare to find and my face looks better; even tone; firm and slightly glowing also. Please try this product, I have all kinds of high ends but if you need your pores to look better and your face all around better then you NEED this toner. It also does not burn, sting or tingle so it is great for sensitive skin. My face feels great. I have also recently bought other foxbrim products and pleased with everything so far.</li>
    <li> I love this toner !  It&#x27;s orange fresh and so beautiful. I use it everyday</li>
    <li> This toner was delivered on time and in great condition. I have used the product twice daily for a week and i love it. It is the first toner i have everused that does not leave my skin feeling dry and tight. My skin feels fresh and clean without the harshness of other products! Great toner, definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> This smells heavenly.  We have orange trees and the scent of the blooms in the spring are intoxicating.  This feels refreshing and soothing at the same time.  I&#x27;ve only used this for about a week so I can&#x27;t attest to any long-term benefits.  It&#x27;s a luxurious product.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t state it&#x27;s organic but it is cruelty-free which I think is so important.</li>
    <li> This toner has an amazing smell, its very fresh but therapeutic at the same time. I love how awake it makes my skin feel :)</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this and it makes my face feel tighter, cleaner and shiny.</li>
    <li> really liking the way my face feels after using this</li>
    <li> This has a nice refreshing smell to it and is not harsh on your skin. Use it after washing my face daily.</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing! It helps with the oils on my face and helps with my makeup halfway through the day! And it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> The overall scent of this is nice and I like that it&#x27;s so natural. My skin is looking and feeling good!</li>
    <li> Smells great! Works great!</li>
    <li> Smells good,  fast ship. It&#x27;s not greasey.  Goes on smooth</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing and feels refreshing on my face.  I used this product as a toner after washing to get excess oil and makeup off my face.  This toner preps my face for the moisturizer.  I actually feel the moisturizer soaking in my skin more.  This toner does not dry out my skin like some toners can.  This product removes only excess oil and makeup not moisture from your skin.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful find! I make sure to use toner daily as part of my skincare regiment. Most that I have used are alcohol based and strong, both in smell and potency. I usually cut my toner with witch hazel for my sensitive skin. So I was extremely pleased to hear about Orange Blossom water as a natural astringent and toner. It was a treat to open the packaging and find a glass bottle. The sent is so wonderful and not a cloying floral sent. The water is pure and natural which is huge for me and my sensitive skin. I apply it to a cotton round and swipe it over my freshly washed skin and the water picks up any left over makeup or soap film and tones my pores. Though it doesn&#x27;t burn like typical toners, it still removes any residual eye liner or mascara! Very impressed. Because it&#x27;s pure, you can use it for aromatherapy, as a bath soak, in a facial steam...awesome! *Discount given for my unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order from the seller again.</li>
    <li> I got this product free to review and I absolutely love it. It smells like honeysuckles on a rainy summer day. I also noticed, unlike many other toners, this particular one does not dry out my face.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment, an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Great product! The smell is wonderful - but subtle. Feels refreshing when you put it on your skin. I would definitely recommend this toner and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> The scent of this toner is to die for. I enjoy every spray. This is also 100% natural water from the orange blossoms. You can also rigjt away tell the the great quality of this toner. I love to use this one in the morning rigjt after cleansing my face. I feel like it really tones and brightens my face. The anti-microbial properties will benefit those with acne or problematic skin. It also has a lot of uses, you can add it to a mask or even to your bath! So happy i found this product. I love it. This is my honest opinion about this toner i am able to try.</li>
    <li> This toner is so refreshing and your face will feel so clean.  I&#x27;ve really never tried any toner like it.  You get all the refreshing splash of toner without the harsh chemicals or drying alcohol.  I also tried the recommended use for mixing it with a clay mask.  The mask dried twice as fast!  I&#x27;d recommend getting FoxBrim&#x27;s mask to go with it the Aztec one was a little clumpy when used with this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this product for about a week now, and she absolutely loves it! It has evened out her skin tone, helped with reducing the inflammation in her acne, and leaves her skin softer than before. As a teenager it has been hard finding a product for her that really works, and this one has been the biggest help by far. I had got it for the both of us, but it looks like I will be ordering my own bottle lol. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This toner is amazing. Great smell and leaves my face feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to read the lable and see how many different uses I could get out of this product! You can use it on your skin, and hair, as a room spray, if you&#x27;re out and feel grimey put this in a spray bottle for your hands! It says you can use this as a room spray as well. I never smelled orange blossom water before I ordered this, but it does NOT smell like oranges, It has an herbal smell, so if herbal isn&#x27;t your thing (think tea bag smell) then this toner isn&#x27;t for you. I do wish mine came with a dropper though. Just use a cotton ball.</li>
    <li> I really like this toner I Like to use it in my bath. It leaves my skin feeling so nice and smells really good too. The toner smells like flowers. The bottle is pretty big so it will last a while. I did receive it to review.</li>
    <li> My skin is very complicated and I actually see where this product has made a difference in the tone of my skin and it also helped with the shrinkage of my pores, I would definitely by this product again.</li>
    <li> this makes my skin feel so good and I love the scent</li>
    <li> Really like this toner. Like the way my skin feels afterwards and that it is 100% all natural! Really refreshing!</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly and feels very refreshing as a toner.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product smells!  It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feels fresh. I tried it on my legs first, becasue my makeup was already on when it came in, and also to make sure I didn&#x27;t have a reaction.  I have had no problems since, and I love the way it smells, a sweet soft smell.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels lovely, with a strong floral scent. You might also have seen this product sold as orange blossom hydrosol. It&#x27;s lovely as a toner, or simply to splash on your face for a refreshing and fragrant pick-me-up in hot weather. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my skin, or irritate my sensitive oily skin. This seems like a high quality product; my only suggestion would be to add a sprayer for easier and less wasteful application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review. This does NOT mean this is a fake review. I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review. If you don&#x27;t believe me, click my profile and scroll down to see the poor reviews I&#x27;ve given bad products. My job is to give an honest opinion, not help the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, not sure if it really does all that it says. I have pretty clear skin to begin with. But, I like to use this in the morning when I wake up, because it&#x27;s a lovely smell that helps me wake up. Not overly perfumey. Very nice product. Bottle is very nice heavy glass too.</li>
    <li> smells really good and refreshing</li>
    <li> Foxbrim - what a great product from a great company. I just love everything I have ordered from this company they are so consistent with great design and packaging on the products.  This toner is beautiful the scent is just lovely and it gently cleanses and tightens the skin. I have combo skin on the typical t zone and ths gently cleans but also balances the skin. So many toners are too heavily astringent and over dry the surface layer resulting in breakouts this is not the case it&#x27;s this toner.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> As a licensed esthetician, I can tell&lt;br /&gt;you that toners are probably one of the&lt;br /&gt;most important steps in any skin care&lt;br /&gt;regimen. They remove cleanser residue&lt;br /&gt;and help restore the ph of the skin. And&lt;br /&gt;also prepare it to absorb other skin treat-&lt;br /&gt;ments more effectively.This toner leaves&lt;br /&gt;my skin super soft and conditioned.  Smells&lt;br /&gt;like real orange blossom minus the alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;The dark glass container also helps&lt;br /&gt;preserve the liquid better than plastic&lt;br /&gt;which is known to contaminate any pro-&lt;br /&gt;duct with time.  The quality and purity&lt;br /&gt;of this product makes it a valuable&lt;br /&gt;addition to any skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> This toner has a very refreshing smell. I loved the toner!!! I will defiantly order it again.</li>
    <li> I received this on discount from a group this in no way biased my review!  I have been using this on my face and I love it my face feels clean and refreshed and the smell of oranges is fantastic! I love this product!</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this!  I kind of want to bathe in it.</li>
    <li> My face has never looked better. Usually id break out from stuff like this but not with this one. Ive been using it for about a week or so and my skin is glowing and very smooth. Id give this one ten stars if i could. The smell is beautiful too. Its definitely part of my beauty routine now.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does. Minimize pores, hydrate and soothe skin and has natural acidity that balance pH levels for healthy moisture and tone radiant skin. Smells wonderful. Very happy with this Orange Blossom Water Toner.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love foxbrim products!  It smells good and leaves my face feeling very clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m A true Foxbrim fan NOW!! It started one month ago when I bought their vitamin C serum. I noticed almost immediate difference and so I decided to try the orange Blossom water toner. I knew that I trusted the brand and knew if I wanted even better skin I was choosing Foxbrim products. I choose the toner because essentially how simple the product was. My face has had fewer breakouts and fewer blackheads since I started using it. I believe due to the fact that it is cleaning out my pores better than just soap and water. I&#x27;m so excited to see the difference in the texture and the glow of my skin these days!</li>
    <li> Loved it! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I really like this product a lot. It&#x27;s very mild, no sting at all. It smells fantastic IMO. I will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> Love this clean fresh scent great pick me up in the morning</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail today. After trying it out for he first time. I was pleasantly surprised of the wonderful scent of floral water of Mediterranean. I applied it with a makeup cotton ball and immediately felt my skin. It felt nice and refreshed. I love this toner! It didn&#x27;t leave my skin feel rough or dry nor did it sting like some do. I would give this a 5 star anyway. I will definitely be recommending to my friends and family!</li>
    <li> This toner smells delicious. It makes my skin soft and clean and I come away smelling wonderful.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to smell like oranges, but as someone who also has used Vitamin C toner, I should have known better. It was a bit of a musty smell, not as strong as the Vitamin C toner. It&#x27;s not completely unpleasant and didn&#x27;t linger on my face. Since using this toner, I&#x27;ve noticed less oily spots on my face by afternoon, which is fantastic. I always have to carry blotting papers in my purse for my combination skin. This also left my face feeling, but without that awful burn of toners with alcohol. I really like this product! Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> Im very much enjoying this product. My skin feels amazing after using it and its very soothing. This is completely a must have!</li>
    <li> I have used it twice so far, feels refreshing.</li>
    <li> This toner is refreshing and left my skin feeling very clean. Very easy to use and my face felt so soft with a great texture. I will definitely add this to my morning routine, plus it smells great</li>
    <li> I have loved this product!  I use a toner every night for my face and this one cleans well and leaves my skin feeling refreshed, and it smells heavenly!  A little goes a long way! Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic and very refreshing for the skin!</li>
    <li> When I first saw this product I was very eager to test it out and purchased it during a one time promotional period. I have owned essential oils from Foxbrim before and have enjoyed their products so I bought the toner. I grew up around orange trees and love the sweet scent of orange blossoms. The package arrived very well sealed and in a dark glass container that allows the toner to stay fresh and pure without toxins or chemicals. The label contains several uses for the toner and information on orange blossoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner smells amazing! It truly reminds me of the fields of orange blossoms near my old home. The toner has a citrus like floral scent and has no color. The toner looks like water and has the same consistency as water as well. I really like water consistency because after I apply it to my face or body, there is no sticky feeling and my skin absorbs all of the toner. I use this toner every day on my face and hands! The toner feels very fresh and cool when applied and the skin feels clean after use. My skin looks more fresh and my skin has gotten smoother and less oily. I usually break out during that time of the month and this toner has minimized my breakouts! I completely love the scent and the amazing results of this orange blossom toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My favorite part about Foxbrim&#x27;s orange blossom water toner is that it is 100% natural with nothing added! My skin gets all the benefits of this natural toner and I can eliminate my old toner with added chemicals. I have also used this toner in a small spray bottle to freshen my furniture, sheets and clothes and I simply love inhaling the sweet floral scent of orange blossoms. This is a must have beautifully perfumed toner with skin benefits and all natural properties, I simply love it!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use daily as party of my skin routine.  I live in a dry climate so I really am happy to have found such a quality product.</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful toner.  After using this toner, my face feels so smooth. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This toner smelt amazing, felt fresh, and glided on the skin smoothly. Very, very happy with my purchases from Foxbrim! (Also bough argan oil, and vitamin c serum)</li>
    <li> Works very well. After using my pores look and feel really clean. I also love the smell. I don&#x27;t use foundation so I don&#x27;t know how good it work with foundation. I bought at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I have recently moved and have very hard water. I noticed a difference in my skin. It seemed that my regular products had no effect. My skin was dull. I decided to try a toner. This one is excellent! I believe it helps my serum and moisturizer work better for my skin. It smells wonderful! It cleans and softens. It doesnt sting or make my skin feel tight. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> So, so, so gentle on my face (compared to the garbage toners I had been using, leaving me with a burning sensation on my skin). This has been wonderful to use and the scent is refreshing to me. I really love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product! I don&#x27;t believe it has an alcohol, so didn&#x27;t dry my skin. The smell is fantastic. I felt that it clarified and cleared my skin. I will definitely buy again exclamation exclamation</li>
    <li> After I use the mask I follow with this toner, which smells incredible!  My face feels so clean and clear after the mask and toner!  Great product and customer service!</li>
    <li> I love this toner solution. I use these every morning as a part of my daily routine and these haven&#x27;t let me down yet. For about /2 the price of stores this is a great option. Delivery was super fast and great quality.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much more than I thought I would. It works really well after a face mask to nicely balance out your skin texture</li>
    <li> Love this product ...  Washed my faced and used this afterwards, my face felt refreshed, hydrated and not feeling dried out. Love the smell of it and it is a larger bottle and you use very little of it.  Would recommend and purchase again</li>
    <li> Not only does this smell wonderful the results from using the toner are just a great. I love using all Foxbrim&#x27;s skin products, they work so well and I see &amp; feel the difference from using them.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I love the scent and the way my skin feels after I use it.</li>
    <li> Natural and soothing, so good for the skin</li>
    <li> I was asked to write a review for the Orange Blossom Water Toner. This product is very refreshing and smells pleasant. Dries very nicely on your face. Loved it! Thank you</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels great,  works better</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Has done wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> I am SUCH a huge fan of Foxbrim products!  This toner has JUST ONE ingredient, and is cruelty-free.  There are a few recommended uses listed on the package:&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply with a cotton ball to a clean, dry face, applying slight pressure to remove debris from pores.&lt;br /&gt;2. Add to facial mask for additional skin healing and clarifying properties.&lt;br /&gt;3. Add to bath water for a soothing and relaxing bath that will do wonders for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;4. Aromatherapy, hand freshener (?), room scent, facial steam, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually put a spray top on the bottle (the ones that come on travel-size spray bottles and Bath &amp; Body Works travel-size fragrance mists fit PERFECTLY) and spray it on my face just after cleansing or rinsing off a facial mask.  So, my regimen would look like one of the following:&lt;br /&gt;a. Face wash, THIS PRODUCT, hyaluronic serum, light moisturizer, heavy moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;b. Mask, THIS PRODUCT, hyaluronic serum, light moisturizer, heavy moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;c. Face wash, THIS PRODUCT, hyaluronic serum, light moisturizer, primer, makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do toners do?&lt;br /&gt;1.Remove dirt and makeup residue&lt;br /&gt;2.Complement the cleansing process&lt;br /&gt;3.Refine pores and tighten pores temporarily&lt;br /&gt;4.Make skin feel fresh and clean&lt;br /&gt;5.Remove excess oil from the skin&lt;br /&gt;6.Refresh tired complexion&lt;br /&gt;7.Whisk away impurities&lt;br /&gt;8.Reduce the appearance of fine lines&lt;br /&gt;9.Increase blood circulation&lt;br /&gt;10.Restore your skin’s natural pH balance&lt;br /&gt;11.Improve skin tone&lt;br /&gt;12.Reduce oil secretion&lt;br /&gt;13.Improve the elimination of toxins&lt;br /&gt;14.Speed up cell turnover&lt;br /&gt;15.Promote sloughing of dead skin cells&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;Comes in an amber-colored glass bottle and is shrink-wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:&lt;br /&gt;Light floral, reminiscent of honeysuckle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Citrus Aurantium Amara (Orange Blossom) distillate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other information:&lt;br /&gt;Vegan.  Cruelty-free.  Imported from Morocco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Factoring in all that information, my pros/cons are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;PROS- Great natural, light scent.  Used as part of a facial regimen, this is a light toner that helps the skin to retain moisture and is gentle enough for sensitive skin.  Competitive price point for the size.&lt;br /&gt;CONS- A lot of product is lost when applied with a cotton pad.  I recommend using a spray top if you&#x27;re using this as a toner, then dampen a cotton pad with water if you want to rub it into your skin.  I usually just let it sink into my skin without any rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I LOVE this product and highly recommend it!in all that information, my pros/cons are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;PROS- Great natural, light scent.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been amazed with this produc this far. My skin feels soft and I&#x27;ve not had a breakout since I&#x27;ve been using it. I was asked to test and review this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toner for about a week and have noticed a dramatic change in my skin for the better! It looks like it took 5 years off my face already and it&#x27;s only been one week! My skin was becoming dull prior to this product from lack of sleep due to stress and several other issues that have taken a toll on me both mentally and physically. My skin is now looking more plump, firm, it&#x27;s glowingly much more radient! I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like after a month! I am so glad that I discovered this product! I&#x27;m a 35 year old 117lb female who is big into nutrition and fitness, but I have been lacking severely in both areas for the last 1 1/2 years dealing with chronic pain from a car accident years ago and repeated traumatic events afterwards. I just now am starting to get myself back to how I used to look just 2 years ago and this toner will definitely help me achieve that much quicker! Thank you so much for a wonderful product. I will recommend this to everyone I know, just seeing the amazing results in such a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this great product.  I have been using this product for a few weeks and I love how it preps my skin after I wash for my moisturizers. I love the fresh scent and love the ingredients because It is not harsh on my sensitive skin. Thank you,</li>
    <li> Hands down one of the most amazing things I&#x27;ve ever smelled in MY LIFE! It&#x27;s intoxicating. I would wear this as perfume. My skin loves it. Feels nourished and hydrated. Stunning product. Will never run out of this.</li>
    <li> The only Toner I will ever use</li>
    <li> I have 3 different Foxbrim face products I&#x27;ve been using together now and I&#x27;m so in love! I have always had the most oily/dry/uneven skin on my face and neck. I&#x27;ve never been able to put lotions or scrums and creams on my face without my face feeling like I put Crisco on it. But I can see and feel a difference, I&#x27;ve had multiple compliments on my skin &amp;#34;you look like your glowing! What are you doing? &amp;#34; you bet your behind I tell them Foxbrim, Amazon and I am so ok not paid to say anything just good stuff! Thank you! : ) - Angie H. -</li>
    <li> This is amazing! It smells so good,I wish there was a perfume that smelled like this!</li>
    <li> I received this toner at a promotional rate to review the product. This stuff is absolutely amazing. I was expecting it to smell more orangy, but it is so light and floral and not offensive at all. I have used it on my face twice now, and it absolutely does an amazing job of toning my skin while still keeping it soft and supple. I currently use another brand of all natural ingredients toner, but I think I&#x27;m making the switch to this permanently. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often use this type of product, however I was intrigued by the natural ingredients, especially the orange blossom.  It smells divine and feel great on my skin.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of days now, but I honestly think my face is softer, feels cleaner and the pores are less apparent.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple weeks now with another vitamin C spray (Azure Naturals) and my skin is AMAZING!  I was looking for something natural and gentle, as my skin has been red and oily and flaky.  That&#x27;s exactly what I got with this product AND my skin seems to be LESS RED!  I have been skipping foundation all together and going straight to just covering spots that haven&#x27;t faded away yet.  I use it twice a day, morning and night.  Usually I don&#x27;t cleanse my face again in the morning, but I WIILL soak a cotton pad in this and wipe down my face.  The scent is beautiful, it feels refreshing, and it helps your skin!</li>
    <li> Received just as described- would certainly reorder if needed!</li>
    <li> This is now my go to toner. I love the smell and feels great. Also used in my diffuser!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to be able to review this product! It has been HOT here in the South lately, After a long day, even after I remove my make up, my face gets oily and the humidity hits.  It was so refreshing to be able to us this Orange Blossom Toner before going to bed ,  Just a bit on a cotton pad during my bedtime routine, and my skin feels fresh and the aroma relaxes me for a good night sleep. I can not rave enough about how wonderful this product is!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Feels great on my face. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> My face always had a oily feeling before I started using this product now it does not! I love how its so easy to use and a little goes along way!!! My redness in my face also went away also and to be honest just had it for a few days great product!!!!</li>
    <li> one of the best beauty products i have come across in years. this gentle astringent and toner has done miracles in riding my face of blemishes and irritation. i use it on my neck and decolletage as well. my skin is moisturized and glowing. The fragrance is soothing and invigorating at the same time if that is possible.  i&#x27;m going to try some in my office atomizer. it smells so good i want to cook with it!</li>
    <li> I love this toner almost as much as rose water. The smell alone reminds me of some kind of spice bazaar in the middle east and is very relaxing. It absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves it feeling fresh and revitalized and looks brighter. Great for sensitive skin as well.</li>
    <li> Smells DELICIOUS!!! it is very refreshing and you feel it tightning. I would purchase again</li>
