<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great shipping and great for holding wigs</li>
    <li> A must for styling wigs.  I like the foam heads because you can pin the wigs to them as you work, so no shifting around.  Has a hole in the bottom for a wig stand; I have a clamp on one and they go together perfectly.  If you want this to style wigs, I highly suggest you get a base or stand of some kind to go with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great head! It shipped super fast, and came is pristine condition! It holds my wigs perfectly, and stays up right just fine (which I was a little worried about)!&lt;br /&gt;If I ever need another one, I&#x27;m getting one of these! :D</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to try hats on. I knit a lot of hats and needed something to try them out on.</li>
    <li> Really great! Came super fast!! I love it!</li>
    <li> as stated fast service</li>
    <li> I use it for a wig stand.  It is fine.  It should have been packed better because it got dented.</li>
    <li> It was dented when it arrived, but it makes an ok wig stand. A bit small so my wig falls off often if I move it too much.</li>
    <li> never owned one, of these but was in need of one.  very glad I ordered this wig form.  The head is sturdy and I can now style my wigs with much more ease.  Yes i would reccomend this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Styrofoam head</li>
    <li> Came in just in time but the head was damage and had lines and bubble warp markings. :(</li>
    <li> The wig head was a little bit smaller than I would have liked, but otherwise is a good, basic wig head. It does its job of holding my wig just fine.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as described. With it being a little on the small side, I worried my daughter&#x27;s heavier cosplay wigs may tip it over. Not the case. Pleased with the product and price, so I ordered another and will most likely order more. It&#x27;s a tad creepy looking, but I won&#x27;t deduct a star for that. ;)</li>
    <li> These wig heads are like play things. They are waaay too light and they keep falling over when I put my wigs on them. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I had painted this and gave it to my mom as a present. She cried. It amazed her.</li>
    <li> Came quickly with a small dent in the top of its head, (barely noticeable) but I would definitely recommend for wigs and etc.</li>
    <li> use for a delicate hat that I don&#x27;t want to mess up</li>
    <li> The head arrived very fast, but it was not as pictured. A different head was shipped.  Normally this would not matter if w were using it as a wig stand, but we weren&#x27;t.  The head that was shipped has a huge base on it and won&#x27;t work for what we wanted it for.  Too late to order another one.</li>
    <li> OK....BUT FOUND AFTER I BOUGHT THEM, COULD HAVE GOTTEN CHEAPER AT HOBBY LOBBY.</li>
    <li> I love this styrofoam wig head! It holds the wig perfectly. Thank you to the seller for having this product on hand. Kudos to you! Also arrived in a timely fashion which i really appreciate.</li>
    <li> I like this head. I use it for still life drawing in my art classes. It&#x27;s not quite as big or realistic as the guy one I have, but it&#x27;s still neat to draw.</li>
    <li> will be sure to be using this product often.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good wig head but I can&#x27;t say it arrived in perfect condition... It looked like down one scratched it but over all it worked pretty well</li>
    <li> Ordered three one severely dented..</li>
    <li> it was ok, it&#x27;s doing the job but not to our expectations</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my first wig.  The size was good and my wig was perfect.  Can&#x27;t wait to do another one.</li>
    <li> These styrofoam wig heads are not neatly made.  There are rough, unfinished edges all around each of the three heads I purchased.  I ended up not even using them because I was so unhappy with how they looked.  It also wasn&#x27;t packed well.  The three styrofoam heads were in a box without any packing materials.  They came with some dents and scratches etched in the styrofoam.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great with my projects</li>
    <li> Overall they are decent heads to store my wigs as opposed to in a drawer somewhere but they are smaller then I expected and are not sturdy in the least. If the wig is positioned in a certain way I am able to get the head to stand up right. Yet for heavier and wigs with a higher density it is impossible for the head to stand up on its own without being propped up between other items. My wigs slide off easily but thats a simple fix with the help of t-pins.</li>
    <li> nice but so light that it constantly falls down!</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could style a wig and it served its purpose.  It arrived as it appears in the image, undamaged, and was the right size for the wig.  The only issue I ran into was that I was trying to put the wig in a ponytail (which is difficult enough for me as it is) and it kept on falling over.  I ended up having to employ someone else to hold the head while I styled the hair.  However, it was cheap so I didn&#x27;t expect much out of it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok..works like a styrofoam head. Is not sturdy or anything.</li>
    <li> It does what it needs to do. Great price, haven&#x27;t had a problem with it at all.</li>
    <li> The wig head was as described and in perfect condition.  It was just what I wanted to use in a display.</li>
    <li> this is nice to have when your making hats</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these styrofoam wig heads, and they shipped quite quickly. I&#x27;m currently using them to hold my wigs for Otakon, and they serve their purpose well. They don&#x27;t tip over or anything, and they have decent weight. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> was perfect for me. used to display a mask and it worked great and got to my home quick! if i ever need another styro head i&#x27;m getting it here.</li>
    <li> Good model for an acupuncture student.  Nice and elegant looking face.  She is kinda hott to be honest.</li>
    <li> I got a female head instead of a male head so it was patently offensive to have my wig on this while company was in my Passenger room on a Russian Tanker. Material is cheap grade foam. As a side note, this is very buoyant if the ship capsizes.</li>
    <li> came unleveled falls over constantly.</li>
    <li> Perfect for taking pics of hats I make.</li>
    <li> Product arrived when expected and in good shape.   No problems with the seller.     For the purpose I&#x27;m using the styrofoam head (to make a mold for a Halloween decoration), I would have preferred it to be a little more realistic in appearance. But it was a good deal for the price, and I can \\&quot;tweak\\&quot; it a bit with a little craft clay and an exacto blade.       All in all, a good shopping experience with this seller.</li>
    <li> It does its job. It holds a wig.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!! Arrived fast !!!</li>
    <li> Seems a bit too small for my head o well gotta make it work!! Great packaging!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it gives me the option to have a place to put my wigs. Also, if you are practicing to sew in a weave, this is a great display. The only problem i have is the model head is smaller circumference than mines :( Otherwise, you can use pins, thumb tacks to hold the hair in place, or glue. Whatever your preference, the product gives you diversity in styling. A must have for wig/weavers.</li>
    <li> Exactly as shown.&lt;br /&gt;Seam is VERY slight.  NOT a problem (I disagree with the other reviewer on this).&lt;br /&gt;Not tippy at all.  Did not have to sand down the seam at all, seam is no issue at all.</li>
    <li> very good product. It serves a purpose.  Has to be very care, because it is styrofoam</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this. It has served its purpose.</li>
    <li> I got this head to display my size small crochet hat and it works perfectly with that. But it did come with a few small dents but nothing that&#x27;s so bad it will ruin the displaying</li>
    <li> Great Product Fast Delivery!!</li>
    <li> Fine quality basic wig head.</li>
    <li> Nice Head! great for holding my wigs.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Perfect for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a head made of styrofoam for holding wigs or masks. What else can be said. It has no moving parts... it works as advertized.</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose quite well. I actually have 2 wigs on the one wig stand. It is very stable and keeps the wigs in good shape. Would purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> This strofoam head is good for both caps and wigs.  The size is good for storing so it&#x27;s not in the way.  It arrived on time, undamaged, and it was cheap.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Came faster than expected! Love that the size is realistic! Overall great product and service!</li>
    <li> As advertised. Big enough to accommodate most wigs but small enough to store away if needed</li>
    <li> Perfect for displaying my Pug head mask!</li>
    <li> The head works very well for holding my cosplay wigs for me! The only downside is that it is smaller than a human&#x27;s head and it is somewhat off to the side as well. Overall, I am very happy I purchased this!</li>
    <li> I like the product and would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice for the price.  Face looks as pictured.  The head is the perfect size for a quality, adult-sized wig.  Neck height is proportionate and makes this ideal for a shorter wig - maybe no longer than shoulder length unless you get creative with some sort of additional base attachment so for a longer wig.  Unfortunately, I had to return mine because it was shipped with an 8 lb book and the book left indentations all over the head.  Thankfully, it was a prime purchase (Midwest Beauty Supply fulfilled by Amazon) so the return was hassle-free.  I have yet to repurchase but I would again if ever I happened to see it as a prime eligible purchase for the same price and had no other items on order that could potentially be packed with it and damage it.</li>
    <li> The wig head itself is great and a must have for long wigs (Unless you have a lamp) but I am very disappointed with the bubble wrap. It is no fun and all of the bubbles are deflated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two so far and both have been perfect. They both stand up on their own and hold the wigs on just fine.</li>
    <li> Though not as portable as the snap-together ones I also use it certainly looks nicer. The only complaint is that since the whole thing is so light weight it knocks over at the slightest nudge.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I got the wig head within 3 days of me buying it, but when I got it, it had a lot of dents in it. It&#x27;s also super lightweight and falls over when you start styling the wig on it. I had to hot glue a piece of wood under the base to try and keep it from constantly falling over. I could really take this purchase or leave it.</li>
    <li> Came about 2 days earlier than prediction. I bought this for my first cosplay wig, the head is very sturdy and will definitely purchase again for future wigs. I recommend this! :^)</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a foam head. what can i say? I guess it fits the clamp, that I bought with it, better than the foam head I bought locally. Just wish the supplier of this product met their delivery obligations on time especially when they charge you 12 times more for shipping than the total cost of the products purchased.</li>
    <li> This head looks great in my display... I will be reordering this..</li>
    <li> Great Nothing Was Wrong With It, Its Definitely The Same Styrofoam Head You Can Buy From Any Local Beauty Supply No Issues or Problems.</li>
    <li> I ordered the styrofoam wig head to use in a series of photos of hats that I crocheted for chemo patients.  The head was reasonably priced and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a great form. It served it&#x27;s purpose of hat model well! She has a great looking face too!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described and shown, though it had a handful of small (3-4 cm long) shallow dings/gouges on its surface. Understandable, given that it&#x27;s styrofoam.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised at the quality of this item. I will definitely reorder this product. Great low price also.</li>
    <li> It is what it is. It&#x27;s a styrofoam head for your wig. My wig fits perfectly on it and there&#x27;s no crumbs or anything like that coming from the head.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a happy buyer so far!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed when I saw the items. All 4 items were packed in the same box and three of the styrofoam heads had a few scratches on them. They were not as smooth as they seem on the site. One of the styrofoam heads had chunks of styrofoam missing on the side and it was disappointing. The only good thing was the delivery time was very quick.</li>
    <li> Great wig head - was used for a muscle project for Anatomy &amp; Physiology. If you need it for a similar use, I got 2 words for you: super glue.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re welcome. :)</li>
    <li> it does not balance with a wig on it. It keeps tipping over. Will not purchase this one again. I WILL MAKE THIS PURCHASE AGAIN</li>
    <li> What can I say, it gets the job done. Currently the one I bought is holding up both my wig and witch&#x27;s hat that I&#x27;ll be using in a month for when Halloween rolls closer. But if I were to get additional wigs at some point, I&#x27;d definitely be buying more of these. Cheap and easy, what&#x27;s not to like about it?</li>
    <li> This is your very basic styrofoam head but does the trick to hold wigs nicely.  Would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> I bought a semi-high quality wig and wanted to make sure it would hold it&#x27;s shape so I bought this and it works. It&#x27;s light (of course because it&#x27;s styrofoam) and it doesn&#x27;t tip, so that&#x27;s a plus. I&#x27;d buy again!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect stand for my wig.  thanks for getting it to me so quickly.  It arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so upset with these ppl, bc I ordered the &amp;#34;Female&amp;#34; bt I still received a ugly male wig head. Really? What am I suppose to do with a male head. Whatever I needed it ASAP so I took the ears of so at list I have it plat all the way ard. I hate it bc I have it in my bedroom and my husband feel so uncomfortable with it lol. Bt I payed for it so I will make the best use of it.</li>
    <li> I have an Etsy store that I sell crotchet hats in and needed a model head to take pictures of wearing the hats.  This was packaged well and works perfect for my hats!</li>
    <li> I like this styrofoam wig head very much.  It was a good price and the shipping was free!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with making a knitted hat. for an adult.&lt;br /&gt;It is way too small for that.&lt;br /&gt;It can help if you&#x27;re making a child&#x27;s hat or want to display an adult hat that hangs to the bottom of the Styrofoam head.</li>
    <li> got these mainly for our craft sales.......nice to display the crocheted hats we make</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Arrived fast and worked out great. There was an indentation on the face, which is why I gave four instead of five stars. But the back and body were fine, so it works for what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is cheap and will not stand up on its own.  I truly wish I had not ordered this item.</li>
    <li> Not much to say. It&#x27;s a styrofoam head! It&#x27;s light weight and holds my wigs nicely. I do use pins to hold the wig in place while styling but that&#x27;s a personal preference. I&#x27;ve used the plastic wig stands before and they are too flimsy. I will stick with the styrofoam. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> it came in really fast although it had a scratch it was just a minor problem?&lt;br /&gt;it has a good stand stable posture.</li>
    <li> The face arrived smashed in!</li>
    <li> Helpful for styling wigs, glad I got it!</li>
    <li> Sturdy, not expensive and do the job.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe that I got two wig heads so reasonably inexpensively.  Normally a wig head from most wig stores are around $30.00  a piece, but I got two wig heads for way less than I would have paid for one.  The heads are of normal size and my wigs are right at home on there.  I will be ordering more items from this company in the near future.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a very good wig holder, but the reason i gave it three stars is that when i opened it there was a dent in her face. (which im sure it was just the shipping that messed it up not the seller)</li>
    <li> good price.  made well. if you have wigs you need at least one of these, for brushing and stying the hair.</li>
    <li> They work great for crafts/projects. My two daughters and I made mummies with these for Halloween.  We had a great time!</li>
    <li> Way too small to hold a medium cap size. I have to adjust my straps. Make sure to order or buy pins with this BTW.</li>
    <li> Most of these other comments are ridiculous. Mine came without damage a day before expected. It&#x27;s already cheap and it&#x27;s Styrofoam so yes you might have to be careful with it. 5 starts from me don&#x27;t know about anyone else.</li>
    <li> Although the shape is nice and perfect for what I needed, shipping was rough. It came with many dents in the back of the head and one HUGE one right in the middle of the forehead, a bit disappointed</li>
    <li> I have a long black wig, so when I found this online, I was very happy. This helps prevent the wig from tangling, like it would in it&#x27;s plastic bag.</li>
    <li> The face is perfect. The head shape is perfect for any wig you may have. The foam head is sturdy and very well made.</li>
    <li> I love how it came in very quickly.. My wigs needed a head and i have been cosplay for a long time but never thought i needed a wig head but i decided to get one now and wow fast delivery and it make me very happy, very good head shape fit glasses onto the head and just very nice.. now i can finally say i have a wig head stand :) YAY</li>
    <li> I would reinforce it with wig pins if you&#x27;re a little concerned with the fitting. It&#x27;s a little awkward to get wigs on this, but they do fit- they just fine.</li>
    <li> The wig came on time and no damage what so ever like it was brand new! I highly recommend this for cosplayers and hair stylists. Worth the money and helpful.  :)</li>
    <li> I love the wig head and my wig fits on it but it wobbles a little bit too much. But other than that it does the job!</li>
    <li> It is a couple of dollars more than the cheapest wig heads but it&#x27;s the right size. I ordered on of the others from another website and it&#x27;s too small for the wig! This one fits and it&#x27;s easily worth the price difference. The delivery was right on time.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive styrofoam light weight base. It&#x27;s fine for our purpose of holding a wig. It is a little wobbly, but works fine.</li>
    <li> Works well. I also had fun drawing in eyes and mouth.</li>
    <li> It got here a couple days before the estimated date. When it arrived it was wrapped in bubble wrap and in perfect condition. I really like having it as it makes styling wigs a ton easier.</li>
    <li> I got a female head instead of a male head so it was patently offensive to have my wig on this while company was in my Passenger room on a Russian Tanker. Material is cheap grade foam. As a side note, this is very buoyant if the ship capsizes.</li>
    <li> its a well shaped styrofoam head for holding my costume wigs..works great!!..a must have for wigs and hats..i bought 2..i plan on accumulating an entire army over time..oh and the face is pleasant..lol..</li>
    <li> Perfect, got it for my sister who&#x27;s having a bit of thinning and she has some extensions she can use with it. Not big &amp;  bulky , just right.Thank You...</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this item! It works well for what I needed it for and the price was GREAT! Very satisfied :)</li>
    <li> Quality was good, delivered on time and works great</li>
    <li> This wig head will do just fine for my uses. It&#x27;s sturdy and holds my wigs nicely. I really like this wig head. I will be able  to use it to detangle, style, and fix my wigs. Sol glad I bought this and the price can&#x27;t be beat</li>
    <li> Seems better suited to storing a wig than using it to make or style one as the head size is too round to be realistic and too small if you have a bigger head. Still a great value for the price but be prepared to modify it to fit your heads size if making a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as I mentioned in my review for the titan dome cap the seller charged me individual shipping on this and the other two items I ordered which were (all lightweight and inexpensive) but when my order arrived I found them not wrapped in real packing materials but in crumpled plastic bags that other items had once been in. (Each bag had barcodes and item description stickers on them.) Why bother to overcharge for shipping if you aren&#x27;t going to spend some of that money on shipping materials.</li>
    <li> good price - good quality - I will be buying more !!</li>
    <li> One head is as good as another.  They work great for my wife&#x27;s wigs.  However,  I  tend to talk to her heads when she puts the wigs on them, thinking it&#x27;s her.  The good part is I get more intelligent answers from them.</li>
    <li> It does the job who could ask for anything more...</li>
    <li> The hole in the bottom to set it on a spiked base is crooked. As a result, the head stands at a slight angle. Makes styling difficult.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about the relatively small size; however, I bought this stand for a grandmother undergoing chemo treatments. She claims to have needed to purchase the smallest adult-sized wig available in the shop and her wig fits perfectly on this head. So, take that to mean whatever it does to those of you familiar with wigs and hairpieces. Small-headed wig-wearers will find this head more than adequate.</li>
    <li> This was a pretty well built, alien-like, head but in the end I just felt like I was talking to myself.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time,  but had a few dings like on the nose and lips. A little awkward of head shape But works for its purpose.</li>
    <li> The styrofoam heads were perfect for what I needed. My granddaughter and I had so much fun painting them up to display my headbands on. Such a wonderful buy!</li>
    <li> The head is smaller that normal wig heads. My head is way too big and I don&#x27;t know if my wigs will fit.</li>
    <li> Why do these all have alien eyes? It makes it harder to use for determining eye placement on masks... And I can&#x27;t put my glasses on it and use them as a guide because it doesn&#x27;t have ears. I put my Minnie Mouse hat on it and it sits on my desk, at least it&#x27;s good for that... ... Also I think it&#x27;s face is crooked. A little.</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.</li>
    <li> Served my purpose well.</li>
    <li> It is a traditional head for wigs. Serves my purpose well.</li>
    <li> I plan on using this to style my Halloween wig, you can get Styrofoam heads at craft stores but this was a good value. Not the fastest shipping, but it did eventually arrive and since I clearly plan ahead for Halloween (it is still August), I have plenty of time to style my wig</li>
    <li> This was great for advertising some hats I was selling.  Very cheap and was great for the job I had.</li>
    <li> Pretty straight forward styrofoam wig head. Bit of a seam mismatch, but thats easily fixed with a decent hobby knife and a careful hand. I mention that fact due to the nature of its use, I didn&#x27;t want my expensive lace-front-wig to pick up styrofoam tid-bits and/or catch on it and damage the lace or cap in anyway. However, I didn&#x27;t let that nit-picky detail effect the rating, so it gets 5/5 for me.</li>
    <li> What can one say about a wig holder. I can definitely say this is the LEAST expensive wig holder anyone will ever find. It also ARRIVED SUPER FAST and in perfect brand new condition. A much recommended vendor and item.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  I didn&#x27;t realize the head it tilted a bit.  I would rather it have been straight looking on.</li>
    <li> My wig fits nicely on it. However, I thought ths would be sturdier. The stand falls if it not proped up against something which is not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I know this product is mainly used to hold wigs but I bought it as a photo prop to place a wig on and display my hair clips. When it arrived I was disappointed that the nose was smashed in. This wasn&#x27;t caused by shipping because it was packed very well, it was sent to me like that. I will be sending it back and have ordered a new one. Will update my review when I receive the new one hopefully without a smashed nose.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re perfect for modeling the hats and headbands I make</li>
    <li> This wig head came in once piece &amp; was not chipped or cracked.. Will be used to make my wigs and u-parts. For the price you get a sturdy high quality wig head that&#x27;s sure to last.</li>
    <li> This came a lot quicker than I thought it would, about a week after I ordered it. It was in great condition, nice packaging, and it stands fine. There is also a hole at the bottom to put a stand in if needed. It&#x27;s perfect for styling my wigs and would recommend this for anyone who needs it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Styrofoam wig head.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  No complaints</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery! Few dents in the head but great stability and structure...</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Shipped/arrived quickly&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive for what it is&lt;br /&gt;-Does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Only complaint is that it was somewhat deformed when I received it. Parts of the nose and lips were smashed. However, I&#x27;m not a professional and just use these to hold hats that I&#x27;ve made.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t worn it yet but it looks lovely. Not exactly the color pictured but a bit softer.</li>
    <li> This was exactly as represented.  I gifted this item and the receiver plans on painting her a lovely face.  It is a wonderful size for a woman&#x27;s head, will make a good hat stand.</li>
    <li> Eventhough I&#x27;m Not Too Upset About It I Am Disappointed That I Received A MAN&#x27;s WIG HEAD Eventhough I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR AND PAID FOR A WOMAN&#x27;s WIG HEAD. The Package Even Said &amp;#34;Woman&#x27;s Wig Head&amp;#34; On The Paper But When I Looked At It It Had The Face Of A Man... I Was Like Wow 😒 However, The Only Reason I&#x27;m Not Too Upset About It Is Because I Have A Big Head Lol So It Still Worked Out...</li>
    <li> Head isn&#x27;t sturdy at all but it does it&#x27;s job at holding my wig.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these so far and am very happy with what I&#x27;ve gotten. They were well packaged with barely any dents.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased when this came in a good container and nothing was scratched, broke, chipped, etc. It was packaged well, shipped quick and a great price. My daughter knits and crochets scarves and she uses it for displaying her items so she can take pictures of them. It works perfect and it is plain and doesn&#x27;t take away from looking at the actual product for sale  rather than the manequin head itself.</li>
    <li> MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED IT....NO DENTS....AND DELIVERED WHEN EXPECTED.</li>
    <li> It was as described. Everything was fine except the nose and lips were slightly smashed in shipping. Really made little difference, no big deal.</li>
    <li> It came exactly when it was supposed to but when i got it there were some dents in it but it still works great</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and top heavy with wig</li>
    <li> great  product,  keeps  the  shape  of  the  wig,</li>
    <li> what can i say...a wig head is a wig head...*thumbs up*</li>
    <li> Really cheap, was dented and banged up when I got it. Price was right for it I suppose...</li>
    <li> these are just a must have with wigs. they came really fast and i was really suprised. i recommend them if you are looking</li>
    <li> This is a low cost wig holder. It is easy to draw a design on, if you wish to do that. It is much cheaper to buy on Amazon than at Sally Beauty.</li>
    <li> I am using this to create a prosthetic piece out of liquid latex. At first glance, this is TINY! So if using for a wig, it may drape over the bottom. I will update my review after I create the prosthetic to see if it works for what I purchased it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10.17.13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to return this item and buy a man head. I didn&#x27;t even bother to create the prosthetic. I stood next to it in the mirror to confirm my thoughts and back to the seller it goes. :-/</li>
    <li> It works well for coloring, styling, cutting, and just about anything you need to do to wigs.  So in my opinion it serves its purpose, and is quite durable I might add.</li>
    <li> Received it in a timely matter. What can I say about a styrofoam head. Works just fine for my wigs.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I expected. Fast shipping. I am satisfied with my purchase. I use two of these to hold my wig as I style it. Plus they are nice to stand wigs you can&#x27;t put into a bag because of the design. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> Item arrived fast and in great shape, no chips scratches or dents in foam.  Looks just as it does in pic. We have painted her to look like an alien as a Halloween decoration she looks great!</li>
    <li> The bottom of this wig stand has an uneven seam which makes it wobble on any flat surface.  Sometimes enough to fall over.  Otherwise, it does well in holding my wig when I&#x27;m not wearing it.</li>
    <li> The whole packaged smelled like a freaking ashtray and the head still smells like it!! Gross!!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s me check my progress and model finished projects when I crochet headwear. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> i got it pretty fast . 5 to 6 days and it wasnt beat up like others say . it did have a few scratches but you cant really notice them</li>
    <li> Arrived fairly fast and in great condition! It&#x27;s perfect for helping to style my cosplay wigs and to keep them while they aren&#x27;t in use!</li>
    <li> I got two. They were not packed tight. Several scuffs. On the back wouldn&#x27;t be so bad&lt;br /&gt;but the nose and cheek really show.</li>
    <li> she&#x27;s in my window now watching the tweekers down the street, now I have to get another one for our zombie head because my wife likes her to much</li>
    <li> I have not had a chance to use this Styrofoam wig head. I purchased it to make my wigs and have not had a chance to use it yet. I am sure it will work fine.</li>
    <li> Hard to find these anywhere else but on Amazon for a decent price. My daughter does COSPLAY, and she has a few wigs.</li>
    <li> Came with tines of dents but is okay for j&lt;br /&gt;ust hiding in my closet and holding a wig</li>
    <li> I got it fast and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price and fast delivery.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Kinda creepy when I wake up at night and its facing me, but it keeps the shape on my cause-play wig nicely. Kinda on the light weight side but no problem getting the wig on and staying up</li>
    <li> Made up her face, now she has eyes and placed the bad wig on her, looks really nice. I like the height, all I need is one of these I&#x27;m a scary cat, too many can be spooky, the shipping was very fast, all in fun.</li>
    <li> Good wig head. It&#x27;s sturdy, and it has a space at the bottom so you can put it on a stand. I have several of these heads, and I put wigs and hats on them.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was expecting</li>
    <li> exactly is pictured and came super fast! i love it and will probably order more, in perfect condition. perfect to put my wigs on</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great wig head for it&#x27;s price :) I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it, and would defiantly buy this again and recommend it to others :)</li>
    <li> The wig heads are very nice and fit with the wigs perfectly. However, pins are needed if the hair is longer than a bob and the heads fall over very easily.</li>
    <li> Not much to say; it holds your wig... Are there better wig heads? Maybe. Are there worse ones? Undoubtedly. Does it do its job admirably? Yes.</li>
    <li> Works great; highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It came damaged like it had a mike tyson marking through the eye, but it was still usable so i didnt fuss over it!</li>
    <li> This head actually lasted me a long time. It was a bit funny shaped but I adjusted it to mimick my head. It&#x27;s at its whits end right now so I&#x27;m due to buy another one. I think I had this for about 2 years. Overtime, the foam will start to widen where the opening to insert the headstand is at. But it&#x27;s old so whenever that starts to happen, order a new one. Or you&#x27;ll have to put tshirts over the stand to fill in the gap, like I did lol</li>
    <li> nose was flat and face is all lumpy - wanted to use it on a dress form for a Halloween witch creation but it was too damaged to bother with</li>
    <li> I bought this to model my crochet hats. The head size is good and it does the job well.</li>
    <li> The wig head will fall over a lot if the wig is heavy</li>
    <li> It does what it needs to do. :)</li>
    <li> I use this not for wigs, but for displaying and photographing hats that I make and sell. It suits that purpose quite nicely. I don&#x27;t suppose there&#x27;s much more I can say about it.</li>
    <li> Of course, it is very light weight and it does keep falling over, however it looks nice holding my cosplay wig.&lt;br /&gt;It is actively serving its purpose and for the price, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping on it was excellent in time and it was well packed too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty content and maybe once I get a base for it, I&#x27;ll be even happier. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product and particularly so if you have a cure for wobbly Styrofoam heads.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for anyone with a wig or if you wear hats.  I like to wash my winter hats and then let them air dry and putting them on this actually helped keep the nice shape that I love about each hat I have.  The hats dry quickly too.  I just wish it was a bit heavier so it wouldn&#x27;t tip over so easily.  I will remedy that myself but it&#x27;s something to think about.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as described. Many argue about the size of the head as it is smaller than the normal adult head, but I found the head size is just fine. I use the mannequin head as holder to display my crochet hats, and it does the job very well. It is lighter then I accepted, and it came with a lot of scratches that I am not sure if it was because of the seller or the shipping. Because the head is white, in the photos the scratches are not visible, so I am happy with the head. In short, I like the head, but I would be happier if it was heaver as it would be more stable.</li>
    <li> it came in before they said and it is what it is a wig head  now i can work on my Toph wig</li>
    <li> Great to store my wigs on, some of the longer wigs fall over.</li>
    <li> Though prone to tip over, these heads do the job. Great for styling and storage. They are certainly priced cheaply enough to buy multiple heads for multiple wigs. Important for chemo wearers.</li>
    <li> Its okay. The stand falls over alot and dosent sit right on any flat surface. i would suggest buying one with a more steader base</li>
    <li> The styrofoam is very lightweight.  Wish it had a little more weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;Falls over a lot.  Also, I understand pins are extra, but it would have&lt;br /&gt;been nice to have a couple included to secure my hairpiece.</li>
    <li> Badly damaged. Nose was almost completely gone, there were several large dents in the head.</li>
    <li> Its a good wig head. I use it to make u-parts. It wasn&#x27;t damaged or anything. Came in about a week.</li>
    <li> For what I payed I am very happy with the results. As most of the other reviews have stated that the head wobbles a little but all in all it serves its purpose. I am using this to style a wig for future cosplays and it will definitely come in handy!</li>
    <li> There really isn&#x27;t much to say about a wig head, but it wasn&#x27;t messed up in transit, which is nice</li>
    <li> My daughter has tons of wigs and loves to keep them on wig stands. These are priced well and arrived quickly. This purchase was a good one.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, nice package but you get what you pay for.....it was very inexpensive and it is very light styrofoam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tips over all the time, hard to put wig on it cause it keeps moving.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I can figure out a way to stablize it.  Dosen&#x27;t really stand too well with wig on it...........BUT in all fairness, the wig I bought is a long wig so maybe it is too heavy for this head.</li>
    <li> Received this wig head, I didn&#x27;t realize that head would be tilted and may be a problem when you are trying to style wiglet.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and good size. Pleased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a styro head.  What can I say? Use it to hold a few of my hats.  Lightweight.  Arrived in great condition; packaged in bubble wrap.  Stands erect without a slant.  Holds about 4 of my caps/hats.</li>
    <li> Great head. A bit light. Had a base made for it to be more stable.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for and wanted :) my dog loved it also she ate it .... Lol so will be buying another soon</li>
    <li> Wig head, works like it should.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these styrofoam heads for a wig I recently purchased. I was honestly more worried about it being damaged during the shipping process more than anything. However, I received it in perfect condition. I could have just been paranoid about ordering the head online but I was very happy with it when it arrived. I was also worried that it might be kind of small but I am very pleased with the size.</li>
    <li> Great service. It came right away. I wish the head was a little bigger. I didn&#x27;t realize my head is on the bigger side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is used to hold my sun hat. Looks great.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about having this for my wigs I had bought.I had bought the wigs due the the Anime Festival in July.When I had bought them I was expecting a really nice head like all the other reviews had said.My &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; was supposed to come in 3 weeks but it came in 6 days.I was really excited But sadly when I had opened up the package the heads were smashed in!I had bought 2 heads which cost me $10.07.They were both peices of crap!If you are reading this buy something else noth worth 1 star I wish I can put a zero!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay really haven&#x27;t much to say about it. I  may need to buy a couple more will probably buy this same model</li>
    <li> Wig head work well for but can be unstable at times. I had it on a dresser and could not bump the dresser without the head falling over. However, you can&#x27;t expect much for the price and the product (foam).</li>
    <li> This works fine for holding a hat when I&#x27;m not wearing it.  I also use it to take photos of scarves and hats I&#x27;ve made for my Etsy shop and blog.  I picked this one over others because the face looks serene.</li>
    <li> Worked great, very studryd</li>
    <li> Working out just fine.</li>
    <li> Fine wig head. Does the job we need it to, holding up a wig.</li>
    <li> Its Styrofoam so yeah it indents easily. Its hard to find somewhere to sit it when styling, especially for longer wigs but its cheap and the shipping is really fast. I like it. I got more than what I payed for.</li>
    <li> perfect for my wig; dried quickly and held the shape nicely...</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect size for crocheted hat displays. Came a week sooner than quoted. VErY pleased! Would definately use seller again :-) per</li>
    <li> A little light weight if you have a heavier wig.</li>
    <li> Decent for making wigs. Nice and cheap and simple.</li>
    <li> I was okay, although it looked like it was dropped before shipping. Regardless still able to use it without a problem.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> love my styrofoam wig head.. i named mine &#x27;Foamy&#x27; lol</li>
    <li> Works perfect to hold the wig I just purchased, awesome! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> As expected. Does the job.</li>
    <li> My wig knocks it over...But it works well as long as I have it supprted.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Delivered fast</li>
    <li> They are what they look like they should.  I wish they had a grip to keep them in place.... I had to tape it down... but that;s my fault I should have thought about that.</li>
    <li> Cheap and exactly what we needed. Thank you.</li>
