      <li>Nice smell and sulfate free.  </li>
      <li>Love them all.</li>
      <li>In fact, I think it made my hair more greasy because with Pureology I could get away with every 2-3 days washing it, and with this I had to wash every day.</li>
      <li>AND FEELS HEALTHY</li>
      <li>The shampoo is okay.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>but I love this one.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS SHAMPOO</li>
      <li>Nice product and do not need much to clean well.</li>
      <li>This is pretty good shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I was really hoping to love this shampoo and after reading all the great reviews, I was excited to try it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, how my hair seems to stay clean longer, and the way my hair behaves after using it.</li>
      <li>I love everthing about this shampoo, from the cool twist cap to the way it makes my hair feel and smell.</li>
      <li>Provides volume and smells fantastic..</li>
      <li>and I also like its light scent.  </li>
      <li>Like the old adage says, if it sounds too good to be true, IT IS.</li>
      <li>This is the best shampoo for my very fine, thin hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to buy eco and animal friendly beauty products and this fits in that category.</li>
      <li>This is not to say all their products suck, I do use their heat protectant on my tips before I blow dry my hair and that stuff is great.</li>
      <li>You got the important part right; the product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>People have said my hair looks so full.  </li>
      <li>quick delivery.</li>
      <li>It appears to me that the conditioner that is used is much more important to the way my hair looks even if used with a different shampoo and the conditioner lasts a lot longer.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunate I can&#x27;t give a good review on this product, I was hoping it would be good</li>
      <li>It may be a different smell that results with each persons chemical balance, kind of like perfume.</li>
      <li>highly recommend if you have fine hair..</li>
      <li>It takes very little to get a great lather and works gret.</li>
      <li>Nice shampoo, pleasant scent, generous size and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Items were as expected, but better prices than I have experienced at other stores.</li>
      <li>So, thanks for that!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received numerous (daily)compliments on the shine and healthy appearance of my hair.</li>
      <li>but this is the first time I purchased from the seller.  </li>
      <li>Not as moisturizing as my hair needs in this dry climate, but it&#x27;s definitely volumizing and smells great.</li>
      <li>Phew, this stuff really has a strong masculine scent.  </li>
      <li>My first indication was how much it suds up.  </li>
      <li>It gets oily very quickly and falls flat about 5 hours after washing it.</li>
      <li>I was probably misguided in purchasing this product - it seems to really strip my hair of moisture</li>
      <li>I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Tammi</li>
      <li>Plus, it really works.</li>
      <li>Finally, that there&#x27;s no animal testing is important to me too.</li>
      <li>tHANKS aMAZON FOR very expeditious delivery.</li>
      <li>I used this shampoo for months and month and really like it.  </li>
      <li>It has no PCBs and is very conducive to hair.</li>
      <li>and they really work like a charm.  </li>
      <li>In fact, it may very well work for a lot of people.</li>
      <li>Other shampoos are better for her hair.  </li>
      <li>every bottle to get it clean enough to put on the shelf.</li>
      <li>I will continue to reorder as long as it is available</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m particular about scents</li>
      <li>B005BA5PZ4 Alterna BAMBOO UV Color Protection Vibrant Color Shampoo]</li>
      <li>I have highlighted hair and this product is mild enough to use.</li>
      <li>Recommend highly.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product to switch it up, I usually use Pureology Pure Volume shampoo but wanted to make sure my hair wasn&#x27;t getting used to it.</li>
      <li>You only need small abount to have a good result.</li>
      <li>Long story short, this product didn&#x27;t help my hair stay any cleaner or add more volume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong so if your hair is liek mine, only use 1-2 spritz into your hand and spread through tips only.</li>
      <li>I needed additional product to tame flyaways, which isn&#x27;t the case with every shampoo/conditioner combo I&#x27;ve tried, but I love this brand.</li>
      <li>I live in a rainly area and need something with holding power.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for my thick hair, but not so much that I would buy again.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> To be used as stocking stuffers.  Items were as expected, but better prices than I have experienced at other stores.</li>
    <li> I love everthing about this shampoo, from the cool twist cap to the way it makes my hair feel and smell.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SHAMPOO MAKES MY HAIR HAVE THE VOLUME AND SHINE. MY HAIR LOOKS AND FEELS HEALTHY I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR THE VOLUME ALONE</li>
    <li> Adds amazing volume, smells great!  I will continue to reorder as long as it is available&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend if you have fine hair..</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for my very fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> Used it for years.  Nice product and do not need much to clean well.</li>
    <li> I love that Alterna perfected the volumizing shampoo. I have short-medium length fine hair and am in my late 30s. Once the line launched, I switched immediately to the Bamboo - this after years of trying a number of other volumizers. I&#x27;ve received numerous (daily)compliments on the shine and healthy appearance of my hair. Agree, the smell is a little off, but it doesn&#x27;t linger on me as a mens fragrance, it leaves my hair with a clean smell throughout the day. I do follow up with the conditioner. It may be a different smell that results with each persons chemical balance, kind of like perfume. Anyway, I have found a great product and will continue to use Bamboo.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever!  Good service.</li>
    <li> very good it gives volume to your hair</li>
    <li> Phew, this stuff really has a strong masculine scent.  The [[ASIN:B005BA5PZ4 Alterna BAMBOO UV Color Protection Vibrant Color Shampoo]] products are a little better, smelling like black licorice (!) and they really work like a charm.  Considering their Caviar line smells so good, I was really disappointed by this one, though, and ended up getting a refund.</li>
    <li> It is a shampoo that does add volume. However, it takes several squirts to get it to lather.It is unscented and does not irritate my scalp. I  have color treared hair and it does not take the color out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ve been trying to buy eco and animal friendly beauty products and this fits in that category. It&#x27;s not tested on the eyes of bunnies like many products are. Plus, it really works. My hair is on the thinner side and it makes it feel thicker and stronger. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for the past year and it&#x27;s totally made a difference. I will keep using this.</li>
    <li> Manly scent. Excellent shampoo, though.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used this shampoo and conditioner on me at the salon.  I&#x27;m particular about scents but I love this one. Nice shine, good volume. I craved this scent so much that I bought this shampoo a few days later.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for months and month and really like it.  Add body to my very limp hair.  :-)</li>
    <li> I was probably misguided in purchasing this product - it seems to really strip my hair of moisture and I cannot use it for more than a day or two in a row.&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it does smell great. Just wish it was kinder to the hair while still prodviding volume.</li>
    <li> Great product of a great brand. A bit pricey, and there&#x27;s not much of it in a somehow smallish bottle, but it is worth every dollar.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good shampoo.  I use this along with Wen Bamboo shampoo as the conditioner.  The Alterna Cavier is good shampoo too.</li>
    <li> Have thin hair and this makes it fluffy.  It stays for several days.  Use it with the volumizing mist.  People have said my hair looks so full.  Feels like it did when I was younger</li>
    <li> Nice smell and sulfate free.  Cleans and gives hair a terrific smell for days.  The salon I go to for blowouts uses Bamboo products.  Love them all.</li>
    <li> #1. tHANKS aMAZON FOR very expeditious delivery. It was delivered within few days of ordering it.&lt;br /&gt;#2. The shampoo is amazing. It has no PCBs and is very conducive to hair. Plus the smell is pleasant. Both I and my husband like it. Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> love Alterna Volume products</li>
    <li> The shampoo is okay.  The &amp;#34;matching&amp;#34; cream rinse made my daughters hair greasy within a day. Other shampoos are better for her hair.  It&#x27;s okay for my thick hair, but not so much that I would buy again.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> this is the best stuff I can find to keep my 60yr old hair looking good...&lt;br /&gt;most guys my age don&#x27;t have any hair-so I use this product to keep mine&lt;br /&gt;healthy.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the scent. Smells like a man&#x27;s cologne although you can&#x27;t smell it once your hair is dry. Good sudsing.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and was looking for something that could add volume and I found it. I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Tammi</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair and had used the Bamboo Shampoo and Conditioner in the past.  It appears to me that the conditioner that is used is much more important to the way my hair looks even if used with a different shampoo and the conditioner lasts a lot longer.  I had run out of the conditioner and it suddenly dawned on me that my hair was looking a lot flatter and less manageable.  I ordered the shampoo and conditioner and with the first time using my hair was back to looking healthier and appearing fuller.  I&#x27;m trying a couple of their other products this time as well but haven&#x27;t used them enough to know if they are working well.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my thin hair much thicker and builds volume, and I used it with the Bamboo volume spray, they both work  together well. A little goes  a long way, so the price is worth it. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> quick delivery. love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Really makes my hair look great!</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine shoulder length hair.  This shampoos scent is such a turn off!  It does create volume but, that lasted for only a few hours.  I live in a rainly area and need something with holding power.  I&#x27;m going to try the Caviar line.</li>
    <li> Provides volume and smells fantastic..</li>
    <li> Good shampoo for all types of hair.  We purchased it for our daughter who has a glutton sensitivity.  It is gluton-free.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is what I always use but this is the first time I purchased from the seller.  In the past, the seller taped the bottles all the way around the cap which prevented the bottles from &#x27;weeping&#x27; during shipping.  Without the tape, every bottle had a coating of the shampoo liquid on it.  There wasn&#x27;t a noticeable amount missing from the bottle but I had to rinse (lather and repeat) every bottle to get it clean enough to put on the shelf.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for about six months.  It takes very little to get a great lather and works gret. It s a good product for every day use. Does not weigh your hair down. Not overly fragrant.</li>
    <li> Let me say I have been using this shampoo for over a year and I love it.  I bought it off of Amazon to save a couple of dollars...what a mistake.  Whatever they are selling in this bottle...is not Alterna&#x27;s Bamboo Abundant shampoo.  I bought another bottle from Ulta where I usually buy it and compared the two.  It was totally different. My first indication was how much it suds up.  Go to a beauty supply and buy this...not Amazon!  The same is with the conditioner!</li>
    <li> Not as moisturizing as my hair needs in this dry climate, but it&#x27;s definitely volumizing and smells great. I needed additional product to tame flyaways, which isn&#x27;t the case with every shampoo/conditioner combo I&#x27;ve tried, but I love this brand.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to switch it up, I usually use Pureology Pure Volume shampoo but wanted to make sure my hair wasn&#x27;t getting used to it. I was really hoping to love this shampoo and after reading all the great reviews, I was excited to try it. The product isnt horrible. In fact, it may very well work for a lot of people. A little about my hair: I have a lot of fine hair. It gets oily very quickly and falls flat about 5 hours after washing it. I blow dry AT LEAST my roots after every wash and more often than not, use a hair straightener. I also get highlights about two times a year. Long story short, this product didn&#x27;t help my hair stay any cleaner or add more volume. In fact, I think it made my hair more greasy because with Pureology I could get away with every 2-3 days washing it, and with this I had to wash every day. This is not to say all their products suck, I do use their heat protectant on my tips before I blow dry my hair and that stuff is great. It&#x27;s strong so if your hair is liek mine, only use 1-2 spritz into your hand and spread through tips only. Unfortunate I can&#x27;t give a good review on this product, I was hoping it would be good but....thats the risk we ladies take for beauty, AM I RIGHT?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**If this product didn&#x27;t work for you either for similar reasons, give Pureology Pure Volume a try. They sell it on here for a close-enough price and its great.</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing to improve the volume of my thin, crappy hair.  I think I&#x27;m resigned to using Rogaine.  It cleaned my hair all right but left it incredibly dry, unmanageable and did nothing to improve its overall experience.  I&#x27;ve learned my lesson with Alterna Bamboo products:  they do not work, are overly expensive and I will never, ever purchase them nor recommend them to ANYONE.  Like the old adage says, if it sounds too good to be true, IT IS.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It gives great volume. If I don&#x27;t use it I can tell a big difference.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Does not leave a residue on my hair and lovely sent.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. The smell is great and it adds volume to my hair. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> As advertised-great product.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo, pleasant scent, generous size and a little goes a long way. I have highlighted hair and this product is mild enough to use.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo for fine highlighted hair. Smells fresh and green but not offensively so. Leaves tons of body and shine.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and I&#x27;ve tried many!  But, this is the second bottle I&#x27;ve been unable to open. In addition, the bottle itself is so dense that I find it tough to squeeze. Alterna, if you read these reviews, lose the bottle and redesign it. I&#x27;m not THAT weak, but I do really find this bottle problematic. You got the important part right; the product is fantastic. I love the smell, how my hair seems to stay clean longer, and the way my hair behaves after using it. Finally, that there&#x27;s no animal testing is important to me too. So, thanks for that!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is made from a known, excellent company with a reputation for quality.  I like the way my hair feels when I use this product and I also like its light scent.  You only need small abount to have a good result.</li>
    <li> Great seller. Product was as described.</li>
    <li> Definitely a favorite shampoo.  Smells great and seems to plump the hair strands up.  My hair has more volume afterwards, as promised.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Great on dyed hair, does not make it brassy.</li>
