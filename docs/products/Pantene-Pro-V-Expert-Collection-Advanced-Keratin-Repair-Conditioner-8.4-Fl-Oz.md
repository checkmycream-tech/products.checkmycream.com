      <li>So it&#x27;s already in pretty good shape.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many, many inexpensive and salon quality shampoos, conditioners and after shampoo products in search of something that would make my hair feel smooth and silky and</li>
      <li>It also seems to dry more quickly, which is great!</li>
      <li>Love love love this conditioner, it moisturizes fabulously thanks to keratin, smells great, and leaves my hair feeling conditioned and soft.</li>
      <li>It detangles even with the shampoo and easy to comb through.</li>
      <li>my hair is fine with a lot of flyaways..</li>
      <li>I bought this product and didn&#x27;t expect a lot from it since I have fine hair and</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product and does what it says but doesn&#x27;t suit me</li>
      <li>I could not believe how manageable and smooth my hair was with just one use of the conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It used to be FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>I say this cautiously as with most new products, it does great at first then...not so much.</li>
      <li>I was excited about trying this conditioner.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m excited to keep using it.</li>
      <li>I have been using for several months and fine my hair to be silky and feel good to the touch and seemingly fewer split ends.  </li>
      <li>With the shampoo this conditioner is awesome, my thick frizzy hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is a win so far -- my hair feels relatively straight and frizz-free given that I haven&#x27;t straightened it or</li>
      <li>This expert collection conditioner is better than the standard Pantene Conditioner that comes in the tube, and it smells nice</li>
      <li>On time, cheaper and more volume (since ordered 3 bottles) than large bottle with pump.</li>
      <li>Love it so much</li>
      <li>My hair is super silky, shiny, manageable and unbroken.</li>
      <li>I love mixing this stuff with my normal conditioner.</li>
      <li>for like the first time in FOREVER!  </li>
      <li>I will be surprised if you use this and don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
      <li>it does make it feel soft &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I no longer need detangler, I don&#x27;t have fly aways, and my hair is soft to the touch long after I wash it.</li>
      <li>While I was in the shower washing my hair with the product my hair didn&#x27;t have the dame clean feeling as it did with my bumble shampoo I did get worried as I have really.</li>
      <li>I need two bottles of the conditioner per month, because I use more conditioner than shampoo (as do most people, I believe), yet the bottle of conditioner is almost half the size of the the sister bottle of shampoo in this line.</li>
      <li>this product delivered right after the first use..</li>
      <li>Ever since Philosophy stopped selling their conditioner &amp;#34;Grace&amp;#34;, I have been searching high and low for an amazing conditioner.</li>
      <li>I first tried the sample pack of Pro-V Keratin Repair.</li>
      <li>After the first use, I can already feel the difference.</li>
      <li>This one really works!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually pretty amazed.</li>
      <li>Really love this, it&#x27;s almost like a deep condition every time.</li>
      <li>I have long very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels manageable and smooth which it rarely does the same day that I wash it.</li>
      <li>, just be more sparing with the amount you use and the bottle will last much longer.</li>
      <li>I then cover my hair with a processing cap and a headband on top to keep in as much heat as possible.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m very particular about what I use on my hair.</li>
      <li>before using this product my hair was a complete mess, totally dry, now, after one week of using it, my hair looks healthier, bright and smooth!</li>
      <li>the price is as gentle as something made with (shudder) sulfates).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use much on my scalp.</li>
      <li>This conditioner &amp;#34;quenched its thirst.&amp;#34; I shampoo my hair really well at the start of my shower then apply the conditioner and comb my hair with a wide-tooth comb to distribute it.</li>
      <li>and I was very liberal with the amount that I used.</li>
      <li>It is very concentrated and feels luxurious.</li>
      <li>Its naturally straight but wavyish in some areas.</li>
      <li>When I put it on in the shower, I could immediately feel the difference in my hair, so I was very hopeful.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Would not order again.</li>
    <li> Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection is sulfate-free which helps avoid fading hair color. Not sticky, incredibly perfect and the price is as gentle as something made with (shudder) sulfates).</li>
    <li> the best conditioner I ever used</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it makes my hair feel and shine! I have used it for a couple of week and I have noticed my hair is healthier.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and didn&#x27;t expect a lot from it since I have fine hair and almost everything I tried didn&#x27;t add volume to my hair. But!!! This one really works! After the first use, I can already feel the difference. I use the hair serum along with the shampoo and conditioner. Love it love it love it!</li>
    <li> my teen daughters and I (40) really like the silky feel this conditioner leaves.  almost as good as the conditioner that comes with the Clairol Naturals 28 day hair dye</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of Pantene shampoos and conditioner and this is by far my favorite product. It is very concentrated and feels luxurious. For best results, squeeze the excess water out of you hair before applying a pea sized amount. I have long but thin hair and a pea sized amount is ample for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference in my hair was enough that my friends even noticed. My hair was shinier and bouncier. I only wish the product were easier to find locally.</li>
    <li> Pantene always has good products. I&#x27;m in my early 30s, and I don&#x27;t dye or heat-treat my hair, so I can&#x27;t tell if this conditioner improves my hair, but it does make it feel soft &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t believe the headline hype until my boss told me this stuff was the real deal -- so i tried it and WOW!  my ratty dyed hair actually felt SOFT!!!!  for like the first time in FOREVER!  It makes my hair silky and smooth. I&#x27;m actually pretty amazed. I thought all shampoo/conditioner was Same Stuff Different Bottle but Expert is definitely NOT the same. I will be surprised if you use this and don&#x27;t love it.  PS. I love the KERATIN one. Can&#x27;t speak for Fade Defy or the other ones. I&#x27;ll try those eventually.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for all hair types, it does not leave a residue. Hair feels and looks shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> The smell is unpleasant. It makes my hair soft,  I used the whole thing but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend&#x27;s hair loves this product! Her hair looks shiny and healthy after using this product.</li>
    <li> Starters I didn&#x27;t buy it from amazon as my mam got it for me . While I was in the shower washing my hair with the product my hair didn&#x27;t have the dame clean feeling as it did with my bumble shampoo I did get worried as I have really. Long thick hair and most products don&#x27;t suit my hair , anyway it felt waxy after shampooing I then applied the conditioner. A good point it doesn&#x27;t leave hardly any tangles in your hair and is really east to brush out It left my hair feeling silky smooth and shinny but not as much volume as it normally has  , the second day (wash hair every other day ) I noticed it lost all the volume and looked greasy which I used dry shampoo. Overall it&#x27;s a great product and does what it says but doesn&#x27;t suit me</li>
    <li> From all the Pantene cleansing hair products , this is the only one that really have helped restoring the health of my dried hair. And a little bit of it goes a long way for both shampoo and conditioner. I hope it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued.</li>
    <li> Love love love this conditioner, it moisturizes fabulously thanks to keratin, smells great, and leaves my hair feeling conditioned and soft. However ... it&#x27;s too small. Why do shampoo companies always seem to make a smaller conditioner than shampoo? I need two bottles of the conditioner per month, because I use more conditioner than shampoo (as do most people, I believe), yet the bottle of conditioner is almost half the size of the the sister bottle of shampoo in this line. I don&#x27;t understand. Keep this in mind when ordering. You may need two bottle of the conditioner to accompany one bottle of shampoo in this line, due to its smaller size.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and so does my hair.  Makes it shiny  and soft.</li>
    <li> I saw this as a suggested conditioner for fine/thin hair on Paula Begoun&#x27;s website. Ordered it and have already ordered more. It is incredibly thick and creamy and really coats your hair, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I don&#x27;t use much on my scalp. Really love this, it&#x27;s almost like a deep condition every time.</li>
    <li> I have always used and liked pantene products... However upon reading some previous reviews, I was hesitant to order this. But its good I did... this product delivered right after the first use.. my hair is fine with a lot of flyaways.. this conditioner helped smoothen those flyaways and gave my hair a silky glossy look that lasted for at least 3-4 days... less breakage was noticeable ... will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> This stuff works amazing on  my previously damaged curly hair! Love it so much</li>
    <li> It works great.  The fewest hairs I have ever yanked out of my head while conditioning-period.  I had to find a new conditioner after Nexxus discontinued my 20 plus year choice and offered something that didn&#x27;t work at all in it&#x27;s place.  Long hair, 20 mile bike rides-no helmet, head hanging out car window, convertible driving--although I sold the convertible before I purchased this conditioner--point is this stuff really gets out the tangles.</li>
    <li> I straight-perm my hair each year and also do it for my sisters. The straight-perm can really dry out your hair and leave it looking slightly unhealthy. This conditioner &amp;#34;quenched its thirst.&amp;#34; I shampoo my hair really well at the start of my shower then apply the conditioner and comb my hair with a wide-tooth comb to distribute it. I then cover my hair with a processing cap and a headband on top to keep in as much heat as possible. I let it sit in my hair like this while I finish the rest of my shower then rinse it out. Brings your hair back to life. I think everyone could definitely benefit from this. It is a bit expensive for the amount you get but most people overdo it on conditioner anyway, just be more sparing with the amount you use and the bottle will last much longer. It smells really nice too!</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner - leaves my hair strong and silky - but not weighed down</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time last night - I like it! My hair feels manageable and smooth which it rarely does the same day that I wash it. Usually no matter how silky a conditioner makes my hair feel in the shower, my hair starts to frizz as it dries (I have coarse, thick Indian hair). This conditioner is a win so far -- my hair feels relatively straight and frizz-free given that I haven&#x27;t straightened it or blow-dried it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to keep using it. Maybe I&#x27;ve finally found \\&quot;the one\\&quot;!!!</li>
    <li> This expert collection conditioner is better than the standard Pantene Conditioner that comes in the tube, and it smells nice but it&#x27;s not as good as the old formula deep conditioner that came in the tube that was available a few years back. I don&#x27;t know what happened but Patene keeps changing the packaging and formulas on the deep conditioner. It used to be FANTASTIC. I have long hair and it&#x27;s the secret to keeping it beautiful; it was always better than the expensive brands I used but the change in formulas is making it really hard for me to find one like the old one.</li>
    <li> My hair is smoother and I don&#x27;t notice any split ends.</li>
    <li> Ever since Philosophy stopped selling their conditioner &amp;#34;Grace&amp;#34;, I have been searching high and low for an amazing conditioner. I have found it in the Pantene Pro-V conditioner. Leaves my hair soft and shiny. I love my hair and I want to make sure it looks and feels healthy.  I highly recommend this conditioner to whomever wants the same for their hair.</li>
    <li> Love love love this! I always go back to this. I always try something else but this always makes my hair soft and shiny. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I love mixing this stuff with my normal conditioner. A great boost! Makes my hair silky smooth!</li>
    <li> I have used MANY products over the course of the last several years. I have very long hair, almost three feet down my back. I chemically lighten my hair at a salon, and I have thyroid issues that cause my hair to periodically fall out and break off. So I&#x27;m very particular about what I use on my hair. After having recently purchased some Dove Shampoo and Conditioner that literally fried my hair I was looking for something that would repair it without causing more damage. I have used many Pantene products in the past with much success so when I saw this product that I hadn&#x27;t tried before in the local drug store I thought, why not try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO glad that I grabbed this product!! Not only did it undo the drying and breaking that the Dove products caused it truly made my hair shiny and more manageable in just a matter of several uses. I no longer need detangler, I don&#x27;t have fly aways, and my hair is soft to the touch long after I wash it. This is a great product that I will continue to use and I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was excited about trying this conditioner. I have not had very much luck with Pantene in the past but I guess I fell for the sleek packaging. Anyway, some background on my hair. I&#x27;m 23 years old, never color, blow dry or heat style my hair. So it&#x27;s already in pretty good shape. Its naturally straight but wavyish in some areas. It lacks shine and smoothness, though. And this product promised shine, so that&#x27;s why I bought it.  I&#x27;ve used this a few times now and it has not improved the condition of my hair at all. In fact, it&#x27;s made the ends of my hair feel like straw! This never happens with any other conditioner so I know it&#x27;s this one. Overall for the high price I was not impressed with this product at all and I don&#x27;t believe it delivered on its claims. I&#x27;ll be returning it and I should&#x27;ve just stayed away due to the fact that Pantene never has worked well for my hair in the past or even now.</li>
    <li> With the shampoo this conditioner is awesome, my thick frizzy hair is smooth and shiny. It also seems to dry more quickly, which is great!</li>
    <li> this conditioner is fantastic, leaves your hair silky and smooth smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this conditioner with my normal shampoo yesterday.  When I put it on in the shower, I could immediately feel the difference in my hair, so I was very hopeful.  I have tried many, many, many inexpensive and salon quality shampoos, conditioners and after shampoo products in search of something that would make my hair feel smooth and silky and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very curly in the back, straight near the front and has a lot of volume, so I am constantly looking for something to help my hair lay down on my head and not look so poofy.  I also color and highlight my hair and use a flat iron daily.  I could not believe how manageable and smooth my hair was with just one use of the conditioner.  I went back and bought the whole line and can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> Only used about a week now and like it. I say this cautiously as with most new products, it does great at first then...not so much. Will update in about a month.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites.  Leaves course, thick, curly hair silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> i purchased the small travel size thinking I was ordering the 8.4 oz size.  My error...they both look the same on the web.  I like the product with some reservations.  Do not expect dramatic improvement overnight, actually i would say take the advertising hyp with a grain of salt.  I would also advise use as little as possible.I have long very fine hair.  I find that i can wash my hair less and it looks clean longer when i use less conditioner.  I would also suggest occasionally using a different conditioner.  I have been using for several months and fine my hair to be silky and feel good to the touch and seemingly fewer split ends.  I am happy.</li>
    <li> At first,  I was considering buying Pantene&#x27;s Beautiful Lengths but I am so glad I bought this instead.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice to be truly happy, with a hair product because it doesn&#x27;t happen that often. Before this product my hair was unbearable it was breaking constantly and it was knotting. It didn&#x27;t feel nice either.&lt;br /&gt;Well not anymore, now my hair is &amp;#34;touchably soft&amp;#34; and I love to run my hands through my hair. And my hair is breaking a whole lot less which probably has a lot to do with the l-histidine that is in this conditioner. This amino acid causes aging hair to thicken which leads to less breakage.</li>
    <li> This is a nice conditioner. But I love the Pantene Age Defy conditioner better.</li>
    <li> My hair always get very dry and frizzy every time it is treated - color, perm etc. I&#x27;ve tried lots of conditioners to combat dryness and none has worked as well as this. Highly recommended and though it is not a big tube, it lasted three weeks for me with daily use and I was very liberal with the amount that I used. I also switched to a shampoo for volume as without it, my hair became quite flat after using this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I first tried the sample pack of Pro-V Keratin Repair. I immediately felt the difference in my hair.  I have been having a hard time finding the conditioners available at the normal stores, so I had to resort to Amazon to purchase this. It makes my hair feel healthy.</li>
    <li> After using this entire bottle I saw absolutely no difference in my hair, I think it actually made it drier. I would not buy this product again, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I saw this product in stores and I just had to try it...after the first use my hair felt awful! My splits ends are getting worse because my hair is now dry and brittle. Save your money!!</li>
    <li> before using this product my hair was a complete mess, totally dry, now, after one week of using it, my hair looks healthier, bright and smooth! totally love it!!!</li>
    <li> The only thing that I can say about this product is WOW! I&#x27;ve tried many keratin shampoos and conditioners and none have done anything close as to repairing my hair as Pantene&#x27;s Expert Keratin Repair. I wish this came in a liter. My hair is super silky, shiny, manageable and unbroken.It detangles even with the shampoo and easy to comb through. My hair is smooth even after I blow dry and not fried or frizzy. I can go 3 days without washing and it still looks great! No need for dry shampoo. I have told all my coworkers about this line and will be giving as gifts. I hope Pantene continues to make more products like this. How great it would be if they made a children&#x27;s line.</li>
    <li> love the product. Came as expected</li>
    <li> On time, cheaper and more volume (since ordered 3 bottles) than large bottle with pump.</li>
    <li> really pleased with this product, noticed an improvement in my hair quality and softness with only a few uses. use it about once a week and am very happy with how my hair has been.  scent is fabulous! shipped quickly and good packaging, great price- no complaints. would buy again!</li>
    <li> Good conditioner - rinsed clean from hair and without residue.  Left lots of shine after blow drying hair, hair was really soft.</li>
    <li> Been using Pantene products for a while now. Leaves my hair feeling soft and silky. Good conditioner product.</li>
