      <li>This form arrived in perfect condition, although it was just wrapped in a plastic bag.</li>
      <li>I received the product in perfect condition!</li>
      <li>Great price, too.</li>
      <li>Good still did use it</li>
      <li>Makes the hats look good.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I love this head!</li>
      <li>It would have been nice if it had come with the head to hold my hair.</li>
      <li>I use it to model chemo caps of my own design and others.</li>
      <li>My new wig that I bought at Amazon fits just perfect.</li>
      <li>The hats look much better on her than they did on my computer speaker.</li>
      <li>pleased with purchase.  </li>
      <li>I love this mannequin head.</li>
      <li>This one is also very sturdy and has a charming face.</li>
      <li>Beautiful head used to train future neurofeedback practitioners to accurately locate 10-20 training sites on the head.</li>
      <li>Otherwise I have not used it for wigs or makeup, but the smooth texture should make doing makeup easy, as well as removal.</li>
      <li>Very important to have a good picture for the design patterns, so the head must be actually head-sized.</li>
      <li>Unlike another head I purchased, it is FULL SIZE.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better than similar products that cost more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using the Heads to teach First Aid.</li>
      <li>I wish that the ears were a little more pronounced to hold glasses on them.</li>
      <li>This head took over 3 weeks to arrive, possibly because it was shipped direct from Hunan, China, but it was well worth the wait.</li>
      <li>It will work for what I need it for, but was quite surprised that shipping notice was from 11/2 to 12/2.  </li>
      <li>Just as expected and much nicer than the foam ones!</li>

    <li> Took a while to arrive from notification or shipment and had a mushed nose.  It will work for what I need it for, but was quite surprised that shipping notice was from 11/2 to 12/2.  From 11/2 it took about 2 weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> I love this mannequin head. It is string and stable. My new wig that I bought at Amazon fits just perfect. This will be a repeat order for me.</li>
    <li> For my intended purpose, of taking photographs of hats, scarves, glasses, headbands it works. I wish that the ears were a little more pronounced to hold glasses on them. Otherwise I have not used it for wigs or makeup, but the smooth texture should make doing makeup easy, as well as removal.</li>
    <li> I have something to model my crocheted chemo caps and hats now.&lt;br /&gt;Its wonderful and her name is Hattie.</li>
    <li> Just as expected and much nicer than the foam ones!</li>
    <li> head is a little small and is short</li>
    <li> I clearly see a black piece on this head. It would have been nice if it had come with the head to hold my hair. I purchased 2 of them It&#x27;s not worth the money...unless you are showcasing something...a hat..hair etc. I&#x27;m going back to my previous purchases....styrofoam. At least, I get what I pay for.</li>
    <li> Holds my wigs in place while I stlye them.</li>
    <li> I received the product in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> I love this head! I read all the reviews from Styrofoam heads and saw that they arrived with smashed-in noses. This form arrived in perfect condition, although it was just wrapped in a plastic bag. I have purchased a wig for it. I gave her a name and she models all of the hats that I knit. The hats look much better on her than they did on my computer speaker.</li>
    <li> I got it for my girlfriend and she loves it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using the Heads to teach First Aid. My students are practicing how to apply bandages to head and eye injuries.</li>
    <li> Came all the way from China, took almost 3 weeks, packaged in only a plastic bag.  I ordered 2:  one was chipped at the base and missing a part inside ( wasn&#x27;t important though), the second was chipped at the base and had a dent in the nose!  I would have returned it but the product still served its purpose: holding a wig while standing up.  Also there was no receipt that came with it.</li>
    <li> Good still did use it</li>
    <li> pleased with purchase.  Just as expected.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase. Great price, too.</li>
