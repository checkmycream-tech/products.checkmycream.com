      <li>I like that much better.</li>
      <li>They are cute but they are small😃</li>
      <li>; even thought it may still be able to be used.</li>
      <li>Now with these new rings I&#x27;m happy I stuck with it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re top grade and fit well and are comfortable!</li>
      <li>I love them, they&#x27;re flexible and comfortable.</li>
      <li>I think ima buy them they seem cool!</li>
      <li>Balls broke and came unscrewed easily</li>
      <li>I love the flexible tongue rings and this was such a great price for all these that u get.</li>
      <li>Love them there light weight, were received pretty fast and loved the colors.</li>
      <li>cheap plastic quality however</li>
      <li>I do recommend these if ur looking for a light weight tongue ring</li>
      <li>They are cheaply made and will prob break at sum point</li>
      <li>But great buy, the balls are smaller just for a reference</li>
      <li>But with these light weight rings and barbells, no problems.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great though I definitely have 0 complaints.</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>Fore the price, totally worth it!</li>
      <li>They are super light</li>
      <li>Have had no problems with them so far and liked how cheap they were.</li>
      <li>Smaller bars and balls, but it was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
      <li>I received these quickly.</li>
      <li>Lucky for me it was the red/orange one</li>
      <li>Just be aware of the threading!</li>
      <li>exactly as described!</li>
      <li>Every bit worth the price.</li>
      <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve had the first one in over a week and</li>
      <li>The only problem with them is that the balls don&#x27;t screw on all the way, and the threading irritated the top and bottom of my piercing.</li>
      <li>looks exactly like photograph.</li>
      <li>Received exactly what was described.</li>
      <li>I almost took it out after I was first pierced.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>I received a bunch of different colors, and I&#x27;m really excited!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t rub on my gums, not in the way as much.</li>
      <li>They came fast.</li>
      <li>Getting use to my tongue ring again these really helped.</li>
      <li>I wasnt able to use two of them but Other than that I like them</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t want to deal with high security metal detectors</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for... 8 out of 10 of the barbells were fine, two had a rough finish.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with this product; I received all 10 with no damages or missing pieces.</li>
      <li>Which is good and not good in some cases for some people who can just pull it through a hole!</li>
      <li>I had to edit this review and lower the stars because one of the barbells had a seem on it (aka, a sharp edge which would surely either cause a lot of irritation or actually cut your tongue).&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>The ball on top is a little smaller than I am used to</li>
      <li>However, I still really like the way they look, so I&#x27;ll definitely be using them for shorter periods of time!</li>
      <li>These are the first tongue rings I got after my initial larger metal tongue ring.</li>
      <li>It took them awhile to get to, but they were exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>Total Waste, atleast they were cheap</li>
      <li>I HATE long tongue rings so these being short are PERFECT for me!!!</li>
      <li>I actually ordered from 4 other companies within the same amazon transaction and this package actually arrived first.</li>
      <li>They came in the mail fast and came in a little baggie.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They are the same colors.</li>
    <li> good size and flexible. people r just too picky sometimes! they r great</li>
    <li> Love them there light weight, were received pretty fast and loved the colors. Have had no problems with them so far and liked how cheap they were. Love them !!</li>
    <li> Received exactly what was described. All in great condition.</li>
    <li> I had to edit this review and lower the stars because one of the barbells had a seem on it (aka, a sharp edge which would surely either cause a lot of irritation or actually cut your tongue).&lt;br /&gt;In the time since I purchased these I have broken one ball, which I was expecting anyways because they&#x27;re acrylic... and well... acrylic on a tongue ring eventually gets bit down on and breaks (but in turn this saves your teeth from damage, which is why I&#x27;ve always used acrylic balls on my tongue rings).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, they are really light, which is nice. For the price having one that&#x27;s unusable and a couple that break, it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
    <li> This was a great price for these, and they look really great when they&#x27;re in! The only problem with them is that the balls don&#x27;t screw on all the way, and the threading irritated the top and bottom of my piercing. However, I still really like the way they look, so I&#x27;ll definitely be using them for shorter periods of time! Overall, great price, great shipping, good product. Just be aware of the threading!</li>
    <li> These are nice they hurt a little bit but sanding the sides down fixed the problem</li>
    <li> I thought these were tongue rings, but they are NOT! These are nipple rings, NOT tongue rings! Total Waste, atleast they were cheap</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Can&#x27;t beat the price for 10 of em.!</li>
    <li> They even run a shorter bar so it&#x27;s nice to have them. I liked how cheap they were and they stay tight always</li>
    <li> I keep these tucked away in my purse just in case something ever happens to the current one I have in. I prefer the metal ones as compared to these, but these are still pretty awesome</li>
    <li> I received my 10 pack of flexible colored barbells in no time at all. I actually ordered from 4 other companies within the same amazon transaction and this package actually arrived first. I am pleased with this product; I received all 10 with no damages or missing pieces. However, one of my acrylic bars were slightly bent even though it is hardly noticeable. Lucky for me it was the red/orange one and I personally don&#x27;t care for red at all so I wasn&#x27;t planning on using that one anyway; even thought it may still be able to be used. I would order from SQdeal again bc their prices and delivery time were both amazing. I would also recommend these acrylic barbells to anyone wanting to spend wisely...especially since acrylic bars are not recommended for extended use beyond a few hours a day (for the tongue I have been told by a few piercing artist anyway; other areas I&#x27;m not sure about). You will defiantly come out on top buying from the SQdeal team.</li>
    <li> Just as described. 10 rings and 10 diff colors. Quik shipping. I think I paid under $5 total. Great price. These are shorter then the steal one I had in. I like that much better. Doesn&#x27;t get in way when eating or talking ect. Just fits nice. I almost took it out after I was first pierced. Now with these new rings I&#x27;m happy I stuck with it. They are cheaply made and will prob break at sum point but I&#x27;ve had the first one in over a week and so far so good. I will order again. Thank you !</li>
    <li> Only one of each color so buy two packs if you need a pair. Great vslue</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast. Colors are great. The balls are smaller than standard tongue rings and I actually like that a lot. Not too flexible but so much better on the mouth than metal.</li>
    <li> Good color assortment. Purchased to replace my titanium one. It was rubbing on my gums on the back of my lower front teeth. These are shorter, flexible and don&#x27;t rub.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for... 8 out of 10 of the barbells were fine, two had a rough finish. Fore the price, totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I just got these in. These are the first tongue rings I got after my initial larger metal tongue ring. I am SO happy. These are very comfortable, and I&#x27;m quite amazed that people would ever give these a bad review. I received a bunch of different colors, and I&#x27;m really excited!</li>
    <li> Been using these for the past 3 months and let me tell you, I haven&#x27;t had my toung cramp up since. I always used steel with acrylic bells. But with these light weight rings and barbells, no problems. SOME poles were a little rough but I just tossed those.</li>
    <li> Very good quality nice verity and I would buy again</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Just wish they sold them as pairs.  I had to buy two packs to get matching colors.</li>
    <li> maybe should read description clearer these are small very thin look cheap but there ok... i was expecting a little thicker and bigger..</li>
    <li> Some of the theeading on there hurts so I wasnt able to use two of them but Other than that I like them</li>
    <li> will never order these again the balls was strip an they dont make them in the size i needed 16 gauge was disapointed</li>
    <li> exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Most of the balls was broke when I get it and rest broke when I put it in..</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t want to deal with high security metal detectors so I needed these as soon as possible I reviewed them in 2 days no damage, they&#x27;re all different a colors but I&#x27;m not wearing them to show off</li>
    <li> I think ima buy them they seem cool!</li>
    <li> Was not ready for the balls to be so small, but it&#x27;s not a bad thing. It&#x27;s very comfortable in your mouth</li>
    <li> I bought it for a friend who needed new tongue rings, only thing with this is that the balls on this are smaller than usual if you use them for your tongue. Which is good and not good in some cases for some people who can just pull it through a hole! lol But great buy, the balls are smaller just for a reference but it will be great for work if you are trying to hide it.</li>
    <li> The shipping was excellent and everything came on time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no duplicates (which kinda sucked for me since I wanted them for my nipples)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re top grade and fit well and are comfortable!</li>
    <li> This was a great deal. I love the flexible tongue rings and this was such a great price for all these that u get. These are good colors too. These are a little smaller than usual but I like them.</li>
    <li> I cleaned and disinfected these and within 12 hours of wearing them the balls had shattered.</li>
    <li> I loved these. They are so comf</li>
    <li> Not happy at all, 6 out of 10 came cracked (no use) will not be buying from this consumer again.</li>
    <li> They came fast. They feel good. I have no problem with them at all. I do recommend these if ur looking for a light weight tongue ring</li>
    <li> Every bit worth the price. Balls are smaller then regular tongue rings but I will continue to buy this same product to use the flexible barbells</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
    <li> They are cute but they are small😃</li>
    <li> It took them awhile to get to, but they were exactly what I expected. I love them, they&#x27;re flexible and comfortable. My only issue is that they&#x27;re alittle short, plus they took about a month to get to me. (But they are coming from China lol). They&#x27;re great though I definitely have 0 complaints.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cute! No matching colors, though. They came in the mail fast and came in a little baggie. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I received these quickly. Various color assortment as described. Smaller bars and balls, but it was a pleasant surprise.  Doesn&#x27;t rub on my gums, not in the way as much. None damaged.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> A little longer than I expected, and the balls are little smaller.  Fast shipping, happy costumer</li>
    <li> They are a great price. The plastic balls could be bigger. Getting use to my tongue ring again these really helped.</li>
    <li> I wish all of the we&#x27;re matching pairs! looks exactly like photograph. cheap plastic quality however</li>
    <li> A fab variety of colors. They were shorter/smaller than I expected but I am growing accustomed to them. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> They look awesome but they are VERY HARD to get the balls on right and all the way on.. On one of them had a extra flap on the bar.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE!!!!!!!!! They are super light so I do not even feel like I have anything in my tongue. The flexibility of these are amazing, I never bite on my tongue ring anymore! Love all the colors you get, and I love the length of them! I HATE long tongue rings so these being short are PERFECT for me!!! The ball on top is a little smaller than I am used to but thats nothing!</li>
    <li> Balls broke and came unscrewed easily</li>
    <li> they were not sets. i expected 2 of every color like the picture and that is not what i received. i was disappointed.</li>
