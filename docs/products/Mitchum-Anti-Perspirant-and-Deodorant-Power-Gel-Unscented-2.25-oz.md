      <li>a good amount stuck up in the cap and more anywhere else it can spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you did a nice job packaging the order.</li>
      <li>I am so embarrassed because I smell my own sweat even after putting this on twice before I leave the house.</li>
      <li>effective.</li>
      <li>Great price quick delivery.</li>
      <li>It keeps me dry and the unscented is perfect because I don&#x27;t know too many deodorants that I think (or girls think) smell great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years - nothing else is as effective.</li>
      <li>so far like the productand delivery time was excellent</li>
      <li>This is by far the best under arm deodorant that I ever used.</li>
      <li>As far as underarm deodorant goes, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Very strong and effective - lasts over 24 hours.</li>
      <li>It is &amp;#34;Unscented&amp;#34; but has a very light and refreshing scent when applied.</li>
      <li>This stuff is scented for sure, but very lightly.</li>
      <li>This unscented deodorant offers me full-day odor protection and also very good anti-perspirant characteristics.  </li>
      <li>Awesome product that is hard to find in a lot of stores for a great price.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>Give me back the old one!!!!!!!!!!!!  </li>
      <li>Obsession is my favorite cologne</li>
      <li>My sons and I love it, and no skin irritation either.</li>
      <li>unscented (which people love and doesn&#x27;t bleach your shirts)  http://www.amazon.com/Arrid-Antiperspirant-Deodorant-Unscented-2-6-Ounce/dp/B001E77NUS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_sc_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1428123575&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1-spell&amp;keywords&#x3D;arrid+xtra+dry</li>
      <li>when you go to apply the product and dispense some of the gel, it tends to want to run off the top.</li>
      <li>but the price is better on this on</li>
      <li>Much better.</li>
      <li>A better dispensing top and non-sticky  gel.  </li>
      <li>Glad i can purchase thru AMZ</li>
      <li>am a fan of products which use oxygen in them, notably cleaning products.  </li>
      <li>i feel there are others that works even better</li>
      <li>Longtime pleased Mitchum customer here.</li>
      <li>This is an outstanding product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great for people who are perfume-sensitive, because unlike some brands, when Mitchum says unscented, it really means unscented.</li>
      <li>Nothing more needs to be said.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe Mitchum has not heard many complaints.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m really glad that Amazon carries it now.</li>
      <li>It works ok but it stains my clothes, the stain washes out.</li>
      <li>It literally works better that anything.</li>
      <li>Yes, I know there is a &amp;#34;for women&amp;#34; version in girly scents, but this works better for me.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>I know I haven&#x27;t been able to use</li>
      <li>and I still love them.</li>
      <li>My favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be wasting any more money on any of the Mitchum line of products.</li>
      <li>Most concerning, it is ineffective.</li>
      <li>Work as good as Mitchum has worked for me over 10 years, its by far the best anti perspirant in the market, no irritation, and really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did not purchase this through amazon, rather I got my dual pack locally.  I came to amazon looking for the original formula but haven&#x27;t found it yet.  I felt I should weigh in on reviewing the new 48hr Oxygen forumla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have noted, this formula is very &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;, if you pull the cap off without being most gentle and careful, the solution will go flying/splashing on anything.  If you advance the product up through the many tiny holes, enough to apply it to yourself, much of the product will slide down the package, onto your hand, counter, sink, or companion pet.  If you actually manage to get the product onto the intended target, presumably your armpit(s), it does not dry quickly like the predecessor Mitchum gel product did, but rather becomes a sticky mess, creating friction between your arms and your torso.  Should you then happen to don a shirt, well I&#x27;ll just feel bad for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of products which use oxygen in them, notably cleaning products.  In this case however, Mitchum has fallen far from the mark of quality.  I intend to contact Mitchum directly about this.</li>
    <li> Came as advertised, just like from the grocery store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum for years.  It seems that the changed the packaging and formula in 2 very disruptive ways:&lt;br /&gt;1) The gel is now extremely liquidy.  So much so, that it leaks out if placed on it&#x27;s side.  So, if you have a medicine cabinet where this will be stored upright, you should be fine.  If, however, you plan on ever putting this in a drawer, or a travel kit, DO NOT BUY IT.  If you ever have to lay on it&#x27;s side IT WILL LEAK and you will probably lose at least 25% to this leakage over time.  What&#x27;s even worse, is that it will make a total mess of your drawer.&lt;br /&gt;2)  Instead of 3 different slots to dispense the gel, there are now about 20 or so tiny holes.  This make you use the gel all the much faster, unless you are extremely careful, and who needs to focus on their deodorant that much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way the deodorant actually works, and will search for the old formula.  If I cannot find it, I will switch brands.</li>
    <li> As far as underarm deodorant goes, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  Nothing fancy, just deodorant.  Fiance likes the smell, which is there but not overpowerings.  Yes, she&#x27;s a weird one.</li>
    <li> This is the right product adn delivery is always very fast. Great price too!</li>
    <li> this deodorant is sometimes hard to find locally, so it was a great find to get it here</li>
    <li> Product is defective.  The gels separates and water leaks.  The formula is very sticky.  Filed claim with Mitchum today.  May be a bat lot or new formula is defective.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff.  There is no \\&quot;White gunky\\&quot; stuff to get all over your clothes.  I wear good perfume, feel naked without perfume after my shower, so I do NOT want that awful scent they put in all the antideoderants and antiperspirants.....The scents they ALL use is AWFULLLL!!!!  I use GOOD stuff and don&#x27;t want the competition from crappy deoderants and antiperspirants.  This is like a gel, no white crap and NO awful smell to compete with ones signature perfume.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want the white mess all over their clothes plus the awful, cheap smell.  BUY IT!!</li>
    <li> Longtime pleased Mitchum customer here. Something is wrong with this gel or bottle, leaks everywhere creating a sticky mess. Have never experienced this problem before. It&#x27;s created a mess in my medicine cabinet &amp; gym bag.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best antiperspirant deodorant in the market. I have been using it for the past 20 years.</li>
    <li> I was a regular user of the Mitchum Power Gel unscented until they took it off the market and replaced it with this. Problem is, it&#x27;s runny. I open the cap in the morning and a ton of it drips from the cap. I know I haven&#x27;t been able to use but about half of each one I&#x27;ve tried and I keep trying them in case I just got a bad batch. Not so. Soon as I can find an unscented replacement gel, I&#x27;ll stop using it. It&#x27;s just too wet and runny for me.</li>
    <li> Man this stick gets over fast. But it is really nice. No crazy annoying smell and yet keeps my armpits from smelling disgusting</li>
    <li> The new applicator bottle is awful, the formula is watery and drops off the applicator loosing big amounts of the product. Impossible to carry on when traveling because it drops off and makes a complete mess</li>
    <li> I thought this would be as good as the old roll on. Wrong! it&#x27;s a messy gooey disaster that does not work. I am so embarrassed because I smell my own sweat even after putting this on twice before I leave the house. I&#x27;ve used it 3 days but it&#x27;s going in the garbage. 48 hour protection? Not even 48 minutes.</li>
    <li> Yes, I know there is a &amp;#34;for women&amp;#34; version in girly scents, but this works better for me. I&#x27;ve used it for many years - nothing else is as effective. This isn&#x27;t sticky and has no smell at all.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Last long and always holds it&#x27;s neutral scent. Especially if you tend to sweat a lot, like I do.</li>
    <li> This has helped me overcome the problem for good. A very good stuff for the price no questions asked. I been using it for a month now, forgot the times i struggled with bad body orders.</li>
    <li> Best kept secret.  Recommend to all that sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> Great price and product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for 25+ years.  It&#x27;s the only type I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t have a nasty scent AND keeps my armpits dry as well as unoffensive! ;)  I&#x27;m a laborer &amp; work outside all day &amp; certainly put it to the test daily.  Great stuff! I love the fact it&#x27;s unscented!</li>
    <li> New formula is TERRIBLE...  Its like water, runs all down the bottle and drips everywhere. This product is soooo bad and the company knows it.  If you call them to complain they will send you all kinds of coupons you can use on other products.  I told the lady I wished for the old formula back !!</li>
    <li> Was great stuff - not sure what happened with this batch but is more like water than gel.  Leaks from container and not effective.  Didn&#x27;t hear anything from manufacturer (their job to fix a problem and make the consumer happy - my job to buy something that works and stop buying something that doesn&#x27;t) so tossed it and trying something new!</li>
    <li> My son was at me to get this for him, he is very happy with the way it goes on and the minimal odour. Good product and will buy again</li>
    <li> Was looking for a deodorant/anti-perspirant that I could take with me in my gym back in the summer that wouldn&#x27;t melt. The other ones out there that are bricks of powder melt in the heat so I needed a gel based one. This works great, keeps me dry and prevents me from stinking. Gotta love that!</li>
    <li> Like many of the reviewers here I too am a long time user of Mitchum Power Gel Unscented, probably something like ~20 years. It has been a staple in the bath cabinet and was always happy with the performance and [lack of] odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked when i started using this last batch from Amazon. The &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34; is a mess. Literally - it is running down my arm. It is also sticky. In short I HATE IT. What frigging marketing MORON came up with this crap? Did they even test it before putting it out there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy the old formula for as long as I can find it and then, I suppose, find some other brand to start supporting if these wizards decide to pull it off the market in favor of the new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this waste of money ZERO stars if possible. Unbelievable. Somebody should lose their job over this &amp;#34;new coke&amp;#34; marketing disaster.</li>
    <li> I had the read the product description and reviews properly.&lt;br /&gt;However I just couldn&#x27;t get used to an unscented gel I guess and returned the product for a full refund. I guess it was just me.</li>
    <li> This is a great scent, but it will stain your clothes!  It also doesn&#x27;t do a great job of keeping you dry.</li>
    <li> It works ok but it stains my clothes, the stain washes out. Won&#x27;t be buying any more of this specific formulation.</li>
    <li> The old formula was the best deodorant on the market as far as I&#x27;m concerned; the motto was truly &#x27;you can skip a day.&#x27; If it ever comes back, I will give it 5 stars and shout its praises from the rooftops. But, I don&#x27;t know if I can ever trust Mitchum again after this. When they changed it in the stores to this new &#x27;oxygen&#x27; version, I smelled trouble; next day, it was I that smelled. I can only imagine, like the razor industry that never makes a blade so good that you won&#x27;t need to replace it, the company decided their formula that&#x27;s been out decades was too good, and they needed to water it down to make us use more and apply more often. The application now looks and feels chalky after drying, which my GF pointed out. It does not even last all day. Let me say that again. IT DOESN&#x27;T EVEN LAST A DAY. It&#x27;s quite clear that Mitchum has decided to cut costs and attempt to raise revenues by selling an inferior product. There should be a mass exodus and mass reviewing of this product so we can officially bury the reputation of what used to be a sterling brand. I myself am deperately trying to find the old version online before it disappears forever, and then I&#x27;ll be looking for another brand entirely, because the new formula,even as the average deodorant goes, really stinks.</li>
    <li> Its the BEST deodorant that I have ever used and have used it for many, many years.  Would not use anything else.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t think of a single positive statement to make about this product. It is not unscented, it has an odor similar to laundry detergent. It is a thin gel that drips before it can be applied. Most concerning, it is ineffective. After using this product I have as much body odor as if I hadn&#x27;t used any deodorant. I won&#x27;t be wasting any more money on any of the Mitchum line of products.</li>
    <li> Probably ordered the wrong Mitchum product</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant my husband and I use.  It&#x27;s hard to find good unscented deodorant and this fits the bill</li>
    <li> It has become harder to find Unscented Deodorants, specially this product. I&#x27;ve been buying it on Amazon.com and have no regrets or a clashing of scent when I use my colognes.</li>
    <li> The antiperspirant is good, they need to make sure there is more of it in each container, you roll it up half to 3/4 to get it to come out.</li>
    <li> Awesome product that is hard to find in a lot of stores for a great price. What more could you ask for? It keeps me dry and the unscented is perfect because I don&#x27;t know too many deodorants that I think (or girls think) smell great.</li>
    <li> My hubs used a deodorant for as long as I have known him....Developed a rash, so I purchased this for him.  Very happy</li>
    <li> This stuff is clear, does not stain clothing, and has no odor.  It really does work.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The product has been use by me for years.  It does not stain clothing and provides very good protection.  I highly recommend the use.</li>
    <li> If you wear cologne or perfume, this is great stuff. It keeps a neutral scent that doesn&#x27;t interfere with what you are wearing.</li>
    <li> This the deodorant I always use that this was a great buy....I highly recommend stocking up on these at this price!!</li>
    <li> It works. Nothing more needs to be said.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased because it advertised itself as non-staining and it not only stains the skin it stains the clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware</li>
    <li> It did not work well for me as Deodarant (smell is awful) and I&#x27;m using it up 3 to 4 times faster than hard (not gel) deodorants.</li>
    <li> I use the one that is in the picture and thats why I ordered this one but when I received in the mail today it was a different version, not the power gel advertised, if I wanted another version I would have ordered that one, now I have 6 qty, of something I dont use...</li>
    <li> I specifically ordered this to stock up on what has always been an excellent product. For some reason the manufacturers have replaced it with a dreadful substitute which is the consistency of water more than gel. Unfortunately the seller sent me the new formulation instead of the one pictured. I can only hope that the makers will come to their senses and give us back the old product. I will be returning this appalling &amp;#34;new Coke&amp;#34; rubbish.</li>
    <li> The new formula with the &#x27;O&#x27; on the label saying it has oxygen is far thinner than the original formula, which I love.  The new stuff will fly off the applicator if you bring it to your arm too fast.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I was shipped a 5-pack of the old-school version.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Must not be glitzy enough for current retailers. I had to resort on-line search but, happy to report that I was able to find/purchase. A six-pack will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Thin and watery.  Messy.  Does its job (antiperspirant/deodorant) but drips and splashes off the applicator. This product is so completely different than the Mitchum Sensitive Skin Gel I used to buy,which has been discontinued. It may be time to find another brand.</li>
    <li> hard to find unscented at stores, this is exactly what we wanted.</li>
    <li> Excellent service, great product</li>
    <li> Mitchum has become a useless product, Sticky - Slimy - No Protection (the old formula worked - I used it for years) Not anymore ! I am currently looking for another product.</li>
    <li> I get mitchum at the store all the time.  I thought I would buy in bulk and save time and effort... for some reason the pack of these are very watery.  Way too watery!</li>
    <li> Worst deodorant ever! I use other Mitchum deodorants and they work well, but this &amp;#34;Oxygen&amp;#34; stuff is terrible! I took a shower, put it on and my pits stunk badly after an hour!</li>
    <li> watery.  leaks and spatters out of the container.  worst of all.. it barely does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do, even in the first few hours!  too inexpensive to bother returning.. heading straight into the trash.</li>
    <li> I had been using this extraordinary unscented gel deodorant for five years, no complain at all,I will recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> The other reviews are right.  This unscented deodorant offers me full-day odor protection and also very good anti-perspirant characteristics.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to the \\&quot;big name\\&quot; brands.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Dinging them a little on the star rating as they have updated the design of the container, resulting in (imho) messier application and increased likelihood of leakage when carrying this in a travel bag/case.</li>
    <li> Mitchum Power Gel keeps me dry and odor free. Moreover, it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve noticed over the years that some deodorants make my underarms itch. Mitchum never does.  I apply it after showering in the morning, and it works all day. The Power Gel goes on smoothly and easily. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. The only downside with the Power Gel is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the solid stick. I&#x27;ve tried both Mitchum products and the solid lasts about twice as long.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best deodorants on the market what else can you say it&#x27;s good stuff nice job</li>
    <li> Great product, received on time</li>
    <li> I have used Mitchum unscented PowerGel for as long as I can remember. The stuff was great. It dried fast and neutralized wetness and odor between showers like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used. I mourn its&#x27; loss. This &#x27;new &amp; improved&#x27; oxygen formula is simply terrible. A drippy, watery mess that never dries properly and stains the hell out of my shirts. They shouldn&#x27;t have messed with such a good thing, and judging by many other recent negative reviews here, I&#x27;m not alone in my disappointment. See ya, Mitchum. We had a good run, didn&#x27;t we? :(</li>
    <li> One of the best anti-perspirant&#x27;s you can find.</li>
    <li> Other antiperspirants tend to irritate my underarms... Mitchum ... for whatever reason ... does not.  Also gives me reliable day long sweat and odor protection.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> What you get is different than the item pictured... it is the new Oxygen 48 Hour protection formula. As previous reviews, it is a bit watery for some reason so when you go to apply the product and dispense some of the gel, it tends to want to run off the top. Other than that, it is exactly what I wanted. It is &amp;#34;Unscented&amp;#34; but has a very light and refreshing scent when applied. And it really does last a long time, once the watery gel dries. It does its job. Since Speed Stick 24/7 is discontinued and they quit making Unscented gel a LONG time ago, I decided to give Mitchum a try again. I do absolutely love that it is unscented and does not interfere or compete with my cologne when I wear it, or my natural body scent when I don&#x27;t. I will keep using this product as long as they keep making it or I find something better, but I personally HATE scented deodorants because they drastically affect other scents like cologne.</li>
    <li> The new product is terrible.  I am sitting here sweating after applying last night.  And it goes on wet, and stays wet.  It is nowhere near as effective as any of the previous formulations.  I spoke with Mitchum and they said the new &amp;#34;Oxygen&amp;#34; formula is the only one available.  So, after &amp;#62;40 years of using their products, I am finished.  Listen up Mitchum and return to your previous effective formulations.  Give up on the &amp;#34;New Coke&amp;#34; before you lose your customers.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened to the formula but it appears I&#x27;m not the only one noticing. The old gel version, as originally pictured, was a quick drying long lasting product.&lt;br /&gt;This new version changes the applicator slots to dozens of tiny holes and the gel is now highly liquified, so much so that it flys out of the bottle as you apply, or leaks down the side of the bottle, you can even see the watery consistency \\&quot;jiggle\\&quot; holding the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It is also slow drying, and sticky to the point underarm hair or clothing stick for some time after applying. I can&#x27;t believe Mitchum has not heard many complaints.&lt;br /&gt;As to the supplier, not your fault and you did a nice job packaging the order. It&#x27;s Mitchum that needs to refine this Oxygen chemical bond breakdown or lose customers.</li>
    <li> Ordering six together is a big savings, plus they were shipped fast.  They&#x27;ve also redesigned the applicator so that none of the product is wasted.  5 stars and well worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent in every way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all I use.  Unscented is perfect and doesn&#x27;t clash with any scent you may be using.</li>
    <li> The best stuff out there, until Mitchum ruined it and replaced with Mitchum Advanced...now it ruins your clothes.</li>
    <li> Mitchum&#x27;s &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; of their Power Gel Unscented Sensitive Skin Fragrance Free anti-persprant and deodorant. WARNING: The new product is NOT fragrance-free; it has an overpowering scent. To label it as &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; is misleading. The smell remained in my dress shirt after the first laundering. I had to scrub the underarms of the shirt and wash it a second time before the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; finally disappeared. When I called Mitchum to complain about the new product and about not being able to find the former, I was informed that the Power Gel Fragrance Free had been discontinued. Their CSR recommended Revlon&#x27;s Almay Clear Gel Fragrance Free Sensitive Skin Hypoallergenic anti-perspirant and deodorant. (Mitchum-maker Revlon also has the Almay line.) The Almay has no detectable fragrance or scent, is non-irritating, does not dry as quickly, does not keep one odor-free as long as the old Mitchum, but is readily available in the drug stores and grocery stores I&#x27;ve checked. The Almay product # under the bar code is 3 0997-3664-00 5.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I have used Mitchum for at least 10 years and have always been happy with their products - I have been using gel for as long as I can remember. This new formula is very disappointing. It is watery, smells different (and not very good), and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as the old &amp;#34;formula&amp;#34;. I have switched over to right guard for the time being but will continue to search for a suitable replacement.</li>
    <li> Used to be the best, in the previous packaging (didn&#x27;t say \\&quot;Advanced\\&quot;).  Now I can&#x27;t stand the chemical/plastic like smell.  The 3 slots in the top changed to a bunch of small holes, the gel is now much more runny and stinks.  The old \\&quot;Unscented\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t really unscented but had a very good scent, this new stuff is terrible.    Really ticked off, bring back the old stuff as \\&quot;original scent\\&quot; or something.</li>
    <li> This packaging is terrible. The cap doesn&#x27;t stay on. And the product itself lasts like 3 hours tops.</li>
    <li> works as intended, not a much though.</li>
    <li> Get &#x27;em while they last.&lt;br /&gt;These are obsolete and the reviews for the replacement formula has been on the dry side</li>
    <li> Really works well as an anti perspirant but residue left behind feels odd</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal Mitchum user for 20 years, but the new formula has caused me to look elsewhere.  The new Mitchum might as well be glue!  After putting it on, your underarms remain tacky for hours - not a pleasant feeling!  Obviously, this product did not undergo human testing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and they added oxygen and screwed it up.</li>
    <li> The new Oxygen formula is runny and makes a total mess. I ended up throwing some away because it was just no good. Useless for travel as it makes whatever container it is in disgustingly runny</li>
    <li> Best unscented anti-perspirant/deodorant I&#x27;ve used but not always the most effective (your body adapts to it somewhat sometimes I fee)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a great 6 hours, then another good 4 hours then a decent 2-3 hours, then it&#x27;s just about all worn off by the 12 hour mark on an average person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely the worth buying if you&#x27;re into budget unscented anti-perspirant/deodorant that actually does the job and isn&#x27;t itchy or anything and helps keep you dry and smell free.</li>
    <li> Good price, quick shipping, right product.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Best product on market.  effective.</li>
    <li> Worst &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34; of all time. As others have written, the new formula is a drippy mess, the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on, it will leak all over your luggage, and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore as an antiperspirant. Here&#x27;s the worst part: it WILL stain your shirts. Bright colored shirts will end up with bleachy-looking white and pink stains, and white shirts will end up with yellowed pits. This never happened before they changed their formula. I wrote to the company to complain and never got a response. I&#x27;m guessing they are inundated with complaints.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best under arm deodorant that I ever used. It&#x27;s unscented and very effectively prevents you from getting bad odor, even after long work outs. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Needed this product and didn&#x27;t want to shop for it.  Great way to buy in bulk and have on hand when needed.</li>
    <li> My husband was very pleased!</li>
    <li> What a horrible product. Runny, leaky mess.  What the heck were they thinking... Give me back the old one!!!!!!!!!!!!  Can someone recommend an alternative product (from another company) that goes on like the old product did?</li>
    <li> I was using their roll on product and decided to try their gel.  I love all of their products, but I have noticed the gel leaves less white residue on my clothes, so I will stay with this.  Buy it, you will be happy!</li>
    <li> There is something wrong with this formula.  The new &amp;#34;oxygen&amp;#34; formula doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s gel state. It&#x27;s not stable.  It turns into a liquid and drips everywhere.  When you turn the dial on the bottom, the gel pushes through the holes in the top and immediately becomes a sticky liquid that drips down the side, on the counter, on the floor, everywhere.  It is a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old power gel formula was great.  This new formula has a problem that Mitchum needs to correct and replace all of the product that has been sold. Do not buy this product until Mitchum fixes the formula.</li>
    <li> This deodorant really does its job. I put it on in the morning, and sometimes find it is still effective when I wake up the next day. The gel goes on clear, and absolutely doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, which I love. It&#x27;s also great for people who are perfume-sensitive, because unlike some brands, when Mitchum says unscented, it really means unscented.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.  Works well for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is scented for sure, but very lightly. It is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried without a doubt.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. Musty smell by the end of the day.I tried the smart solid. That was good unless they changed the active ingredient.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for over 30 yrs....because it works.  Most other&#x27;s i&#x27;ve tried do not.  Glad i can purchase thru AMZ</li>
    <li> I liked the old Mitchum gel, but this new version is terrible.  As the other reviewers have noted, the good reviews are for the previous generation of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new product is so watery that it leaks all over, running down the sides of the container when you roll even a small amount out to be applied.  This gets on your hands, your bathroom counter, etc. and is hard to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making matters worse, while the old container actually had a cap with 3 bumps on the inside that plugged the three applicator holes through which the product is dispensed, the new container has dozens of holes and the cap does nothing to keep the watery gel inside. So forget packing it in your gym bag or suitcase--you&#x27;ll find it everywhere: a good amount stuck up in the cap and more anywhere else it can spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Absolute crap!I want the old formula back</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product.  It keeps me dry and  non-smelly all the time, which is what it says it will do and what it does.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the deal...This stuff works excellent at fighting odors and sweat.  HOWEVER, it is indeed runny and messy.  I have found a solution...simply do not put the lid on the product when done.  Only turn the dial for the amount you need, apply, then actually turn the dial down the opposite way.  Nest time you use it, simply give it a small turn, and, not really runny at all.  It sounds crazy to have to do this, but, it really works the best for me from anything that I have tried.  I think there is some sort of &amp;#34;pressure phenomenon&amp;#34; that occurs once the lid is one that breaks down the gel.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using Mitchum for years, this was such a good deal which is why I purchased it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum deodorant for years. They changed the formula as others have posted. It&#x27;s too bad. I will be looking for another brand of deodorant.</li>
    <li> Mitchum deodorant works great for me because the aroma is not overwhelming, and it does not irritate my underarm as some deodorants do.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THESE.  I usually buy this brand in the store and never had a problem. But I bought the 6-pack through Amazon and they are a big watery mess!! I even stored them in a very cool place and it didn&#x27;t matter. And I got stuck with 6 of them. So disappointing!! It&#x27;s supposed to be a gel consistency, but instead these are a watery consistency and makes a mess. Don&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
    <li> My husband likes gel deodorant (not dry, solids). This is the only one we have ever found and thank goodness he likes it really well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, just not my cup of tea. I didn&#x27;t realize it was so wet and gel-like, i&#x27;m more into the dry deodorants. Just not for me</li>
    <li> same as usual ! Good stuff !!</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to.  It not only keeps me odor free but this is the only anti-perspirant that keeps me dry also.</li>
    <li> Good product, but dries my skin and it starts to be itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Skin stays dry 36 hours for sure</li>
    <li> We live in a warm climate and when we recieved the deodorant the top and the covering stuck together therefore making it impossible to use.  My husband loves this brand but I am not sure that shipping it to south Florida is a good idea.</li>
    <li> I am 78; when I was a little kid, my Pops used &#x27;5 Day Under arm Pads&#x27; and thought they worked.  All of which is to say that with Mitchum if you choose you can shower every other day and not clear the room when you enter.  Get this, my Bullmastiff still lovse me on day 2.</li>
    <li> I just used up my last Mitchum product, and won&#x27;t be getting another. I agree that the new dispenser and the new deodorant that is inside are not nearly as good as what had been sold. I have used Mitchum for as long as I can remember, but now have to begin to find something else. Someone tell me why companies seem so eager to improve what does not need to be improved.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Advanced&amp;#34; formulation STINKS. It runs all over the place leaving a messy mess behind. I have used Mitchum for over 20 years, and am now looking for a new brand.</li>
    <li> so far like the productand delivery time was excellent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from right outside of Chicago and I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum since I was 10 years old. I&#x27;m 31 now. It literally works better that anything. If you use too much it will dry you out when your 1st using it. You only need a little.  UNSCENTED is the way to go! Why? Because you don&#x27;t want it to clash with your cologne!!!  Our deodorants are scented, our soap, our shampoo, our lotion, our hair products.....Then we put cologne on too...lol A real man knows whats up...Thank you.</li>
    <li> Terrible! For some reason the product oozes out of the container. Either the cap cannot be properly sealed (due to suction) or there&#x27;s some other defect in the packaging. Not sure but the sides and top of the container are constantly sticky and messy. DESERVES A RECALL AND REFUBD,</li>
    <li> Another product for my personal use, and I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better for me. Mitchum is a great product as I do have a strong underarm body smell, this works very well, and no mess with the clear gell uncented or sport sent both work great.</li>
    <li> I agree with other 1 star reviews. I had used Mitchum for years but am now looking for a new product. The change in the product and packaging are horrible. Complained to the company responsible for this change. They offered coupons for their inferior products. They can keep them and their new improved product.</li>
    <li> Has an overbearing geriatric smell.</li>
    <li> I received the old school power gel when I ordered. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I live in humid Florida and work in very close proximity to patients. I have to have something that won&#x27;t fail. This is the only thing that works for me. If I get lured away by a pretty container or a nice sent, within two days I&#x27;m back to this Mitchum.</li>
    <li> I have used these Mitchum anti-perspirant and deodorants for two years and I still love them. I also gave to some friend in Vietnam.</li>
    <li> Mitchum Anti Perspiration is great smelling and long lasting.  I have used it for about one year and so far I wouldn&#x27;t use another anti perspiration.  Wether its for men or women and I am a women I would buy either or.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is not 100% fragrance free, but it is sweet and clean and very neutral like a mild soap. I can smell it on but it never clashes with anything else I am using. I get excellent protection from it. Harder to find in stores so I&#x27;m really glad that Amazon carries it now. I like it in gel formula. It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my armpits feeling greasy like solids do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other deodorants over the years, but I ultimately keep coming back to Mitchum. I exercise quite a bit, and having a reliable product that doesn&#x27;t smear or smell strange is important as part of my everyday routine. Other deodorants occasionally let me down, but I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by Mitchum gels. To top it off, it&#x27;s consistently more economical than many of its less reliable competitors. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking for a deodorant they can rely on.</li>
    <li> I once gave this a four-star, and realized it&#x27;s really more five-star worthy.  I repeatedly buy this product and am very happy with it--especially the value you get from buying it on Amazon vs in a drug store.  When are these brick and mortar stores going to stop ripping us off with basic household necessities??</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how Mitchum can call this product &amp;#34;UNSCENTED.&amp;#34;  It has a distinct Musk smell to it, which makes me gag.</li>
    <li> Tried many deodorants over the years, some good, and most bad. This is the only one that never lets me down. Odorless, colorless and effective for at least 24 hours. Get the six pack from Amazon and save a few bucks.</li>
    <li> Great price quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I always order in bulk the only thing i  didnt like was that it has to many holes on top where the deodorant comes out its just a waste</li>
    <li> This stuff is complete crap. I was a religious user of mitchum deoderant since 1998. Since they changed to this new oxygen formula and new applicator it is garbage. The tiny multiple holes allow too much to come out, the new gel is so thin it runs all over the place and dries a crusty mess on the bottle and elsewhere it leaks onto. While applying leakage flies around. Once it flew into my eye creating a painful dry condition that lasted a day.&lt;br /&gt;I have an older bottle that I am savoring as long as I can.</li>
    <li> Escaping from prison, it is crucial to have unscented antiperspirant. Harder on the dogs. This pack is an excellent value and keeps me from going into a hell hole walmart.</li>
    <li> No. 1 for post-menopausal and marathon runner husband</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant. It will still work the following day. My sons and I love it, and no skin irritation either.</li>
    <li> This was the best deodorant for decades and now in 2014 it has been changed and is ineffective after 3 to 4 hours. Body odor gets right through the new formula. They changed it and ruined it.</li>
    <li> Work as good as Mitchum has worked for me over 10 years, its by far the best anti perspirant in the market, no irritation, and really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complain and why it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars, its the new opening on the top is too much, i like the old presentation better with 3 holes, now it has tons that for me its hard to judge whats enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum for thirty years.  Every once in a while I will try something else but my sensitive skin does not appreciate the change and I quikcly go back.  Not cheap, but if (like me) everything else (so far) you try causes rash/irritation - this is worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very strong and effective - lasts over 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, works great for me. I like only the gel one.</li>
    <li> This is a huge pack, maybe even a year supply. The deodorant is good, no real complaints. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Dries fast</li>
    <li> I try different antiperspirants on occasion just to see if there&#x27;s any difference and I usually go back to this product. This seems to keep me the driest, especially during the Texas heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have any real complaints about this product other then I wished it were bit stronger, but I think increasing whatever ingredient is in it to keep us from sweating ends up not being too good for our bodies down the road!</li>
    <li> As  of 2015 It seems that the formula and the package have been changed.  A better dispensing top and non-sticky  gel.  Much better.</li>
    <li> Obsession is my favorite cologne so I use this Mitchum and [[ASIN:B002PQ8BQM SweatBlock Antiperspirant Towelettes - As Seen on Rachael Ray - Reduce Sweat for up to 7 Days Per Use]].  Then I spray one shot of my [[ASIN:B000GHVGRI Obsession by Calvin Klein for Men, Eau De Toilette Spray, 6.7 Ounce]] under each armpit.  My underarms will smell like obsession for 24 hours and never a drop of sweat.</li>
    <li> The scent is queer and lingering. At best it could be described as mossy musk. Mildew would be a more accurate account.</li>
    <li> Not only is it effective but it does not stain clothing worn over it. The one slight down-side is that to be most effective is must be allowed to dry for awhile. (Sit naked under a shade tree with your elbows raised for 20 minutes and you&#x27;re ready to go (or to answer questions from a local police officer).</li>
    <li> reading the other reviews here, I finally solved the mystery of why my shirts have bleached armpits!  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a couple years, and I just started noticing that the armpits of my darker colored shirts are all getting bleached.  I didn&#x27;t notice this in time.  Now, some of my nicest shirts are ruined!  WTF?  so lame.  I&#x27;m pissed.  I&#x27;m throwing away my supply and switching to the Arrid XX unscented (which people love and doesn&#x27;t bleach your shirts)  http://www.amazon.com/Arrid-Antiperspirant-Deodorant-Unscented-2-6-Ounce/dp/B001E77NUS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_sc_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1428123575&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1-spell&amp;keywords&#x3D;arrid+xtra+dry</li>
    <li> great price for 5 pack!</li>
    <li> I have used Mitchum deodorant for, I think, 30 years.  It never fails.  You can go for a day or two and forget to use it after a shower and it is still working.  Buying the 6 pack is equivalent to one free bottle compared to retail.</li>
    <li> Not bad works i feel there are others that works even better but the price is better on this on</li>
    <li> It is genuinely unscented and works at preventing odor. It does sting a little sometimes, but it does not cause any redness or irritation. It is a really strange feeling when it does sting, sort of like being pricked by a needle made of ice. I will probably get the sensitive skin version on repurchase. One last thing is that the gel only fills about 2/3 of the space unopened, they obviously intentionally made it larger to make you think you are getting more than you are.</li>
    <li> I had been using the solid stick, my mistake in ordering the power gel.  Works as it should, however it is not as travel friendly being a gel.</li>
    <li> Unscented is far fetched, very misleading. The scent is overpowering, it smells like musty and moldy clothes, it can smell up a whole room.  Never getting this product again.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I have really sensitive skin that has \\&quot;issues\\&quot; with most scented antiperspirants/deodorants,but,since I live in Texas and want to keep my job, not wearing deodorant is not an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not stain my clothes or leave a residue, does not cause irritation, and blocks body odor!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order this through the subscribe and save program at Amazon, so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the supermarket for the first time some months ago. I don&#x27;t like typical deodorants that reek of perfume and leave me itchy so I decided to splurge on this stuff. When it ran out I bought it in bulk off Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing a bit about marketing when I first read &amp;#34;with oxygen strength&amp;#34; or whatever it says on this thing I immediately thought it was a clever way of saying &amp;#34;we watered down our formula,&amp;#34; because technically oxygen is in water (H2O). I never bought Mitchum&#x27;s before the formula changed so I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m missing, but this stuff is still better than the rest of the players in the game despite being watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a gentle, neutral smell. A little goes a long way and lasts me all day. It is watery and takes time to dry. When traveling with it I suggest capping it, then lowering the remaining product to create a vacuum that keeps the cap shut and air tight. Otherwise the product will leak out and get all over your stuff.</li>
