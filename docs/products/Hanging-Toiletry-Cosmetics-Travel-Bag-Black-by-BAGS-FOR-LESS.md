      <li>Very good product, two things to be aware of.  </li>
      <li>he really likes it, nice size fits all his toiletries and hangs nicely to be able to conveniently see and get to the items, great price too!</li>
      <li>handy for sure.</li>
      <li>The storage in this bag is nice, however, there is no hook at the top to hang it, therefore requiring me to use a clothes hanger.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s by far the best cosmetic case I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>I liked the quality of the product but wish it came with a ring for the top metal loop like many women&#x27;s travel bags do.</li>
      <li>works great, exactly what i needed</li>
      <li>It is easy to hook a repelling type spring mounted clip on the top so you can connect to most anything in or around bathroom!</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;pocket&amp;#34; at the bottom is a nice sized bag that I can fit all my hair products and implements in.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>It ended up being her favorite gift as she uses it on every trip we take</li>
      <li>this product would have been so much better with a hook instead of a D ring.</li>
      <li>but most men can get what they need in it.</li>
      <li>I did read that a hook instead of a circle at the top would be better in case there wasn&#x27;t a hook to hang it on.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>more plastic than what i though...</li>
      <li>recipient was pleased with item.</li>
      <li>Great space for toiletries and closes up very well.</li>
      <li>Overall very happy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It would be better with a hook (like a hanger) at the top, but I can always find a way around that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
      <li>can hang it over a door or towel rack knob if you buy a velcro strap, a medium- to large-sized carabiner should allow you to hook it over a towel rack, and you might be able to hang it over a door by rigging something with a clotheshanger at the hotel (but you couldn&#x27;t close the door).  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If this travel bag had a hook on the top instead of a ring, it would be perfect. I bought this for my husband to use while we were on vacation this summer so that instead of unpacking and repacking all the toiletries in the bathroom (an annoying part of travel), he could just keep everything in the bag and hang it up in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice-sized bag that holds a lot. Right now in it is travel sized shampoo, body wash, toothpaste, toothbrush, deodorant, shaving cream, disposable razors, qtips, a small loufah, contact cleaner and case, glasses and case, and there&#x27;s plenty more room to spare if we needed!</li>
    <li> Given as Christmas present. Well received and well like.</li>
    <li> Looks good. Good price.</li>
    <li> Just received this Hanging Toiletry Bag and took it on the road for the first time. It&#x27;s functional. I haven&#x27;t figured out how I&#x27;m going to work it into my packing routine yet but I like having the divided spaces. It is definitely a good idea. We&#x27;ll see how it holds up to some semi-rough use over the next few months. I&#x27;m thinking of storing my charging cords to the different gadgets I carry, earbuds - that sort of thing.</li>
    <li> I needed a bag with multiple compartments that fit all of my make up and this bag does the job. Since I&#x27;m a college student I travel a lot from home and school and this bag makes it very helpful. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> JUST WISH IT ACTUALLY HAD A HANGER FOR SHOWER ROD</li>
    <li> Just what I needed...</li>
    <li> Very good product, two things to be aware of.  First, it comes with a metal loop at the top so you might need to provide your own hook, I personally use a coat hanger to hang it up.  Second, the width of the overall product means I can not transport my electric toothbrush assembled, I need to take the brush off for it to fit into the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a fantastic travel toiletry bag.</li>
    <li> came with some sort of manufacturing error. It will not close due to the velcro being sewn on the wrong side. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> The quality of this bag is less than desirable but I guess I&#x27;m getting what I paid for.  It is functional but I don&#x27;t plan on it lasting very long.</li>
    <li> works great, exactly what i needed</li>
    <li> I travel a lot for work and had a very similar toiletry bag for many year. My old one was getting very ratty looking, but I didn&#x27;t want to throw it out since I liked it so much. So I was very happy when I found this bag at amazon. It has great side compartments for smaller pieces like razors and hair accessories, so you know exactly where everything is without digging. The main compartment has plenty of room for shampoo/conditioner/hairspray etc bottles, brushes and combs, and anything you need for personal hygiene.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had this for long, so not sure about it&#x27;s durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the big pocket where I can put all my bulky items and the smaller pouches for smaller things and brushes so it&#x27;s easier to get to.  Would be better if there is a hook/hanger.</li>
    <li> It would be better to buy one of the travel bags with individual detachable bags... Getting into the different compartments is difficult.</li>
    <li> Received product and was packing toiletry items in the plastic enclosures and the stitches&lt;br /&gt;holding the zipper together busted open.... Very Dissapointed!</li>
    <li> My husband had to travel and it worked great!</li>
    <li> Not super fancy but does the trick! Has been a few thousand miles and shoved into backpacks and still looks like new. Easy to wipe clean and has enough space for essentials and non essentials.</li>
    <li> We used this travel bag on our trip to Italy last year and we were able to carry all of our everyday toiletries and then some. All pockets are easily accessible, the only reason why I do not rate higher is because the ring provided for hanging is not usable in all locations, an optional means to hang it would be useful in many places.</li>
    <li> I actually love this Cosmetics Travel Bag, it is actually exactly what I needed. I have to much make up as it is, but this is gonna come in handy for sure. Got it exactly on time, actually sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Been using this as my travel toiletry bag for over 2 years of business travel.  It works great and has plenty of storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be better with a hook (like a hanger) at the top, but I can always find a way around that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> It will work for what I need it for could be just a little bigger!</li>
    <li> it works great.  Just for information it does not come with hook.  Lot fits in it.  Thanks you so much</li>
    <li> I was looking for a bag with bigger zippered see through compartments..plus this bag comes with NO hooks to hang the bag..was not satisfied with this bag..would have paid more to get what I wanted</li>
    <li> This travel bag is pretty bulky but that means I was able to put everything in that I needed. I was even able to put my medicine container (Gasketed VitaCarry 8 Compartment Pill Box Holds Up To 150 Pills...) in there in addition to all of my toiletries. It stands up nicely on a counter, and can even hang if you wanted that too,. Overall very happy.</li>
    <li> recipient was pleased with item. it was as stated/shown on Amazon. recipient travels quite a lot and was happy to have this type of toiletry bag. would recommend this to others based on their comments.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Very handy.</li>
    <li> This bag was just what I needed. It was just the right size. Was able to get everything I needed in it and more.</li>
    <li> The pockets are just right.  The sizing helps organize, the material is solid and the price is right!  Velcrow is sticky, but doesn&#x27;t attract lint!  Not too bulky, only wish there was a better way to hang it when velcrowed.</li>
    <li> Gave this to wife for Christmas as a stocking stuffer.  It ended up being her favorite gift as she uses it on every trip we take it is so great!  Just hang it on the bathroom door!</li>
    <li> great for Europe, it,s smaller then the one I use to travel in this country, so takes up less room.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome bag for one person. For two people, my husband and I it wasn&#x27;t big enough. I love it and plan on using it in the for myself in the future. I would buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> The storage in this bag is nice, however, there is no hook at the top to hang it, therefore requiring me to use a clothes hanger. STRIKE NUMBER ONE. Number two, the compartment separator inside ripped literally like a month after receiving it in the mail. Nice size bag, not good quality. Would recommend that the maker of this bag recreate it and make some edits in its formation.</li>
    <li> Pretty good overall but it doesn&#x27;t come with a hook to fasten it to anything.  I had to use a belt to make it work!</li>
    <li> not as big as i expected. wish you could hang it on something</li>
    <li> Was good just not great material. Only got used once.</li>
    <li> The product was how it was described and arrived very quickly. Also, the price was very good.  However, as soon as I opened one of the zippers, it came off.  I think the zipper part was poorly designed.  I ended up returning the product.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my husband who wanted one after he had traveled with a friend who had one.  I liked the quality of the product but wish it came with a ring for the top metal loop like many women&#x27;s travel bags do.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend, she has been using it ever since. It&#x27;s not too big, and easy to carry around.</li>
    <li> it isa too much small&lt;br /&gt;just for poor people  this bag is too little i don&#x27;t like this about bag</li>
    <li> Tough, durable and saves a lot of messing around with toiletries in the shower.  I bought this to go in my gym bag after my last bag was stolen.  It replaced a similar toiletries bag I had bought from Ikea a few years back and I was very pleased.  First of all the clear windows are an improvement over the open mesh I used to have.  I can see everything stored.  The bottom compartment is a small shaving bag in itself, so a good place for a soap box and shaving lotion can; perfect in fact.  Because this travel bag is well made it will hold a small pair of scissors too - and no worries of them poking out the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things this travel bag do not have going for it:&lt;br /&gt;1) It has a metal D ring but no hook - this was easily resolved by putting a hanger hook in the top pocket. Now it hangs on any shower wall or door.&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t dry out easily if it gets wet. - again not much of an issue, I just wad up paper towels and stick them in the pockets for a day or 2 until the moisture is absorbed and dry it with my gym towel if it gets over sprayed.</li>
    <li> I used this for a trip, but a few weeks later, a product punched a hole in the side wall of the bag. It isn&#x27;t exactly durable. It&#x27;s made of thin plastic.</li>
    <li> I tried this out for a short trip to Atlantic City for my electronic devices (camera, cables spare phone battery and charger, etc) and I have no doubt it will be a great asset for my cruise toiletries this September. Only thing missing is a hook to hang it which I will make from a piece of coat hanger. It does have an eye to hook it to. Good product.</li>
    <li> Man you can fit everything in here.  I like the compartments and separation.  Gets pretty flat when it&#x27;s empty which is great for storage.</li>
    <li> Grandson taking a trip in a couple of months. Perfect for  him.  I do wish it had travel size bottles wity.</li>
    <li> I have the royal blue one also and I love these to hold my products for my business travels. The top shows what products I have and the bottom holds more!!</li>
    <li> Great product, enough space!</li>
    <li> Give this item rating 5 stars is because it has a Fantastic Space for storage fot the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beware that the folding clear zipper areas are for small and thin items to put in. What tha mean is that if u put too much in the clear pock and it bulks out u will not be able to close or even fold the bag to put away!!! So be warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about is that it has improved my reduction of carrying 2 small travel kits into 1! This bag literrally is 3 small Walgreen/CVS/Macy size travel bag in 1!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I use this as my travel kit for over night or long trip travels for business. Works great for the purpose and awesome price.</li>
    <li> This little bag holds a lot more stuff then I thought it would. I just wish it had a Velcro strap to keep the bag close.</li>
    <li> Sent it back- doesn&#x27;t hold what it looks like it would and you can&#x27;t really pack enough in it so that you can roll it up properly.</li>
    <li> Ths is great.  It holds so much!  and yet it folds up, to fit in a suitcase.  I love that it hangs up also, although I had to put a hanging device on it.  It didn&#x27;t come with a hanger.  But I still love it</li>
    <li> I just wish it was bigger. I honestly have so much cosmetics but the bag is very convenient and fits a lot of items. I cant wait to use it when I travel.</li>
    <li> The case looks like it does in the photo. Simple and sleek in design and can pretty much hold many things. Folds easily too.</li>
    <li> I travel often for my job, and the travel case I had was falling apart -- and it was not the type I could hang up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at a variety of travel bags for my toiletry items, I opted to purchase this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bag is spacious enough for all items I travel with, conveniently wraps around itself to fit in a suitcase, and hangs well on a door hook (or whatever type of hook your hotel provides). Decent quality as well. It should last a few years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I guess I had hoped for more. The top part should be a hook instead of a ring. What good does a ring do?</li>
    <li> used this overseas in afghanistan it is awesome</li>
    <li> The description calls it a &amp;#34;hanging&amp;#34; bag, but unless you supplement the bag with a velcro strap or carbiner, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find a nail small enough for the small metal D ring.  Most travelers will want to hang this from a doorknob, towel rack, or over the door, but you can&#x27;t do this with the metal ring attached to the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hang it over a door or towel rack knob if you buy a velcro strap, a medium- to large-sized carabiner should allow you to hook it over a towel rack, and you might be able to hang it over a door by rigging something with a clotheshanger at the hotel (but you couldn&#x27;t close the door).  My pick is a velcro strap because you can also use it to wrap around the bag to help hold it shut (it is held closed by a strip of velcro).</li>
    <li> works good. I like that you can see what you have in each compartment, this way you don&#x27;t have to dig around to find what you want.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it. It folds up perfectly for traveling. Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this to hold emergency kit items like bandages, bandaids, steristrips. Etc. It works great! The compartments are a nice size, the plastic is decent- especially for the price. This is not something that will hold up for years as a makeup bag or anything that takes a ton of abuse on a daily basis. But if you are looking for something inexpensive and is well constructed for what it is, look no further. It came within the proper time frame as well. I am debating getting a few more for my 72 hour kits</li>
    <li> Great cosmetic case. I originally purchased this for travel, but I use it always. It folds up so I can keep it in a drawer, even full of my many cosmetics. And for travel, the same, and allows me to hang it to easily view all of the contents. It&#x27;s by far the best cosmetic case I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> This is a handy travel bag.  I&#x27;m using it for snacks for the kids and it has nice large pockets.</li>
    <li> I was looking around for an all in one travel bag to carry tolietries and makeup - instead of carrying (3) seperate bags for all this stuff. My sister in law had one of these bags that she paid almost $30 for in a department store . I found this bag - looks exactly the same as hers and same amount of store for so much less !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bag is GREAT . It has a loop on the bag that you can eoither attach a hook to or just hang this bag off a hanger in your closet and your set to go .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and very durable !</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t complain because of the price i paid for this. it wasnt much! quality isnt amazing but it will hopefully last at least a year. def. reccommend.</li>
    <li> right size with enough room to sort the products my son uses, should come in handy his next trip it was a good gift</li>
    <li> This is really a cheap quality item  Thirteen more words that are required are unnecessary  and a waste of words</li>
    <li> Great bag.  Went for a two week vacation and a whole bunch of travel sized products and some not so travel sized fit just great. Had it packed and it rolled up nicely.</li>
    <li> I went on cruise and had read that having a hanging bag was the way to go. This bag worked great for my trip. There was a hook on the back of the door in the bathroom and this fit there great. The bag had plenty of storage for all of my stuff and still closed. I think this will work great on any future trip. I did read that a hook instead of a circle at the top would be better in case there wasn&#x27;t a hook to hang it on. I didn&#x27;t have a problem as there was a hook but I could see how this might be a problem as you can&#x27;t hang this on a towel bar. Overall it worked great for what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> So helpful, great for traveling</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present, and she loves the hanging hook.  Pay attention to the sizing info, however, because it is small.  But it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this as a gift.  I had the same model / layout and have used it for years to travel all over the world.  I&#x27;ve had others, butthis design is so nice for organizing and hanging open so that you can see and access all of your stuff.</li>
    <li> Great price, shipping, and packaging.  Light and probably will not last more than a couple of years but most men can get what they need in it.</li>
    <li> Was a little iffy about this product when I read another reviewer&#x27;s comment about some tag saying &amp;#34;this product contains a known carcinogen&amp;#34;. Of course it sounded like rubbish, but I was still on edge. After receiving my bag, I checked all over and could not find any such tag.&lt;br /&gt;The bag itself is pretty good, lots and lots of space. Seems well constructed and zippers feel sturdy, my only gripe is the D ring... this product would have been so much better with a hook instead of a D ring. However, I&#x27;m gonna add a clip to it (so problem solved). No holes, no tears, no defects. It was in perfect condition. Delivery was on time, and all-in-all I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It was almost what I was expecting.  Would have liked more room for larger products but on the whole it is compact for all of the stuff I put in it and folded into a nice compact case.</li>
    <li> This bag seems to be quite well-made.  Although there is plenty of room for all your necessities, it folds to a nice compact size.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with a hanger.  More slots for specific items and zip or snap closures would have been nice.  Got it for my husband.  I have one that is much better from another maker.  Should have gotten him one from there.</li>
    <li> This is a great all in one traveling bag. It&#x27;s roomy but not too big. I love the easy access to everything. It was perfect for my trip. The shipping was fast and it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This bag comes with a label explicitly stating that the material it is made of contains a known carcinogen. Call me crazy, but I wasn&#x27;t excited about putting my toothbrush inside it. I prefer not to purposely ingest ingredients that cause cancer. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I travel often and need something I can just grab and go with. I found this bag and its wonderful. I keep all most essential in it so when I need to take off I just grab this and toss it in my bag and don&#x27;t worry. I keep an extra set of everything in this bag so its got everything I need. Folds perfect to carry in a backpack or suitcase. It also has a side handle to carry by. The clear pouches allow you to find things quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom large compartment holds a full size paddle brush, comb, mini mouthwash, toothpaste and toothbrush, face wash, and deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed at this bag.  Its inexpensive and lightweight so I thought it was sort of junky but with travel weight limits its turned out to be just the ticket.  Seems to hold everything I need (which is a lot) and it can be rolled up or spread out in your suitcase depending on your needs.  I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a year and its holding up.  I&#x27;ve cleaned it a couple of times with a lightly soapy cloth and it comes out looking new again. The bottom pocket is big for those 3oz sized (or larger) bottles and tooth brushes.  The zippers still all work, even with the pockets jammed full.  Its a good deal.</li>
    <li> got this for my husband who now travels frequently for work..he really likes it, nice size fits all his toiletries and hangs nicely to be able to conveniently see and get to the items, great price too!</li>
    <li> We use a travel bag just for all our toiletry items.  Now we can take what we each need and actual pack this in our suitcases instead of having a separate suitcase full of stuff we usually don&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy. Not easy to get things in and out of. The zipper opening is very small across the top of the main compartment.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this travel bag the quality is nice and what a great gift for the person that does a lot of traveling. Birthday, Fathers day &amp; Christmas is coming soon order it you will be 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> It needs a hook (I use a twisted wire hanger) but other than that it&#x27;s perfect.  I had become adjusted to my old toiletry bag through the years and was grumbling about having to replace it. This was not expensive so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It really is great - holds a lot and it&#x27;s easy to find anything without having to dig through it and it folds up nicely.</li>
    <li> this is a great bag for the price !</li>
    <li> I was very excited to open my package and start packing for my trip that is happening in a few days. I started packing and I was about to put toiletries in the big part of the bag, when I noticed there&#x27;s a big hole. How am I supposed to travel with a \\&quot;BRAND NEW\\&quot; toiletry bag that is supposed to protect my toiletries when there is a hole in it? I do not have time for nonsense of returning things and for $12 I was hoping to get a decent product. This is a huge disappointment. Do not buy this bag, you&#x27;ll just end up wasting your time and money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great but a bit big for what I needed.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much a person can say about a toiletry bag except that it holds toiletries and hangs on the bathroom door of the Motel. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain for the price, however I have one dislike. I have bottles in all of the clear pouches including small shampoo, etc.  When folding the long sleeve part of the bag around itself it has problems conforming and the Velcro pieces are off by several inches and therefore doesn&#x27;t stay closed and ends up a rolled up mess that tries to unravel as I carry it or store it in luggage.  This is a pain so next time I use it I will try to figure out which pouch is the biggest cause of this problem and possibly leave that pouch empty.  It may just be me as no one has really complained in the reviews about this.  Otherwise lots and lots of storage, at a glance viewing of where everything is stored, durable and a decent zipper (my last bag the zipper always jammed and therefore stayed unzipped all the time).</li>
    <li> Spacious, very nice. Can fit about three shampoo bottles with no hassle. Great space for toiletries and closes up very well. Very good product. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> My wife says I could survive on a desert island with my travel bag!  I have been able to put everything necessary for trips up to 16 days long! I have combs, scissors, razor, soap, bandages, creams, toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, sewing kit, mirror, medications, AND MUCH MORE!! Anytime she needs something on a trip I am sure to have it!  It is easy to hook a repelling type spring mounted clip on the top so you can connect to most anything in or around bathroom! I have hooked mine to lights, mirrors, shelving, shower glass or whatever you can find. I have used mine in hotel rooms, ship bathrooms while on cruises, homes we have stayed in, etc. This price is a GREAT price and you cant go wrong with spending this amount on such a great bag!  Highly recommend this Travel Kit! You will be pleased!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought my original hanging toiletry travel bag in the 1980&#x27;s.  It has lasted this long.  This one is almost a duplicate and the zippered pockets even seem to be a little larger then the original.  I&#x27;m totally satisfied with my purchase and really glad to have found another one just like my original.</li>
    <li> I never received what I requested. In it&#x27;s place I received something that looked like a man&#x27;s shaving kit. Needless to say I was disapointed. I was told that beacause I purchased from \\&quot;Bags for Less\\&quot; &amp; their inventory was constantly changing they couldn&#x27;t replace it. But I did get credit. I&#x27;m happy with that. Although, it kinda makes me wary to purchase from anyone but Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is really thin, flimsy material., and instead of a hook on the top, that will fit onto a towel bar or a back of door hook, this just has a really small metal ring, so I don&#x27;t know you could even hang it up.</li>
    <li> This toiletry bag is great because of its clear zip-up pockets, a larger fabric pocket for bigger and more personal items.  Thank you!  It shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel!  You can get everything and and it hangs!</li>
    <li> for my husbands needs. I found that it was flimsy, quality wasn&#x27;t that great, however I kept it for myself!</li>
    <li> This bag is awesome. I wish it was a zipper to close it instead of velcro that&#x27;s the only thing I don&#x27;t like. This is because when it&#x27;s really packed the Velcro opens easily so if you hold it by the handle on the side it opens out</li>
    <li> The bag arrived with loose stitching. There were hanging threads in some places. The material didn&#x27;t feel very durable. However, the pricing was relatively low.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful size. The &amp;#34;pocket&amp;#34; at the bottom is a nice sized bag that I can fit all my hair products and implements in.&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is that the items in the top pocket should be small or flexible enough to fold around the rest of the bag. You could certainly use it for makeup or bath products as well!</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift, she was happy.</li>
    <li> Love-fits all my makeup and brushes- only think I don&#x27;t like is it doesn&#x27;t have a hanging hook</li>
    <li> I was very mad when i got this since i recieved something that was nothing like the picture shown, the only reason i didnt return it is because i live outside the states and international shipping was going to be more expensive than the item itself....</li>
    <li> Great item for travel.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my husband&#x27;s &amp;#34;old man bag&amp;#34;.  Folds n (shaving supplies, medications, etc.)Nice and compact. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Too big...otherwise good</li>
    <li> My wife used this a few times when traveling.  Some of the seams have already torn.  Now when she puts an item into one of the clear pockets it actually falls out of sight into the lining of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There must be better quality versions of this product available.  We had similar bags that we used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and look for something else.  Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> His toiletry kit was disintegrating and a new one was needed.  He liked the pockets and knew just what was in each one.  So, he did not want a bag that was different.  I never thought that I would be able to duplicate his old system.  When I saw this bag on Amazon, I knew that it was the perfect choice.  It shipped fast and he was very pleased.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the pics and its great for travel. Nothing special about it but it&#x27;ll get the job done.</li>
    <li> I love it. Made with good material. Can hang it on anything. Very portable. Has lots of space and pockets. Over all great makeup traveling bag.</li>
    <li> I travel often. This helps a lot when it comes to carrying all my beauty products. I don&#x27;t have to worry about spills..</li>
    <li> I love it. I bought this product to go to a trip, and it is very useful to carry out everything that you want to... I used it to carry out my makeup.</li>
    <li> Pretty small - was disappointed it did not hold more.  Dimensions are given but it appeared to me it would be big enough.</li>
    <li> During the first 2 months it worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;I did not put any heavy object in it but after 3 months the bag compartments gave in.</li>
    <li> Pockets are smaller but overall decent</li>
    <li> more plastic than what i though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but very good maybe that is better for humidy enviroment in the toilet... practical</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good bag to use at the gym as most days I work out and shower and get ready for work.  It was a hassle getting shampoo, soap, shaving cream, razors, brush, etc, all in one bag that I could use in the shower.  This bag is cool as you can hang it up in the shower and all your stuff is right there.  Can&#x27;t use it for airline travel with the plastic bag for liquid requirements.  But for using at the gym or even for travel if you are not carrying your luggage on board it&#x27;s good.  I have had a couple of months and it&#x27;s holding up.  I am going to order another just to have as a back up.</li>
