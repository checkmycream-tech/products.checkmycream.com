      <li>and i loved how i could run my fingers through my hair without untangling any knots.</li>

      <li>She said she really loved this product and that her two daughters wouldn&#x27;t keep their hands off of it.  </li>
      <li>I read a lot of reviews that said this was just as good as Wen.</li>

      <li>A friend recommended the Wen product and I loved it.</li>
      <li>Have never seen my hair look this good before.</li>
      <li>I have never used Wen but bought this after watching some YouTube videos about how good it is compared to Wen.</li>
      <li>so she tried the Hair One and loved it, too.</li>
      <li>I have tried this, and LOVED it.</li>
      <li>A good alternative to Wen at about 1/2 the price.</li>
      <li>I bought some for my daughter, and she also loved it,  </li>
      <li>When I tried it, I loved it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fairly unimpressed with Hair One.    </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how anyone has rated this as good as Wen.</li>
      <li>I have gotten the best results when I use COOL water at the end of my rinsing routine.  </li>
      <li>Love love love my hair!!!!  </li>
      <li>I love Wen conditioning cleaner; my hair was always great looking when I used it, full of body, and kept my style well, and I have thinning hair so that was great!</li>
      <li>I could not be more happy with it.</li>
      <li>All I can say is that it works great for my hair type, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>At any rate, once I followed the instructions, I was very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>but I like a nice smelling shampoo/conditioner so that my hair smells good all day while I&#x27;m at work.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that it is just as good as Wen, but you wont go broke using it.  </li>
      <li>We will order even more!</li>
      <li>Our family is really satisfied with this product!</li>
      <li>Wen is wayyyy better!</li>
      <li>but I love this for shaving cream!</li>
      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>but I decided to stick with it, and I am so glad that I did!</li>
      <li>First 2 uses were wonderful.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>If you like Wen, you will love Hair One!  </li>
      <li>My hair has allot of lift/volume when using this product as well as it does a great job managing the knots that get under my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It shocks your hair and then the turn around will be amazing.  </li>
      <li>Now I have the Wen and it is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>I was using Wen and loving it, but going broke at $40.00 a bottle.  </li>
      <li>After purchasing Wen and LOVING the results, I searched online for a cheaper alternative and found Hair One.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK, but not as good as WEN.</li>
      <li>here is my honest review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
      <li>People began to comment that my hair looked nice.  </li>
      <li>But I was happy to find that when it was rinsed off, my hair was just as squeaky clean as with shampoo.</li>
      <li>Its a good cheap alternative to Wen for sure!</li>
      <li>I love this product, my hair is very healthy.  </li>
      <li>And the best part is, I saw this huge change after the first time I used it!</li>
      <li>At about $1 an ounce, this is my hair&#x27;s new best friend.</li>
      <li>but you need to use more product for it to even be remotely effective.</li>
      <li>The results are great and for the price its worth a try.</li>
      <li>Maybe I should have gotten the kind for more oily hair?</li>
      <li>This is a great great product - its knock off of the WEN hair care product that cost $19.95 for the same 12oz size.  </li>
      <li>Worked great for the first 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>First, let me say that it is great.</li>
      <li>Very smooth.</li>
      <li>and i was hoping that Hair One would give my hair more volume and body.</li>
      <li>But cheap Suave conditioner has cetyl alcohol too!</li>
      <li>it kinda helped with  frizziness but not any more than a $4 anti frizz shampoo would do.</li>
      <li>so I can see that others may need to use more.  </li>
      <li>I am a WEN user and think it is a bit more luxurious in its texture than Hair One.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s much better for your hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure I can make myself use the rest of the bottle and may just toss it out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this every day but when I do use it my hair stays soft and manageable for several days before I need to use it again.  Make sure you follow the instructions and it works far better in cooler water than hotter water.  It&#x27;s smell is invigorating and I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this as a potential, cheaper, replacement to wen, but unfortunately it just wasn&#x27;t as satisfying.  I think, had I not used wen for over a year before trying this, I would have liked it quite a bit, but unfortunately, since I have something to compare it to now, it just doesn&#x27;t quite suffice.  I have fine dry hair and this makes the top of my head seem oily while leaving the tips of my hair dry.  It also smells quite chemically, more-so than even regular shampoo.  If you&#x27;re new to this kind of hair product, I&#x27;d say give a go, it&#x27;s a good replacement for regular shampoo, however, if you&#x27;re already a customer of wen and can afford it, I&#x27;d say stick with that as it is, overall, a better product.</li>
    <li> This was not quite what I expected it to be. I followed the directions exactly. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday but with this stuff I had to. It did make my hair look very good right after it was washed, and it felt soft. By the end of the day, it looked greasy and stringy. I got the normal kind because my hair inst usually greasy. Maybe I should have gotten the kind for more oily hair?</li>
    <li> I have tried this, and LOVED it. However, if you&#x27;re down to $5, a $10 bottle of Hair One is still too much (especially considering how much you have to use). But if you just take a second and compare the ingredients in Hair One with the ingredients of a $2 bottle of conditioner from the grocery store, I think you&#x27;ll be surprised at how similar they are.    That&#x27;s because Hair One uses cetyl alcohol to clean your hair. But cheap Suave conditioner has cetyl alcohol too! I tried washing my hair with Suave Rosemary Mint conditioner one day after I ran out of my Hair One. My hair was a mess and I had sworn that I was NEVER going back to shampoo. I saw Suave conditioner on sale for $1.67 at Kroger. Looking at the label, I noticed that it has many of the same ingredients as Hair One, and decided to give it a shot (I also think it smells better than Wen or Hair One, personally). I was amazed! My hair was just as clean, shiny, and bouncy as with Hair One, but for a tenth of the price (and a thirtieth of the price of Wen)! Suave Rosemary Mint conditioner all the way.</li>
    <li> I have long greasy flat hair and i was hoping that Hair One would give my hair more volume and body. It doesn&#x27;t.   The smell is not very good either but it goes away after you dry your hair. Pretty much the only reason why i   would buy this again is because of the fact that it&#x27;s anti tangle. since my hair is long and straight it is always   tangly and i loved how i could run my fingers through my hair without untangling any knots. But i won&#x27;t buy it  again because it is $11 for basically 2 and a half weeks of use. i wash my hair every day (hair one didnt help  with my greasiness either) and because you have to use so much of it every time you wash, you go through the  bottle very fast. i got it 2 and a half weeks ago and now i am out. it sucks considering the price. even though it  is shampoo and conditioner, $11 every two weeks for a not so great shampoo is not worth it. it kinda helped with  frizziness but not any more than a $4 anti frizz shampoo would do. Don&#x27;t bother unless you&#x27;re willing to fork out  a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Hair One is a non-detergent shampoo of comparable quality to Wen but without the high price.  Because the product does not contain detergent, it does not lather like shampoo but is much gentler on the hair.  I have fine hair and was concerned that it would not clean as well as regular shampoo and would leave my hair flat. But I was happy to find that when it was rinsed off, my hair was just as squeaky clean as with shampoo. The Cucumber and Aloe for Normal Hair has a pleasant, slightly minty scent.  I have been using this product for three months so far and do not plan to go back to regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I first bought Wen some years ago and after having surgery and then losing lots of hair and the condition of what remained I tried it again.  Instantly my hair looked fuller and felt better than it had in ages.  The cost being the major deterrent, I started searching out alternatives.  Hair One, having both positive and negative reviews seemed to be at least worth the try.  And in some ways I suppose it was.  But after just one use (and no, you cannot convince me try again!) my hair was dry, frizzy and a total mess.  I have baby fine hair that with Wen can go as many as 3 or 4 days between shampooing.  With Hair One I was desperate to climb back into the shower immediately.  Which under ordinary circumstances I would have done but my trial was ill-fated as we were also in a power outage and I had just used the remaining hot water for an entire week.  This wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem with Wen incidentally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, save your pennies and splurge unless you are one of the few who actually have good results.  Hair One is not for me.</li>
    <li> If you like Wen, you will love Hair One!  I used Wen Cleansing Conditioner for 9 months before I finally discovered an inexpensive, comparable, alternative...Hair One!  Hair One has the SAME ingredients as Wen, so there is no reason not to switch!  The main reason I love it....all my life I have had \\&quot;bedhead\\&quot;.  There was no way I could get a brush through my hair after getting out of bed.  I was forced to wash and condition my hair before I could leave the house. NO MORE! I get up in the morning and for the first time in my life, I can brush a few tangles out and GO! No need to wash/condition my hair EVERY day!  I have normal to oily...fine to medium, shoulder length hair. Hair One leaves my hair clean, tangle free, soft, and manageable....need I say more?  The main thing to remember when using either of these products...before you get out of the shower...RINSE your hair well.  I have gotten the best results when I use COOL water at the end of my rinsing routine.  I normally don&#x27;t \\&quot;do\\&quot; reviews, but the reviews I read on Hair One before I decided to buy it, helped me make my decision, so I thought it only fair that I attempt to help someone else. The only suggestion I would have for the makers of Hair One...give us some more \\&quot;scent\\&quot; options.  Cucumber and Aloe is great, but I&#x27;d love to try some others for my hair type!  And P.S.  16oz of Wen is $28 unless you find it somewhere on sale.  Hair One is $11.99 for 12oz (and you use less per hair washing then Wen) at AMAZON! Shipping starts at $3.88...the more you buy, the less the shipping charge per bottle! GO HAIR ONE!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy who wears my hair very long and was looking for a good hair care product. Hair One looked promising. I do not use any other hair products, dies, dressings, etc in my hair.    At first, I really liked the effect it had on my hair. Very smooth. No roughness. That lasted about a month.    Fairly quickly it became evident that Hair One was causing a heavy buildup on my hair. Snarls became worse than ever. The sheen was gone and my hair was dull and ratty looking. My hair kept getting heavier and heavier as the buildup continued. After about 3 months of using the product, I decided to stop using it and switch to the Aussie products. In about a week the buildup was gone and my hair was feeling and looking great again.    I have so many regrets about trying this product. At least I can warn others of my experience.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to compare it with Wen because I wanted to find an alternative that was cheaper. It is a different product. It feels like you have to use a lot more than the ton you have to use with Wen to achieve the same effects. It does clean the hair well if you use it correctly. It is a good alternative, but definitely not a replacement. You will probably end up spending the same amount of money on this as Wen to get the desired softness and manageability.</li>
    <li> I tried wen and loved the softness of my hair afterward but still found the need to wash my hair daily. With the cost of wen, I can&#x27;t afford to use it everyday. Came across Hair One when doing research online for wen. I have a Sally&#x27;s Beauty nearby and to my surprise, they had trial size packets of Hair One and the sign said \\&quot;compare to wen.\\&quot; They didn&#x27;t have the trial size of Cucumber Aloe, so I tried the Jojoba since my hair is color treated. I really liked it and figured that even if I still need to wash everyday like with the wen, at least it&#x27;s a lot cheaper (about $10 for 12 oz vs nearly $30 for 16 oz). So I went back and bought a bottle of the Jojoba and one of the Cucumber Aloe. I tried the Cuke today and love it. Better yet, I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s hair. Her hair had been looking very dull. She&#x27;s only 9 but I wanted to see what it did for her. Even my husband commented on the difference in her hair. It&#x27;s shiny and her natural wave is back. My hair is soft and shiny too. And I don&#x27;t have to wash it every day. It&#x27;s less oily than when I used the wen.  I would say before resorting to expensive wen, give this a try! So worth it!</li>
    <li> I have used Hair One for over a month and for the most part I have really enjoyed the way the Hair One has left my hair. However, it does keep my hair a bit oily, so I limit my use once a week *like a deep conditioner* and my hair has never been healthier.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thick, oily hair, and need to wash it daily or it looks greasy and horrible.  I have considered Wen, but at that price, it just wasn&#x27;t feasible.  Hair One seemed like a good way to try out the concept before breaking the bank as it is a similar product.    I chose the product for &#x27;normal&#x27; hair, and also got a sample of the product for &#x27;color treated&#x27; hair, as there wasn&#x27;t an option for oily hair.  My first thought was that the bottle is rather small for the price.  My second thought was that the shampoo smelled horrible!  But I followed the directions... pump, pump, pump, pump... at this rate, that little bottle will be gone in no time. I slathered, combed through, rinsed, etc. according to directions, then blow-dried my hair as usual.  It looked awesome and felt great.  For about two hours.  After that, my hair started getting flat, and by mid-afternoon, it looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in a week.  Gross. I ended up wearing a hat when we went out after work, as my hair looked embarrassing. I thought perhaps I hadn&#x27;t rinsed my hair well enough and tried again the next day.  Same thing.  I tried the color-treated sample, and that yielded the same results and smelled just as bad, if not worse.    I have since determined that the only way this keeps my hair looking decent is to wash my hair with a regular shampoo first, then use the Hair One as a &#x27;conditioner&#x27; then rinse.  And I can only do it once or twice a week or I look like a grease ball by the end of the day.  So NOT what I expected of this product.  If your hair is greasy enough to need to be washed daily, I think a regular shampoo will yield far better results. And even if you have nice-looking hair, it still smells like rotten vegetables.  I will not be buying this again.  I&#x27;m not even sure I can make myself use the rest of the bottle and may just toss it out.</li>
    <li> I use the Cucumber Aloe conditioning cleanser on my scalp, and the Dry Hair w/ olive oil for the \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; step. Love the way this stuff makes my hair looks. Don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to traditional shampooing if I don&#x27;t absolutely have to. My hair looks shiny, strong, and thick. Have never seen my hair look this good before. Plus, my hair stays clean for 2-3 days... that never used to happen with shampoo. Always thought I had an oily scalp. Can&#x27;t compare it to Wen, have never tried it. I&#x27;m not tempted to either, because this price is so much more reasonable at about half the cost and produces amazing results. For those who mention a greasy appearance, it might be that 1. there&#x27;s a lack of thorough rinsing, or 2. the need to blow dry, brush, and style. I noticed my hair looking greasy (but not feeling greasy -- rather it felt \\&quot;piece-y\\&quot; as if too much hair gel was present) if I let it just air dry. But when I blow out my hair, it looks multitudes better than w/ traditional shampooing and conditioning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly unimpressed with Hair One.    I&#x27;ve been using Wen for a few months, but I decided to try this because of the price difference and favorable reviews.  After a week, my hair is very dry and it feels like there&#x27;s already some product build-up.   I&#x27;ve had better results with leading conditioner brands (i.e. Pantene, Dove).   The scent is also a bit off-putting.    I&#x27;ll likely finish the bottle I purchased, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy Hair One again.</li>
    <li> Wow is all I can say. I&#x27;ve been looking for a cheaper conditioning cleanser than Wen. I can&#x27;t afford Wen in this economy of high gas prices. To save money I searched for a similar product. I found Hair One. I purchased it at a Sally Beauty Supply shop and used it right away. It&#x27;s almost exactly the same as Wen. It&#x27;s a quarter of the price of Wen! I even tried Biolage an expensive shampoo/conditioner found at drug stores and it was horribly heavy on my hair. Hair One left my hair light and soft just like Wen. I want everyone to buy Hair One so that they won&#x27;t stop making it. lol I can&#x27;t afford Wen. Hair One is a life saver for me. I use it as a conditioner and my hair feels better than when I use any other conditioner. Hair One is awesome ^.^</li>
    <li> I have never tried Wen the product this is supposed to be just like, so I can not speak to that part. However this product is horrible! My hair felt dirty and gross after using it. I gave it a few tries following the directions and was VERY unhappy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It&#x27;s only a fraction of the cost you pay for Wen. I recommend it to all my friends!!</li>
    <li> It seems to cleanse and condition ok in one step, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  It smells terrible, like vicks kind of.  It also dried my hair out slightly.  I like Bed Head Superstar Shampoo and Conditioner WAY better.</li>
    <li> My hair is color-treated, fine and long.  Hair One is a great product if you do not want to pay the price for WEN.  My hair has allot of lift/volume when using this product as well as it does a great job managing the knots that get under my fine hair.  I am a WEN user and think it is a bit more luxurious in its texture than Hair One.  But, Hair One basically does the same job and my hair color does not fade when using this product, just like WEN.  If I feel like splurging on a new scent, I will buy WEN but, I like saving money, too and this will be my basic go-to shampoo.  My hair feels much healthier when using this product.  Try it...you will like it.  Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply sells it if you have a local store near you and do not want to pay the shipping cost.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and I really love this shampoo. I am a black woman with natural 4a hair, and this product does wonders for my hair. It cleanses it without drying out my hair, which is really important because I have dry hair. Regular shampoos always just strips my  hair of all its moisture. I put my hair in about 6 or 7  twists and use 1-2 pumps per twist. After that I let the product sit on my hair for about 30-40 minutes,then I rinse. After Im done rinsing I am left with moisturized soft curls, then I style and go. (side note I brought this product from my local Sally&#x27;s for $11.00)</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I love the WEN so much, but wanted to save money.  Don&#x27;t waste you time on this.  It left my hair feeling like straw - nothing like the smooth, silky feeling of the WEN. Right out of the bottle it was a different texture and was a complete disappointment</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used Wen, but this stuff works fantastically if done right.     You want to squeeze out any excess water from your hair before applying so that it can penetrate better and leave it on as long as you can afford for the best results. I usually just wet my head, apply it and go about doing things for awhile before I even get in the shower, I am constantly amazed by how soft and shiny it makes my hair. I also use a tiny bit of Shikai&#x27;s henna highlighting shampoo and conditioner because I love the shine it creates and removes any buildup the Hair One might cause.     It does seem to get used up quickly, I have to buy a bottle every couple of months, I really wish they had a subscription offer on here for this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try Wen products, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay that much for a product that I would go through so quickly (my hair is between my bra strap and my butt). It&#x27;s straight, thick but fine, and I bleach it every 3 weeks. I&#x27;ve noticed in the last year or so that when I wake up in the morning, it&#x27;s very tangled...and it never used to be. I used to work in a salon, and I tried everything out there, and I haven&#x27;t had any horrible issues...my hair just tends to get a little greasy at the roots and dry at the ends. I always used a lot of conditioner, and didn&#x27;t totally rinse it out from the ends so it wouldn&#x27;t get so tangled. So, I tried the cucumber Hair One, and it&#x27;s really neat! I thought initially that my hair felt a little stripped in the shower, but I just followed the directions, and it came out beautifully. I combed it with no problem at all, I let it air dry that night, and when I woke up this morning, it was clean, soft, shiny, and it wasn&#x27;t tangled! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> This product works differently for different hair.  Normally it takes me 15 minutes or more to comb my daughter&#x27;s hair in the morning because it is so tangled.  I started using this shampoo on her hair a few days ago (I have only used it twice so far).  Now the comb goes through her hair so easily and her hair is so soft and full of body.  It is great not to have her complain about it hurting when I comb her hair.  However, I used it once and my hair was oily, flat, and limp after one use.  I know I rinsed well.  I went back to using miracle 2 because it is the only thing that keeps my hair from being oily and gives my hair body.  I gave 4 stars because it works so well on my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on vacation when I couldn&#x27;t locate sulfate free shampoo. I have thick, easy to curl gray hair. This product makes my hair as soft and manageable as the combination of pricey \\&quot;salon\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t negate the need for a bit of shiner or gel in humid conditions.It seems to treat my hair gently and clean well.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, but for me, it really didnt work any better than good old shampoo and conditioner.  My hair type: Curly, goes down to about my bust area, and i straighten it every day.     Pros: Took away some of my frizz, tingly feeling on scalp  Cons: Expencive for the ammount you get, takes too long and too much work, didnt mosturize my hair enough, caused a lot of my hair strands to come out :(    Honestly I would not buy this product again, it didnt really do ANYTHING for my hair and there are a lot of really good shampoos and conditioners out there that are better than this product.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be the knock-off to wen haircare. if you have ever used wen, do not try this product. wen leaves your hair silky as this will leave your hair feeling like straw. lacks the conditioner element. MUST use a leave in conditioner on top of using this product</li>
    <li> I like this very much!!  My hair is clean and it works just as well as Wen but a lot more affordable. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted the WEN shampoo but found the price to be ridiculously expensive.  Although this is expensive, it is worth it after one use.  I am pregnant and suffer from very dry and itchy scalp and dry, course long hair.  Since I enjoy my long hair and so does my husband, I needed to do something to keep it manageable.  I had tried all sorts of dandruff treatments for the dry scalp to no avail, as well as moisturizing formulas for dry hair in the shampoo aisle.  I had tried salon brands as well as store brands, all with poor results.  This shampoo leaves my scalp feeling as though it is healing:  comfortable and not itchy for several days after washing.  I do not wash everyday; perhaps every two or three with my long, dry hair, and there is no greasy feel with Hair One.  I will continue to use this product, and it is available at my local Sally as well if I run out.  I say it is great for the whole family because my two year old daughter has suffered with very extreme cradle cap since six months old; we applied the shampoo ONCE and her father used a fine-toothed comb after working the shampoo through the hair and scalp for about five minutes - the cradle cap was COMPLETELY removed painlessly and almost effortlessly in this single application!  For those of you who have experienced this with your babies, it sure beats the old baby oil and cotton ball treatment, which tends to make the cradle cap worse and causes the baby a lot of discomfort as you scrub the head with a toothbrush trying to remove the dandruff!  This is also recommended for men and women as a shave cream although I have not tried it yet.  So far, I am very impressed after using this for two weeks - I have ordered more and in different formulations to try.  Worth every penney.</li>
    <li> I am black and I bought this product from Sally&#x27;s. I just used it on my husband\\&quot;s long natural hair and it worked Great! When I finished washing his hair it was soft and very managable and it really detangled his hair even his beard was soft! I was able to comb right through his hair without having to use a detangler and when I blow dried it there was basically no hair in the comb and that never happens! Cant wait to use it on my hair.Im sold!</li>
    <li> GREAT product! Why spend so much more on other name brands such as WEN...when this stuff does the trick for SO much less.</li>
    <li> it smells great, but there isn&#x27;t nearly enough conditioner.  I have fine, thin hair, but curly and there&#x27;s still not enough conditioning power.  Too bad because it smells good and has an awesome cooling tingle.</li>
    <li> This is an alcohol based product and nothing like WEN!!  It dried my hair out and split my ends on freshly cut hair.  I straighten my hair a couple of times a week and have found that it has left my hair crunchy and not silky smooth like WEN does.  It leave my hair feeling goopy, unlike WEN which leaves my hair smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews that said this was just as good as Wen. Unfortunately I have to disagree. This product doesn&#x27;t compare to Wen and although it is cheaper there are a few reasons why that is the case. First, it is much thinner than Wen, it&#x27;s as if someone had watered it down which made it impossible to achieve the same results at all but you need to use more product for it to even be remotely effective. Also, the smallest bottle of Wen is 16 oz. compared to the 12 watery ounces you get in this bottle. The product barely has a smell which me be pleasing to others but I like a nice smelling shampoo/conditioner so that my hair smells good all day while I&#x27;m at work.&lt;br /&gt;While I was initially excited that this would save me a lot of money and do the job just as well sadly I was very unhappy with the product and I did try for quite some time to see the results so I&#x27;m not judging based on one or two times of use.&lt;br /&gt;I am now back on my Wen and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I love this product, my hair is very healthy.  Give it a little time, it works great.  I don&#x27;t use nearly as much as the directions suggest, even with long hair.  Definitely not going back to shampoo!!</li>
    <li> I discovered this Wen knockoff over a year ago.  It cleans your hair and leaves it soft and shiny.  My only complaint is that I have to use a regular shampoo once a week or I get a buildup on my hair.</li>
    <li> Although the product uses the same mechanism to cleasnse your hair, it dries the hair out much the same way commercial shampoo does. Works great as a conditioner on my aussie&#x27;s coat!</li>
    <li> I was somewhat disappointed in this product.  I&#x27;ve found that my hair can&#x27;t tolerate it alone.  Using it as a cleansing conditioner stripped my hair and made it horribly frizzy.  However, when combined with other products, it does make my hair wonderfully glossy.  The only practical use I&#x27;ve found for this is to help stretch my expensive Aveda products.  I start out by slathering on about six pumps of this product, comb through, and then shampoo my scalp with a small amount of Aveda Smooth Infusion shampoo.  I then rinse that off, and mix my Aveda Smooth Infusion conditioner with six pumps of Hair One.  I comb this through my hair, continue with my shower, and rinse it out at the end.  I then follow that up with my usual Aveda Smooth Infusion Style Prep or Nexxus Pro-Mend and blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again?  Probably.  It&#x27;s an inexpensive way to moisturize my hair while stretching my expensive products.  Time will prove if this is actually cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/14/2012 (updated rating from 3* to 1*):&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given up on this product.  The waxy buildup is just too much for my hair.  I had to buy a bottle of Prell to strip off the nasty waxy feeling.  It took 2-3 washes to get it all out.  This stuff is just gross.  Avoid if your scalp is remotely oily.</li>
    <li> I am caucasion with mildly course hair that is curly and tends to frizz in humid weather.  This product does well with the first wash but with consecutive washes, it just makes my hair look like it needs a wash instead of making it look clean and silky.  It does work much better than the Wen Almond&amp; Mint for me.  I have a friend who uses the Wen and her hair always looks fabulous so I think if your hair is compatible with it, then it&#x27;s great.  I say get a small bottle of it and just see how it works with your hair, then if it does, go for it.</li>
    <li> My hair was fine with the shampoo I was using, but QVCC sucked me in to believing the Wen products so I decided to try this. It was terrible. I only used it twice and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN and found this to be a likely alternative so I ordered it.  My husband has been using it and likes it very much. I still prefer the other.</li>
    <li> If I could give this negative stars, I would.  It completely dried out my hair, my hair feels like straw right now, its frizzy and horrible AND less than 24 hours later, its oily at the roots.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used an entire large bottle of Wen and never got the magic it promised.  However my hair did start getting thicker and growing super fast. My hairdresser even noticed and has to trim my hair to conceal the growth.  Some of you hated Wen or Hair One but I will say when you first try the no poo approach your hair WILL look like crap for about a week.  It shocks your hair and then the turn around will be amazing.  This Cucumber is the best one to me and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I have baby fine curly hair that I naturally straighten.  My hair  is thick despite it&#x27;s fine texture.  I have noticed increased volume and body in my hair and now I can even see the top 4 inches of my hair look much healthier.  I can&#x27;t wait till all my hair growth is from Hair One.  Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it and you can use less than they recommend.  I have hair just past my shoulders and I use about 10-12 pumps.  I know that sounds absurd but when you see it in your hand it&#x27;s not really that much.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I heard about Wen Hair Care but it was beyond my price range. So when I found Hair One I was ecstatic. It was half the price of Wen and was said to be as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and bought the Cucumber Aloe. First, let me say that it is great. The smell isn&#x27;t very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem I have is that it is a very small bottle and you have to use a lot. Also, it did make my hair feel soft and clean, but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it is very good for the price. It does what they say it does and you just have to follow the instructions. I really like it. But honestly, it isn&#x27;t as good as the shampoo that I normally use, Herbal Essences. That works great. It smells awesome and makes my hair feel and look good. And it stays nice for up to three or four days whereas the Hair One is only a day, maybe two. It just doesn&#x27;t feel the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, I am actually surprised not to see more good reviews.  Perhaps it suits my hair well and not others, or perhaps others haven&#x27;t used it long enough to get results.  If you have oily hair, it does feel different to the shampoos you are used to, but once you realize this, it is fine.  Normally, I have to wash 3 times in a row, then my hair feels really dry and &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; - stripped of natural oils but still feeling kind of greasy at times.  After about 24-36 hours, it is very oily again, needing to be washed again.  With hair one, after one application as directed, my hair is soft, moisturised but not greasy.  A different feeling from what I am used to, but it is how my hair should feel.  I now go 2-3 days before washing again, and don&#x27;t get a greasy/ producty build up, but I make sure to rinse really well (about 30-45 secs) and don&#x27;t use any as a leave in conditionder.  Some people have said they need to use heaps.  I only use 6 pumps, but I have fine, short hair (just above my shoulders) so I can see that others may need to use more.  All I can say is that it works great for my hair type, and I love it.  I have been using it for about 3 months, and am just reordering now.  I love it, and will never go back to regular shampoo, despite the high shipping costs to me in Australia.</li>
    <li> I was desperate for something to change the texture of my dry hair. For the last 3 years I have had a lot of stress and it really affected my hair. Not to mention all the blow-drying, straightening, and curling I&#x27;ve subjected my hair to over the years. I have always been into more natural products so when I heard about this, I was anxious to try it. I saw some reviews that said it made your hair fall out so I was a little nervous at first. When I tried it, I loved it. My hair felt softer than I could remember (although a lot of hair did come out during the washing process). I was weary of continuing because a lot of hair was coming out during the washing process but I decided to stick with it, and I am so glad that I did! After about a week or two, my hair stopped falling out during the washing process completely and it stimulated hair growth because my hair is much fuller now and so much softer and shinier. I look at it as weeding out the weak hairs to make room for the stronger, healthier hairs that will come in. My only &#x27;complaint&#x27; would be that the process of washing the hair takes a while but then again good things come to those who wait! I am so thankful that a product like this is available for such a great price. I will never go back to traditional shampoo. I will be buying this forever!</li>
    <li> I love Wen conditioning cleaner; my hair was always great looking when I used it, full of body, and kept my style well, and I have thinning hair so that was great! But I had to stop using it because of the price, and my hair hasn&#x27;t been the same since.  Just a couple of days ago I discovered Hair One in Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store and tried it since it looked comparable to Wen...and it is!!!  I&#x27;m loving the way my hair looks again! Soft and shiny, but fully of body and bounce.  At about $1 an ounce, this is my hair&#x27;s new best friend.</li>
    <li> My hair is somewhat thick and is normal to dry, and I color it at least once a month though it&#x27;s not completely damaged-but it can feel a bit coarse. I have not tried Wen, so I can&#x27;t compare to Hair One, however, my experience with this product has been good so far.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the last three days and my hair has been softer than usual and has more volume! At first I tried it just as a cleanser/conditioner and I did get sort of a straw like feel that the other reviewers were talking about but the next day I also used it as a leave in conditioner and it was a lot better. The hair can feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; after a day but at the same time still feel clean?! but that doesn&#x27;t bother me as I usually wash my hair every day anyways. I know with Wen, one of its goals is for you to not have to wash your hair everyday, but it&#x27;s not much of a concern to me. I still really like it. I say this product is worth a try and it&#x27;s worked just fine for me.</li>
    <li> I love the Hair One and what it does to my hair... this is my story...  I am in my 50&#x27;s and felt like my hair was thinning.  A friend recommended the Wen product and I loved it. My hair looked great and felt thicker and healthier. People began to comment that my hair looked nice.  I was sold!     I bought some for my daughter, and she also loved it,  Then she went on line and found a similar product, Hair One.  We both ordered some and did our own comparison test - they both gave us the same great results but the Hair One is less than 1/3 the cost.   That was a no brain-er - we both switched to Hair One.      The Wen is great but why would anyone spend 3 times the money for the same results?    My mother - in her 80&#x27;s- was having problems with dry scalp so she tried the Hair One and loved it, too. Then we found they make a product for dry scalp that was only a couple of dollars more and it seems to have solved all her problems.    If you have been thinking of trying this type of product, I would highly recommend Hair One.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Just like the much more expensive &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; product!  Love love love my hair!!!!  Color stays longer and hair is extremely soft and healthy!  If you are considering Wen, please consider this instead!</li>
    <li> i still have it and im still using it it tells you how many pumps to use and such but it think you should you use as much as you think you need... and my hair feels nice it cleans and does wat its supposed to do but my hair doesnt feel supper soft or nething thing its no big deal but yea if u want a good co-wash you should get this but 1 quick tip make sure u wet for hair for like almost a minute and this will work well</li>
    <li> I have used Wen for years, but now that I am retired I was trying to tighten my budget without losing quality.  This is much less than the WEN and I think it actually works better.</li>
    <li> HairOne conditioning shampoo is similar to Wen.  However, the texture of this product is not as thick.  You need to use more product for better results.  Also HairOne does not have additional products in their line.  All in all it is a decent product and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I had seen the infomercials for WEN and I admit that I wanted to try it, but when I looked on line and saw the price tag...ouch! I&#x27;m a working mother and could not justify spending that much for shampoo. So I gave up on trying that. Then someone at work suggested that I try this and WOW!!!! I could not be more happy with it. I followed the directions exactly and I have the hair I&#x27;ve always wanted. I have short hair that is incredibly thick and with just enough wave to make it super frizzy. I usually took 20 minutes to straighten and get all the &amp;#34;frizziness&amp;#34; under control. After blow drying my hair, I noticed a huge difference. The wave was there but the frizziness was gone! It only took 10 minutes to straighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t in love with the smell, but when my hair was dry, I couldn&#x27;t even smell it. Not that it was bad, I just tend to like sweet floral scents and this definitely isn&#x27;t like that. It would be great if you are sensitive to strong smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love, this is an amazing product and for 1/3rd the price of WEN, I am thrilled with it!!!</li>
    <li> This was my first hair one product, and i really love it.  I find that I do get buildup after a few days and need to use a regular shampoo though.  Its a good cheap alternative to Wen for sure!</li>
    <li> It actually works. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a cleansing conditioner product and I&#x27;m satisfied, it&#x27;s worth trying. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my hair which has dry ends.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo, without sulfates so it&#x27;s much better for your hair.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this item, but as a tip for all of you who have experienced buildup...this product contains amodimethicone fairly high up the ingredient list. For those who don&#x27;t know, silicones coat the hair shaft, and are not water soluble, meaning, they can&#x27;t be rinsed off with just water, so they build up in the hair, causing that greasy, heavy feeling, or the frizzy, dried out feeling. You need a sulfate, or a low-poo containing coco-betaine to remove it. So if you want to use this product, go for it! Just know that you should shampoo or low-poo once a week or so to prevent buildup.</li>
    <li> Worst product I have ever used!!! This stuff just does not rinse out right. I used it for a week and everytime I used it I had to go back in to re-rinse it. If I could give 0 stars I would. The buildup is also horrible after just two uses. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> not as expected when is better</li>
    <li> I am sold on Hair One and Wen products . . . but will stay with Hair One because of the price and accessibility at Sally stores. I have long, wavy permed Asian hair and these two products are the only things that keep my curls looking great. No bedhead either. I actually do not need to use all the pumps of product they recommend . . . the key for me has been distributing it well and having the patience to leave it in for 15 minutes. I just use a few pumps and leave it in after the shower and I wake up with frizz free curls. Hair One costs as much as the SLS free shampoos plus conditioner.</li>
    <li> i was on the fence about trying a conditioner wash due to not easiest to manage hair,, i color/highlight on purpose bc i hv lots and lots of thin hair that when perfectly healthy is very straight, no body, and feels dirty by end of day. damaging it a bit gave it body.. but age, stress or whatever has caused one section on top right to thin out and its been breaking off like crazy past few yrs. saw a wen promo on tv, started researching and found a less expensive way to test it out.    i&#x27;m very happy with Hair One after one week. while this product makes it feel healthy, really soft and a bit thicker, i have body with less product,, just need to fluff it with finger tips every so often (also switched to wood comb and boar hair brush). i&#x27;m hoping it continues to do well for me after several months and mostly hoping to see if thin spots thicken up     thinking if i get buildup, i wash it once in a while with my bumble n bumble gentle shampoo. i also like the way it tingles on the scalp and smell isn&#x27;t overbearing, rather clean smelling. it hasn&#x27;t added to morning get ready time either; i hop in shower, get hair wet, work it thru, clip it up, shave, etc,, then rinse it out at very end (i swear my skin in general is softer too!) i plan to continue use or will update this if issues come up after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> I needed more  moisture  for my gray hair this shampoo has help a lot  I have more body and shine</li>
    <li> Amazing hair product! I washed my thick hair (only) with this cleansing conditioner and wow. I did exactly what the directions said and my hair was completely different! I showered at night, so I had to wait until morning for my delightful surprise. My hair was so great! The texture was amazing, and it just set so well (as if I used a blow dryer to make it look that way)! I do regularly have dry hair (with an oily scalp) yet if I don&#x27;t wash my hair every other day it does get OILY. So I was worried to buy this product since I thought it would be more like a conditioner, but I was wrong. It does not leave a coating on your hair (if you wash it out VERY well). And, it def. washes your hair and it feels 100% clean after you use it. If I go in the shower with oily hair, this product will wash it All out, no problem. My hair was completely oil-free after using this. Agian, I can&#x27;t even tell you how great this product is......  And the best part is, I saw this huge change after the first time I used it!</li>
    <li> I have been using One for the last 4 days and I am absolutely sold on this product !! My hair looks absolutely wonderful and feels better than it has in a very long time ! I tried to use a little as a leave in conditioner the first day I used it and didn&#x27;t like the results I got, so I don&#x27;t do that anymore. It made my hair feel dirty and weighed down.  I find that I don&#x27;t need a leave in conditioner at all anyway . The longer I use it , the better my hair looks and feels. Just be sure to leave it on long enough, and follow the directions on the bottle. I will be ordering another bottle soon !!! LOVE IT !!!!</li>
    <li> While researching Wen reviews several people mentioned Hair One, so I searched out other blogs online &amp; found the same reviews mentioning how great this product works &amp; that it is really a wonderful comparison to Wen at half the price. Sally Beauty Supply does carry this product, yet finding it in stock can be an issue. Our local store manager told me lots of people come in for Hair One &amp; it&#x27;s hard to keep it stocked. Amazon is my back up if I can&#x27;t get any locally. Either way the price is great compared to Wen. My hair is thinning, color treated, natural curly down to my waist. I do not use heat or styling products. Over time using chemicals, perms &amp; styling aids with heat my hair started thinning, so I&#x27;ve adopted a more natural approach &amp; use several oils on my hair, along with Hair One. The results are great and for the price its worth a try. Everything builds up in my hair over time, so I use Garnier, they have a \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; shampoo &amp; conditioner that contain no silicone to remove buildup. That works great, or else I have used the one by Paul Mitchel that removes everything, just once a month.</li>
    <li> I thought I knew how to use this, so the first time I used it, I did it my way.  Just put some on, rubbed it around, rinsed it out. It did not work well AT ALL.  But, before giving up, I decided to try actually doing what it said on the bottle.  The only complaint is that the writing is so small. Or maybe I am just old and not seeing as well as I used to, haha. At any rate, once I followed the instructions, I was very pleased with the results.  I have never used the WEN cleansing conditioner, but I am extremely satisfied with the Hair One, and cannot see how the WEN could possibly be any better.  I love the mint in it - gently cools your scalp. The scent is not awesome or anything, but is not bad.</li>
    <li> After purchasing Wen and LOVING the results, I searched online for a cheaper alternative and found Hair One.  I read a ton of reviews every place I could so I decided to give Hair One a try.    Meh.    Hair One is definitely cheaper per bottle than Wen, but one of the main problems I faced was the fact that Hair One has more water than Wen.  Wen is one of the thickest, creamiest products I&#x27;ve used.  Hair One was obviously more watery and as a result I had to use at least three times as much Hair One to get it through my hair.    Air drying my hair, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference with Hair One and Wen (my hair is wavy/curly), but blow drying it straight I noticed a HUGE difference.  In order to replicate the same silky hair I achieved with Wen, I had to use two additional Aveda styling products with the Hair One, and it still didn&#x27;t get as soft or silky as my hair did on Wen.    Besides the fact that it&#x27;s an inferior product, I don&#x27;t see how it would really save you money if you have to use three times as much Hair One product compared to Wen.  I&#x27;ll finish up the Hair One, but I&#x27;ll definitely not purchase it again.  I&#x27;m sticking with Wen.</li>
    <li> I tried the Hair One first and liked it but it made my hair feel like straw. There was no way I could use it and not use after conditioner. I used it for about 3 weeks. Now I have the Wen and it is AMAZING. My 50 year old hair feels 20 again. In my experience the products are not even comparable.</li>
    <li> So I lived in Texas for 15 years.  The biggest worry about my hair was managing the frizz. It was curly and poofy, so I would put stuff like Matrix curly or Aveda curly in it. I moved to Califormia and found if I use the same product it would make my hair greasy.  When I stopped using it my hair was flat and wispy, constantly getting in my face. There was no volume what so ever. So I started using volumizing mousse, shampoo and conditioner. While my hair was ok, the volume was stiff.  My hair didn&#x27;t have the softness it used to. So I read about Wen. I thought I might give in and buy it, but decided to read reviews instead. That is how I found this product.  I went to Sally and got this and the volumizing spray. I used it today and let it air dry. Wow! My hair was bouncy and soft after the first time.  My hair color was enhanced and it was shinny.  I think the red high lights in my hair came out even more.  It is a good product and I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen faithfully for 18 months and will never go back to traditional shampoo.  I was hoping for a less expensive alternative but am disappointed in this product.  It left my fine, shoulder length, colored treated hair dry and frizzy.  This product may be a step up from shampoo but Wen is still far better.  Might be good for those looking to use a similar product on children who do not have damage from the salon/heat styling.  Wen is sold as a more natural approach to cleansing but this product has a pearlescent quality to it meaning the manufacturer is adding chemicals that are not needed.</li>
    <li> I used Wen before and loved it but didn&#x27;t like the price so I tried this as an alternative. I expected it to be different, not as good, from Wen but I didn&#x27;t expect to hate it. I tried it for over a week and it was awful! I have soft, straight, hair that is prone to get oily but this stuff had my hair limp and greasy looking right after I showered! It left a greasy build up and it literally took two washes to get all the weird oily feeling from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super unhappy that this one didn&#x27;t work and now I just have an expensive cream to shave my legs with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only plus might be the smell and if you have very dry hair maybe but it didn&#x27;t even work well with my daughter&#x27;s curlier hair.</li>
    <li> I have never used Wen but bought this after watching some YouTube videos about how good it is compared to Wen. So I washed my hair once with it and followed all directions and let me curly hair dry naturally! Next day my hair was like straw. Felt like a build up of product was on it :( so I gave it one more chance and decided to blow out my hair. Result: DRY STRAW LIKE HAIR!!! I sware I&#x27;ve gotten better results with regular shampoo!! My hair has never been so dried out ever!!! Totally returning it to Sally&#x27;s!!!! Now to get my hair back to normal!!!!</li>
    <li> I am trying to grow my thin fragile hair out and had been using Wen due to its reputation for being gentle on hair. I was unhappy with the cost of Wen and the fact that my hair always looked flat so I decided to try Hair One (Cucumber and Aloe).  I used Hair One for about 2 weeks. My hair looked flat, dull and just awful.  In fact, it looked so bad that I went into a salon for a conditioning treatment (something I have never done before).  The stylist told me I had horrible build up in my hair and used a stripper to clean my hair (twice) before conditioning it.  My hair now feels and looks great again.  I was really disappointed by this product for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my niece.  She said she really loved this product and that her two daughters wouldn&#x27;t keep their hands off of it.  She wants more.</li>
    <li> Great substitute for the pricier brands of hair shampoo and conditioner in one.  Lasts a long time.  Smells great.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> First 2 uses were wonderful. My hair looked and felt lovely. After that, it was greasy and dirty. Had to break down and use a clarifying shampoo. I will not be using it again.</li>
    <li> A good alternative to Wen at about 1/2 the price.</li>
    <li> hair is not clean after use.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic product.  Not just like Wen, but certainly comparable for the cost.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Wen but because of the price and not being able to buy it locally I was looking for a different product.  I was in Sallys Beauty Supply and found a sample package of the hair ONE. The sample was for \\&quot;normal hair\\&quot;  I used it the following day &amp; was amazed at the results. Absolutely love it! I usually shampoo ever day. But on day two it was still looking great, day three still no frizzies, still have not had to use hairspray.. I have thick, naturally curly red hair, which is frosted.  I also live in Alabama, and the frizz is rediculous. Couldn&#x27;t leave the house without half a can of super duper freeze it in place hairspray, without being frizzy within 30 minutes. I couldn&#x27;t believe that this cleanser got rid of my frizies, but it did.  So on day three I went back to Sallys and got the full size product, but got the type for color treated hair.  Used it tonight and my hair is great.  The color was brighter and the shine is fabulous!  This is no exaggeration. I am 62 years old, so when I say I have tried it all, believe me, I have.  The hair One at Sallys is $25.49 for 33.81 fluid ounces, so you can&#x27;t beat that price!  I don&#x27;t know about the buildup some are talking about, since I have just started using this,  but it will not bother me one bit to have to use good old Prell (told you I was old) or a cup of water with baking soda desolved in it once every week or two to get rid of the build up if that happens. The results I am getting right now is well worth it.</li>
    <li> This product worked pretty well for the first two weeks.  But after about 20 days of using it, it leaves my hair feeling very dry!  This product is no where near as good as Wen!</li>
    <li> I like Wen, but it&#x27;s too expensive and I had read reviews of this product and I tried it and I agree.  It compares to Wen and is a lot cheaper, now if it lasts as long I will love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great great product - its knock off of the WEN hair care product that cost $19.95 for the same 12oz size.  And this price is $3 less than the beauty supply stores sell Hair ONE for !  It shipped free, too.</li>
    <li> I like the l&#x27;oreal cleansing conditioner better than this one but I love this for shaving cream! I will buy it again for that!</li>
    <li> I had to check it out but it&#x27;s not for me.  I like the tingle of aloe on my head and the smell isn&#x27;t bad but I can&#x27;t commit to the time these products want you to spend rubbing on your head in the shower.  Does everyone really spend 10-15 minutes in the shower doing nothing but scrubbing their scalp for this?  I did notice some hair loss when using like other raters have stated but I think it was more my hair getting used to being manipulated so much and not some chemical or problem with the conditioner.  Bottom line for me, I like it as a conditioner and will use it on occasion, and I like it as a leave-in conditioner but I&#x27;m not running up my water bill to stand in the shower.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair heavy, stringy, flat, without its natural curl.  Yes, I rinse and rinse.  Has some nasty ingredients...propylene glycol.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I need very little to work this through my hair. I follow the directions exactly and find my hair is very clean and &amp;#34;springy&amp;#34; afterward. I am one of those who washes her hair just 2-3 times a week. For the record, this bottle has lasted for 5 months. One of the things I like most is the fragrance of the cucumber and aloe. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Spend the extra money and get WEN</li>
    <li> I tried it because I it was suppose to be like Wen Conditioner Cleaner and it left my hair oily and laid down.</li>
    <li> My Granddaughter has such thick hair this really helps with the humidity and all !</li>
    <li> I tried this looking for a Wen substitute, as it is so much cheaper. It worked ok a first, but after a few days I noticed a residue buildup. I figured the Wen answer we always get, \\&quot;Use more!\\&quot; may be the answer. I tried more product to no avail. I could have put up with the chemical-tinged smell, but the cleansing and conditioning value just didn&#x27;t hold up to Wen for me. I did want it to work so badly, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Does sorta work like a poor man&#x27;s (or woman&#x27;s) WEN, but after using it my curly, white girl hair got kinda crunchy.  Me no like.&lt;br /&gt;I think any conditioner would probablly work as well and for less.  In any case, moving on.</li>
    <li> If you are using Wen and love it, you may not like this product. If you are using regular shampoo and wanting to switch to a cleansing conditioner, you might like it. Hair One is ok, but I personally am back to using Wen.</li>
    <li> I love keeping my hair as healthy as possible, but I&#x27;m like everyone else. I&#x27;d like to save a buck or two when I can. I&#x27;ve been using Wen for over a year. It was love at first sight for my hair, but not so much with my wallet. Sooooo...I read the reviews on this product and took a chance because everyone&#x27;s hair reacts differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here is my honest review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair One DOES NOT compare. Let me just say that I didn&#x27;t even make it out of the shower before realizing how much drier my hair felt with Hair One. I turned right around and cleaned my hair with Wen. Bam! The softness was back with avengence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long, thick hair with Wen: One point&lt;br /&gt;Long, thick hair with Hair One: Big fat zero&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work for you, but this just made me realize that YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I will be donating my barely used bottle of Hair One to a friend who isn&#x27;t as fussy as me. :)</li>
    <li> Wen is wayyyy better! Hair one made my hair extremely tangled and i wont be usin it again! Ill stick with wen!!</li>
    <li> Hair One was thin and required more to clean my hair. It left my hair tangled and not smooth like Wen. The ends looked dried and frizzy after drying my hair. I would not reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> works almost like wen, i agree wen is a lil bit thicker but considering the price it is worth it</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff for a month. I followed the instructions to the letter. What I ended up with was the frizziest, least manageable hair I have ever had. By the time I gave up on it, my hair looked like a rusty Brillo pad. I had to use several other products just to try to tame the frizz, but it barely helped. Today, I went back to my regular shampoo and conditioner, Garnier&#x27;s Clean products. My hair looks so much better. I am never using this expensive crap again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how anyone has rated this as good as Wen. This is absolutely awful cleansing conditioner. I picked it up in a beauty supply store and the woman working there promised it was even better than Wen at a fraction of the price. I was really hopeful that this would be true. Yeah, it totally wasn&#x27;t. This stuff made my hair feel like straw. It didn&#x27;t even feel soft while it was in my hair. It felt like cheap hand lotion. Wen makes my hair feel and look great. This Hair One did not. I tossed the bottle and went back to ordering Wen.</li>
    <li> Shampoo that doesn&#x27;t suds..?  This was a bit weird.  Ok, but after sticking with it, even though I was tempted to go back to my regular shampoo because in my mind, if it doesn&#x27;t lather, how can it really do the job??  But it does and my hair looks and feels healthier.  I will say that you have to take a leap of faith and stick to it...do not go back to shampoo no matter what.  This product is not an immediate gratification thing...it takes time and patience.  The pay off is worth it. I even think my hair grows faster now.  Probably because it is over all healthier.  Rub it from scalp to tip...You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, Let it sit for about two minutes before you rinse...Do not use conditioner after.  Rinse really well with a final rinse in cool water.  It took a little over three shampoos to get into it and notice good things, but now I&#x27;m used to it and my hair really is better for it.</li>
    <li> I have been using HAIR ONE for about 2 years now. I like it very much. It cleanses very well and leaves the hair nice and soft. Sometimes I do need a leave in conditioner or oil.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product thinking it was supposed to be like the &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; hair care products. I have to admit that I have never used Wen and now I never will. First off, this stuff STINKS. Very medicinal smell when I opened up the bottle. Second, it takes a LOT of product to use on my hair (long) so I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t last long once I saw the bottle. I used it for one week and my hair was so dry and brittle if I even LOOKED at a brush I would get static cling. My hair alternated from dry to clumpy and oily looking. TERRIBLE PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Our family is really satisfied with this product! We will order even more!</li>
    <li> Worked great for the first 2 weeks. Thereafter it was a downward spiral to dry, frizzy and lifeless hair!! I don&#x27;t plan on buying it again. I&#x27;m using another non-sulfate brand called Hairtrition, which is better than Hair One but still not up to my expectations.</li>
    <li> This hair product is  less expensive than WEN however it&#x27;s better.This company spends its money on a great product not costly advertising..</li>
    <li> Has a light fragrance and rinses out easily.  My hair is shinier and doesn&#x27;t feel oily after using it.&lt;br /&gt;If you like using Wen, you will like Hair One.  Wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> I tried to stick with it.  I have gone through an entire bottle over the last couple of months, trying it off and on, hoping to find the perfect amount to use. I so desperately wanted this to be the hair miracle I&#x27;ve been looking for.  But I&#x27;ve come to accept that this stuff is pure crap.  It leaves my hair SO GREASY, weighed down, and just disgusting.  It makes me look like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in weeks.  Very disappointing and embarrassing.</li>
    <li> My GF only used WEN and she LOVES this so I LOVE it too because it&#x27;s cheaper and she actually says its BETTER</li>
    <li> This product works as well as Wen</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, but not as good as WEN.</li>
    <li> I was using Wen and loving it, but going broke at $40.00 a bottle.  So I decided to give Hair One a try.  I wish thst I had tried before and saved myself a lot of money.  I have wavy hair, down to my waist.  I use about 20 pumps each time that I wash my hair.  It cleans and moisturizes my hair thoroughly.  I leave it on about 3 minutes and then thoroughly wash it off.  Thats it, done.  No complicated wash, rinse, condition, wait and rinse again.  It is very gentle as well.  I can honestly say that it is just as good as Wen, but you wont go broke using it.  It definitely is on my list of favorite things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CraftingMarfa</li>
    <li> Bought it to try instead of the more expensive Wen. It was terrible and left too much residue in my hair. I have now gone back to Wen. Oh well, the price was worth a try!</li>
    <li> To be honest I was disappointed. At first I liked it the first few times I washed it had that wen feel to it now for some reason my hair is so greasy after washing my hair with this. Everyone has different hair so maybe it will work for you.</li>
    <li> I used to buy WEN until a friend told me about Hair One.  I don&#x27;t notice a big difference on my hair between the different types of hair one.  My hair is normal and I guy normal, dry or color treated and they have all worked really well.</li>
