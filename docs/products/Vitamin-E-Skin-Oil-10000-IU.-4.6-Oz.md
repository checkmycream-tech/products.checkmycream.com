<li> This Vitamin E Skin Oil is not pure Vitamin E oil, but actually a blend of Grape Seed Oil, Safflower Oil, and Vitamin E, listed on the label in that order.</li>
<li> helps with my dry skin issues</li>
<li> Also helps with my dry skin.  </li>
<li> Next time I&#x27;ll order the two pack and save myself a few extra $$$ in shipping.</li>
<li> but since I just started using it in the midst of a breakout its hard to tell so far.</li>
<li> The oil was great, but the packaging is terrible.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a combo of a few different oils.</li>
<li> Used it for my skin as moisturizer and to mix within other products.</li>
<li> i recommend this product for dry skin but havent noticed any lightening of dark uneven skin</li>
<li> not the icky sticky gooey oil like regular vitamin e!  </li>
<li> It also leaves a mess when you travel with it, not to mention this wastes a lot of product.</li>
<li> You can tell it&#x27;s vitamin e by how your skin feels a few hours after application.  </li>
<li> (absorbs after just a few minutes, by the time you dress)</li>
<li> (but my forehead is the least acne-prone of my skin compared to the rest of my face)</li>
<li> It leaked out the base of the cap every time I squeezed the tiniest amount into my hand, then it would drip down the side of the bottle when I set it back on the counter.</li>

    <li> This Vitamin E Skin Oil  was also a great buy.</li>
    <li> The oil was great, but the packaging is terrible. It leaked out the base of the cap every time I squeezed the tiniest amount into my hand, then it would drip down the side of the bottle when I set it back on the counter. It also leaves a mess when you travel with it, not to mention this wastes a lot of product.</li>
    <li> She loves how the skin on her stomach feels with this oil. I highly recommend, especially if you are getting this for someone who is pregnant.</li>
    <li> Great for skin, use just a little</li>
    <li> This product keep my skin soft and replenished. I love it.</li>
    <li> The oil leaked into the box and also contaminated the DVD box set shipped with it. Totally unsatisfactory! Returned oil and cost Amazon a replacement dvd set.</li>
    <li> helps with my dry skin issues</li>
    <li> good,  like it very much</li>
    <li> I was searching for something light and fragrance free to replace the discontinued Safeway brand I&#x27;ve used for years.  This arrived today (arrived very very fast too I might add) and it fits the bill perfectly.  This oil is very light and I can&#x27;t tell any difference whatsoever in this oil and the Safeway brand oil.  This order was a trial to see if I even liked the product.  Next time I&#x27;ll order the two pack and save myself a few extra $$$ in shipping.</li>
    <li> Smooth and goes on easy.  No smell at all.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality, smooth and easy to apply with ess.oils.</li>
    <li> The product was a fair price and seemed to be of good quality compared to other vitamin E skin oils</li>
    <li> I have been using this for after shave and my skin feels and looks great. Definitely worth the buy. Great</li>
    <li> Good product.  Oil very nice!  It is pure vitamin eye, which I like it us not a mixture of oils..</li>
    <li> Very nice oil, will buy again</li>
    <li> Not for hair use because it leaves hair looking but not feeling oily. I have very itchy skin and was hoping this would help but did not. I am not only going to use it as a &amp;#34;hair mask.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> this vitamin e oil is great for your face!  not the icky sticky gooey oil like regular vitamin e!  no, the 10,000 IU is lighter and will make your skin look wonderful.</li>
    <li> You ideally want an oil that is not mineral based (like baby oil). Grapeseed and safflower oils are excellent not only for cooking but also for your skin. They are light and virtually odorless and are easily absorbed. Vitamin E is also important for the skin but not too high a concentration. Just put this on after your bath/shower, it will keep your skin moisturized even during the winter months. (absorbs after just a few minutes, by the time you dress)</li>
    <li> Great for my skin after sx</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and it works perfectly on it. I use it on my face and body. Will be ordering another bottle soon since i am getting help using it lol.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this product to me.  I use faithfully every night and am experiencing great results.  My surgery scars and fading and so are my stretch marks.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> Great value on a good product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Used it for my skin as moisturizer and to mix within other products.</li>
    <li> I mix it with my daily body lotion and it does make my skin very soft.  But I&#x27;m not sure if it will get rid of any marks or fade scars like pure vitamin E is supposed to do.  The seller also did not package it well and it was leaking all through the box when it arrived.</li>
    <li> Very nice product for the face and body I will recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I will also make a comment on the price.</li>
    <li> I used this on an extremity, in the shower. It became red at the end of the day when it never is... As a lotion, it&#x27;s too oily.</li>
    <li> Using it on my face, i should mix ie with coconut,  and I will,,,my skin is already smoother s&lt;br /&gt;thankyou,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good thing that they used Grapeseed oil, not to be confused with rapeseed oil FYI. It&#x27;s really soft and luxurious and was great for massages, it really improved my skin.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin E Skin Oil is not pure Vitamin E oil, but actually a blend of Grape Seed Oil, Safflower Oil, and Vitamin E, listed on the label in that order. It will probably still work for my purposes, but I wish there had been a more accurate description.</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin E oil even tho it&#x27;s a combo of a few different oils. I use it for everything and even my husband uses it.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the vitamin E. I use it for my hair and I use it for my skin and lips. It&#x27;&#x27;s a great skin softener and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> Ordered this to use as ingredient in home formulary lotions, aftershave and salves. Blends well and is an effective adjunct to compounds for skin maintenance. Folks say I look 15 years younger than my actual age.</li>
    <li> I use this oil when I make coconut oil lotion at home, helps calm dry skin &amp; itching. Haven&#x27;t tried it for anything else yet.</li>
    <li> I make my own body wash, you will love the vitamin e skin oil, it is a must to keeping your skin soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitamin E for several years now as a moisturizer.  This is a wonderful product at a great price.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Good product.  You can tell it&#x27;s vitamin e by how your skin feels a few hours after application.  it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I am a menopausal woman and this is a tremendous help in keeping my skin moist and supple.</li>
    <li> I have used Coconut oil, almond oil and olive oil on my skin but this Vitamin E oil is by far better than the rest.  Did wonders for my complexion.</li>
    <li> So I gave it a 3 just to be fair...I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far and will update this if I see any improvements (fine lines around eyes and forehead, chest wrinkles (I&#x27;m 28 yrs old), also using on stratchmarked areas- thighs, butt) The reason I only gave it a 3 is mostly because it is pretty greasy, doesn&#x27;t spread well, and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb very well. If it does it must take forever! I have been using on my forehead lines and havent had any break out from it yet (but my forehead is the least acne-prone of my skin compared to the rest of my face) If it begins to cause any extra acne on my chest I will update as well but since I just started using it in the midst of a breakout its hard to tell so far. Overall I am glad I got the product and look forward to seeing if I notice any improvement at all with consistent usage.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It&#x27;s great for your face as well as pouring a few drops into your bath water.</li>
    <li> Very good for skin. Large bottle. Ct</li>
    <li> Every girl needs this stuff! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 89 and have zero wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is my second or 3rd bottle, I really like this oil, I add it to my home made lotions and face serums, I also add it to my oil hair mask. this is a great quality product.</li>
    <li> Love this product have use it to make Chapstick, lotion, deodorant. Super happy</li>
    <li> not too oily and works well for dry skin.. shipping was great.. i recommend this product for dry skin but havent noticed any lightening of dark uneven skin</li>
    <li> Good product, good size, good price! I very much like it. Not having lots of experience with skin oil, this seems to fit the bill quite nicely.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Great for your skin.  Also helps with my dry skin.  Would recommend it :)</li>
