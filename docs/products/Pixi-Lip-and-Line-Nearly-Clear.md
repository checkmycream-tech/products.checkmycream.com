### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This primer &amp; liner are wonderful!  </li>
      <li>I was really impressed by this.</li>
      <li>I have NEVER heard of this brand or this product but it is GREAT!</li>
      <li>need to order a couple more of these!!!</li>
      <li>Great product esp.</li>
      <li>I wanted a lip primer to make my lip color bright.....</li>
      <li>Although my lips felt good, it could not extend staying power.</li>
      <li>Good stuff</li>
      <li>However, it does not smell good.  </li>
      <li>It was a great buy for sure.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an alright primer, it does cover some cracks on my lips, which is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t cover them all.</li>
      <li>Plus, the price is the best I&#x27;ve seen for a good clear liner.  </li>
      <li>The best lipstick locker ever, received early</li>
      <li>The quality of product is good, it goes on fairly smoothly and the liner tip is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>I will be buying more when mines runs out</li>
      <li>No nasty flavor, and non drying!</li>
      <li>I love the way it moisterizes my lips before I put my lip stick on.</li>
      <li>The colored end is great as a primer under a too bright or dark lipstick, and makes it more day suitable.</li>
      <li>I still think this product is good, and high quality, and works as advertised.</li>
      <li>This little bitty primer is wonderful...</li>
      <li>One important note: I did NOT find that either the primer or the liner prevented lipcolor transfer from my lips to glasses, straws, etc.</li>
      <li>It glides on smooth but can be flaky if you don&#x27;t use a balm underneath which I recommend.</li>
      <li>NO concealer needed here to clean up...</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for in a lip primer and its easy to use.</li>
      <li>I got this as a free sample, and I am back to buy more!  </li>
      <li>But it keeps your lipstick on like a champ, which is worth it to me.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for all of you who enjoy wearing lip color, but find that it &amp;#34;disappears&amp;#34; too quickly.</li>
      <li>Overall it does all of the things the higher priced primers do, plus nudes out your lips, so I give this a huge thumbs up!!</li>
      <li>It kept my lipsticks from feathering, kept my glosses nice &amp; shiny, &amp; it lasts a long time (even through eating &amp; lots of chatting).  </li>
      <li>First, it changed the color of my lipstick.  </li>
      <li>She recently asked me to order more, so I think that gift was a &amp;#34;home run&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>The primer works better than my Urban Decay or my Two Faced primers.</li>
      <li>I have natural full lips</li>
      <li>She says that it works better than many other similar products she&#x27;s tried.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very light-weight &amp; silky feeling - not sticky or tacky at all.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference while wearing this under lipstick.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t hold color well, but this stuff really works.</li>
      <li>I got it really FAST.</li>
      <li>and with the lip primer, the color just popped way too much and looked almost like neon pastel.</li>
      <li>Found other products that do a better job of priming lips for color.</li>
      <li>because I also use it on my eyelids and it works better than the eyelid primer I was using previously.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations</li>
      <li>my red lipstick right in place</li>
      <li>There are more expensive liners, but this works just fine.  </li>
      <li>Combined with other products, I take advantage of the free shipping.</li>
      <li>Just didn&#x27;t live up to expectations.</li>
      <li>This may or may not be points off for other people, but my pink lipstick was already bright enough....</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and is a little tacky feeling.</li>
      <li>The lip color sticks very well to the tacky surface and holds the lip color much longer than I had expected.</li>
      <li>The primer isn&#x27;t completely clear, but I didn&#x27;t have an issue with it altering the color of whatever product I used over it.  </li>
      <li>I am a lipgloss/lipstick/lipstain ADDICT &amp; I work as a hairstylist at a busy salon where re-applying lip cosmetics a lot isn&#x27;t an option.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to see my lipstick still there and in place even after dinner.</li>
      <li>It keeps it straight on my lips and makes it last a lot longer.  </li>
      <li>I tried Pixi Lip primer and it really evens out the color, and makes it last all day.</li>
      <li>last 6 hours instead of the normal 1-2 hours!</li>
      <li>It does pale your lipstick a little, but this \\&quot;nearly clear\\&quot; lip primer smells like coconut and makes my favorite lipstick</li>
      <li>I especially like the clear liner that prevents my lipstick from &#x27;bleeding&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Next time I will probably go with a totally clear lip primer if I can find one.</li>
      <li>This subtly tinted primer goes on smoothly and has a hint of coconut.</li>
      <li>I have this Barbie pink lipstick called &amp;#34;PINK NOUVEAU&amp;#34; from MAC that I love wearing, but I really needed a primer underneath because otherwise it gets all flaky and weird.</li>

<li> When applying the lip base, smooth on gently, or use finger to take the desired amount, and rub on lip to coat and fill in as needed.</li>
<li> So far seems decent but not perfect.</li>
<li> One end is a primer and the other end</li>
<li> There is not alot of product, so use it carefully, so none is wasted.</li>
<li> It is a little &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; and it can change the color of your lipstick slightly.</li>
<li> Using the fine tip for lip liner followed by the broader applicator for use as a lip base is the trick for achieving long-lasting color.  </li>
<li> Thick, clumpy...does not do what it says.</li>
<li> I have only tried one other base some time ago.  </li>
<li> I do not know of any other base like this.</li>
<li> Looks silly.</li>
<li> but sadly it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> I was totally disappointed in this product.  </li>
<li> This was just awful.</li>

    <li> Just didn&#x27;t live up to expectations. Found other products that do a better job of priming lips for color.</li>

    <li> i do not recommend the lip primer left my lips with this chalky look and the liner doesnt not work well</li>
    <li> I have this Barbie pink lipstick called &amp;#34;PINK NOUVEAU&amp;#34; from MAC that I love wearing, but I really needed a primer underneath because otherwise it gets all flaky and weird. I tried Pixi Lip primer and it really evens out the color, and makes it last all day. I was really impressed by this. The only downside is that it makes the color a bit brighter than it would have been if you just put the lipstick on by itself. This may or may not be points off for other people, but my pink lipstick was already bright enough....and with the lip primer, the color just popped way too much and looked almost like neon pastel. I still think this product is good, and high quality, and works as advertised. Next time I will probably go with a totally clear lip primer if I can find one.</li>
    <li> The quality of product is good, it goes on fairly smoothly and the liner tip is easy to apply.  When applying the lip base, smooth on gently, or use finger to take the desired amount, and rub on lip to coat and fill in as needed. There is not alot of product, so use it carefully, so none is wasted. I have only tried one other base some time ago.  Do not remember name, but was not satisfactory.  I do not know of any other base like this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hold color well, but this stuff really works. I was surprised to see my lipstick still there and in place even after dinner.</li>
    <li> I use this when I wear RED lipstick ( seams to always run ) this worked. I&#x27;m 64 &amp; have allot of lines in my lips. Great product esp. for the price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference while wearing this under lipstick. I might as well be wearing nothing at all.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom.  She says that it works better than many other similar products she&#x27;s tried.  She recently asked me to order more, so I think that gift was a &amp;#34;home run&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an alright primer, it does cover some cracks on my lips, which is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t cover them all. It give me not-so-great looking lips instead of having chapped lips. It&#x27;ll leave a frost look on your lips, so it cannot be used individually, you&#x27;ll have to color your lips to cover it up.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for all of you who enjoy wearing lip color, but find that it &amp;#34;disappears&amp;#34; too quickly. Using the fine tip for lip liner followed by the broader applicator for use as a lip base is the trick for achieving long-lasting color.  Order two, because you will want to keep one for your purse as well as one with your cosmetics at home.</li>
    <li> I wanted a lip primer to make my lip color bright..... I have natural full lips so I wanted them to stand out and stay moist. This little bitty primer is wonderful...</li>
    <li> I am a lipgloss/lipstick/lipstain ADDICT &amp; I work as a hairstylist at a busy salon where re-applying lip cosmetics a lot isn&#x27;t an option.  This primer &amp; liner are wonderful!  It kept my lipsticks from feathering, kept my glosses nice &amp; shiny, &amp; it lasts a long time (even through eating &amp; lots of chatting).  It&#x27;s also very light-weight &amp; silky feeling - not sticky or tacky at all.  Plus, the price is the best I&#x27;ve seen for a good clear liner.  The primer isn&#x27;t completely clear, but I didn&#x27;t have an issue with it altering the color of whatever product I used over it.  I will definitely purchase this again!!!</li>
    <li> The colored end is great as a primer under a too bright or dark lipstick, and makes it more day suitable. No doughnut mouth, either. No nasty flavor, and non drying! Good stuff</li>
    <li> This was just awful. I did not like the way it felt on your lips. It makes your lipstick peel up. And the outline side which you use after you put on your lipstick is shiny, and you can see it!! Looks silly. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product. It is a little &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; and it can change the color of your lipstick slightly. But it keeps your lipstick on like a champ, which is worth it to me. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Thick, clumpy...does not do what it says. I was recommended this item to use to outline my lips and it would help keep lipstick on and in place.&lt;br /&gt;NOPE... it does not do that for me.</li>
    <li> I thought it would hold my lip color but sadly it didn&#x27;t.  Although my lips felt good, it could not extend staying power.</li>
    <li> does not work, gums up, I did follow instructions  when I put my lipstick on over it just clumps  I have to remove and just use my lipstick  wish I returned</li>
    <li> I was totally disappointed in this product.  First, it changed the color of my lipstick.  Second, the lipstick did not stay after one cup of coffee.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of Pixi lip products so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations but when I tried it I was floored. The primer works better than my Urban Decay or my Two Faced primers. It goes on smoothly and is a little tacky feeling. The lip color sticks very well to the tacky surface and holds the lip color much longer than I had expected. The clear lip liner keeps my lip gloss from migrating down my chin like sparkly drool. One important note: I did NOT find that either the primer or the liner prevented lipcolor transfer from my lips to glasses, straws, etc. It does keep them on longer than when used without but don&#x27;t expect regular lipstick to suddenly be that 24hr permanent coverage type. Overall it does all of the things the higher priced primers do, plus nudes out your lips, so I give this a huge thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for in a lip primer and its easy to use. I got it really FAST.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t use it often but when i do its like magic.keeps my red lipstick right in place and no one is even the wiser.would definitely purchase again.fast,great shipping.</li>
    <li> This subtly tinted primer goes on smoothly and has a hint of coconut. And on the other end, a clear liner helps prevent feathering.&lt;br /&gt;Two products in one, actually three because I also use it on my eyelids and it works better than the eyelid primer I was using previously.</li>
    <li> I like what this stuff does to my lipstick.  It keeps it straight on my lips and makes it last a lot longer.  However, it does not smell good.  Not such a big deal since you cover it up.  There are more expensive liners, but this works just fine.  I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER heard of this brand or this product but it is GREAT! Lipstick that bleeds and comes off will STAY put ALL day with this stuff.. One end is a primer and the other end you line your lips and  apply liner and lipstick and it locks it in place.. NO concealer needed here to clean up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to order a couple more of these!!!</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample, and I am back to buy more!  It does pale your lipstick a little, but this \\&quot;nearly clear\\&quot; lip primer smells like coconut and makes my favorite lipstick last 6 hours instead of the normal 1-2 hours!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell any difference. The only reason I gave 2 stars is that it appeared to have some moisturizing benefit</li>
    <li> I have ordered this item twice. Combined with other products, I take advantage of the free shipping. I especially like the clear liner that prevents my lipstick from &#x27;bleeding&#x27;. The primer conditions my lips under the colored lipsticks that can be drying.It lasts through the morning till lunch time. I will be buying another as soon as this one runs low.</li>
    <li> The best lipstick locker ever, received early</li>
    <li> I love the way it moisterizes my lips before I put my lip stick on. It was a great buy for sure. I will be buying more when mines runs out</li>
