      <li>I first purchased this at Whole Foods, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it recently, so I was quite happy to discover I can buy this from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>so well I use it now as my full time hair conditioner for head and beard.</li>

      <li>this is an amazing, inexpensive, deep conditioning hair mask.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s all natural and conditions better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
      <li>and this makes it super soft, shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>But I liked the idea of having a deep conditioner to use occasionally, maybe once a week, to give my hair some love.</li>
      <li>Soft, silky and easy to comb through.</li>
      <li>This sulfate-free product deep conditions, washes out cleanly, and leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Once your hair is healthy you only need to use it maybe once a week, otherwise the protein will be too drying.</li>
      <li>But other than that, I can&#x27;t wait to buy more!</li>
      <li>Earth Science Olive &amp; Avocado Deep Conditioning Hair Masque is one of my favorite hair products.  </li>
      <li>It is better than my another deep hair conditioner.</li>
      <li>It really makes your hair soft and easy to brush.</li>
      <li>When rinsing this product out of my hair it feels promising, pretty silky to the touch.</li>
      <li>The design doesn&#x27;t make it easy to open.</li>
      <li>Then, I just rinse in the shower, and my hair looks super soft and shiny that day.  </li>
      <li>BTW, I have mid-back to waist length brown hair that is fine but coarse</li>
      <li>I keep in in and do not wash it out until I am ready to wash my hair again.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a miracle worker because I didn&#x27;t have breakage</li>
      <li>Even my friends would play with my hair and ask me why it was SO SOFT!!!</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this conditioner as a recommended product from a woman working at a local farmers market for use on my beard.</li>
      <li>AMAZING.. heals dead ends completely.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.  </li>
      <li>If you use protein conditioners and your hair feels a little hard afterwards, this is the best follow up conditioner to use to get your hair soft again.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks shinny and healthy, especially after I got light blonde ombre highlights in my dark brown hair, I wanted to make sure the ends didn&#x27;t get too damaged and dried.</li>
      <li>I first discovered this product at Whole Foods, but they have stopped stocking it in recent months.  </li>
      <li>Seriously, it&#x27;s rather hazardous...</li>
      <li>Have purchased many time in the past.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an avid swimmer, so I constantly struggle with trying to keep my locks moisturized.</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and the frizz is gone!  </li>
      <li>The effects last most of the week, and with regular use, my hair doesn&#x27;t get dry or dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It completely restores hair, but give it at least 1-2 weeks to work its magic long-term.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had my hair respond so completely to a conditioner before,</li>
      <li>I went natural with my hair (stopped the relaxer treatments) about 5 years ago and lack of moisture was always a problem.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The instructions say to get as much water out of your hair as possible before applying.</li>
      <li>, so, if you are looking for something natural, you probably won&#x27;t like this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, yes, my hair did feel detangled and soft</li>
      <li>I use this on my natural hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Earth Science Olive &amp; Avocado Masque is made from natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rich and luxurious and feels like it should cost at least twice as much.  </li>
      <li>and I am of European (Dutch) decent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive conditioners, but Earth Science Olive &amp; Avocado Deep Conditioning Hair Masque deserves to be a cult favorite.</li>
      <li>The previous reviewers were right-</li>
      <li>I use regular old Pantene Pro-V for my daily shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; type of hair conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dried out.</li>

<li> EXTREMELY slippery, so don&#x27;t move around a lot while you are rinsing it out of your hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you use protein conditioners and your hair feels a little hard afterwards, this is the best follow up conditioner to use to get your hair soft again.  I deep condition with plain old mayo once a week and follow it up with this conditioner after rinsing the mayo out and the results are fantastic!  I also use it as a conditioning wash and it never disappoints.  I went natural with my hair (stopped the relaxer treatments) about 5 years ago and lack of moisture was always a problem.  I bought alot of the expensive deep conditioners (Curls, Mixed Chicks, Carols Daughter, you name it), but it became too expensive of a habit.  I saw this at Mom&#x27;s Organic Market about a year ago and decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve never had my hair respond so completely to a conditioner before, so now I keep my cabinet stocked with it and use it every time I wash my hair.  It smells wonderful, works like a dream, is decently priced - I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair care product I have ever found. Yes, I know that&#x27;s saying something and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. Use this intensive conditioner 2-3x a week depending on your hair&#x27;s damage and you will see results within the 1st 2 uses. It completely restores hair, but give it at least 1-2 weeks to work its magic long-term. The fact that its 100% natural, great smell and lasts a long time is just a huge bonus. I&#x27;ve been using this as my intensive conditioner for over 2 years now. Once your hair is healthy you only need to use it maybe once a week, otherwise the protein will be too drying. BTW, I have mid-back to waist length brown hair that is fine but coarse and this makes it super soft, shiny and smooth. You will not be disappointed!!! Staple product I will always have in the house as long as ES makes it!</li>
    <li> I use this on my natural hair. It keeps it moisturized and I no longer have dandruff. I keep in in and do not wash it out until I am ready to wash my hair again. Its not flaky at all. You can also use other leave in conditioners with it.  Amazing Product</li>
    <li> Love the product! Hate the packaging.  I find it difficult, if not impossible, to flip the lid open while I am in the shower. I have to unscrew it every time. The design doesn&#x27;t make it easy to open.</li>
    <li> This is seriously one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used, and it costs around $10 a bottle!  It&#x27;s rich and luxurious and feels like it should cost at least twice as much.  I first discovered this product at Whole Foods, but they have stopped stocking it in recent months.  I was really excited to find it available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> AMAZING.. heals dead ends completely.</li>
    <li> BEST heavy conditioner for the price! Use is 3-4 times a week. Have purchased many time in the past. This 2 pack is a good price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite conditioner of all time.  Works miracles on dry hair and hair feels so great after wards.  LOVE.</li>
    <li> This hair conditioner is wonderful. It&#x27;s all natural and conditions better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before. My hair tends to have some frizz. When I use this conditioner I don&#x27;t have to use a flat iron afterwards. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Earth Science Olive &amp; Avocado Deep Conditioning Hair Masque is one of my favorite hair products.  I&#x27;ve been using it once a week for about a year, and I love the way my hair looks and feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is almost shoulder length, very dark brown with low lights. It&#x27;s important to me that my hair is in great condition, healthy and shiny.  I also have some gray in my hair, which I carry off by ensuring the cut and condition of my hair is always perfect--I think gray only looks bad when it appears unkempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earth Science Olive &amp; Avocado Masque is made from natural ingredients.  I first purchased this at Whole Foods, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it recently, so I was quite happy to discover I can buy this from Amazon.  Once a week, I wash my hair and then apply the conditioner, leaving it on for about 30 minutes.  Then, I just rinse in the shower, and my hair looks super soft and shiny that day.  The effects last most of the week, and with regular use, my hair doesn&#x27;t get dry or dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive conditioners, but Earth Science Olive &amp; Avocado Deep Conditioning Hair Masque deserves to be a cult favorite.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because my hair stylist said I needed to have healthy hair before I did a full set of highlights. After I used these both up, my hair was stronger and softer than ever! Even my friends would play with my hair and ask me why it was SO SOFT!!! It&#x27;s really a miracle worker because I didn&#x27;t have breakage, hair fall out or weighed down feeling. I recently found out that my local sprouts market carried this brand so I think I will get it there from now on...I will continue to use this wonderful product for as long as my hair lets me!</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely wonderful product.  It leaves my long hair feeling incredibly nourished after a day at the beach in saltwater.  Plus, the smell is fantastic.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It works great. My hair looks shinny and healthy, especially after I got light blonde ombre highlights in my dark brown hair, I wanted to make sure the ends didn&#x27;t get too damaged and dried. So far so good, and an awesome price compared to simular quality products.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this conditioner as a recommended product from a woman working at a local farmers market for use on my beard. My beard is thick and as coarse as a cheese grater and this conditioner makes it so soft it takes all the manliness out of it. It worked so well I use it now as my full time hair conditioner for head and beard. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a grocery store by chance, what a good surprise I had. It really makes your hair soft and easy to brush.</li>
    <li> I had a sample of this product, my hair was desperate , so I tried this and it was the best conditioner I have ever used. My hair is completely transformed and feels great ! It&#x27;s worth every penny, I will be ordering more and highly recommend you try it......you won&#x27;t want anything else after this !!</li>
    <li> This sulfate-free product deep conditions, washes out cleanly, and leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth.  I&#x27;ve only just started using it, but the amount I need to apply is so little that I think this will last a long, long time.  I do not dye my hair, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it will retain dyed color; based on the level of conditioning, though, it will do wonders for establishing and maintaining the health of your hair.  The application process recommends waiting 5 minutes after applying before rinsing it out; it works well if rinsed out sooner (I&#x27;ve left it on as little as 3 minutes.)</li>
    <li> I love this hair conditioner! It&#x27;s the first \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; type of hair conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dried out. I&#x27;m an avid swimmer, so I constantly struggle with trying to keep my locks moisturized. This conditioner is the best and does the trick!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this masque a few times and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!  My hair is so soft and the frizz is gone!  I can go 2-3 days without washing it if need be after using this masque.  I would definitely recommend using this before trying expensive salon treatments, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I use regular old Pantene Pro-V for my daily shampoo/conditioner. That works alright. But I liked the idea of having a deep conditioner to use occasionally, maybe once a week, to give my hair some love. I turned to Amazon and saw the great reviews on this product paired with a great price. I have gone through all of one bottle and a third of the second and I have come to the reluctant conclusion that this product does nothing for me. Not only does it not provide a deep conditioning like I hoped, it does less for my hair than my Pantene conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to get as much water out of your hair as possible before applying. This makes it impossibly difficult to spread the product through your hair. When rinsing this product out of my hair it feels promising, pretty silky to the touch. However as soon as I get out of the shower and try to run my hand through my hair it feels rough, tangled, and starved for moisture. It is difficult to comb. When I use Pantene it feels smoother and is easier to comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can offer no explanation as to why this product seems to work great for many people but so poorly for me. Maybe my hair type? For your reference I have long, medium-thickness hair and I am of European (Dutch) decent. If you try it I hope it works for you!</li>
    <li> It is better than my another deep hair conditioner. Also good price for good quality. Worth it to buy. :)</li>
    <li> Bought this on vacation on a fluke and now I love the way my hair feels after I use this.  Soft, silky and easy to comb through.</li>
    <li> I Love this product It has helped the health of my hair quite a bit and it is not too expensive. Will be buying again soon!</li>
    <li> I had to rewash my hair after trying this. Disgusting. Product that shipped is not the same as the one pictured.</li>
    <li> The previous reviewers were right- this is an amazing, inexpensive, deep conditioning hair mask. My only qualm is that it makes the bottom of the&lt;br /&gt;bathtub EXTREMELY slippery, so don&#x27;t move around a lot while you are rinsing it out of your hair. Seriously, it&#x27;s rather hazardous... Wait until it all washes away down the drain. But other than that, I can&#x27;t wait to buy more!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good choice...I have used a couple other face products from this company and they work well - feel and smell natural, too. I have a lot of long, blonde hair so I was excited about what all the good reviews said!&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so, if you are looking for something natural, you probably won&#x27;t like this. It smells like 99 cent shampoo and chemicals. I guess it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if it washed out (the smell) but it STAYS WITH YOU. My roommate made a comment about me not liking perfume and I was like \\&quot;uh, yeah, it&#x27;s my conditioner\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, yes, my hair did feel detangled and soft but I am never going to use this again. It really smells too strong or like a cheap perfume. I am not sure why this company did this, where is the olive or avocado smell? That would have been a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of the smell of this conditioner!!!</li>
