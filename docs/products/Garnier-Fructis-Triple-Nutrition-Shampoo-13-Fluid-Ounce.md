      <li>My absolute favorite shampoo EVER!</li>
      <li>I saw this shampoo for $2.97 @ the &#x27;Mart (you know where lol), and decided it would at the very least give my scalp a good clarifying to accept the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low and behold...</li>

      <li>/&gt;Finally I read some reviews on here about the conditioner to this shampoo and started it first, using it as a co-wash.</li>
      <li>Price was reasonable too!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Thank you definitely a good price. Bought like 2 bottles for a stock. Its cheaper to buy here.... So i like to save money so i buy from here. And its good brand....</li>
    <li> Works Best for dry and frizzy hairs! I really love this product! It works great with Garnier Conditioner</li>
    <li> Its shampoo. It makes my hair shiny. Why am I even writing this? I did it to make the emails STOP.</li>
    <li> Since chemotherapy my hair had been so dry and brittle. Felt horrible and looked that way too. Just one week of this Nutrition shampoo and conditioner and I noticed a huge difference for the better.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Make your hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> good shampoo but not my favorite.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both use this shampoo and conditioner and it works great.  Sometimes, for me, I feel like I have to change up after a while because it loses it&#x27;s effectiveness.  i&#x27;ll use the color protector for a few weeks and then come back to this.  My daughter uses this constantly with no issues but she also doesn&#x27;t use gel and hairspray like I do.  I love the fact that this works on my hair (course and curly) and I&#x27;ve tried a TON of different brands from cheap to expensive - and this is affordable.</li>
    <li> I bought the conditioner and shampoo at my nearest Walmart. This product helped me manage my wavy long hair. It made it soft, shiny and less tangled. Will buy again once I run out!</li>
    <li> If the shampoo would have been in the bottle and not all over the box, that would be a good start.</li>
    <li> I have always Like the fructis line and the I like the triple nutrition even better. It makes my hair extremely soft. Price was reasonable too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. The cap did open in our suitcase... But the product is good</li>
    <li> As a loyal user of Garnier products, I have found that some of their products work for me, while others do not.  I love the Garnier Fructis line of hair products.  This shampoo smells great, and does exactly as advertised, making hair feel soft, manageable, gives a great shine, triple nutrition and moisture, as well as improves the strength of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair needs improvement in these areas; this product would help enhance the ability of your hair health.  If you apply this product to your weekly/monthly hair regime, you will see the difference.  I would definitely recommend this product to women who have different hair needs, maintenance of hair lengths and types, which would bring a solution for your hair beauty needs on a daily basis.  I purchased this from Amazon Prime Pantry program, and the price, packaging, and delivery time was great.  A highly recommended product!</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about Garnier Fructis shampoo, but I&#x27;ve been getting lots of positive remarks about my hair lately.  I thought it was the new hair cut but have come to realize its actually how much smoother this shampoo makes my normally out of control hair.  I&#x27;ve tried this and several of their other shampoos and they all seem to do the same thing.... control your hair even in a humid climate.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! Great description, product, and service.  Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  I posted a favorable comment after first beginning to use this shampoo with the conditioner and wanted to update that I have been using for months now.  I have baby fine hair that dries out very easily.  For literally 20 years I used Biolage thinking it was the only shampoo gentle enough for my hair.  When they changed their formula I had had enough...since the price only kept increasing and now it didn&#x27;t even work for me anymore.  I wash my hair every day with Triple Nutrition and use the conditioner with it.  I have never had my hair as healthy as it it now.  This shampoo is like miracle.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product! Love the smell, the consistency, and price! It is sometimes hard to find this particular kind at my local big box store so I am happy I can get it though Subscribe and Save. I have naturally curly hair and live in a dry climate and this has been the best shampoo for my hair type.</li>

    <li> Works great on my hair and makes it nice and soft!!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite shampoo EVER! I can find it for the same price locally, so I don&#x27;t see the point in buying it here until that becomes a problem. You can go to my profile and see my many reviews on verified purchases, if you don&#x27;t trust that this is a true review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a Caucasian with color-treated, 3a/3b, dry &amp; damaged hair. I recently had to cut my waist-length hair to shoulder-length due to a color job gone wrong-which was the cause of the intense damage. Not wanting to go any shorter, I still have a good 3-4 inches that is pretty damaged and parched.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the CG method, forking out bucks constantly searching for THE product that was going to pamper my curls, give them that moisture they long for, tame some frizz, and prolong color. Started with DivaCurl, ended with Tresemme (sp?)-with every home treatment I could find in between-cut the mustard in any way.&lt;br /&gt;Finally I read some reviews on here about the conditioner to this shampoo and started it first, using it as a co-wash. I loved it! My hair started perking back up right away, but I have to use shampoo once a week to at least freshen my hair..and the shampoo I was using was leaving a weird gunk on my scalp. I have rarely bought matching hair products, because I have found that the hype surrounding sets has been ridiculous at best. I tried with the DivaCurl-and was yet again disappointed. That was the first time in four years. I saw this shampoo for $2.97 @ the &#x27;Mart (you know where lol), and decided it would at the very least give my scalp a good clarifying to accept the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low and behold...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it clean my scalp very well...but it didn&#x27;t strip it or my hair of moisture! I detest that &amp;#34;squeak&amp;#34; feel that hair. The one where your fingers kind of drag instead of slide? Like wet straw lol Not so with this. My hair feels silky enough that one might wonder if it&#x27;s actually clean. The first use I actually gave my hair a second rinsing thinking something was leaving a buildup or the gunk from the other shampoo wasn&#x27;t cleaned off. Wrong! My scalp was completely clean! I used a 1/4 the amount the conditioner that I normally use...and no leave-in. I plopped my hair, and when I removed the plop my curls looked OUTSTANDING!!! I had much less frizz/flyaways than if I had loaded my hair down with product, which begs the question &amp;#34;What would happen if I used the tiniest amount of product?&amp;#34;. Since I haven&#x27;t really had a reason yet, I haven&#x27;t. I might just to come back &amp; update that aspect,  though ;)&lt;br /&gt;As to shine? Perfect. Curls? Quenched and more defined. Color? Lasting. It looks and feels healthier than when I started the CG journey! And one thing I hated about doing CJ was not washing my hair more often. I LIKE my scalp being super clean, but we dry-haired curlies can&#x27;t really get away with that. With this shampoo, I can wash daily or every other without feeling guilty. I hope this HG find is never discontinued,  or that the formula isn&#x27;t changed, because my decades-long search is over ;)g something was leaving a buildup or the gunk from the other shampoo wasn&#x27;t cleaned off.

    <li> Garnier Fructis shampoo is a very good product. It was designed to work with all types of hair. It does not matter if you have straight, coarse, thin,curly hair or permed. Their overall hair products can handle any type of hair. I suggest this particular triple nutrition shampoo and conditioner because I am living in a very dry climate. But this is also go for the states that are daily humidity (GA, NC, SC, LA, MS, VA). I think you get the hint. Buy this brand and you will not be disappointed. It&#x27;s affordable but cost more than Suave hair products.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my hair but my last order 1 bottle come open n the box and I had a mess with shampoo all over my other items the other bottle did not come open.</li>
    <li> Smells great, leaves hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
