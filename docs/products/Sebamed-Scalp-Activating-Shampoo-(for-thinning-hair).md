### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s good shampoo !</li>
      <li>good!</li>
      <li>Great line of products, but a bit pricey.</li>
      <li>I feel great after using it.</li>
      <li>This is a good product.</li>
      <li>It cleans perfectly and you don&#x27;t need to use very much.  </li>
      <li>every 2-3 days I also do the Leven Rose Jojoba Treatment for my hair and steamed it for 30 minutes using the Mutual Beauty Heat Cap.</li>
      <li>Its all natural, hair in a great condition after it, smells great.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>It is an ok shampoo.  </li>
      <li>If you like it, look for a better price per oz.</li>
      <li>I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
      <li>Mildly scented, which is very important to me.  </li>
      <li>It rinses quickly and you don&#x27;t have to repeat!</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean, not overly clean and has so much more bounce.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really cheap.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how good is it because I use it for a couple of times and my front head became red and stingy.</li>
      <li>Officially my new favorite shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Have not used it long enough to know if it is an excellent product, but think it is working.  </li>
      <li>I just reordered second time since March because I find it to be effective.</li>
      <li>But def worth a try.</li>
      <li>I did notice a positive my hair was not s greasy on day two as it normally would be, I paired this with conditioner they offer, perhaps using the shampoo alone would be fine and using another conditioner to kill the smell.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>I have hard well water and this shampoo works great with it.</li>
      <li>Gave this a low rating since it has a very strong, very masculine fragrance.  </li>
      <li>light scent and the hair feels clean, can&#x27;t say I see any less hair loss.</li>
      <li>It looks much healthier than it used to be now.</li>
      <li>I wish I could speak more about the quality of the  product long term but after giving it 3-4 turns, I could barely take the smell both in the shower and after my hair was dry.  </li>
      <li>and I can definitely see I don&#x27;t shed out as much hair as I did before...</li>
      <li>It is like old spice meets old lady on over drive.  </li>
      <li>I bought it for my wife and she loves it so far.</li>
      <li>And new hair appeared, although i am using not only this shampoo for stimulation.</li>
      <li>As a few other have mentioned the perfume is overwhelming.</li>

<li> I use this shampoo, very small amount, about 4 times a week.</li>
<li> Difficult to locate in stores, so we order usually.</li>
<li> It does make my thin hair look and feel fuller.</li>

    <li> My hair is soft and thin. It looks much healthier than it used to be now.</li>
    <li> FINALLY!!! no more dryness, itchy scalp, falling hair and dandruff! I use this everyday and I can definitely see I don&#x27;t shed out as much hair as I did before... every 2-3 days I also do the Leven Rose Jojoba Treatment for my hair and steamed it for 30 minutes using the Mutual Beauty Heat Cap.</li>
    <li> love it. light scent and the hair feels clean, can&#x27;t say I see any less hair loss.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how good is it because I use it for a couple of times and my front head became red and stingy.I did not use it anymore and gave it away.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo, very small amount, about 4 times a week. It does make my thin hair look and feel fuller. I just reordered second time since March because I find it to be effective.</li>
    <li> Have not used it long enough to know if it is an excellent product, but think it is working.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Gave this a low rating since it has a very strong, very masculine fragrance.  Couldn&#x27;t use it!  Threw it out.</li>
    <li> Its all natural, hair in a great condition after it, smells great. And new hair appeared, although i am using not only this shampoo for stimulation. But def worth a try.</li>

    <li> I like this German made shampoo. I feel great after using it. It&#x27;s more expensive than other products, but it is my hair, also in long term it&#x27;s really cheap. I like the PH 5.5 thing.</li>
    <li> As a few other have mentioned the perfume is overwhelming. It is like old spice meets old lady on over drive.

    <li> My son has eczema, and has been losing his hair, and scalp was itchy and dry, and scaly, so I got it for him, and he thanked me for it.  I cut his hair for him, and I can tell his hair is softer, and his scalp isn&#x27;t all scaly.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good!</li>
    <li> It is an ok shampoo.  I don&#x27;t think it did anything for my thinning hair. I do want to try their everyday shampoo though.</li>
    <li> Hubby uses it, believes it&#x27;s working.  Not much for lather, but hey.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I bought it for my wife and she loves it so far.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good shampoo ! Works for me!</li>
    <li> Great line of products, but a bit pricey. Difficult to locate in stores, so we order usually. This is a small bottle. If you like it, look for a better price per oz.</li>
