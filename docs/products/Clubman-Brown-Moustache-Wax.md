      <li>They say &#x27;practice makes perfect&#x27; and it&#x27;s very true in this case.</li>

      <li>It smells good, it tames the face fuzz, it hides the gray.  </li>
      <li>I cannot comprehend whats good about this product.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, good scent, my first application</li>
      <li>Be handsome!</li>
      <li>Safe and easy to use, good coverage, and knocks 10 yrs off !.  </li>
      <li>Once you figure out how to use it works effectively.</li>
      <li>I threw it away because my , but the comb was nice.</li>
      <li>Godsakes just buy beeswax and coconut oil and make your own wax.  </li>
      <li>Ok, it&#x27;s mustache wax ...</li>
      <li>The brown wax is not the brown that most of our hair looks like.  </li>
      <li>but it was a lot more work</li>
      <li>The included brush/comb is ok, but a better brush/comb would make the application go better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like crayola brown.</li>
      <li>So easy to make and works like a charm.</li>
      <li>Washes out easily with ANY moisture.</li>
      <li>This product is affordable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>However, the customer service from this seller was EXTRAORDINARY!  </li>
      <li>Overall, a great product, which can be easily used to style/control your mustache.</li>
      <li>I had some hesitance in deciding which color to choose (brown or the white/neutral), but I decided to go with the reviews and selected the brown color, since I would describe my beard color as a light brown.</li>
      <li>I bought this after reading all the good reviews and Im at a complete loss.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a handlebar mustache novice, but overall its been a good product for me.</li>
      <li>Be sure to have some Q-tips ready to wipe it of with ease</li>
      <li>so go easy on the first application till you see how it looks.</li>
      <li>Clubman is great wax and if your stache is the color of dark chocolate, then this is the stuff.</li>
      <li>Does a good job of covering the grey.</li>
      <li>The wax is stiff and provides a good hold, and is easy to apply with the included brush (I watched videos for pointers.</li>
      <li>Super strong hold and can shape your mustache into pretty much anything.  </li>
      <li>Fast free shipping --</li>
      <li>When first playing around with my mustache, I quickly found out that hair pomades/</li>
      <li>I look like one of the guys right of a barbershop quartet these days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very VERY brown.  </li>
      <li>Big word of advice, do not get the &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; unless you have very very light hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try applying more next use.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find it locally.</li>
      <li>So I figured I must have not put enough out and tried a substantial amount more, still to no avail.</li>
      <li>After playing with the wax, adding more of it, and patiently styling my mustache into the handlebar look (from a video I found online), this wax actually does the job.</li>
      <li>Not bad stuff, just not for where I live.</li>
      <li>The wax didnt come out of the tube very easily and putting it on the moustache evenly was difficult at best even with the little comb.</li>
      <li>Yes, it takes several tries to properly learn how to make your mustache take the shape you desire using the wax (and I highly suggest looking at some online tutorial videos), but the product works excellently.</li>
      <li>quantity, considering how much you need to apply for it to do anything</li>
      <li>It matches very well.  </li>
      <li>I sent a message to the seller, though I didn&#x27;t really hold out much hope.  </li>
      <li>I was very liberal with the amount of wax I used</li>
      <li>It needs something much stronger, and after reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to purchase this product.</li>
      <li>Holds very well.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t hold a shape very well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a young guy, and right now mustaches are the trend, so I decided to grow out my beard and give it a shot (the process took about 2 months).</li>
      <li>Good hard to find product!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve had to keep them trimmed to look decent.</li>
      <li>It is truly brown, and not subtle about it, so not for consumers with lighter colored mustaches.</li>
      <li>It also holds up for a decent time throughout the day (I won&#x27;t say it holds all day, but no wax can realistically do that -</li>
      <li>Highly highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m growing my normal hunting beard</li>
      <li>The first shipment got lost in the mail, which happens around here on a more or less regular basis.  </li>
      <li>If you have dark brown hair, you will find this product too be too light a brown in color.</li>
      <li>No other product like it due to available colors.</li>
      <li>Get the clear wax.  </li>
      <li>I used to use this stuff when I was young to make my mustache look thicker.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m having to cut it with the natural to avoid looking like I&#x27;m wearing a costume mustache.</li>
      <li>It brought my facial topiary to an entirely new level!</li>
      <li>Goes on with a white tint, but dries clear.</li>
      <li>One thing, the brown runs pretty dark and will leave some color on your skin.</li>
      <li>Now I am old and I use it to cover up the white hairs.</li>
      <li>If your moustache is not solid brown then use the natural color of clubman, or use some Murray&#x27;s pomade.  </li>
      <li>The first time I tried it, it just plain didnt work.</li>

<li> The first time I tried it, it just plain didnt work.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t clump or flake like some waxes do, but I live in the deep south where heat and humidity are a big problem, so my mustache becomes droopy after just a few minutes.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think I use enough so it doesn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
<li> It caused my blonde brown stache to look grey.  </li>
<li> doesnt hold for very long at all&lt;</li>
<li> Holds quite well when dry.</li>
<li> The wax is pretty thick and a little goes a long way!</li>
<li> The brown color of the product is a little dark for my hair personally, but after brushing it into my mustache hair with the comb, it&#x27;s not very noticeable at all and actually makes my hair look thicker.</li>
<li> Definitely has an unique fragrance, but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant.</li>
<li> A little goes further than you think it will.  </li>
<li> It doesnt hold your mustache in place for very long at all, less than an hour after applying it my mustache was already curling back down into my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If your stache is lighter, it makes it look unnaturally dark and dyed.</li>
<li> Straight brown color- almost looks fake.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s dark brown, so be careful not to get it everywhere, as it can look messy.</li>
<li> It is a dark brown</li>
<li> messy, not much hold,  </li>
<li> I intend to get black and see how it works.</li>
<li> Somewhat difficult to squeeze out of tube, color looked unnatural, messy and smeared on skin, greasy and didn&#x27;t hold very well.&lt;br</li>
<li> My husband loves this wax, and uses the little comb that is included.</li>
<li> Work with the fire department and nurses, I get compliments everyday.</li>

    <li> The wax didnt come out of the tube very easily and putting it on the moustache evenly was difficult at best even with the little comb. The coloring was great but it was a lot more work that i orrigionaly thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Straight brown color- almost looks fake. Holds quite well when dry. Washes out easily with ANY moisture.</li>
    <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
    <li> have to appky with an included brush. messy, not much hold,  dont want to colot my &#x27;stache -  dont get it.</li>
    <li> The wax is stiff and provides a good hold, and is easy to apply with the included brush (I watched videos for pointers. A little goes further than you think it will.  If you have dark brown hair, you will find this product too be too light a brown in color. I intend to get black and see how it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m growing my normal hunting beard however I&#x27;m not trimming my stache this year.  I got this to keep the stache hairs from hitting my nose or going in my mouth.  I don&#x27;t think I use enough so it doesn&#x27;t last too long.  Big word of advice, do not get the &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; unless you have very very light hair.  It caused my blonde brown stache to look grey.  I got the brown because the rest of my facial hair is brown.  It matches very well.  I&#x27;m going to try applying more next use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, good scent, my first application I was very liberal with the amount of wax I used and it was a pleasing scent, not over powering but not too subtle. Great color match for my hair color. Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.need stiffer brush</li>
    <li> My husband has only used this brand since he was a teenager and grew a mustache. He won&#x27;t use anything else !!</li>
    <li> Clubman is great wax and if your stache is the color of dark chocolate, then this is the stuff. If your stache is lighter, it makes it look unnaturally dark and dyed. I&#x27;m having to cut it with the natural to avoid looking like I&#x27;m wearing a costume mustache.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a handlebar mustache novice, but overall its been a good product for me. Definitely has an unique fragrance, but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant. It is truly brown, and not subtle about it, so not for consumers with lighter colored mustaches.</li>
    <li> I look like one of the guys right of a barbershop quartet these days. Pinaud is as I remember it from 20 years ago -- which was the last time I sported a cookie duster. Fast free shipping -- what&#x27;s not to like.&lt;br /&gt;Uke Jackson</li>
    <li> It just doesn&#x27;t hold a shape very well.  Doesn&#x27;t clump or flake like some waxes do, but I live in the deep south where heat and humidity are a big problem, so my mustache becomes droopy after just a few minutes.  Not bad stuff, just not for where I live.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a young guy, and right now mustaches are the trend, so I decided to grow out my beard and give it a shot (the process took about 2 months). When first playing around with my mustache, I quickly found out that hair pomades/waxes do not work at all on my mustache. It needs something much stronger, and after reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to purchase this product. I had some hesitance in deciding which color to choose (brown or the white/neutral), but I decided to go with the reviews and selected the brown color, since I would describe my beard color as a light brown. The brown color of the product is a little dark for my hair personally, but after brushing it into my mustache hair with the comb, it&#x27;s not very noticeable at all and actually makes my hair look thicker.

It also holds up for a decent time throughout the day (I won&#x27;t say it holds all day, but no wax can realistically do that - I&#x27;ll give it 6-8 hours). Overall, a great product, which can be easily used to style/control your mustache. I will definitely be repurchasing this product in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very VERY brown.  If your moustache is not solid brown then use the natural color of clubman, or use some Murray&#x27;s pomade.  I threw it away because my , but the comb was nice.</li>
    <li> Safe and easy to use, good coverage, and knocks 10 yrs off !.  No other product like it due to available colors.</li>
    <li> My brows tend to go every which way and I&#x27;ve had to keep them trimmed to look decent. This stuff is wonderful. My brows are fully grown out and this keeps them in place and looking GOOD. Don&#x27;t know how it works on moustaches but ladies it is great for brows.</li>
    <li> Be handsome! Be mustache! I was delighted to receive and utilize this product. It brought my facial topiary to an entirely new level!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive wax for the &#x27;stache. Once you figure out how to use it works effectively.</li>
    <li> The wax is pretty thick and a little goes a long way! Does a good job of covering the grey. It is a dark brown so go easy on the first application till you see how it looks. The included brush/comb is ok, but a better brush/comb would make the application go better.</li>
    <li> I used to use this stuff when I was young to make my mustache look thicker.  Now I am old and I use it to cover up the white hairs.</li>
    <li> Item was as described. Great!</li>
    <li> Super strong hold and can shape your mustache into pretty much anything.  but the wax stains like crazy and gets everywhere.  Including all around your girlfriend&#x27;s lips.  In public.  In front of yours and her family.</li>
    <li> Somewhat difficult to squeeze out of tube, color looked unnatural, messy and smeared on skin, greasy and didn&#x27;t hold very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Godsakes just buy beeswax and coconut oil and make your own wax.  So easy to make and works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Already had the brown and this wax works great. Holds very well. Goes on with a white tint, but dries clear.</li>
    <li> it sucks.  it&#x27;s hard and dried up... throw your mony in the trash can... never use this service... don&#x27;t be stupid... i was...</li>
    <li> This product is affordable and easy to use. It maintains a good hold but the color can stain out of place if you use a napkin or tissue leaving and unsightly brown mark on your face.</li>
    <li> Ok, it&#x27;s mustache wax ... what is there to say?  It smells good, it tames the face fuzz, it hides the gray.  However, the customer service from this seller was EXTRAORDINARY!  The first shipment got lost in the mail, which happens around here on a more or less regular basis.  Weeks passed, and I forgot I&#x27;d ever ordered this stuff; then I noticed it on my Amazon account and remembered.  I sent a message to the seller, though I didn&#x27;t really hold out much hope.  Well, not only did they get back with me within an hour or so, they volunteered to resend the order, which arrived only two days later.  I&#x27;ll definitely order from these guys again!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years, that&#x27;s why I keep buying it.  I have not been able to find it locally.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Looks great</li>
    <li> Get the clear wax.  The brown wax is not the brown that most of our hair looks like.  It&#x27;s more like crayola brown.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the good reviews and Im at a complete loss. I cannot comprehend whats good about this product. The first time I tried it, it just plain didnt work. So I figured I must have not put enough out and tried a substantial amount more, still to no avail. It doesnt hold your mustache in place for very long at all, less than an hour after applying it my mustache was already curling back down into my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;If you kiss someone with it on, it smudges all over their face.&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt hold for very long at all&lt;br /&gt;It smells horrible&lt;br /&gt;Small quantity, considering how much you need to apply for it to do anything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;none</li>
    <li> Good hard to find product!</li>
    <li> It kind of stinks, I would also buy a non colored version next time. SORT OF helps keep the end of my mustache curled as I had hoped it would. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Best mustache wax I could find anywhere. I decided to grow my stache out and see if I could curl it into a handle bar stache and by did this stuff get the job done. Work with the fire department and nurses, I get compliments everyday. I tried using the fisticuffs mustache wax and it just doesn&#x27;t compare. Highly highly recommend. One thing, the brown runs pretty dark and will leave some color on your skin. Be sure to have some Q-tips ready to wipe it of with ease</li>
    <li> My husband loves this wax, and uses the little comb that is included. It&#x27;s dark brown, so be careful not to get it everywhere, as it can look messy.</li>
