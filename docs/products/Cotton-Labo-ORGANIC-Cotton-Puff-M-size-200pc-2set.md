<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lots of cotton l. Its great</li>
    <li> Works great in an RDA.  No boiling required.  Dry hits not as offensive.  American 100% cotton was a minor  irritant even after boiling.  200 pack will net me 1000s of wicks With Dual 1/8 Inch Inside Diameter coils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not 5 stars?  because the packaging is in far-eastern glyphs and I cannot read it.  And because I seem to burn these up quicker, though that may be operator error.</li>
    <li> Great tasting... 100% satisfied... Will buy again... Thanks AAA+++</li>
    <li> Yummy...worth the waiting time especially for that price.</li>
    <li> Use it to wick coils for e-cig mods. Works well. Would Reccommend.</li>
    <li> Even though it came straight from Japan, it came Surprisngly fast to my house. Wickin with this tho is sick as tits. The flavor is on point and to me, it sits right at the top. Also for this price?!..No regrets whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Never a bad taste with this cotton. More expensive than CVS or Walgreens brand but how much are you going to need in a lifetime?? I got bad taste from regular cotton. This Labo doesn&#x27;t need boiling &amp; rinsing. Great juice taste right out of package &amp; in the coil. Don&#x27;t be cheap, buy this!!</li>
    <li> These Japanese organic cotton sheets are awesome for vaping, no more rolling and fiddling with cotton balls just snip and wick. Not to mention it saturates so well, better than normal cotton balls do. 10/10 would suggest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you&#x27;ll be set for a WHIIILE</li>
    <li> Great for rdas! Not extremely noticeable but will over make it better</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to satisfy your vaping needs with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Excellent cotton, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I am more than pleased with this purchase. Will definitely be ordering some more soon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much better than any cotton puff I bought in store. Soft, bleach free, easy to tear into at least 4 layers so that you can use it as facial mask. It completed change my understanding of how to take care of your skin and feed it enough water. I love it, the only concern I have is that if you want to use it as facial mask, you may want to get the longer one like Muji ones, since this is shorter and you have to stretch a little bit to fit the face.</li>
    <li> Best wicking material I&#x27;ve used to date!  Flavor is clean, no break in time, no burnt taste, just an all around excellent product for your RDA&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> works well for vaping</li>
    <li> Oh my god. Cotton for months. If you&#x27;re looking for your RBA, look no further. I seriously didn&#x27;t realize it was this much cotton, and it&#x27;s amazing. Takes a few weeks to get to you, but totally worth the wait for the price. I wish I could give it ten stars.</li>
    <li> I never knew what cotton could be until now.  When I first opened the package I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was looking at -- this thick puffy square, and then I used it and it felt AWESOME.  I actually look forward to using it--it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s own experience!  And no chemicals. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s not expensive because I could never go back to the usual cotton round/square brands now...</li>
    <li> Very soft organic cotton pads! I&#x27;ve never felt cotton pads this soft and gentle. They are also thick.</li>
    <li> I received this ten days ahead of the delivery estimate, perfect for my needs. I&#x27;ve already recommended this to friends for value and quality.</li>
    <li> The Bees Knees if you vape this stuff is 2nd nature</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal. No weird or off putting smell or texture out of them giving me the peace of mind to use this stuff for my vaping needs.  Don&#x27;t start looking at the shipping from Japan as being daunting - it&#x27;ll get to you sooner than expected! I ordered a couple packs of this stuff from the seller Deputi-Japan thinking I might as well make it worth my while on April 15 with an expected delivery May 15 - June 8. This stuff came on on April 29. HOT DAMN! A single pack of this stuff should last me a year if I solely use it for vaping. I&#x27;ll eventually find other uses for this stuff just for the sake of using more &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; organic cotton. I honestly don&#x27;t know how long this stuff has been sitting on their shelves at this stupid cheap price.  A bit of a con against my seller though is my 2 packs of the cotton came shipped in a plastic bag with the cotton safely bubble wrapped but they used a rubber band to keep the two together. It made the cotton on the parts the rubber band was securing the cotton bent. It really only effected about 9 pads total from both packs so 9 out of 200 pieces imperfect? I can live with that. I wished Deputi-Japan can see this - they don&#x27;t need to use a rubber band if they wrap the cotton with bubble wrap and tape it up.  Oh yeah, double check who the seller is. I noticed Amazon always defaults to a janky/questionable seller when I look up products. I recommend ordering this stuff from Deputi-Japan, J-subculture, and Colors Osaka as I&#x27;ve ordered from them before regarding other products and they&#x27;ve been pretty good with shipping your goodies out in a timely fashion and the good stuff gets to you in 2-3 weeks time not the 5-7 week timetable they give you.  Cheers!  TL;DR : just get this stuff already.</li>
    <li> Took forever to ship, but worth the wait. Excellent for vaping wicks for clean, excellent flavor. Simply cut a small strip off the pads this size and it&#x27;s good for most of my coil set ups. SOOO much cheaper than anywhere else I&#x27;ve looked for vaping cotton supplies.</li>
    <li> Great for vape wick. I use scissors to cut the right size. A little tricky to keep the two sides of the sheet together though</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for wicking material in my rebuildable dripping atomizers. I&#x27;ve used cellucotton, koh gen do, and vapers choice cotton, i definitely prefer this stuff. Incredible value, wicks very well, and the flavor is superb. Delivery may take up to a month or longer but it is well worth the wait!</li>
    <li> There is a whole lot of cotton in this bag. I barley even use a half of a square each time I rewick my RDA. I also use this cotton for wicking on my Fogger v4 and it is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great flavor! I do not notice a cottony taste in my flavors when I use this wick. Also, I do not boil the cotton before I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protip: When cutting a square of cotton to wick your coil, be sure to cut along the strands of cotton and not against it. When you get your hands on it you&#x27;ll know what I mean.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to switch from silica.  Enough material to wick millions of Kayfuns and RDAs.  I would purchase again, but I have a felling I won&#x27;t ever run out.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice cotton. Volume is great and the size of the pads is just right.</li>
    <li> Good cotton, for vaping.</li>
    <li> Great quality, easy to use for wicking.  The best thing is the flavor you get.  Regular cotton has a funny aftertaste when used as a wick, not so with these.  For the price and the amount you get, silly not to pick it up.</li>
    <li> Very nice cotton pads.  No off taste when used for wicking.</li>
    <li> I use these for wicking my vape, works great!!  Honestly, a tiny bit better than cotton balls, but the real advantage is that it is soooo easy to cut uniform strips and when I cut the leading edge at a 45 degree angle, getting it into the coils is so much easier than cotton balls.  Also, when the wick is dry, don&#x27;t get me wrong it doesn&#x27;t taste good, but its not like cotton!!  You aren&#x27;t going to be choking and spitting out that nasty burnt taste!</li>
    <li> Great cotton for stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different wick materials lately. These wicked adequately. Better than cotton balls for sure. But they muted the flavor of the juices I was vaping. They performed even better after they were boiled once and dried. But they didn&#x27;t perform nearly as well as the muji cotton pads, but unfortunately those are chemically treated so I&#x27;d like to stop using those. The price is great though. so much cotton for your money. Just make sure you order from somewhere where the order is fulfilled by amazon so you don&#x27;t end up waiting a month like I did.</li>
    <li> great for wicking coils</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;ll start by saying that I&#x27;m all for supporting brick &amp; mortar vape shops. They help bring vaping into the public eye. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve seen a local vape shop sell one or two of these individual squares for $1. It doesn&#x27;t take a calculus major to figure out that 250x markup isn&#x27;t something I want to support. I&#x27;ll wait the few days to receive an entire bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On that note, I didn&#x27;t experience the large shipping times that others did. It fit right in the 3-5 business day estimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only cotton I&#x27;ve ever used in my RDA (rebuildable dripping atomizer), and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. The outside two layers of a single sheet are denser than the inside. I&#x27;ve heard arguments saying each are better than the other. I tend to use the inside, but that&#x27;s my preference for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy a bag and swap flavors to your heart&#x27;s content!</li>
    <li> flavor flavor flavor!</li>
    <li> This says it&#x27;s 200 pieces, which is true. But seeing as it pulls apart so easily into completely separate pads and doesn&#x27;t have the rough, gnarly center that some cotton does, you&#x27;re essentially getting 400 pieces. I bought two of these and I am very, very happy I did! For a 2.4mm coil build a 0.5, 0.4cm or slightly less strip cut with the pad sideways, then lightly rolled, is the PERFECT wick. It feeds very well and will hold an almost hilarious amount of e-liquid. You will be very hard pressed to run out of wicking material if you purchase two bags. I am deadly serious; you&#x27;re set for a good year or so and that&#x27;s rewicking every day. It&#x27;s much softer than Ko Gen Doh as well. The resealable packaging is really cool as well, it&#x27;s all in Japanese. As for softness, it&#x27;s like a cloud, you guys. Really. It&#x27;s cream colored and 100% organic. There are bits of earth and sand in the fibers in spots, pick them out or not. It doesn&#x27;t matter. This stuff is incredible.</li>
    <li> Great wicking material for Vaping.</li>
    <li> I received these a few days ago and have been beyond pleased. I use organic cotton to make wicks for my vape atomizers. I have used surgical gauze, organic cotton balls, and silica wicks of all types and sizes. This stuff is by far the best tasting (literally flavorless) and easiest to work with. If you split the sheet in half and then use scissors to cut wick into strips, this bag will last forever. I finished half of a full sheet tonight and it took 2 dual coil drippers, 2 dual coil orchids, and 3 single coil atomizers to use half the sheet. So I have re wicked several atomizers and still have 199 and 1/2 left lol.</li>
    <li> Great quality on this cotton. Plenty of them to make a lot of coils.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for vaping. Perfect size so not a lot of waste and wicks like a dream. The only annoying thug is this was a add on item and you had to spend a certain dollar amount before it shipped. Huge bag tho so I won&#x27;t need more for a long time.</li>
    <li> Good for my rba, and my girlfriend for make ul</li>
    <li> Its alright for wicking, it gives me a burnt taste even though it fully saturated, With a new coil! What am i doing wrong?</li>
    <li> Fantastic. I use this for my e cig vape.</li>
    <li> Way better than American style cotton balls or pads.  The cotton pad becomes saturated with just a little of whatever liquid you are using (e.g., toner).  And I love how it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> I, like many others, use this as wick material in my nicotine vaporizer. I think it works wonderfully and is super easy to work with. Definitely an upgrade from regular cotton, though I have not tried any other materials yet. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Great for wicking, one bag will last years. Split this with someone.</li>
    <li> I bought this for wicks in my RBA.  Works great! not sure it&#x27;s any better than sugar n&#x27; cream yarn but&lt;br /&gt;I it seems to be a little easier to use, and you can cut it to the thickness you need for different size coils.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion cotton is the best material for wicks,  Better flavor and better vapor.  Doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as&lt;br /&gt;silica but if since you are rebuilding it is still cheaper.</li>
    <li> Flavor is awesome, and the people at my local vape shop are always asking me for a square or two. :)</li>
    <li> Works great for the rebuildable e-cig.</li>
    <li> I use this to wick my vaporizer and love it!!  I&#x27;ve used all sorts of cotton for my vaporizer and in my opinion this is the best so far.  It absorbs the juice quickly and carries the flavor great.  I highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Makes other cotton swabs seem like sandpaper. Super soft but somehow durable</li>
    <li> Great Cotton for vaping! Taste weird at first but after a few hits it&#x27;s just a better taste then organic cotton from a convenient store.</li>
    <li> Loving this cotton for wicking! Zero cotton t-shirt taste from these pads, and it soaks e-liquid&lt;br /&gt;like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried. Simply amazing. The shipping was supposed to take a long time,&lt;br /&gt;and marked for March 19-April 9. I ordered anyway, and it arrived in yesterday&#x27;s mail.</li>
    <li> Use for vaping devices. Couldn&#x27;t stand organic cotton balls. Even when boiled and dried, always thought it tasted like a wet sock. This stuff is great for taste, easy to size, and very absorbent. Not sure how the more expensive choice can be any better, since these are exactly what I was hoping for, plus enough wick for years.</li>
    <li> Fast fast shipping!  I got cotton for days son!</li>
    <li> well worth the waiting!</li>
    <li> Much better than your typical cvs cotton on an RDA and the flavor is great!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for a rebuild-able dripper. This is the first Organic cotton that I have used in a vaporizer that is FLAVORLESS. It blew my mind on the quality. These are very fluffy sheets and pull apart easily. There are cotton particles in the sheets, but they don&#x27;t effect your vaping experience. Also they have a slight yellow tinge to them, but that&#x27;s because they are not bleached. Shipping will take a month, so plan ahead.</li>
    <li> Great for Vaping, Wicks fast, tastes great, awesome product</li>
    <li> The fact it has no bleach in it makes me likes it even more.</li>
    <li> the best wicking material for vapes. soaks up a lot of juice, and doesn&#x27;t give the burnt cotton taste, when its dry; that you would get from cotton balls. unbleached organic japanese cotton squares this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> Arrived in two weeks a month faster than expected.  Product as advertised very happy.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. So much cotton. Enough to last a lifetime. Great price too. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Best organic cotton i&#x27;ve used for vaping.</li>
    <li> I bought four of these to use in a ReBuildable Atomizer (Kanger Subtank). I didn&#x27;t realize just how much was going to be in each bag. I gave my son one or two bags and still have more than enough for a very long time. If you want a cost effective way to maintain a supply for a few years, buy a few bags.</li>
    <li> These are so super soft and lush. In fast, I pull them apart into two pieces to use on my face and eyes. Lovely.</li>
    <li> Great for using with e-cigs.  Tastes and wicks better than brand name KGD cotton.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time as promised and was everything I had expected it to be</li>
    <li> Yup, real deal. Perfect for Vaping, which is why I assume were all here. Do it</li>
    <li> These puffs are gentle on the face and soft to the feel. If you are in the market for organic cotton puff squares, these would be the one to choose.</li>
    <li> My skin is really sensitive so I need to wash my face very carefully.  I am amazed by these Cotton Puffs! They are extremely sensitive, they don&#x27;t irritate my skin.The edges are soft, puffs don&#x27;t fall apart when removing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery is very quick and the price is really good! I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order them again!</li>
    <li> Shipping takes a long time but for the price this cotton does the trick and is a great value!</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending too much money on wicking material from my local vape shop.  This product is perfect.  Tastes great!  No problems at all.  I can now rewick my RDA anytime I need to.</li>
    <li> not bad-  once the juice finally soaks in-</li>
    <li> Love this cotton, well worth it. I highly recommend this for any Vape fanatic.</li>
    <li> Came fast works well. Dropped one star because feeding thru coils is a bit harder than regular organic cotton balls for me.</li>
    <li> Use product for wicking coils on my vaping gear. Works great!!!</li>
    <li> Been using these for my RDA, and they work very well. Happy with the amount I got for the price.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to rebuild the coils for my Aspire Atlantis.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s is cool , i like it</li>
    <li> Works great. No taste</li>
    <li> surprisingly the best cotton iv had so far. took 3 to 4 weeks but 200 pieces but this is an add on item so u need to buy $25.00 or more so buy some wire and new RDA but make sure to look up the RDA so u dont buy a crap 1. if u dont want a shop ripping u off start building its cheaper.</li>
    <li> Outstanding - A real big difference in flavor.</li>
    <li> Excellent flavor for you vapers out there.  It beats cotton balls by a mile.  No more boiling and unspooling.  These flat sheets are easy to cut strips off, and twist and wick.</li>
    <li> Great wicking on all my RTA&#x27;s and RDA&#x27;s, way cheaper the kendo</li>
    <li> puff puff puff enough said</li>
    <li> Perfect for vaping, screw buying these from your local BM for .50 per sheet.</li>
    <li> I use this for my vape mods and they work just fine. There is plenty of cotton,  actually there is so much I think I&#x27;m good for the rest of the year. For people who are not using for mods the cotton is very soft and organic.</li>
    <li> Nice price, good quality and fast delivery A+++</li>
    <li> Loved the product and the length of time to get here was really quick. Will Def be ordering more in the near future.</li>
    <li> I really couldn&#x27;t recommend this organic cotton more for the purposes of using it as a wicking material for electronic cigarette builds.  I used this cotton as a wicking material in my dark horse build.  I have not had to change the cotton yet and it wicks the liquid perfectly into my coils and has yet to &amp;#34;burn up&amp;#34; even when I let it run a little too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are not using this product for electronic cigarette wicking, the cotton is extremely soft.  There is no doubt that this cotton is organic and you can even see the occasional cotton seed in the puffs.  Absolutely fantastic quality cotton.</li>
    <li> I love the softness of these cotton pads. The size is just perfect to use (I use them to remove my nail polish with and the clean makeup off my face). I must add that my husband uses them to make vaping wicks and he&#x27;s thrilled. I would recommend this product for anyone who is searching for a cotton pad with no chemicals and that&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> Everything is great. Packaged good.</li>
    <li> this is like super wick, dont know how i used normal cotten before</li>
    <li> all good can use this will order some more later</li>
    <li> Real organic cotton pads!</li>
    <li> my husband asked to get this for his vapers this are the real thing I personally believe are great just be patient with the shipment because it takes a couple weeks but is worth the wait, one really cute detail is his son send you a treat witch is delicious!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect! My husband and I were using store bought cotton balls for vaping, leaving us with a toxic chemical taste when hitting our mods. With these I can taste every flavor as soon as I drip, without the added taste of chemical. :]</li>
    <li> Perfect for my vaping needs</li>
    <li> Cotton fer days. Don&#x27;t let brick and mortars rip you off. This will have you set on wick for months on end.</li>
    <li> Delivered as expected and looks and feels organic and the price was right.  I try to buy organic whenever possible, due to the toxins in GMO&#x27;s.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> best price anywhere.  i use it to make my vape wicks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the prettiest thing in the world, so I don&#x27;t use these as a beauty supply, but they are great for wicking a coil for a personal vaporizer.&lt;br /&gt;No taste, wick very well and a bag will last for a while, just finished my last bag after 9 months. I perfer this over Cotton Bacon, but some may not, I can&#x27;t tell a difference, but I also don&#x27;t believe every ad I read either. ;)</li>
    <li> Been using this for making coils and wicks in my ecig for a while now. I have no complaints, you are getting exactly what is described.</li>
    <li> Great for RDAs!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wicks very well, 3 tanks and not a dry hit this far.  Will definitely recommend for DIY vapors.</li>
    <li> The package is misleading. Is way bigger than it looks. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Took 2 months to arrive but when it did, man was it worth it. Cotton for days.</li>
    <li> Great for coil wick. Super good deal in terms of quality and quantity. Shipping took quite some time but whatever. Get these for a great vaping exp.</li>
    <li> So absorbent! So soft! So affordable and smells SO Nice!</li>
    <li> Super great for people looking for rda cotton</li>
    <li> Inexpensive japanese cotton wicks far better than standard organic cotton. Definitely worth the price for a good quality vape.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. All this cotton for 8 bucks is all love. I should be good for a year or two will all this. Flavor is also on point imo. Never used regular cotton so i cant compare. Dont plan on it either with all this japanese cotton.</li>
    <li> Burns at a low temp, tastes like crap after</li>
    <li> Works great.  Long shipping time tho.</li>
    <li> Switched to this from your regular run of the mill organic cotton as my primary wicking material. My clouds got bigger and dry hits are non existent. I also notice the draw isn&#x27;t nearly as tight as the other brands I have tried (been building my own coils/wicks for 3 years so consistency isn&#x27;t the issue.) I think I will be set for a few years with just this single bag so that is a huge plus! Well worth the wait and I will never go back to regular organic cotton.</li>
    <li> Good price and quality</li>
    <li> I bought these for vaping.  They really are great.  I can&#x27;t find a difference between these and the sheets I get from the local vape shop, except maybe these are a touch thicker.  No gross taste, and dry hits aren&#x27;t all that bad.</li>
    <li> Works way better than walmart brand cotton balls for vaping.</li>
    <li> Terrible in a rda, tastes disgusting</li>
    <li> Thought these were balls, but am glad they&#x27;re flat sheets, so much easier to work with.. Works great for wicking for my atomizers and there is no taste from them.</li>
    <li> amazing for rda, great taste.</li>
    <li> using with mist. works great so far</li>
    <li> To any one who says they can taste a difference in this a that expensive crap is a liar.</li>
    <li> I love this cotton.  Gives great flavor and clouds galore.</li>
    <li> Awesome cotton grate price, shipping was pretty fast ..no complaints here would buy again and recomend it highly</li>
    <li> Enough wicking material for my rda to last me a long time. No taste from these at all. Only wish they were a bit thicker like other pads but that&#x27;s on me.</li>
    <li> They arrived fairly quickly and were what I expected.  I use them for vaporizing and they are just fine.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the coil builders. I&#x27;m not gonna pay 20 bucks for five cotton squares from a vape shop when I can get this,  and be set for a year.  Vape shops...  Your cotton is not made of unicorn pubes and magic.</li>
    <li> Lots of cotton! No cottony flavor when used for vaping. This is exactly the same cotton that all these other people are selling 5 sheets for 20 dollars or so. They just buy these and put them in their own packaging, just buy this and it&#x27;ll last you a couple of years.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for vaping! I personally cut into pieces and remove the outer layers.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get to me, but well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> So nice cotton wicking is sick 👍👍</li>
    <li> Worth the wait - it does take a few weeks for it to arrive. But tastes great on every RDA I wick, and for under ten bucks you get enough cotton to last until hell freezes over.</li>
    <li> Quality Product and Shipped Sooner then Estimated Delivery Thanks Again (Good Price Too)</li>
    <li> These are great! I got these because I love high quality cotton for my skin care routine. They are natural and feel great on my skin, without the high price tag. Will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> Severely overrated cotton. There isn&#x27;t much difference to this cotton than an organic cotton, say the maxium cotton, that goes for a lot less! This however is a bit more thicker leading to more dry hits on RDA/RBA&#x27;s. Go with Maxim organic cottons instead.</li>
    <li> No crappy chemical taste AT ALL in my RDA.  Can only taste my liquid in my ecig.  It&#x27;s worth the two week or more wait.  Cut in strips and go nuts.  This stuff is awesome for atomizers/RDA&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ll never be able to use anything else now.</li>
    <li> First time using this cotton for vaping. Works great.</li>
    <li> Just what the vaper ordered.  Fast shipping and works great.  In fact works so great I bought 2 packs.</li>
    <li> Great tasting cotton! No i don&#x27;t eat it.. I use it for wicking like most of the reviewers here.... and very soft and gentle for the rare moments you want to use them on your face</li>
    <li> Same stuff as a lot of the vape shops sell here in Las Vegas, just much cheaper. This bag will last me over a year, maybe two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This cotton works great for vaping. It wicks easily and performs great. I highly suggest once you receive this opening up the package and letting it sit and breathe for at least 3 days. I made the mistake of opening it and immediately throwing it into a new coil build. Has a rather off putting taste to it. But it goes away completely if you let it set in the bag with the top open for a few days. Great buy for a cheap price in bulk.</li>
    <li> thank you very much.terbaik..</li>
    <li> Best wicking material I&#x27;ve had yet, I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great for wicking! No weird taste, and the cotton comes in little squares which makes it easy to cut strips and wick!</li>
    <li> works great for RDA builds and vaping!</li>
    <li> definitely worth the wait</li>
    <li> They work great for my vape gear</li>
    <li> Great Cotton for Vaping! Fast service too! Will buy again when i ever run out</li>
    <li> A family member ordered this a while ago for his vaping needs , which is my same desire. I used this to wick up a 28g 4 wire twisted kanthal build. Using this dual coil at 0.2 ohms 100 watts .  Flavors are excellent and soaks up juice so well . Why pay 5 to 10 dollars for a few pieces of what shops claim to be high end cotton when you can use this ? I&#x27;ve used koh, samurai, organic cotton balls , unicorn cotton, etc . This is a beautiful equivalent for so much cheaper . I ordered my own pack tonight . Since i have amazon prime, with a 35 dollar purchase it&#x27;s guaranteed to arrive this afternoon . I&#x27;ll receive this product within 12 hours of ordering it . So excited .</li>
    <li> 8 bucks for 200 pieces of Japanese cotton? Yes please. Great quality cotton perfect for pv&#x27;s. Way cheaper than getting from vape suppliers or shops.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition and works perfectly for wicking my RDA&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is excellent organic cotton for the price! Seriously best value. I have a supply that will last me for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very absorbent, dense, and very easy to work with. The fibers have a direction and work really well when cut into strips.</li>
    <li> Shipping is much faster than expected.&lt;br /&gt;I love the softness of these puffs.  It is good for any use.&lt;br /&gt;Have to say, this is the only &amp;#34;worry free&amp;#34; cotton puff I&#x27;ve ever used.  Not like the ones I got from grocery store, this one will not break apart or leave lint on my face AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t help it, I am getting more!</li>
    <li> Great flavor in my vaoe pen</li>
    <li> Took a month to get here but was WELL worth the wait. Vape shops must of bumped there heads thinking they can charge what they do for cotton that isn&#x27;t even as quality as this stuff. I use a LOT of cotton between all my RDA&#x27;s and addiction to making coils.... and I still havemore than half the bag.... months later! I&#x27;ll be buying from these guys as Kong as they&#x27;ll sell it to me.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Nothing but taste!!!!</li>
    <li> The Best wick a Vape Head can buy</li>
    <li> If you are thinking about making the switch to organic cotton, get the japanese cotton right here. I use it in my dripper and it is full on flavor from the start. Best stuff ever.</li>
    <li> Working as intended. Better than expected.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality cotton.&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Lots of cotton, cheap, used for vaping.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Comes from Japan so dont expect speedy delivery, its gotta go through customs.</li>
    <li> Little on the non-soak side. I have had other cotton pads before, this one wears out faster a little, but until then, it performs ok. So, cheap to get, but use more then other types.</li>
    <li> Item is same as as described and the cotton pads separate very easily, No muss no fuss. quality product and the price is insanely low. I needed this for my RDA And RBA&#x27;s,works very well.</li>
    <li> Way cheaper. Long time for delivery. But very much worth the wait. Great price. Large quantity</li>
    <li> To use it as vape supply, it lasts FOREVER!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product :)</li>
    <li> Unreal value. Package came fine, no defects. Get great flavor in my RTA, and I&#x27;ll have enough cotton for years lol.</li>
    <li> great item fast shipping</li>
    <li> very comfortable and soft!! Good for applying toner and removing makeup</li>
    <li> Excellent for RDA&#x27;s, RDTA&#x27;s and is just simply better than any other cotton for vaping. You can&#x27;t beat the price or quality....I didn&#x27;t get any free candy from Japan :-(</li>
    <li> Great for vaping wicks!</li>
    <li> mostly clean cotton. Great for use in vaping when you cut away the 1/4 of the pad with leaves on it.</li>
    <li> This was the first cotton I&#x27;ve ever bought, so I have noting to compare it to. I will say it met my expectation, but not enough to warrant 5 stars. I good product to get at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great cotton for your ejuice</li>
    <li> Very good cotton.... Very large package and can last me life time for vaping ....  It has little black stuff ... Somes in it .... Don&#x27;t be worry. It is because  the cotton is organic....  Yea .. So don&#x27;t freak out.  I would say for the price .... Give it a go.</li>
    <li> Great cotton. Great experience</li>
    <li> best cotton for vaping I&#x27;ve had so far, 200 pads vs 60 or 80 from KGD and about half the price for a bag. i get about 10-15 wicks from one pad. this will last you a long time, can&#x27;t beat it. wicks juice amazingly good and i think it gives a better flavor than other cotton brands.</li>
    <li> My favorite kind of cotton for wicking my mechanical mod. Great value, great product.</li>
    <li> I used these for vaping.  Awesome quality and have plenty so I won&#x27;t run out any time soon!</li>
    <li> great product and i love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the ado about the great taste of these is about, but they work very nice as facial wipes.  I cut them in 1/4&#x27;s and figure it will last for years:)  Great product.  Thanks for caring enough to grow organic!</li>
    <li> not linty, very soft, absorbent, good price I was debating buying this as a facial pad because of all the reviews about the lint and a lot of reviews about using it as a lighter wick. However, it was best value for the money so I took a chance, and I&#x27;m glad I did. Just one-two pads dampened with makeup remover liquid is enough to clean my entire face (with a lot of mascara and dark eye makeup). Note that I used the pad as is, did not separated it any thinner. If you separate it, you might get some lint, but in any case, it&#x27;s not too crazy expensive (7.69 for 200), just use a whole pad.  Also, just in case you&#x27;re wondering, they&#x27;re softer than Swisspers Hypoallergenic Cotton Rounds sold on amazon and at Costco, as well as the up&amp;up cotton pads sold at target. Those are suitable for cleaning nail polish lol. The Deleon that costco used to sell is a little bit better but still not as soft as these, and Deleon has a weird &amp;#34;mesh&amp;#34; on both sides of their pads (what for??? Only if someone can enlighten me).  There are brown spots, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Took a little while to arrive, but that&#x27;s okay because they are worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Great for your rebuild able atomizers! Pretty quick shipping for the fact that it comes from Japan</li>
    <li> This cotton is very good for rebuilding your attys! Cheap and you get a lot, a vape shop will probably charge you about half the cost of this for a few pieces(~4). This is authentic organic cotton and its on par with Koh Gen Do cotton but this is made in nature and pretty much alike. This is a Medium size cotton pad and still does the job. This is worth the money and the shipping was quick, came a lot earlier than expected and prompt shipping the next day I ordered.</li>
    <li> So I bought this item due to a friend advising me to start using JDM non - bleached organic cotton for the wick of my vape coils. I would say the flavor is much better than I expected, well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> Great Organic Cotton!  You can use this as wick in your RDA/RBA, or apply Toner apparently!  I might need to get some Toner (Once I find out what it is) to see what the Hype is about.  You can also Swab things!  I&#x27;ve never been into that, but who knows what tomorrow brings!</li>
    <li> now i have an unlimited supply of cotton for my vape. AND i can wipe some oil off my face when i need.</li>
    <li> Simply the best cotton product I have ever put inside an atomizer coil!</li>
    <li> Great for wicking rda&#x27;s</li>
    <li> On par with other Japanese cotton, a must buy!</li>
    <li> Cotton came faster than estimated the flavor with this cotton just is amazing i will not get any other cotton any more and want need any more for 2 years probably bought 2 paks</li>
    <li> Use this for my rdas and best I found still have plenty left after giving some to a local shop and friends to try will be ordering more. No bad taste or need to boil</li>
    <li> Great organic cotton for your RDAs. I also used this cotton to rebuild an Atlantis V2 coil. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Thought they were cotton balls but turned out to be cotton squares.</li>
    <li> Received my order in excellent condition. This cotton might last me a year.</li>
    <li> Was just what I was looking for, shipping was a tad bit lengthy, however, quality of product by far made up the difference in wait time. Neatly packaged and arrived without a hitch, I&#x27;ll be ordering from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally ordered these for wicking my RDAs, ability to hold and soak up my juice is fantastic, flavor is also amazing.</li>
    <li> Japanese cotton is best, square flat sheets make it easy to cut and work with.&lt;br /&gt;Holds more liquid and seems to wick faster. This will make you blow bigger clouds. Plus this will last me over a year. I highly recommend, if you want the best buy this right now. Hide it from your mom and sister they will steal it.</li>
    <li> The pads feel nice but they come apart in the bag so you end up having to use 3-4 of them at a time. For instance I use it to apply facial toner and one pad is not nearly sufficient to wipe my face with. Would be useful if each pad were stitched close like other makeup pads because you end up using so many for a few uses</li>
    <li> This is the best deal I&#x27;ve ever seen for this product! Excellent quality!</li>
    <li> Ko-gen-do happens to simply be a brand name. This is the real thing here! Whether for hygene or wicks, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using mine for wicks for a vape. Size M is ideal for 22mm drippers or for tanks, with most builds. The straightened, organic cotton threads run 5cm long, in sheets 4cm wide. 200 count makes for a long-lasting personal supply.</li>
    <li> Great for wicking your rda. Great flavor, consistent,  and thick pads.</li>
    <li> Great price and very nice for vaping.</li>
    <li> I bought these for wicking material for my RDA/RBA builds because Organic Japanese Cotton has the cleanest vape, and most consistent wicking ability.  The local shop sells a very similar pad in packs of 10 for $20, but they are thinner and have imperfections... not near the quality of this cotton!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bag should last me YEARS... However, my wife and daughter have discovered how soft and durable they are... and now I have to share with them for their \\&quot;beauty needs\\&quot;, lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/16/15:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared this cotton to KGD and Muji (both high-end brands of Organic Japanese Cotton) in wicking tests (speed and volume), using 100% VG, 100% PG, and 50/50 solutions.  All strips were cut to exactly the same size.  KGD and this cotton are nearly the same thickness and the Muji is slightly thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Selena brand cotton wicks faster and higher (in vertical capillary tests) than both KGD and Muji with 50/50 and PG solutions, and wicks exactly the same as KGD with VG solution (both beat Muji).  Volume testing allowed 1-minute soak in solutions and the KGD held more volume by weight than this cotton, but only by 0.05gm, regardless of liquid used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both KGD and Selena out-performed Muji in every test.  For the cost, even though these are smaller pads (length/width), these out-perform KGD in cost-savings, performance, and are close enough in overall volume absorption to be equal.</li>
    <li> Cotton for years. Good for wicking&lt;br /&gt;easy to cut, tear, and form&lt;br /&gt;clean flavor</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Don&#x27;t waste your money on any other cotton sold on ebay or online store. This is great product at very reasonable price. It takes a while to arrive (1 month for me) from Japan but it&#x27;s worth a wait. Will definetly buy again before my batch runs off. Thanks cotton labo.</li>
    <li> Nice product, so smooth. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like these facial puffs much better than the ones that you can find in drugstores. I can&#x27;t use the ones that don&#x27;t have a smooth texture (like the cotton puffs that have a pillow texture/pattern on them) because my skin is so sensitive, but these puffs are so soft! The only thing I would change about these is the loose fibers that they give off. The edges aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;sealed,&amp;#34; per se, so that it is possible to pull these apart and potentially release loose fibers (perhaps problematic when removing eye makeup). Otherwise, my skin like these so far and they are just big enough to remove a full face of makeup.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in the rba wicks very well.  Lots of flavor</li>
    <li> I use these as wicking material for my coils in my rebuildable atomizers, &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; in this case, refers to how the cotton is produced, NOT how it&#x27;s grown and means that it is free from chlorine bleaching and other processes that may introduce nasties into your cotton that you wouldn&#x27;t wanna vaporize and inhale deeply into your lungs! Great for what I need them for, some vaper&#x27;s don&#x27;t like this size but all your doing is cutting off the excess and tossing it in the garbage so for me they are perfect.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff if you need wicks for rebuild-able vaping devices. Great price too!</li>
    <li> Great wicking for e-cig. Shipping was not as bad as listed.</li>
    <li> I use this cotton for e-cig wicks on all of my Kanger Protanks as well as my Kayfun Light Plus v2.  It is very clean, free of junk you don&#x27;t want/need, and improves the flavor of your juice.  The difference is noticeable compared to other wicking material.  This cotton is superb and I would certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this for my dripper.</li>
    <li> Great product for my intended use! 100% Prue Nature Made Organic Cotton Pads at a Great Price !.. I will be a repeat customer !</li>
    <li> Makes dripping a much more pleasant experience</li>
    <li> Really nice cotton. Great flavor for wicking an RBA. This enough cotton to last for years and years.</li>
    <li> I use this in my coil builds, wicks great, no leaks, awesome flavor. This bag will last a long time!!</li>
    <li> You are sitting there looking at this review asking if you REALLY want to take a chance on this stuff right? Well that cotton you use? Most likely over paid for it. And that clone tobh? yeah you can afford to save a buck or two right? Who will turn down a great deal?! Just try it and you will understand why I took the time to type this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this cotton is a bit more puffy and thick compared to the majority of the foreign cotton pads out there. This is a good thing though because it takes less to fill a coil if it is puffy like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it in my Mutation X on my God Mod  (0.69Ω at 88-120W with duel 24 Gauge 12/13 wrap around a 9/64 bit.) This is my every day build. I have been on Jap cotton for maybe 3 months now. I have used several brands and done some driving to check out what other shops sell. No one has anything this &amp;#34;Puffy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff wicks somewhat better then the others and the burn from a dry his doesn&#x27;t make you want to puke a lung out. Don&#x27;t get me wrong... It still sucks but it&#x27;s somehow not as bad and it will take what I can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line-Getting 4 bags of these in the mail was like opening up an amazon box and finding it filled with stacks of cold hard cash. I have enough cotton to last quite some time. I would ask everyone to give this stuff a try. I was right to trust all other 5 star reviews. I fully expect the seller to be sold out of this stuff soon.  All tests done on juice from Nixteria dot com.</li>
    <li> I bought this for rewicking my rebuildable atomizers. It works well and I will certainly be using it for that but I have to honestly say I like the Swissper organic cotton better. I can&#x27;t tell any difference with taste using this or the Swissper organic cotton. However the Swissper organic cotton is much cheaper and I don&#x27;t have to spit layers or cut strips using that like I do with this.  I can thread the Swissper cotton through my coils easier than this as well. I bought this style because of all the good reviews and had to see if it had better flavor than organic cotton balls, but for me, there isn&#x27;t a difference. It&#x27;s just more expensive!</li>
    <li> The cotton is great quality and you get A LOT of it, way more than what I was expecting which is great. The bag is about 10 x 5 inches and the cotton pads are about 2x2 squares, your definitely getting what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my mechanical mod e-cig wick. They are squares that are easily split to use as wick. A lot less mess and waste and leave my e-juices tasting great. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great price for a fabulous product.  It is coming from overseas, but it arrived quickly.. weeks before the expected delivery date.. works great for rebuild-able ecig coils!</li>
    <li> Great cotton used for wicking.</li>
    <li> Best material I have had for wicking! I have used cotton, organic cotton, rayon and standard silica wicks. This is not only great when it comes to absorption and retention but it is VERY easy to cut a strip from a sheet and roll it into a coil and have it maintain a consistent volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For cosmetics I am sure it is spot on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is very proactive in communication as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I would do business with this seller any time.. and will!</li>
    <li> Best cotton I&#x27;ve used thus far for vaping.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Will last me forever and soaks up ejuice really well.</li>
    <li> I switched to these from organic cotton balls for my coil building and wow! What a difference! The ease of getting the right amount, the flavor, everything is quite a bit better than the organic cotton balls. Will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty legit. Wicks and absorbs juice so much better then organic cotton balls. Highly recommend this product especially to those who drip. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I believe a 10 pack of Japanese organic cotton sheets at a local vape shop will run you anywhere from 5-10 bucks. Bang for your buck right here. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> Great quality and very fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to wick your rda you&#x27;re looking at the right product. Great taste virtually no break in. Soaks up allot of liquid. You&#x27;ll be hard set to run out of the stuff it comes with so much and it&#x27;s cheap. Look no further.</li>
    <li> By far the best wicking I have ever used for my RBAs. Came in a lot faster than I thought it would. Dont over pay for this stuff at your local vape shop, or even for the most popular Japanese cotton. THIS IS THE SAME THING. and you will have enough for a lifetime. haha.</li>
    <li> I use these for my rebuilding my RTAs. No funny tastes. Wicks great. These should last me a while!</li>
    <li> First off, I use this for wicking material in my mechanical vaporizers. Not some sort of makeup application or removal as I&#x27;m sure the creators intended. Next.. One sheet can wick about 3 dual coil builds and easily. This stuff is as thirsty as a fish in the desert! I can over fill an rda with juice and it&#x27;ll suck it all up quicker than I can see it. There&#x27;s no break in for flavor, the dry hits are flavorless clouds (no coughing), and it seems vapor production is maxed out with this in my rda builds. If you vape, you owe it to yourself to grab some of this asap!</li>
    <li> Excellent cotton. As others have said, it is ideal to use with mods.</li>
    <li> great + resonable shipping</li>
    <li> Perfect size for vaping. Just as good as the over priced larger pads from the Vape store. I would say I&#x27;d buy them again but I purchased 4 bags (800 pads) and they will probably last the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Works for what I use it for.</li>
    <li> Got the product as pictured. Shipping was late even though I paid for the fastest shipping available. Over all, coming from japan I got what I payed for and enjoy the product.</li>
    <li> Great for wicking your coils. Good price too.</li>
    <li> Shipping was good and packaging was good. The cotton is easy to use and has great flavor. You can&#x27;t go wrong with 200 pcs for this cheap. Definitely would recommend this stuff. Hell of a lot easier than boiling cotton balls.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, its enough to last a lifetime and it is excellent quality. Amazing for RDA&#x27;s and rebuildables, clean taste and very cool packaging!</li>
    <li> Used for Atomizer vaping/wicking. Flavor is good, but diminishes faster than other cottons. I change the cotton every ~4 days as opposed to every ~7 days as I had with others. That said, it&#x27;s an incredible value! I still use only ~2 sheets per month with changing it so often. That is more than 8 years of cotton for $7.76!&lt;br /&gt;For use, I split each pad into thinner halves (it tears apart easily) and then cut it in half again for a total of 4 strips/wicks per sheet.</li>
    <li> Received 6 days ahead of delivery date. I already knew Japanese cotton is superior to regular cotton and I confirm 100%  first of all there is absolutely no taste or at least very very minimal (if any) clothy cotton taste. That&#x27;s a major benefit for my vaping.  I absolutely hated that taste from my regular boiled cottons.&lt;br /&gt;Plus you can test it for yourself that this wicks better. Watch pbusardo on YouTube about his Japanese cotton test.</li>
    <li> This cotton has been the best cotton I have used for vaping.  It comes in squares and is easy to cut strips out of it to use in you device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t vape these are are still great.  They are unbleached and chemical free.</li>
    <li> This review is for all of you looking for a good Koh Gen Do replacement for wicking your RDA&#x27;s and RBA&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve used KGD for a while now and was running out of my supply so I needed to find a replacement. I was going to purchase more KGD however it is getting more difficult to find and thus the price has sky rocketed out of control. Planning on switching to Rayon (Cellucotton) for wicking I did some more research and am glad I did. Here&#x27;s a bullet point Pro&#x27;s vs. Con&#x27;s list I would like to share. I&#x27;ve used both Labo and KGD side by side and this is my honest opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Labo Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1) Natural, Organic, NOT bleached cotton&lt;br /&gt;2) Provides excellent wicking and fantastic flavor. Every bit as good as KGD if not better. Seriously, I believe Labo provides better flavor.&lt;br /&gt;3) Far less expensive&lt;br /&gt;4) Readily available&lt;br /&gt;5) Splits in half more evenly. I use micro-coils and have found that both KGD and the Labo sheets are bit too thick so I split them in  half after cutting my strips for wicking. I find that the Labo sheets split in half more evenly then the KGD thus giving me more usable cotton material.&lt;br /&gt;6) You don&#x27;t support the vapor shops that are jacking up the price of cotton wicking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral: Labo and KGD&lt;br /&gt;1) Both KGD and Labo seem to wick juice equally well&lt;br /&gt;2) Both are natural, organic and not bleached&lt;br /&gt;3) Both come in the same style of sheets (pads) and can be cut and wicked the same&lt;br /&gt;4) The Labo sheets are smaller then the KGD sheets. Labo sheets are roughly 2.25&amp;#34;x2&amp;#34; and KDG sheets are generally 3&amp;#34;x2.5&amp;#34;. That being said, you get more (qty) Labo sheets in a package and I would guess the total cotton is about equal.&lt;br /&gt;5) Both seem to last just as long between re-wicking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Labo Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1) If you&#x27;re dead set on using Koh Gen Do this is obviously not the product for you. The placebo effect can be strong and some people may be so convinced that KGD is the absolute best. For those of youthat feel that way, spend twice as much as get the KGD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m at the point now where I&#x27;m sticking with Labo Cotton. I have no plans, even if and when KGD becomes more readily available to switch back to it. I have nothing against KGD at all, it&#x27;s a great product. Now that I have tried the Labo Cotton i&#x27;m perfectly content staying with it for my rebuildables.</li>
    <li> shipping time:a littlle too long.&lt;br /&gt;product:good deal</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I have used various types of cotton and also cellucotton and this out performs all of it. Vaper approved!</li>
    <li> Super clean taste. Love having square sheets to work with as well.</li>
    <li> Great price. Great product. I can get many wicks out of a single sheet and this stuff will last forever.</li>
    <li> fantastic! Tell your son thanks for the piece of candy! :)</li>
    <li> Great Kapanese Organic Cotton at a great value!</li>
    <li> TOOK A MONTH TO ARRIVE IN THE MAIL.....BUT THIS WAS EXPECTED SO NOT AN ISSUE ....GREAT QUALITY ....I DID BOIL IT WITH DISTILLED WATER JUST TO BE SAFER....IT WICKS EJUICE AMAZINGLY WELL...IN THE EJUICE ....WELL...;-)</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and well packed. Great product, organic and clean.Thank you for candy and note with a personal touch. I would recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the Bomb!! Perfect for rebuidables. It is the real deal organic, non bleached cotton squares. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Delighted with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I used some &#x27;cardé&#x27; cotton or &#x27;fonty&#x27; on my drippers, I doubt to continue to use them.</li>
    <li> So soft, delivered so fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as wicking material for vaping. Works great. A bit off-white because it is organic/unbleached. The rectangular layered format makes it easy to cut and shape.</li>
    <li> Excellent -&lt;br /&gt;Item delivered on time, was as described. I use it for vaping and think its very good. This one bag will do me for years.</li>
    <li> Perfect for use with e-cigerattes</li>
    <li> GREAT SHIPPING AND PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Best deal going for quality wicking material.</li>
    <li> had been vaping on other types of cotton organic as well , but as soon as I wicked my rda with this cotton WOW! The flavor was just there good stuff worth every single penny . I have cotton for a good year now :)</li>
    <li> No chemical taste. No need to boil. One piece can stuff about 10 builds. The only real issue that I have is trying to keep it away from my girlfriend, who thinks I should share it for her makeup needs.</li>
    <li> Good cotton for vaping</li>
    <li> This is a quality item</li>
    <li> Fantastic.  Decent shipping time frame. Quality is great. If using for vaping this is a must. Full flavor. Nice and easy to work with. Repeat buyer for months to come.</li>
    <li> Use this for wicking my RTAs and RBAs. Works just fine. Better than organic cotton balls.</li>
    <li> I was very happy and impressed. Great for wicking Smooth Vaping.</li>
    <li> I was getting ready to rewrap my new coil with cotton when my mom told me I got something from Japan took about 10-15 days it takes so good</li>
    <li> Incredible! A lot of people will use this for make-up, but for me, I use it for vaping. It&#x27;s a good feeling to know you&#x27;re not inhaling bleach into your body from the cottons you find at the local stores. This pack of cotton will most likely last you a good year or two also. Purchased this at the beginning of 2015, and still haven&#x27;t gotten half way through it! A great buy, and shipping was prompt.</li>
    <li> Great vape, wicks dry and easy to deal with. Has a better taste then organic cotton balls. Order only if you are patient enough to wait 3 to 4 weeks for cotton.</li>
    <li> Works Great with Kanthal coils in my RDA.... It does not have a strange taste on the first ejuice run... compared to cotton i purchased locally...&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed I can drip on this cotton for several days... I changed wicks every 2 days with regular cotton...&lt;br /&gt;GOOD STUFF :)</li>
    <li> Use these for my mods.  Works great!  Of course you get that &amp;#34;cotton taste&amp;#34; at first, but a puff or two and bam! delicious flavor of your choice!</li>
    <li> initial taste is apparent but once broken in flavor is amazeballs</li>
    <li> Well,&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re going to use this for wicking in your vaping device then DO NOT WAIT ANOTHER MINUTE - ORDER NOW!&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to use this to clean up your makeup in the evening (or morning!), do not wait, ORDER NOW!&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to have some use for organic cotton, do not wait, ORDER NOW!&lt;br /&gt;If you want to support the fight for Global Warming and go Green, ORDER NOW!&lt;br /&gt;If you are reading this review, do not finish reading it, ORDER NOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the M size (60x80mm) and &amp;#34;Size it is PERFECT&amp;#34; (now honestly, if you are a woman how many times were able to say this!?), but me, I cut this in half (60x40mm) and then I cut a ~4mm strip for each wick I need (so a total of ~ 30 wicks/pc) - works wonders and it is wet-wet-wet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May seem expensive, but trust me, it is not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you all the best &amp; big clouds of vapors!</li>
    <li> This worked for my cape dripper.</li>
    <li> we use these to make wicks for RDA (vape, ecigarettes etc.) we have had better japanese cotton, but its pretty good overall. I also used it once for its actual intended use on my face and it was very soft, but i wouldnt wait a month while it gets delivered on a boat just for cotton puffs for my toner. Definitely awesome for vaping wicks tho. Great deal too if you dont mind slower than fastech pace.</li>
    <li> Damn only 5 stars???? Koh gen do what????? So cheeep.</li>
    <li> shipped faster than anticipated very happy with purchase will buy form again.</li>
    <li> Super absorbent cotton for vaping! My flavor comes through perfectly with no off taste at all ever! No dry hits and massive clouds! To me its better than Koh Gen Doh!!! And the price is AWESOME!!!! Im glad i got 400 sheets of it LOL</li>
    <li> got exactly what i expected! use it for wicking on my rda!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product and it is definitely lot of cotton for the price. The product arrived pretty early than what amazon showed as the expected date. It came pretty nicely wrapped. It is definitely lot of organic cotton for the price. Stores at my place fraction of the cotton at 4times the price of this one. If you can wait for sometime, definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Great for what I use them for and lasts forever!!</li>
    <li> As in the title, this review is for vaping purposes, not cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have bough regular organic cotton, [[ASIN:B00260T94K Selena Multi-layer Cotton Puffs - 80 sheets]] and [[ASIN:B00IKIV8R8 MUJI Japan Facial Cotton Puff (129 sheets)]]; of all 3 I prefer the Selena one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this particular brand is very curious, is not pure white, it has some seeds (I hope that they are not impurities), the pad are thick and get fluffy when divided, in comparison, the other brands are almost paper thin and quite homogeneous, white and without seeds; but anyway, the flavor is great and wicks as expected. so that&#x27;s that, totally recommended.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay for wicking, only problem is you have to be really gentle pulling it through the coils, it&#x27;s very fragile and pulls apart easily</li>
    <li> i use these for vaping. and i love them. i find a slight flavor for the first couple of puffs (maybe its because im used to organic cotton balls) but it does go away quick. they seem to absorb alot my juice then the organic cotton balls, and easier to wick with. i also get a lot less dry hits when using my goblin and subtank!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Unlike most here, I actually use these on my skin. I use it for toner application, and I personally like these squares way better than cotton balls. It just seems like more of the toner gets onto my face rather than stays in the cotton. And wow, I don&#x27;t know why these are so much softer than the organic balls, but they are. And don&#x27;t worry if you see black or brown spots on these, that just means they&#x27;re actually organic.</li>
    <li> Cotton arrived quickly and plentiful. Great for vaping with Rba&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I use this for my Electronic Cigarette wicks, and it works great! Very clean cotton and wicks fantastically!</li>
    <li> Above and beyond what I was expecting and the best cotton product to vape off of with a rebuildable mod!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised works great</li>
    <li> Great wicking material!</li>
    <li> I am using this for wicking material in a personal vaporizer and it is hands down fantastic. No issues whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure if I used beauty products it would be awesome at that too.</li>
    <li> Very good for vaping.  No taste of cotton. Have to remove the top layers since they are too compact, but a nice alternative to the ones all ways sold out..</li>
    <li> Paid the same price for 3 pads at Vape shop. Works great. Easy to use. Enough to vape forever.</li>
    <li> Shipping took a while but they stated that when I purchased it. I use this organic cotton for vaping and it is really nice. The squares make very consistent wicks once cut.</li>
    <li> Absolutely necessary for vaping, super easy to work with and wicks like a dream.</li>
    <li> Works better than cotton balls for wicking all my ecigs, cheaper than any other seller. Worth the wait for shipping (3 weeks for me), will last well over a year.</li>
    <li> Great product for vaping will definitely but again.</li>
    <li> Took a little long to get.  But we worth the wait.  Got this for $10 at the time and only used about 10 sheets of it.  This will last forever and did I mention it&#x27;s organic?!  No need to bleach, ready to vape.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best cotton there is! product is smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Just did my first build with this stuff on the subtank mini RBA. Bought this because I was running out of the cotton that came with the tank. Kanger says that what they include is organic cotton but after trying this for the first time, i do not believe them at all! This stuff tastes extremely good, I was getting certain &amp;#34;notes&amp;#34; in the flavor of my juice I never was getting. It is way more flavorful in general and I was getting a great tangy sour flavor I never got with the stock sheet of cotton, plus this will last me for an insane amount of time. I never thought I would geek out so hard about cotton a month ago, haha. Really satisfied with my purchase and in 10 years when i run out I will definitely order these again!</li>
    <li> loving these cotton pads! pleased to see little specs in the cotton as well. tells me it is as natural and organic as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i peel off the outer compressed cotton to reveal the super fluff in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i no longer use white organic cotton balls because they are obviously bleached and treated with god knows what.</li>
    <li> I use this cotton for my vaping rda&#x27;s and it works GREAT!!!  Does not affect the flavor of my e-liquid what so ever and is very easy to wick.  GREAT VALUE!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I never do amazon reviews, this is literally my first one. I felt compelled to get the word out there, these cotton puffs are PERFECT for wicking in an e-cig. If you&#x27;re currently using hemp/non-japanese organic cotton and you&#x27;re on the fence about trying this, DO IT. You won&#x27;t regret it. The thickness of these are nice, personally I take them apart to remove about 1/4th of the width to fit in my coils, but they will work without. The flavor off these cotton puffs are unmatchable, it even made me enjoy a juice that I previously put aside thinking I wasn&#x27;t a fan of it. DO IT!</li>
    <li> This is even better than the whole foods organic cotton. Perfect for cutting into strips in my magma and so absorbent. It&#x27;s my new go to wick</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived in about half the time estimated! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and is fantastic for vaping!</li>
    <li> Livraison très longue, autrement super</li>
    <li> excellent quality japanese cotton, works very well with vaping, taste my juices better as well</li>
    <li> Amazing cotton for my vape. No dry hits, wicks super fast, and overall a huge improvement over regular cotton balls.</li>
    <li> Oh my, oh my is this cotton incredible! I use it for my RDA (AR mod with a Tugboat) and I have never came across any cotton that&#x27;s better than this stuff. Shipped very quickly and is 100% authentic Japanese cotton. Wicks last a long time and produce wonderful flavor. Once I&#x27;m done with this bag in a couple of years (lol) I will come right back and buy another! Best cotton out there for RDA&#x27;s 5/5</li>
    <li> Great quality, great price!</li>
    <li> Really good for rebuildable electronic cigarettes, they absorb liquid even faster then regular organic cotton balls</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic for wicking RDAs and RTAs. One bag will do you for very VERY long time. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought this product and got it 3 months later. Never. Again.</li>
    <li> I use my cotton for applying toner. This pack gives you A LOT of cotton pads which I love. The pads stick together a bit, but still great and does not leave any residue of cotton on your face! I have already purchased this item TWICE!</li>
    <li> The best cotton for my makeup needs(super soft and absorbent ) and my husband&#x27;s vaping needs. He uses a dripper and this cotton allows for maximum flavor. The bag lasts a long time. I will definitely being ordering again and sending more people to get this cotton!</li>
    <li> Took a long time to get here but was perfect for my rda/rba needs. Great deal!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to use as a wick for vaping. And I must say it&#x27;s performance in that department is amazing. I believe this is due to the fact that the fibers all run in the same direction causing it to wick extremely fast. I will say that I had difficulty at first with dry hits but that was largely due to the fact that I did not peel off the outer most layers (which are much denser than the middle). Once I started doing that it was amazing, I haven&#x27;t had a dry hit since. I will definitely be purchasing more, although the 200 pieces should last quite a while.</li>
    <li> They get the job done. Kind of fall apart when applying toner.</li>
    <li> Great for RBAs and RTAs.</li>
    <li> this cotton is very good!</li>
    <li> Mine arrived with the top broken open, but the product itself was fine.</li>
    <li> Best for wicking my coils</li>
    <li> Great product, but took about a month to receive it.</li>
    <li> Great Quality. The Vape is tasting great</li>
    <li> Excellent wicing material</li>
    <li> Absorbs great for wicks in my kayfun, no complaints, this bag will last me forever.</li>
    <li> The taste is a little off the first couple but hits, was different than what i was using before.  The best part is if you happen to take a dry hit it isn&#x27;t harsh at all.  You can almost always pull some form of flavor out.  The last cotton I had used if you took a dry hit your throat would burn and taste something awful.  Plus for the price and amount you get, i&#x27;ll never have to buy cotton again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic organic cotton, perfect for gaping and I don&#x27;t taste a thing like you do with kanthal. With a bag this large I won&#x27;t be needing more for a really long time.</li>
    <li> The best cotton for the lowest price. The size is perfect for wicking.</li>
    <li> Works really well for my rda.  This is basically a life time supply for mex</li>
    <li> This is really good for rda builds</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT stuff....I&#x27;ve tried a few different wicking materials and this is now my go to.  great price, shipped quick. Fantastic performance. you wont be disappointed give these a shot!</li>
    <li> I found these are not great for vaping</li>
    <li> Great for wicking e cig</li>
    <li> Use these for my RDA. Work great!</li>
    <li> Long Shipping but good quality</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome for vapeing, I would have giving it 5 stars but it took almost a month to get here. seriously though if you are looking for great cotton for your coils this stuff rocks</li>
    <li> Exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
    <li> The best organic cotton I ever use for rebuildable ecig atomizers, I like also the unique knowledge of japanase to made this kind of quality product.</li>
    <li> Amazing for re-wicking RDA&#x27;s!!</li>
    <li> I really love how well this makes great wicks for vaping. I wicks well and you will have wicks forever. A great buy. I would recommend this for any vapor.</li>
    <li> more air than cotton, sure it is fluffy like cotton, will pull apart easily, low density, no body!  some people will like this cotton, soft, cushe, clouds.If this was thicker and more texture i would buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this product as wicking material for my Vape Pen, and for the purpose for which I&#x27;ve obtained this product, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Plus, it&#x27;s really soft. My girlfriend uses it for make-up or something. She likes it, too. However: The small specks of impurities in this product, make the flavor in my Vapor Pen vary slightly. Overall - 9/10 product quality.</li>
    <li> This product is great. When I originally purchase it, it shipped directly from Japan. I took about 2 weeks to receive the product, which is pretty normal. This was purchase for my RDAs, since every one is hyping about organic Japanese cotton in the vape world. Well no I understand why so many people switched over. The flavor is great and the cotton soaks up the 100%VG with no issues. I would recommend this product to any vapor, especially since the shops are trying to charge $3 for 5 squares. Good luck and enjoy.</li>
    <li> excellent cotton for vaping, nice flavor ,smaller sheets for less waste</li>
    <li> these are the same bags that my local vape shops use. But Its much cheaper here. Its all I vape on these days</li>
    <li> Great for my e-cig wick.  No chemical taste from the 1st puff to the last comparing to bleached cottons.</li>
    <li> Great price. Good product. It doesn&#x27;t really stay together when I apply toner with it though...</li>
    <li> I use this for vaping e-cigs. Works great, easy to manipulate and you get more than enough to last you. Be sure to peel the top layer off though and use the fluffy inside if you&#x27;re using this for vaping.</li>
    <li> Tastes great and came over a week earlier than Amazon said. I can&#x27;t taste the difference between this and KGD. And nothing beats the price and the satisfaction of seeing people&#x27;s happiness when you give them some for free because 200 sheets is more than enough.</li>
    <li> Great for vaping! We use this in our e-cigarettes (mechanical versions) and it works great. Great deal for the money and nothing vapes like Japanese cotton.</li>
    <li> Works well and great taste for vape products!</li>
    <li> Stop wasting your money on Koh Gen Do! These are basically the same thing. Same size/thickness. Same little specs in the fiber. I&#x27;ve used these in RTAs and RDAs, single coil, dual coil, pillow builds, etc. Great performance and flavor.</li>
    <li> Best wick I&#x27;ve used yet for my vape. Absorbs well and does not dry hit like cotton.</li>
    <li> So the cotton is what I was expecting. it seems pretty good for vaping so far, the one downfall is how long it took for shipping, which was a few months so not so happy about that</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as a wicking material for vaping an RBA.  For that purpose it works very, very well.  It&#x27;s absorption rate is better than regular cotton balls and it&#x27;s wicking ability is better than Kanthal.  No added flavors or chemicals.  All in all the best material I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> if your a vaper and are reading this wondering if it makes goot wicking material for a dripper well you would be correct! its really nice stuff!</li>
    <li> Excellent value and top quality organic cotton. This will be my source from now on!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve been using it for months, and each time I build a coil it&#x27;s a fresh clean taste. I&#x27;ve had plenty of different cottons that just tasted like a burnt t-shirt until you burn it off. This is almost a lifetime supply lol I give it out to my boys all the time</li>
    <li> high quality cotton- very soft. I have a little trouble separating each one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this cotton for rebuildable atomizers. And it&#x27;s amazing. Wicks much better than your normal American organic cotton. Needs no boiling, because it&#x27;s not lightened up with Hydrogen Peroxide like the American stuff. It&#x27;s all around great. And you get an absolute ton of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are various vape shops selling small, maybe 3 squares of cotton, baggies for a few bucks. This is 200 of those squares for 10 bucks. Win. Win. Win.</li>
    <li> Too awful  quality, it&#x27;s dirty and damage ,delivery to long time. Never  bought  again</li>
    <li> (For Vapers) Cotton is VERY easy to use and has a great taste</li>
    <li> Perfect for rebuildable atomizers! Wicks so well!</li>
    <li> They work great and my vapor taste great. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how there are a lot of good reviews but these have a terrible taste!! I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing something wrong but it&#x27;s like almost like burnt rubber. I used it on my rba kanger mini and rebuilt aspire Atlantis coil and has a very bad taste. Almost made me throw up!</li>
    <li> Used for dripping atomizer wicks.  Works great. Probably more than I can ever use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product as expected. Too bad the coils couldn&#x27;t be recottonized as hoped however to extend the life of those only with the better cotton! Will be keeping this onhand however for that time when some RDA that does work comes along!</li>
    <li> I just got it and it&#x27;s perfect for Vaping, and on top of that it got here before the estimated delivery date</li>
    <li> Great wicking cotton at a fantastic price. Bought  3 more bags.</li>
    <li> Super convenient, works well, and it&#x27;s a lifetime supply!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Faster than estimated shipping. Well packaged. I would buy again and absolutely recommend this seller!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cotton for vaping in my RDA, and it is hands down the best wicking material I have used. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I only using this as wicks in my rebuildable atomizers.  This is way more cotton than I expected.  I&#x27;ll NEVER use it all but, I would definitely buy this again if necessary.  I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else because I&#x27;ve used nothing else.  No pre-boiling needed.  Resealable package.</li>
    <li> Great product, but maybe not for Vape...</li>
    <li> BEST organic cotton for rebuildable atomizer wicks. Works amazing. RECOMMENDED!!</li>
    <li> Every bit as good as Koh Gen Do</li>
    <li> Product is good though shipment arrived a little bit later than expected.</li>
    <li> Great quality&lt;br /&gt;met all my expectations&lt;br /&gt;better than the other more common cottons&lt;br /&gt;on the market!!!</li>
    <li> Real deal. Quality product. Great price. Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> :) top quality would recommend and will buy from again</li>
    <li> A lifetime supply of coil saturating goodness. Arrived promptly and unsquished.</li>
    <li> I use this for my face. I add my toner on it and wipe my face and the quality is amazing. It&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t break apart. It takes long to come so when I&#x27;m half way through I purchase more so it doesn&#x27;t finish on me because I refuse to use anything else from now on on my face besides this! Will forever be a customer !</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff, get some!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> i really like it easy to wick absorbs juice amazingly well and alot faster then regular cotton balls i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great wick for vapers! No boiling needed.</li>
    <li> Pay the extra ten dollars for the expedited shipping.  It took five days to get here from Japan.  23 dollars seems high for cotton but the pack will last you a Long time.  200pcs of cotton and you can get between 8-10 wicks per square.  If you&#x27;re rebuilding only kayfun style atomizers you can double or triple that number(if you like to save scraps).  This cotton is in squares.  You can easily tear straight strips and it cuts perfectly if you&#x27;re using scissors.  It tears away in even layers if you need to make your wick smaller.  Each square may have a couple pieces of sand or earth embedded in it but it is easy to remove with a pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> best wicking material for rba.</li>
    <li> Best vape available. May not wick as well as rayon, but it tastes just as good, and holds more juice! Not to mention it&#x27;s an organic product of nature.</li>
    <li> Perfect wicking material for RDA&#x27;s. I actually prefer the medium size over the larger pads. If you cut strips from the short end you will have no wasted wick. Flavor is clean and the liquid is absorbed immediately. This package should last a very very long time.</li>
    <li> great product thank you</li>
    <li> Best wicking material for RDA N RTA. I tried organic cotton and other wicks and this is the only stuff I&#x27;ve gotten that will feed my prometheus rta. I love this stuff.  Great natural flavor and wicks great.</li>
    <li> It meet my expectations,&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;JAI</li>
    <li> Works great on my mod</li>
    <li> Awesome feeling cotton, and thank you very much for the free candy from Japan! This was a nice surprise.(:</li>
    <li> love the taste of what make of my e-liquid flavor</li>
    <li> Great Product, Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> works great easy to use</li>
    <li> Excellent product, and very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery for a good value, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Best cotton I&#x27;ve ever used.  Seller responds very fast and has his customers in mind always.</li>
    <li> Very very good product!</li>
    <li> Prepare to be amazed!  Best tasting cotton for a vaper I&#x27;ve ever had.  Seen those cotton pads in your local vape shop?  15 bucks for two pads and a piece of wire?  I&#x27;ll take the ~30 day wait over a hype train any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus mines \\&quot;Made in Nature\\&quot;, what&#x27;s yours?  Organic?</li>
    <li> Good Product Fast Shipping Would Buy Again!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I agree with the above 5 star reviews this stuff is legit!</li>
    <li> This cotton is great to use with electronic cigarettes as wicking material. It wicks very quickly, and doesn&#x27;t have the terrible taste that synthetic cotton balls which are bleached have. The cotton does not taste nearly as bad when burnt, making dry hits suck just a little bit less. If you use it for electronic cigarettes, be prepared to split it with at leas one friend, as this is enough cotton to last you a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Such a great value, and exactly what I needed. With 2 bags, I have enough wicking material to make coils for the next 2-3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great for wicking coils!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff for all my RDAs and it works great. Great value!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!!  Keep it this price and you have a buyer 4 life</li>
    <li> Good for Vaping and the cotton is amazing, hands down some of the best cotton I have ever used.</li>
    <li> AmaZing wicking product! Recommend to any fellow vapers</li>
    <li> Excellent Cosmetic facial puffs!  Wife has no complaints, and we have reordered several times!  Like the fact that they are organic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for about a year now to wick my vape ( and I still have half the pack ). flavor is top notch and you cant beat the price. my sister even uses them to apply her face cleaners and she loves them too</li>
    <li> Great Cotton for vaping.</li>
    <li> The real deal at a great price.</li>
    <li> Perfect for home made coils for vapers</li>
    <li> I use these cotton pads for cosmetic purpose. I&#x27;ve not used it for vaporizer so not sure what it tastes like but I do know it works quite well for toner application. It&#x27;s thin but it holds together just enough to finish the job. Anything more heavy duty than cosmetic application might be too much for this pad. It&#x27;s very soft and it definitely looks unbleached and has no smell to it.</li>
    <li> Well worth the wait took a month and 2 weeks to receive from Japan will definitely be reordering again</li>
    <li> Kills some of the flavor of the juice.. But holds alot of juice</li>
    <li> This is the best cotton for wicking coils! 200 pieces is quite a lot so I have enough to hand out to all my friends, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is some really nice cotton, and it came alot faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> Great cotton for vaping.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, wont buy anywhere else!</li>
    <li> Perfect for vaping, amazing price. Only wish I had discover it sooner!</li>
    <li> Extremely soft. I dip it into my coconut oil then wipe my eye makeup off with it. Perfect for the job. For a gentle scrub to pair with my toner I use the up&amp;up cotton rounds with the small bumps on one side (from Target) to exfoliate my face and remove excess make up.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re gonna wait for it, but it&#x27;s 100% worth it!</li>
    <li> Great flavor out of my rda with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Using it to vape.  Tastes great, wicks well, and there is a TON of cotton.  This will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the different types of wicking material for my rda&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve always gone back to cotton balls. My friend gave me 4 squares of this stuff and im hooked. No weird flavor, no more pulling a finger full off when it gets jammed in your coil and a fresh wick will get every last bit of juice to the coil. I&#x27;d say I will be buying more, but I dont even know if I&#x27;ll ever use all of this stuff. I bought 2 bags of it. And those 5 sheets lasted me a month. Great product! Dont peel it though. Cut it, roll it, pull it through and juice it. Happy vapin.</li>
    <li> Perfect for micro colis. Better than other kind of cotton I have tested.</li>
    <li> Super Soft! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Got here pretty fast. This is some fine wicking material for my rebuildable atomizers and will last me a very long time. For the price it is a bang for the buck deal!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.....wicks very fast</li>
    <li> I use this cotton for my electronic cigarette. For this purpose it really doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> This is awesome JC for vaping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, rayon is great but I find JC to provide a smoother vape and to last a bit longer between re-wicking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2 cents.</li>
    <li> This was my first foray into Japanese cotton for my RDA. For those of you wanting to know the specifics (so you know if this product can handle your build) - I&#x27;m running dual parallel coils. 24ga Kanthal 2.0mm coils. 6 wrap on a IPV3 150 watt IPV3 box mod. The RDA is an authentic Plume Veil.  It tests in at approximately .12 resistance. My sweet spot is about 80watts with that setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the cotton is easy to peel in half with very little shredding. Very little loss there. I cut just under 1/4&amp;#34; wide strips and it rolls like a dream. Because the cotton strands are so long, it makes threading the wicks a piece of cake. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cotton stands up to heavy duty vaping far better than regular organic cotton balls. This stuff has me spoiled!  Try it.... you&#x27;ll like it!!! Great flavor, faster wicking for you heavy hitters out there.</li>
    <li> Good for vaping.  Wicks excellent.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Reasonably fast shipping.  I will use and recomended this product.</li>
    <li> USED THESE IN MY RDA, AND TRUST ME THERE NOT THE SAME. DON&#x27;T FOOL YOURSELF.</li>
    <li> Great for cosmetic use or wicking material. I ordered it for wicking material, but it&#x27;s so much nicer than the cotton pads I&#x27;ve been using all my life. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great cotton great price</li>
    <li> Great cotton, definitely can taste a difference between this and 100% cotton balls. Wicks great and seems to last longer in a rda at low ohms(.08-.2).</li>
    <li> Good quality and can&#x27;t beat the price.  I&#x27;m mainly using for wicks in my vape rebuildables, but my wife want&#x27;s some now for her makeup and facial routine.</li>
    <li> Great product. Paid more than it costs for shipping though. If you use slow shipping its worth it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a Great wicking item!! If you try these you&#x27;ll never go back. it&#x27;s honestly so much better of a cotton for wicking e-liquids</li>
    <li> Hi, I wrote a review before and complained about the time of delivery. However, I received the product today and I like it very much. It&#x27;s carefully packed and with very sweet notes. The quality of the product is very good. I hope I can delete my previous review. This is a nice product.</li>
    <li> Wicks e-juice, tastes great!</li>
    <li> Nice clean burn....This big bag will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Works well for rda&#x27;s in vaping. Enough cotton to last a lifetime, great value.</li>
    <li> SOOO much better than the regular cotton balls I&#x27;ve used.  Once you switch, you won&#x27;t go back.  Has a very clean taste IMO.</li>
    <li> More cotton that I need . Fast shipping from overseas.</li>
    <li> Perfect,  and shipped quickly.</li>
