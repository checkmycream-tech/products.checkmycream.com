      <li>Absolutely STUNNING article: great scent, and looooong lasting, all day long as just used!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an old spice fan, and this scent/style is my favorite right now.</li>

      <li>I like the product very much</li>

      <li>Also, you focus far too much on RETURNS.  </li>
      <li>Even in the few times my husband used it, I felt as though the scent was too strong.</li>
      <li>Finally, the orientation of this section of product feedback implies so much of the problem is the product/vendor.  </li>
      <li>First of all, it took entirely too long to determine a way to give Amazon feedback that you SHORTED me on this order.  </li>
      <li>Last time I will try an Old Spice product since it feels like all your paying for is advertising and a brand name.</li>

<li> Weak scent.</li>
<li> and it makes my armpit stink in a cold winter day and smells like baby powder</li>

    <li> Makes white marks on clothes.  Weak scent.</li>
    <li> Last time I will try an Old Spice product since it feels like all your paying for is advertising and a brand name. Ended up throwing these out after going through 1 stick. The anti-perspirant just would not hold up after even 2 hours, even in dry colorado weather. I would recommend any other anti-perspirant over this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for my husband without reading the fine print (my fault). He only likes deodorants, not anti-perspirants. My fault. Didn&#x27;t want the product to go to waste, so I tried using it myself during workouts or heavy hard work... any time in which I might be sweating up a storm. Works like a charm as an anti-perspirant! My only complaint... the scent. Even in the few times my husband used it, I felt as though the scent was too strong. Not a bad scent. Just too much of it.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an old spice fan, and this scent/style is my favorite right now. It isn&#x27;t powdery and doesn&#x27;t get everywhere, it&#x27;s effective at keeping sweat down, and best of all the smell is not obtrusive. It has a very clean scent, that is lightly present and noticeable at close range but not something that&#x27;ll stick out.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant! Love the smell and goes on great</li>
    <li> They have changed the formula and the scent, it dont protect me no more and it makes my armpit stink in a cold winter day and smells like baby powder, I want my money back, Im not going to use this and threw then in the trash because it made me grow a freaking absses on my armpit</li>
    <li> Very nice product - easy to use.- lasts quite well and the scent is very pleasant. I am female. I like the product very much and so does my son,</li>
    <li> Very reliable Old Spice.  Never fails.  It keeps the applied area dry all day and still maintain a nice scent.  Will definitely buy again. Old Spice is a cut above all other brands.  Strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s choice of brand - he&#x27;s been getting it for years - we&#x27;ve opted to buy multiples from Amazon for quite a little spell now. My husband says that a single of the product lasts him close to six months. It probably helps that he isn&#x27;t a heavy sweater - and that he works in a climate controlled office. All the same he is quite satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this stuff and I like the smell as well.</li>
    <li> Cheap deodorant, works well.</li>
    <li> First of all, it took entirely too long to determine a way to give Amazon feedback that you SHORTED me on this order.  That&#x27;s # 1.  Think about it Amazon, do you really want to offer customer service or do you want to make the customer work as hard as current-day phone customer service hell.  Because that is where you are headed, the site navigation and options simply to fix YOUR error are extremely sub-optimal.  I laughed at the language of one field that said \\&quot;YOUR ISSUE\\&quot;.  You should try the language, \\&quot;Our Mistake\\&quot;.  Let me guess, you have an ex-Microsoft employee scripting online feedback!  Their customer-focus DNA is non-existent -- go the other way! Also, you focus far too much on RETURNS.  This is not a return, you shorted me, I only received 5 of 6.  Understood, we are not talking big money, but I expect much much better execution than this; moreover, it appears someone opened the bag labelled \\&quot;Sold as a set\\&quot;.  Why? Theft? Another customer needed a single? -- you need to look into this.  Finally, the orientation of this section of product feedback implies so much of the problem is the product/vendor.  You need to offer equal chance to give feedback on your service.  If you want to try it, pretend you were shorted an item and seek resolution.  Finally, I have a photo -- no easy place to submit it in the feedback area.</li>
    <li> Absolutely STUNNING article: great scent, and looooong lasting, all day long as just used!&lt;br /&gt;I definetely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Have been using this stuff for years! Love the scent pure sport.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for a very long time can go 2 days if in a pinch.. how many other brands can say that!</li>
    <li> My husband smells so good when he wears this! Sometimes I will use it too!</li>
    <li> I forgot to get this for my husband at the store so I just ordered it on here. Came to the house and he never knew I forgot.</li>
