      <li>Thank goodness this product is available from somewhere.  </li>
      <li>its great to travel with if you can put some in a smaller jar.  </li>
      <li>My skin was smooth and non-greasy at all times.</li>
      <li>My order came in a package of three 8 ounce jars, and every one of the jars has a sizable gap from not being properly filled.  </li>
      <li>Online it appears to be available in the UK and Australia, but not in the U.S.</li>
      <li>This was an awesome product I would highly recommend &amp; wish they would put it back on the market.</li>
      <li>The first ingredient is water and is more of a moisturizing cream.</li>
      <li>Palmers cocoa butter formula is in my opinion better and the first ingredient is cocoa butter.</li>

      <li>I love this stuff, glad to see it back on the market.  </li>

      <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
      <li>This is quite possibly the best thing on the market for extremely dry skin.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the most moisturizing butter I have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the $10.</li>
      <li>It is immediately absorbed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it if you can afford it.</li>
      <li>i really love every thing the smell and how its keep my body soft</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever found for keeping my feet soft in this hot, dry Arizona weather!</li>
      <li>As for the cost, compared to other body butters I have used, this a a good price.</li>
      <li>And, usually, I look great when I leave the house.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for the past month, and my skin is healing very nicely.</li>
      <li>I have used so many different body butters.</li>
      <li>Having had some minor skin irritation, this worked better than anything I tried.</li>
      <li>I use the whole Vaseline Cocoa Butter line.</li>
      <li>Its a bit much to pass through airport security...</li>
      <li>It really is a &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Smells divine and really works.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see myself changing to anything else as long as this stuff is available.</li>
      <li>I have a mild case of psoriasis and the Cocoa Butter is the ONLY over</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many products for dry skin and so far this is the best without the medicinal smell and the sticky feeling left behind by other products.  </li>
      <li>After 2 or 3 applications my cracked heels look brand new.</li>
      <li>Not the typical strong cocoa butter smell.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your skin very soft and it&#x27;s not greasy.  </li>
      <li>Tried it on a fluke on one of my Walgreen binges and damn near used it all in a week!</li>
      <li>My first purchase of the Cocoa Butter Body Butter was made in a local store.</li>
      <li>He has continued using it and the Cocoa Butter keeps his skin totally clear.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and conditioned.</li>
      <li>I really love this product and it&#x27;s very hard to find.  </li>
      <li>I thought vaseline is so common in the US, it must be really easy to find in local store.</li>
      <li>My 22 year old son has had extreme eczema his whole life and has tried dozens of over-the-counter and prescription creams and lotions with no success of clearing up his skin.</li>

    <li> My skin is EXTREMELY dry. I have used so many different body butters. And, usually, I look great when I leave the house. But, by the afternoon, my legs are very dry and ashy. Not with this butter! I use the whole Vaseline Cocoa Butter line. I start with the gel, follow it with the lotion, and end with the body butter. My skin looks and feels wonderful. And, I don&#x27;t feel too greasy (I admit, I like to feel a little sheen). As for the cost, compared to other body butters I have used, this a a good price.</li>
    <li> My 22 year old son has had extreme eczema his whole life and has tried dozens of over-the-counter and prescription creams and lotions with no success of clearing up his skin. He tried the Vaseline Cocoa Butter and immediately saw his skin improve. He has continued using it and the Cocoa Butter keeps his skin totally clear. We have recommended it to others and they&#x27;ve had the same satisfactory result. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product for a long time and cannot find it in stores. I am so happy that i found it on Amazon. It leaves my skin feeling soft and conditioned. Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for dry skin and so far this is the best without the medicinal smell and the sticky feeling left behind by other products.  It leaves your skin very soft and it&#x27;s not greasy.  This is a wonderful product for all skin types.</li>
    <li> Man or man, do I LOVE this stuff or what? Tried it on a fluke on one of my Walgreen binges and damn near used it all in a week! I used it daily from head to toe. Aside from loving that it&#x27;s made w/shea butter, it&#x27;s also very light &amp; creamy, yet soaks into your skin &amp; makes it nice &amp; soft w/out being greasy, with a light smell like a ... cookie (LOL!) It&#x27;s like rubbing whipped cream on yourself w/out being sticky.... not that I would know about whip .... Anyway, seriously, I like this stuff &amp; will continue to use it always. Good job, Vaseline!</li>
    <li> I really love this product and it&#x27;s very hard to find.  So when I finally found it I did not want to get my hopes up but the product was really good.  I have been using it for weeks now.</li>
    <li> Great product for guys and gals.  Not the typical strong cocoa butter smell.  It absorbs fast and rubs on easy. Its a bit much to pass through airport security...and they will take it, but its great to travel with if you can put some in a smaller jar.  It does  not interfere with any other fragrance that you care to wear.  I don&#x27;t see myself changing to anything else as long as this stuff is available.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, glad to see it back on the market.  However, I guess the seller is actually providing factory seconds.  I wish I had known that before I ordered.  My order came in a package of three 8 ounce jars, and every one of the jars has a sizable gap from not being properly filled.  Love the product, not at all happy with the provider.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many creams over the past recent years, including expensive name brands, to moisturize and, in time, heal my dry and scaly knees.  Sorry it sounds awful, but it&#x27;s true.  My kneecaps were very dry, rough, dark, and ugly. And no matter what cream I tried, nothing worked.  I bought this product, Vaseline Cocoa Butter, in the hope that it might help the dryness. It did that and much more. After a few uses, the skin over my kneecaps softened.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for the past month, and my skin is healing very nicely. My knees are no longer scaly, rough, and the darkness is almost gone. I also use this cream over the rest of my body.  I highly recommend this product.  It works!</li>
    <li> I got this on a whim from Jewel-Osco and instantly became addicted to it! Having had some minor skin irritation, this worked better than anything I tried. It also comes in handy on elbows.  I ran out a week ago and have had the hardest time finding it. Now I see it&#x27;s on backorder from Amazon. Is this discontinued for some reason?</li>
    <li> This is such a terrific product I cannot imagine why it is being discontinued.  I have a mild case of psoriasis and the Cocoa Butter is the ONLY over the counter product(of all those that I have tried) to keep it under control.  Living in the mountains of Colorado where the humidity is very low only serves to aggrevate dry skin conditions and Cocoa Butter is a savior!</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis this helps to keep it soft and it also is wonderful for those rough heels. My sister in-law turned me on to this product, give it a try you will love it to.</li>
    <li> I have tried body butter after body butter for years and my search is finally over.  This is by far the most moisturizing butter I have ever tried.  I no longer have problems with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Bummed I can&#x27;t find this in the store anymore.  It is awesome!  I like palmers too, but this body butter lasts waaayy longer. It just goes farther.  I am putting together a \\&quot;my favorite things\\&quot; package for each of my sisters and this 3 pack is great!</li>
    <li> This is the best, bar none, body cream for dry skin.  With shea butter and cocoa butter why wouldn&#x27;t it be?  Smells divine and really works.  I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find in retail stores but I ordered mine on line and it came in good time in perfect condition.  Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> As is par for products lately this \\&quot;cocoa butter\\&quot; is not what I was expecting. The first ingredient is water and is more of a moisturizing cream. Palmers cocoa butter formula is in my opinion better and the first ingredient is cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> I bough this body butter in the UK because it was only a couple pounds. Used it for a week and found out it is truly the best body butter I have ever used before. My skin was smooth and non-greasy at all times. Not to mention I have had eczema for around 10 years now, and this is one of the product i will use continuously for my hands. I thought vaseline is so common in the US, it must be really easy to find in local store. I am very disappointed to find out vaseline does not distribute it to the US stores. I hope they see the increasing demand and reconsider bringing it back.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever found for keeping my feet soft in this hot, dry Arizona weather! Item is unavailable in local stores so Amazon was my answer.</li>
    <li> I hate that I&#x27;m only recently finding out about this body butter. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been informed after emailing Vaseline that it&#x27;s discontinued in the U.S. due to insufficient demand from customers. It is the best body butter that I&#x27;ve used. Online it appears to be available in the UK and Australia, but not in the U.S. If you ever get a chance to try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. To me, it&#x27;s one of the best products Vaseline has made.</li>
    <li> I grew up on the Vaseline. My first purchase of the Cocoa Butter Body Butter was made in a local store. Fell in love with the stuff. The store stopped carrying it so I ordered through Amazon.  WAY, way too pricy for me. It&#x27;s worth it if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> This is quite possibly the best thing on the market for extremely dry skin.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the $10. per jar they charge in the stores. It&#x27;s so good that I ask people to buy it for me as gifts.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best ever skin cream. It is not greasy and does not leave a coating. It also smells nice and clean. I bought it in the stores last year and can&#x27;t seem to find it this year. Thank goodness for Amazon! they have it!! After 2 or 3 applications my cracked heels look brand new. It is just the best.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness this product is available from somewhere.  I don&#x27;t understand why this stuff is not being sold in stores locally.  It really is a &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; cream.  After spending hundreds of dollars on prescription creams and lotions for my husband&#x27;s skin problem, a week using this and he is almost &amp;#34;cured.&amp;#34;  I swear by this product and appreciate Amazon carrying it.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I use it daily for my face after showering and shaving.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> i really love every thing the smell and how its keep my body soft i love it and i will buy it again</li>
    <li> This works so much better than lotions.  It is immediately absorbed.</li>
    <li> I loved this item, it is ashame they stopped producing this. I hope vaseline will bring this item back on the shelf.  Very good for the winter months.</li>
    <li> Love this body butter,used to be able to buy at Wal-Mart or Kmart but can&#x27;t find anywhere so was very happy to find on Amazon, leaves skin soft with a light glow,love it.Margaret Porath</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is discontinued, unfortunately. Once I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any longer, I began purchasing it online. Now, I am unable to find it at all! TOO BAD! This was an awesome product I would highly recommend &amp; wish they would put it back on the market.</li>
    <li> This product proved NOT to be what I ordered.  I have ordered the product in the past.  The description and picture showed the Body Butter with Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter.  I received items completely different from the product pictured in the order photo.  It does NOT have the Shea Butter.  It is Cocoa Butter only.  I am trying to figure out how to return it and receive either a refund or the proper product delivered.  I am NOT HAPPY!!!!! Could you please contact me to let me know who I could contact about my concern?  Thank you.</li>
