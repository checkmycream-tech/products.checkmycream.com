    <li> it was very think and did not smell very nice.  I didn&#x27;t feel that it helped very much.</li>
    <li> Staple product! I am a product junkie and this is the only shampoo that keeps my dandruff at bay. I even started to use on my 7yr old son. The conditioner has great slip and makes detangling my natural hair a breeze.</li>
    <li> Worked really well on my dry scalp.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are one of the better products I&#x27;ve ever used for dandruff. It cut down on flakiness and itchiness a lot.

    <li> Did not do what I expected for dandruff and dry scalp. The tingling felt like it was really working but the flakes were still there after many washes.</li>
    <li> The glossifier has sulfur in it and am allergic to sulfur so it was a disaster to use it. Shampoo and conditioner are fine but the dandruff situation on my scalp didn&#x27;t go away. :-(</li>
    <li> Works great and not an overwhelming medicine smell on scalp. Conditioner works good leaves hair soft an easy to comb through</li>
    <li> very nice for itchy scalp</li>
    <li> These products really controls my dandruff.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite of mine. I have dry scalp and so far it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works to help keep the dryness to a minimum. If you have dandruff buy this. You&#x27;ll be glad.</li>

    <li> Through the years we have tried every natural and chemical option out there to soothe my husband&#x27;s itchy scalp.  He does not have dandruff or any diagnosable condition the Drs can come up with but does tend to have very dry skin.  Until he tried Keracare shampoo and conditioner nothing brought scalp relief for more than a very short time.

I can honestly say that after using this for about a couple weeks my hair feels healthier I don&#x27;t scratch alot and my flakes are dissappearing. I would recommend this and I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Is exactly what I needed for my dry scalp.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  The smell of the product is not desired, however, it works pretty good.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> liked the shampoo and conditioner... The glossifier makes your hair feel like you just put grease in it, makes your hair look like that as well</li>
    <li> A must have for anyone with dandruff. Almost complete eradication of the enemy upon one wash! Bottles are smaller than perceived but a little goes a long way. Left hair clean and shiny, healthy looking and not parched, but without the flakes.The glossifier was good for first application but after one wear became quite greasy, not suggested for someone who wears 2-day-hair. Next on to the 5-in-1 reconstructor....</li>
    <li> Was recommended by my stylist; does the job well!</li>
