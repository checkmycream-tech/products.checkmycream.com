      <li>im at the point where i have to purchase each child their own</li>
      <li>kind of look.</li>
      <li>The nice thing about this pomade is that it has a nice smell</li>
      <li>, I assumed it would just be for people who liked axe stuff( which spending time in the boys locker room I&#x27;ve grown to despise) and it wouldn&#x27;t hold well</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be honest.</li>
      <li>It washes out very easily at the end of the day with just water.</li>
      <li>I personly would have liked it if it was more of a petrolatum based product.</li>
      <li>It also smells nice but not too strong.</li>
      <li>There are much better products out there</li>
      <li>Think more of a &amp;#34;I got a job interview</li>
      <li>Much better than a gel.  </li>
      <li>but in a more reserved &amp;#34;spiffy&amp;#34; fashion.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>(I wear my hair slicked back, which Suave worked perfectly for)</li>
      <li>love it&lt;</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re just looking to spiff up your unruly hair for a bit, it&#x27;s okay for it&#x27;s price, but if you want to do anything else</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay pomade, and it get&#x27;s 3 stars</li>
      <li>But you&#x27;ve got to love a product that dares to call itself &amp;#34;spiffy</li>
      <li>wanted more of a slicker look, not &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; but &amp;#34;spiffy&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I think it smells interesting.</li>
      <li>Got this to replace my Crew brand pomade, I love it.</li>
      <li>There are much better ones.</li>
      <li>i love this stuff.</li>
      <li>When applying, be sure to take a dime size portion, rub it vigorously in the palms of your hand and apply it in your hair.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair slightly more manageable throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I originally used Nature&#x27;s Blessings because it washes out very easily with shampoo, but when I ran out and didn&#x27;t have time to order more, I just picked this up to try it out.</li>
      <li>Item is just as described, I was looking to try a different type of hair product and this product is very good.</li>
      <li>Great for a professional look, but not a rigid as a gel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that if you want a greasier look with this product it is best to apply it when your hair is wet and comb in.</li>
      <li>And I was really hoping to have a good experience with this &amp;#34;spiffy&amp;#34; pomade.</li>
      <li>For me I needed shampoo to wash all the product out but it was easy.</li>
      <li>This is NOT for 100% molding but it allows you to get a more clean look compared to what your morning hair would look like.</li>
      <li>However its easy to work with.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to be that strong, Don&#x27;t expect it to be that shiny,</li>
      <li>I have all the other products but this is works best for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is best used to keep slightly frizzy or &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; hair in place.</li>
      <li>It holds well enough and the smell is great.</li>
      <li>product in particular has been a nice replacement to hair gel, which often gives me headaches.</li>
      <li>- they love it so much!</li>
      <li>I received this item by mistake, but I am glad because it works pretty well for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a teenager, I rock a comb over as my hairstyle,I have used pomades from groom and clean to sauvecito</li>
      <li>Basically, if you normally just wet your hair, style it with your hands, and then go, this is perfect for you.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s white and goes in good.</li>
      <li>It really looks more paste like.</li>
      <li>It smells great and that&#x27;s about the only positive thing I could say about this pomade.</li>
      <li>pomade dries and sets in your hair quickly, within 5-10 minutes, a bit shorter than competing brands.</li>
      <li>Good for medium long hair.</li>
      <li>enjoy the scent and always have positive responses from friends and the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I often wind up using guy&#x27;s products to try and do something with my straight, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Prior to Old Spice, I favored Axe.</li>
      <li>The smell is great, if not just a little overbearing at first.</li>
      <li>It really compliments the original scent antiperspirant and the swagger spray deodorant.</li>
      <li>This product does a decent job at adding some body and light holding power without being overly greasy or shiny.  </li>
      <li>This stuff hold better but is not thick or stiff, smells better, and leaves a nice natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>Its not as good as a Mitch or an American Crew but its much better than the other brands.  </li>
      <li>funny being that it is a product kinda like axe</li>
      <li>, boy was I ever wrong, within a minute my hair was Combed perfectly and guess what, stayed in place!</li>
      <li>I tend to like American Crew more for not leaving my hair feeling like I just put glue in it.</li>
      <li>After the first time I used it, I had immediate regret and wished I didn&#x27;t make the purchase.</li>
      <li>It leaves a pretty noticeable tacky residue on your fingers, and I&#x27;m sure will do the same on my pillowcase.  </li>
      <li>I have used American Crew, Axe, and Suave Pomades in addition to this product and they are the basis for my comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the four Pomades, this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>it has a reasonable amount of strength, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy or oily!</li>
      <li>(it actually doesn&#x27;t work well if you use too much), and be glad it washes out, unlike waxy pomades.</li>
      <li>To my surprise it was white and resembled a paste which isn&#x27;t really like most pomade products.</li>
      <li>Both are priced more reasonably per ounce compared to American Crew and Suave.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite products from Old Spice to date.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using their products for 15 years after my inheritance included the majority of my grandfather&#x27;s Old Spice</li>
      <li>(it actually doesn&#x27;t work well if you use too much), and be glad it washes out, unlike waxy pomades.pect</li>
      <li>This is the only product that I have found that works with fine hair.</li>
      <li>It gives a much shinier look though.</li>
      <li>if I applied too much (not leaving my hair goopy or greasy</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much</li>
      <li>it to be that shiny, Don&#x27;t use too much</li>
      <li>He really likes how it makes his hair look.</li>
      <li>Due to the lighter texture, it was much easier to apply and style my hair, and much more forgiving</li>
      <li>my hair for a slight more shine</li>
      <li>all I would HIGHLY recommend this Item.</li>
      <li>At first glance, Old Spice does not appear to hold as well because it leaves your hair with a soft texture.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m a teenager, I rock a comb over as my hairstyle,I have used pomades from groom and clean to sauvecito or however it&#x27;s spelled, so far while wielding ok results, at the end of the day unless I spent half an hour coming it into a shape that will not move or putting a few spurts of hairspray, the back would come disheveled(I have medium length thick Mexican hair and a severe cowlick in my crown), but my mom got this product from the store, me being the kind of guy I am, I looked at it funny being that it is a product kinda like axe, I assumed it would just be for people who liked axe stuff( which spending time in the boys locker room I&#x27;ve grown to despise) and it wouldn&#x27;t hold well, boy was I ever wrong, within a minute my hair was Combed perfectly and guess what, stayed in place!</li>
    <li> My product came with deposits settled in. This may be due to long exposure to heat or aging.</li>
    <li> Dries with zero greasiness, but holds all day plus.</li>
    <li> This literally DOES what its suppose to do! I use it when my hair is wet and i wear a hat for a bit before i start molding what i want my hair to look like. This is NOT for 100% molding but it allows you to get a more clean look compared to what your morning hair would look like. Just a dab of it is enough, no need to over sculpt your hair. The smell is great, if not just a little overbearing at first. I cant describe my hair other than... spiffy</li>
    <li> I received this item by mistake, but I am glad because it works pretty well for my hair.  I am a female, but I have a really short style so I often wind up using guy&#x27;s products to try and do something with my straight, fine hair.  This product does a decent job at adding some body and light holding power without being overly greasy or shiny.  The consistency is strangely similar to Noxzema creme.  The smell is subtle rather than being an overpowering Old Spice scent so it would be appropriate for either gender.  &amp;#34;A little dab &#x27;l do ya&amp;#34; so the jar will last quite a long time.  It can be applied to either dry or damp hair.  If you run your fingers through your hair later in the day, you will definitely be reminded you used the product that morning.  It leaves a pretty noticeable tacky residue on your fingers, and I&#x27;m sure will do the same on my pillowcase.  But you&#x27;ve got to love a product that dares to call itself &amp;#34;spiffy Pomade&amp;#34; in the year 2015.  Dapper Dan, look out!</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite it smells great and does the trick.</li>
    <li> I bought this pomade after I ran out of my previous cheap pomade that has been discontinued (Suave).  If you&#x27;re just looking to spiff up your unruly hair for a bit, it&#x27;s okay for it&#x27;s price, but if you want to do anything else (I wear my hair slicked back, which Suave worked perfectly for), it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
    <li> For a bit of background, I have short, thick, dark colored hair. I have used American Crew, Axe, and Suave Pomades in addition to this product and they are the basis for my comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the four Pomades, this is my favorite. Prior to Old Spice, I favored Axe. Old Spice is priced identical to Axe in retail. Both are priced more reasonably per ounce compared to American Crew and Suave. The Suave and Axe Pomade&#x27;s are nearly identical is substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Old Spice is white in appearance in the jar, this initially concerned me that the Pomade would not go on completely clear, leaving white streaks that you can sometimes get. These fears were unjustified and it went on completely clear, leaving no streaks to work out. The pomade has a more gritty texture, and is nowhere near as thick as the competing pomades I mentioned. That being said, I had to use almost twice as much of the product to get a similar effect on my hair as competing brands. Due to the lighter texture, it was much easier to apply and style my hair, and much more forgiving if I applied too much (not leaving my hair goopy or greasy looking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pomade dries and sets in your hair quickly, within 5-10 minutes, a bit shorter than competing brands. At first glance, Old Spice does not appear to hold as well because it leaves your hair with a soft texture. This is not true. To test the hold, I wore a hat for short periods throughout the day, the style held without issue. This leaves you with a benefit of soft, natural feeling hair, combined with the draw of pomade: a wet, clean, styled look. Old Spice does not leave as wet of a look as the other brands, but personally for me, this was a benefit, and it still left me with the clean appearance I was looking for. I cannot comment on how this product would fair for longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Old Spice does not run at all and is never sticky (an issue I had with American Crew). It washes out very easily at the end of the day with just water. Even if you were to sleep with product in your hair, as I did after a night of drinking, there is no concern of leaving residue on the pillow. On a side note, the product smells phenomenal and is the best smelling of all the brands. The odor is not overpowering, but is noticeable for the first few hours while you wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I burn through the remaining products I have, I will be switching to Old Spice exclusively.just water.

    <li> my children love this stuff!  they grab it up as soon as it comes in the door.  im at the point where i have to purchase each child their own - they love it so much!</li>
    <li> The only pomade (at this price range) that works for me.</li>
    <li> I got this for my nephews &amp;#34;Mohawk&amp;#34;, and ended up ordering a second for my husband! Excellent all day hold, great smell and no sticky feeling!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products from Old Spice to date.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using their products for 15 years after my inheritance included the majority of my grandfather&#x27;s Old Spice collection.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the scent and always have positive responses from friends and the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product in particular has been a nice replacement to hair gel, which often gives me headaches. This product never leaves my scalp soar or tender and it smells amazing. It really compliments the original scent antiperspirant and the swagger spray deodorant.</li>
    <li> love it&lt;br /&gt;smells great</li>
    <li> This pomade was not intended for a slick, greasy look. Think more of a &amp;#34;I got a job interview but I want to look like I wash my hair&amp;#34; kind of look. I would say use this pomade for when you want to style your hair as you normally would but in a more reserved &amp;#34;spiffy&amp;#34; fashion. We all have different go to options for a night out vs our 9-5&#x27;s, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container contains a generous portion of pomade. To my surprise it was white and resembled a paste which isn&#x27;t really like most pomade products. It really looks more paste like. Texture wise it reminded me of a molding paste that I used manufactured by another company. The pomade itself smelled great and it works great to style your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attached a picture of my hair with the product. As you can see it isn&#x27;t greasy but it looks styled and it holds well. Your hair isn&#x27;t firm feeling but soft and smooth. When applying, be sure to take a dime size portion, rub it vigorously in the palms of your hand and apply it in your hair. I&#x27;ve found that if you want a greasier look with this product it is best to apply it when your hair is wet and comb in.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to slick your hair back or do any gravity defying tricks, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is best used to keep slightly frizzy or &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; hair in place. Basically, if you normally just wet your hair, style it with your hands, and then go, this is perfect for you. It makes your hair slightly more manageable throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Works well. Smells good too. However, I feel like I have to work it into my hair for a while for it to hold. Might be causing some hair recessions since I&#x27;m working with my hair for a lot longer than traditional hair gel.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a wax based product. I personly would have liked it if it was more of a petrolatum based product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay pomade, and it get&#x27;s 3 stars because it&#x27;s average, which is what I think Old Spice goes for. The nice thing about this pomade is that it has a nice smell but it has a slight crunchy effect. There is little shine, which may be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you&#x27;re trying to go far. I will say this pomade is impossible to get out of your hair unless you shampoo your hair so be cautious of that when deciding to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> So,I like Old Spice sprays and body lotions. And I was really hoping to have a good experience with this &amp;#34;spiffy&amp;#34; pomade. Well,I&#x27;m sad to say that this is not old spice&#x27;s best product.After the first time I used it, I had immediate regret and wished I didn&#x27;t make the purchase.It smells great and that&#x27;s about the only positive thing I could say about this pomade.The &amp;#34;Spiffy&amp;#34; makes your hair hard and the white paste can make black hair look somewhat grey. Also,it doesn&#x27;t let you shape your hair the way some less expensive pomades can nor can it hold. I would pass on this product if you are trying to do a side part or have medium to long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read my review and are taking my opinion into consideration. It should be noted that I do not wish for Old spice to fail in an attempt in making a pomade that can be washed out. This is just a bit of criticism in the hope that Old Spice view this as an opportunity to improve on this product.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price. Not top of the line, not the worst.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Great for a professional look, but not a rigid as a gel.</li>
    <li> This works great for my son.  Not quite as long lasting as I was hoping, but it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> This pomade holds well. It has a slightly crunchier feel than previous pomades I&#x27;ve used but it is not hard like a gel. It doesn&#x27;t leave a wet look but it is a little shinier than no product, again not as shiny as gel. It also smells nice but not too strong.</li>
    <li> For my brother. He really likes how it makes his hair look. I think it smells interesting.</li>
    <li> I like it.  Its not as good as a Mitch or an American Crew but its much better than the other brands.  Its price is in about the middle and thats where it performs.  Thats a perfect spot for me.</li>
    <li> Very nice and it got here on time</li>
    <li> Picked this up at a local CVS as it was on sale and I wanted to try something different than gel. When I have read about pomades and what not I expected the result to be something different when in my hair. The smell of this Spiffy pomade is alright, nothing good or bad...just...alright. It&#x27;s white and goes in good. On the back of the bottle there&#x27;s a simple drawing of the hair type/style Spiffy goes good with. I guess I should have studied it a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted more of a slicker look, not &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; but &amp;#34;spiffy&amp;#34;. The matte finish is just as stated and I tried to wet comb my hair for a slight more shine but that didn&#x27;t help at all. For me I needed shampoo to wash all the product out but it was easy. I left some in my hair a couple days in a row via water only wash thinking it&#x27;d help with styling but it didn&#x27;t do any good, or bad for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Nope, I&#x27;m going for Suavecito Pomade which I just ordered off azon. I think you could get a cheaper gel/puddy product than Old Spice Spiffy in particular and get very similar if not identical results. I wouldn&#x27;t pay the price for such a small bottle when you could get another name brand gel/puddy with more per oz at the same price.</li>
    <li> Good for medium long hair. Washes out relatively good</li>
    <li> My husband uses it and loves it. It holds well enough and the smell is great.</li>
    <li> Just a very small dab mixed with an equal amount of any decent conditioner and I&#x27;m set for the day. Holds like spray but hair stays soft to touch.  Much better than a gel.  Smells good but not too overpowering.  Nice job P&amp;G!</li>
    <li> Got this to replace my Crew brand pomade, I love it. The Crew pomade always left my hair looking greasey and feeling thick. This stuff hold better but is not thick or stiff, smells better, and leaves a nice natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I would HIGHLY recommend this Item.</li>
    <li> Item is just as described, I was looking to try a different type of hair product and this product is very good. I like the way the product holds my hair, my only issue with it is that it does leave your hands a little sticky.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really thick and sticky.  I tend to like American Crew more for not leaving my hair feeling like I just put glue in it.</li>
    <li> The hold suxx... If you want a get up and go pomade just for the time being, I guess this will do the job. As far as the price.... Not worth it at all. I can see if it was cheaper. The only thing I did like is the smell.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works quite well</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I have found that works with fine hair. All of the other products seem to clump in one area and this stuff goes on and makes my hair look like there is nothing in it but still holds. Its not a stiff hold its just enough to keep my hair in the right place. I have all the other products but this is works best for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Not my thing.  If you like products that leave your hair looking like there is nothing in it, then you might like this.  It does not have a lot of holding power.</li>
    <li> This stuff is supposed to give a matte finish and a moderate hold. I don&#x27;t know why everyone is complaining about the hold. They even have a little picture on the packaging that shows what your hair looks like after you use it. It doesn&#x27;t look slicked back at all. It&#x27;s supposed to give you hair some fluffyness. On the back, again it shows the image next to two other pictures, both show gelled up hair, and both have slashes through them, because this product is NOT supposed to be that strong. It&#x27;s supposed to give a beachy, wind-blown hair look. THAT SAID, I do not use it this way. I have an undercut style haircut with a length ranging from a half inch at the back to six inches at the front. After I shower, i dry my hair decently, until you can just feel a little moisture, and then i use just enough pomade to cover the end of my index finger at about a fifth of an inch (don&#x27;t know how else to say it). I then spread the pomade between my fingers and rub it into my hair. The water helps make the pomade go further. I then comb my hair back and to the side, think Don Draper. As long as I don&#x27;t mess with my hair much, it holds all day, with a moderate shine and hardness. It&#x27;s not strong enough to slick completely back, but that&#x27;s because its not a heavy wax like murrays. If I were to comb my hair after the pomade has dried in my hair, it would become matte and fluffy, which I don&#x27;t like. I think this product is advertised as it should be, but people are confused about what it&#x27;s supposed to be used for. I found away around the matte look, so if that&#x27;s what your looking for, it might work, but don&#x27;t count on it. If you&#x27;re looking for that, go for Nature&#x27;s Blessings hair pomade. It gives a much shinier look though. I originally used Nature&#x27;s Blessings because it washes out very easily with shampoo, but when I ran out and didn&#x27;t have time to order more, I just picked this up to try it out. It also washes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;Key points: Don&#x27;t expect it to be that strong, Don&#x27;t expect it to be that shiny, Don&#x27;t use too much (it actually doesn&#x27;t work well if you use too much), and be glad it washes out, unlike waxy pomades.pect it to be that shiny, Don&#x27;t use too much (it actually doesn&#x27;t work well if you use too much), and be glad it washes out, unlike waxy pomades.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. it has a reasonable amount of strength, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy or oily!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be honest. This is not the best pomade. There are much better ones. doesnt last that long specially if its a little hot. However its easy to work with. I use it for my every day at work but wont buy again. There are much better products out there</li>
    <li> I only use a small amount of this pomade on my hair to give it a clean but messy look. The stuff holds well and makes your hair look natural. Not a wet/greasy look! I have switched from my usual brand (Axe pomade) to this brand.</li>
    <li> Solid Pomade, I usually use axe pomade and it is very comparable. Smaller packaging than axe pomade but the same amount of actual pomade as Axe. None shiny pomade. I would say holding power on scale of 1-10, is 6 or 7.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price</li>
