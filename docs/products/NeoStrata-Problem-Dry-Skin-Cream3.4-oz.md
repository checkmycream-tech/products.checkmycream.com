      <li>Well worth the $$</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Having ordered this product many times directly from the NeoStrata Company, this is NOT the product.</li>
      <li>It is worth ever penny.</li>
      <li>I have tried other products, but none as good as this.  </li>
      <li>When first applied, it seems as if it is going to be greasy, but that is not the case at all.  </li>
      <li>This product is expensive but wonderful.</li>
      <li>first time caller...</li>
      <li>My dermatologist had recommended this to me a couple years ago and I bought it from her in her office of course at a higher price.</li>
      <li>I now use it daily on my feet to keep them in healthy condition.</li>
      <li>My feet are smooth and soft and so is my whole body.  </li>
      <li>Helped my dry skin on legs and thighs, roughness on heals better too.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t say the calluses are completely gone, but I&#x27;m not the most consistent user, either - I tend to quit using it when things improve, and then only remember to use it again when calluses start bothering me again.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this great cream for a few years for calluses on my feet, and really, it&#x27;s the only treatment that&#x27;s made any difference at all.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>After just a couple weeks, my feet felt so much smoother.  </li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>My skin is really, really dry--scaly, flaky and cracking.</li>
      <li>I have always battled with dry cracked heels and so far, I am new to this line, it is working well and they are looking better.</li>
      <li>Cracks on my heels can quickly develop into open wounds, but not when I use this cream.  </li>
      <li>It gets the roughest, most miserable-looking and awful feeling skin looking movie star perfect!  </li>
      <li>This cream is awsome my doctor recommended and it really works keeps my heels very soft</li>
      <li>My dry skin and callouses were replaced with soft smooth skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really see the big deal with this cream.</li>
      <li>At last I feel as if I have normal skin.  </li>
      <li>Really, really works for dry skin.</li>
      <li>The cracks quickly close and disappear within a few days.  </li>
      <li>AHA products are the only ones that actually helped, but no matter how strong, they were never quite good enough, especially when it came to my cracked and painful heels.  </li>
      <li>I decided to give this higher strength AHA product a try since \\&quot;problem dry skin\\&quot; definitely describes mine!  </li>
      <li>And I mean it really works, I touch my legs in amazement and now live in fear of the day when they stop making it,you know how that goes.</li>

I use this all over now, and it truly is amazing.  When first applied, it seems as if it is going to be greasy, but that is not the case at all.  It absorbs beautifully.

    <li> Will get rid of that yucky dry skin spots.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my dry callused heels. I&#x27;ve been using it since Oct 2013 and my feet have never been better. My dry skin and callouses were replaced with soft smooth skin. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this great cream for a few years for calluses on my feet, and really, it&#x27;s the only treatment that&#x27;s made any difference at all. I won&#x27;t say the calluses are completely gone, but I&#x27;m not the most consistent user, either - I tend to quit using it when things improve, and then only remember to use it again when calluses start bothering me again.

    <li> Our dermatologist recommended this for my husband&#x27;s cracking hands.  I used it, religiously, for 10 days and healed my cracking heels.  I now use it daily on my feet to keep them in healthy condition.</li>
    <li> NeoStrata has been a blessing on my dry, cracked skin. Truly, an amazing product that I will re-order time and again.</li>

I have used it on a couple dry patchy areas on my arms too and they have gone away too. So far so good. It is refreshing to find a product and line that is reasonably priced and works like advertised! Good Job!!</li>
    <li> Really good cream if you have very dry skin, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have had diabetes for almost 40 years, so taking care of my skin and feet is important.  This cream works wonders overnight!  I have tried other products, but none as good as this.  Cracks on my heels can quickly develop into open wounds, but not when I use this cream.  The cracks quickly close and disappear within a few days.  It has saved me from many trips to the wound care doctors.  Wish I could take a bath in it!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry callous feet which is a hereditary condition. I have never found any lotion that would work on my skin until this product. Anyone who has a dry skin condition should definitely try this!</li>
    <li> Really, really works for dry skin. Great on dry heals! Mix half and half with regular lotion to make it last longer.</li>
    <li> Having ordered this product many times directly from the NeoStrata Company, this is NOT the product. Buyer beware!!!! Amazon you should check and do QA especially when your consumers are savvy business customers. Extremely upset, and never again will I order this product via Amazon. Fool me once shame on me!</li>
    <li> When I was having issues with thick skin on my feet, my dermatologist had me buy this cream through her - at a cost much higher than I found it on Amazon.  I had great luck with it from the beginning and now use it daily.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This cream is awsome my doctor recommended and it really works keeps my heels very soft i will definetly keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see the big deal with this cream. I haven&#x27;t seen a &amp;#34;softening&amp;#34; of my skin. Sure, temporary, but any lotion can achieve this. Maybe, it should be put on your skin all throughout the day?</li>
    <li> Only thing I&#x27;ve found to heal my dry heels.  Use it nightly and it works great,  It was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> This actually works for keeping callus from building up on feet and toes.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years.  Somewhat expensive but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
    <li> Best product i have EVER used for my dry skin!</li>
    <li> This cream is great for dissolving the scales that go with having ichthyosis.  It&#x27;s stronger than LacHydrin or AmLactin, &amp; has the potential of irritating the skin, especially after shaving.  This is my second order, &amp; I will reorder.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist had recommended this to me a couple years ago and I bought it from her in her office of course at a higher price. I use it for my cracked heels. OMG It fixes winter feet  in two days of using it...It&#x27;s the perfect solution to get your winter feet ready for the flip flop season! I am no longer embarrassed to wear sandals or even to get pedicures done anymore...this lotion truly does it&#x27;s job!</li>
