      <li>what a HUGE difference did it make in the texture of my skin -</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is important to say that derma micro needle treatment can be done on both men and women.  </li>
      <li>I am soooo excited to share my experience with the Derma Roller vs the Derma Pen ..</li>
      <li>Well worth, really easy to use.</li>
      <li>both are good but for different jobs..</li>
      <li>The place where I was getting my treatments from, said the dermapen was also good for stretch marks and lose skin on my tummy, I&#x27;m trying it on my tummy next....</li>
      <li>wants a more youthful appearance ...    </li>
      <li>but it works adequately.</li>
      <li>I have used this on various needle lengths and I am very satisfied with the product.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s nice that is came with extra needles.</li>
      <li>This device is well worth the investment.  </li>
      <li>It shipped quickly and seems to work very well!</li>
      <li>It does what it is supposed to , however, I still prefer the cheap dermarollers because they are faster and more cost effective as well as doing the same thing for a hundred dollars less</li>
      <li>Most doctors use Dermapen and charge up to $450 per treatment to have same treatment done with this fancy device that uses needle (cartridge) to move across the face.  </li>
      <li>first attempt today was to start at 0.25mm, after applying the numbing cream.  </li>
      <li>Some customers will obviously be interested in effectiveness</li>
      <li>Absolutely, under no circumstances, should you purchase this product!</li>
      <li>When my girlfriend and I first started we did it every Friday for 3 months straight ..</li>
      <li>Love this machine, wish I had ordered it long ago.</li>
      <li>my girlfriend and I first started we did it every Friday for 3 months straight ..</li>
      <li>; I went super aggressive last week , I wanted to attack and focus some very fine wrinkles around my eyes and after I finished I swollen up next day</li>
      <li>It is more accessible to reach areas like nose and upper lip because cartridge is smaller.  </li>
      <li>When you scratch the surface, you just create the potential for infection and light scarring.</li>
      <li>Fast shopping as well</li>
      <li>but I do it really fast and tighten my lips against my teeth</li>
      <li>Excelent the item and the fast shipping A+</li>
      <li>Totally different from original dermapen.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>the directions will tell you that the device is only capable of VIBRATING!!  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t say what it&#x27;s made of, so I wasted my money for sure.</li>
      <li>I looked like a 90 year but as the days went on the healing process made the swollen look go down and the 90 yr old went finally back to looking more like myself minus the very fine lines</li>
      <li>The derma Pen is much faster and the needling is a direct up and down action to make more precise and smaller hole still reaching the goal of Micro needling to give you that youthfulness back..</li>
      <li>/&gt;Recovery is very early when I use growth factor</li>
      <li>I recently became esthetician and I started getting interested in microneedling techniques.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say with certainty that this product doesn&#x27;t have a model that \\&quot;stamps\\&quot; the skin, but this seller clearly does not sell that version.</li>

<li> Used once so far I&#x27;ve noticed smaller pores, tighter skin.  </li>

<li> ladies for a session for a professional to do it in less than 30 minutes</li>
<li> A micro-needling device should move the needles rapidly up and down, while penetrating the first few layers of the dermis.</li>

<li> Its not high end sort of product but in terms of functionality</li>
<li> Also, I found it more painful than a derma roller.</li>
<li> THIS DEVICE IS NOT CAPABLE OF PENETRATING THE SKIN.</li>
<li> I returned this item because it did not do what I expected it to</li>
<li> Having had several Dermapen treatments in the past, I know what to expect from a device like this.</li>
<li> Works as expected!</li>
<li> But if you do it at home you can get as aggressive as you want in one session and do it every week or every other week and not go broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Scary at first</li>
<li> Not worth it ..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Please save your money and get you a legit dermapen. My problem is the fact that the needles in the cartridge does not vertically pierce the skin; this video on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Wlc2bDdCB2Y shows how the device should be functioning. Unfortunately, the one I got does not work like this at all. The needles in the cartridge does not even vertically pierce the skin; (up and down motion) it just vibrated or I like to call it &amp;#34;shaky shaky&amp;#34; leaving scratches on my face. I am disappointed, but I guess this is what happens when something seems to good to be true.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. The needles do not move up an down like others have said. The pen just vibrates. The needles are unable to retract, so you will have to just repeatedly stab yourself in order to use. It&#x27;s impossible to glide the pen over your skin.  It would be more cost effective the just buy a box of needles and stab away manually, as the pen serves no purpose. Also, my pen looks like a counterfeit MyM pen and is not the one even pictured. After some research I learned that there is a MyM pen made in Korea that is the authentic one, and one made on China that is a counterfeit.</li>
    <li> Very Good!! Well worth, really easy to use. Delivery was on time!!😊</li>
    <li> paid extra for same day delivery and received that day.  was totally impressed bercause this was on sunday!  this product does not need an adapter which is another plus.</li>
    <li> Excelent the item and the fast shipping A+</li>
    <li> It is from Japan. I contribute this review using a translation tool, but I&#x27;m sorry if words are wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to make a trace of the herpes zoster better and purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;When I used it with the needle which was longer than 0.1mm, I used an anesthetic of the cream together.&lt;br /&gt;Recovery is very early when I use growth factor Ceram together.&lt;br /&gt;I used it three times, but the irregularities were already restored now.&lt;br /&gt;Because it was earlier than a plan, I want to use the arrival again by all means.&lt;br /&gt;Megumi Sakai</li>
    <li> I used to go to have someone else do my lips and eyes and not I do my own.  I love it and will keep using it instead of spending 200 to 300 per session to get rid ot the wrinkiles.  The lydocane works too but I do it really fast and tighten my lips against my teeth so it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I love it.It is easy to use.Its result is good.This is a Wonderful Treatment.Recommend!!!Good!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is very cheap value more than</li>
    <li> I was doing Botox every 3-4 months at the cost of $360 each time, then I heard about the Derma pen I received 2 treatments at the cost of $300 each, when I saw this I thought I have nothing to lose...between weight lost and age my skin started to sag, the fine lines and wrinkles were setting in. I love this product, I can see the difference in my skin. A coworker of mine that was out of the office and when she came back she asked me what I was doing to my face she could see the difference, my boyfriend has committed on my skin looking firmer the wrinkles are fading. The place where I was getting my treatments from, said the dermapen was also good for stretch marks and lose skin on my tummy, I&#x27;m trying it on my tummy next....</li>
    <li> It shipped quickly and seems to work very well!</li>
    <li> Very nice...i also use on feet.  Feels great!!!  I use on face with hyaluronic acid and coQ10, from bulk supplements at Amazon.</li>
    <li> No instructions of any kind,which I need</li>
    <li> Ok ladies !!!!!  Finally hope and control of your aging has arrived !!! I am soooo excited to share my experience with the Derma Roller vs the Derma Pen ..&lt;br /&gt;Ok both are good but for different jobs..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derma Roller;&lt;br /&gt;  DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR FACE !!!!!! It has a bear crawling effect and the healing is a longer process ..BUT use all over your body for scared , stretch marks , rope scaring after surgeries and the creating we get as we age.. On your hands to firm up your skin , even under arms for chicken arms to firm , tone and tighten.  On your head for hair regrowth .. The list goes on and on ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derma Pen ;&lt;br /&gt;  ON YOUR FACE AND NECK AND ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE YOU WANT !!!! The derma Pen is much faster and the needling is a direct up and down action to make more precise and smaller hole still reaching the goal of Micro needling to give you that youthfulness back..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now ladies for a session for a professional to do it in less than 30 minutes they charge $549.00 here in some Media Spas and plastics surgery offices .. Not worth it .. But if you do it at home you can get as aggressive as you want in one session and do it every week or every other week and not go broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t already experienced this wonder concept I would STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU GO TO YOUTUBE  AND VEIW VIDEOS ON PEOPLE AT HOME LIKE YOURSELF USING THESE PRODUCTS TO SHOW YOU THE \\&quot;HOW TO WITH MICRO NEEDING !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Scary at first but you will never regret it once you&#x27;ve started.. But one note , after you do this depending on how aggressive you are you will look worst then when you stared before you get better ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXAMPLE; I went super aggressive last week , I wanted to attack and focus some very fine wrinkles around my eyes and after I finished I swollen up next day I looked like a 90 year but as the days went on the healing process made the swollen look go down and the 90 yr old went finally back to looking more like myself minus the very fine lines were hardly there now.. And it&#x27;s been 2 weeks now ... Understand the healing continues for months after 1 session ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may ask ; \\&quot; well Carey how many times do I micro needle? \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;When my girlfriend and I first started we did it every Friday for 3 months straight .. And WOW what a HUGE difference did it make in the texture of my skin - it is and feels like a baby butt ! I have now skin like a 10 year old . My make up if I should decide to wear it goes on like butter becuz my pores are non existent !!! MY FACE LOOKS AMAZING !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased so very many of these pen for friends, family and who ever else that I&#x27;ve come across that wants a more youthful appearance ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final advise is buy one of these micro derma pen and see for your self , it&#x27;s a decision you will never regretbeen 2 weeks now ...

    <li> Amazing I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
    <li> It works good. I went to see tha Dr. And paid 125 every week and is the same thing. I am happy.</li>
    <li> I have used this on various needle lengths and I am very satisfied with the product. I wish it had a little higher speed but it works adequately. It&#x27;s nice that is came with extra needles.</li>
    <li> Really bad. Just scratching the surface of my face. Totally different from original dermapen.</li>
    <li> Counterfeit!!!! DO NOT BUY!!  It Does NOT STAMP... NEEDLE does NOT MOVE!!!! I Just receive the item and following the you tube tutorial before I tried on my face. The Derma pen is very noisy , another sign of counterfeit item.. SHAME on YOU!!  I WILL NOT STOP UNTIL you STOP selling this product!! That is why you have a No return policy.. I&#x27;m not sure why AMAZON will let you get away with that... maybe cause no one has come forward yet.. or no one has heard about the buyers RIGHTS!!!</li>
    <li> love it!! Works as expected!</li>
    <li> Having had several Dermapen treatments in the past, I know what to expect from a device like this. Absolutely, under no circumstances, should you purchase this product! A micro-needling device should move the needles rapidly up and down, while penetrating the first few layers of the dermis. Depending on the depth the user selects, the needles can penetrate superficially or deeply. THIS DEVICE IS NOT CAPABLE OF PENETRATING THE SKIN. It does not have the ability to \\&quot;stamp\\&quot; the skin (penetrate the skin with an up and down motion). When you open the package (mine appeared to be used because the box looked like it had been taped several times) the directions will tell you that the device is only capable of VIBRATING!!  Vibrating needles means you have needles microscopically scratching the SURFACE of your skin; not the layers below the surface. This completely deviates from the purpose of the machine. When you damage the skin below the surface, you force the body to create collagen to repair the damage. When you scratch the surface, you just create the potential for infection and light scarring. I returned this item because it did not do what I expected it to AND it did not come with any needle heads. In the product description, it said it&#x27;s supposed to come with 10 micro-needle heads. Please do not purchase this product. I can&#x27;t say with certainty that this product doesn&#x27;t have a model that \\&quot;stamps\\&quot; the skin, but this seller clearly does not sell that version.</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician and this works the same as the one they use in the medi spas. Love it! Why pay 400.00 when you can do it your self.</li>
    <li> this thing does not go  up and down....just a piece of junk had to  throw it away.....i leave i canada and it was a trouble to return it......&lt;br /&gt;a girl from canada</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to , however, I still prefer the cheap dermarollers because they are faster and more cost effective as well as doing the same thing for a hundred dollars less</li>
    <li> the best have used on my laugh lines 2x and they are diminishing..would order again</li>
    <li> Used once so far I&#x27;ve noticed smaller pores, tighter skin.  I do recommend using numbing cream.  So far very happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> I recently became esthetician and I started getting interested in microneedling techniques.  I use micorneedle rollers on my own skin and once a week I have a special treatment and apply collagen, serum and hydrating masks after microneedle face treatment.  Most doctors use Dermapen and charge up to $450 per treatment to have same treatment done with this fancy device that uses needle (cartridge) to move across the face.  Device is battery operated so no need to worry about getting cables entangled on the face.  It is more accessible to reach areas like nose and upper lip because cartridge is smaller.  Along with device I ordered spare cartridges so I do nto have to worry about refills for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to say that derma micro needle treatment can be done on both men and women.  It is great treatment for acne skin, mature skin and for healing scars. This device is well worth the investment.  I use it only on the facial area, although I know that some women use microneedling treatments on their legs (with larger needles) for treatment of cellulite and other skin imperfections.</li>
    <li> Works good, wish it had higher speed.&lt;br /&gt;Must use every week for it to work good.&lt;br /&gt; Fast shopping as well</li>
    <li> Love this machine, wish I had ordered it long ago. I am very satisfied, makes needling much faster and easier.</li>
    <li> I am sure I would see better results from this product if I weren&#x27;t allergic to the metal.  It doesn&#x27;t say what it&#x27;s made of, so I wasted my money for sure.</li>
    <li> The head of this is very small and it takes forever to cover a small area. Also, I found it more painful than a derma roller. P.S- I work in dermatology.</li>
    <li> I found it easy to use, and it also came with a UK electric adapter. The needles are adjustable to variable length but the micro-needles in each stamp were all 12 but it would have been better to give customers the choice to mix and match. Its not high end sort of product but in terms of functionality I think it does the job but I have only used it once. Some customers will obviously be interested in effectiveness but I may not be the best person to say as I didn&#x27;t really have any major dermatological needs. I used it for a small and almost invisible part on my face and so far it seems to have worked.</li>
    <li> I bought the stamp a few months ago, but I haven&#x27;t had the courage to use it until today, after reading your reviews.  I can&#x27;t help praising how great the result is -- my skin is so firm, so silky, and so smooth.  I am in my forties, and my skin issue is -- acne scars.  In fact, I have been spending $300 per visit for micro pen treatment with the clinic.  I am thinking of doing this myself for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first attempt today was to start at 0.25mm, after applying the numbing cream.  I felt very comfortable, and my skin didn&#x27;t hurt or didn&#x27;t bleed at all.  I used it on my eye areas too, and I could see the improvement immediately.  I used the HA serum with the pen.  I think I can try 0.5mm or above next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks all for your valuable comments which help me to overcome my &amp;#34;reluctance&amp;#34; to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
