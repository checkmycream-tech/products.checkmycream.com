      <li>Problem is that its not shiny, but you can help that putting in some gel on top of it, which will also keep it from fading.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect to conceal grey hair on my part in between getting my hair colored.</li>
      <li>But does it get the job done and look pretty darn good, yes.  </li>
      <li>love this product works when your in a rush in between colors my Hair is med to light brown</li>
      <li>I find that a couple or three light &amp;#34;coats,&amp;#34; about a minute apart, work much better than trying to glop it on in one &amp;#34;coat.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>good color match and came fast - just avoid the scalp</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product that performs as expected!</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and covers all unsightly gray between dye jobs.  </li>
      <li>My gray roots seem to show up very quickly, within a week or two of getting my hair done.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product about a month ago in light brown.  </li>
      <li>If you need a couple of extra weeks to get to the salon it is great.</li>
      <li>Love the product, fast delivery!</li>
      <li>Great product for grey or fix a thinning area !</li>
      <li>and she was right!  </li>
      <li>And I sprayed it a good distance from my head, and it&#x27;s still to yellow.</li>
      <li>I had my doubts, that color blonde was very yellow, but is perfect.</li>
      <li>I have medium/dark blonde hair and the Blonde shade is perfect.</li>
      <li>Had been using the high buck Rita Hazen, so this is a viable replacement and a much better value.</li>
      <li>In the past mascara style products very good</li>
      <li>I have very light blond hair, and like many reviewers stated, this spray is more yellow and doesn&#x27;t look natural.  </li>
      <li>My stylist sprayed the blonde style edit in my light red hair and it worked beautifully.</li>
      <li>My hair in fine and straight</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>but it washes right off.</li>
      <li>Any overspray wipes right off my skin with a baby wipe.</li>
      <li>The product comes right out with a wash.  </li>
      <li>Great product, a little sticky, if spray too much but does the job.  </li>
      <li>This product is exactly what I needed and was priced right.  </li>
      <li>Try it at a salon first to match the color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It gives me an extra week or more  </li>
      <li>i only wish the price with shipping was better</li>
      <li>I love it and Amazon is the only place that I can find it.</li>
      <li>if you have highlights, blonde and brown are both good especially blonde.</li>
      <li>This is just as good as Gray Away, if not better.</li>
      <li>Not sure how anyone could give this product a good rating.</li>
      <li>I am glad that the other colors do work but would love to have my $$$ back.  </li>
      <li>Better off using baby powder or dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>When I had darker hair, I used the medium color, and it worked very well, also.</li>
      <li>There wasn&#x27;t much in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>The product itself really does what it is supposed to do, and the color works for touch-ups around the temple area, where my gray shows.  </li>
      <li>I didnt it much the very diferent.</li>
      <li>This color works for me, and blends in very well with my hair color.  </li>
      <li>Really like this.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that much money to try and see if you like it.  </li>
      <li>My wife loves this product Thanks for the prompt service</li>
      <li>4 stars given because... beware the little nozzle can break off very easily</li>
      <li>This manufacturer gives a more generous amount than other brands.</li>
      <li>Will purchase again and hope the double order was no accident, but even if I only got 1, it&#x27;s still a better value than the RH brand.</li>
      <li>I have used my first can several times and, by the feel of its weight</li>
      <li>My hair grows very fast and my grey shows up three weeks after I color my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Easy and great results for touch ups!!!  If you need a couple of extra weeks to get to the salon it is great. I have blond color, bought my friend the red.  We loved the results!!!</li>
    <li> Love the product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I use this spray when my medium blonde hair begins to show gray and dark roots.It only takes a minute to do the hairline and the part and it covers instantly and looks perfectly natural.When I asked my husband to order this for me,he thought I was nuts,but he now agrees that it looks great.My Daughter uses the red,and she is equally happy with it.Any overspray wipes right off my skin with a baby wipe.Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I didnt it much the very diferent.</li>
    <li> It work OK! If you can stand the chemical smell. Leaves you hair damaged and dry. Not purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a spray to cover my gray roots, which start popping after 3 weeks. I ordered the blonde, and for some reason received 2 cans for the price of 1, so really can&#x27;t complain. The coverage was pretty good, spray can was user friendly and color was an excellent blend for my strawberry/golden shade. Had been using the high buck Rita Hazen, so this is a viable replacement and a much better value. Will purchase again and hope the double order was no accident, but even if I only got 1, it&#x27;s still a better value than the RH brand.</li>
    <li> Ordered the one for brown hair, but got the one for blonde hair. I couldn&#x27;t return it because you can&#x27;t send it in the mail.</li>
    <li> excellent product...easy to use.</li>
    <li> Unless you have white hair with a canary yellow tint, you will hate this.  Way too light for 95% of blondes!</li>
    <li> Try it at a salon first to match the color. My stylist sprayed the blonde style edit in my light red hair and it worked beautifully. My hair grows very fast and my grey shows up three weeks after I color my hair. It is expensive to keep up but style edit allows me to stretch out those appointments. I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Great product, a little sticky, if spray too much but does the job.  In the past mascara style products very good but now this is the best I&#x27;ve used.  4 stars given because... beware the little nozzle can break off very easily and then you cant use any more of the product.</li>
    <li> Good for a quick fix between hair coloring I only reccomend it in a pinch. Price is better that hair salon!</li>
    <li> I love it and Amazon is the only place that I can find it.</li>
    <li> I read reviews (mixed) but decided to order anyway.  I have very light blond hair, and like many reviewers stated, this spray is more yellow and doesn&#x27;t look natural.  Too dark. Oh well.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;s an ugly blonde and it stains your hair.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  It has paint in it and it will eventually damage your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a month ago in light brown.  It was a little dark for my color but I love this product!  I just bought a second bottle of the blond. My gray roots seem to show up very quickly, within a week or two of getting my hair done.  This product has saved me a ton of money on touch-ups.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  I&#x27;ve read another review saying it smelled bad.  I have not found this to be the case and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair as the same reviewer noted.  My hair in fine and straight and I wash my hair daily as it is oily side if I don&#x27;t wash it every day.  The product comes right out with a wash.  Because I assume different hair types will react differently I&#x27;m just noting that it worked wonderful for me and I will continue to purchase it. I just wish it came in a larger size than the 2 oz.  The price is also half of what it is in the salon I go to.</li>
    <li> This is just as good as Gray Away, if not better. And.....it actually comes in blonde which Gray Away doesn&#x27;t anymore!!</li>
    <li> Covers the growing out gray perfectly. Went out with some friends and mentioned that I was going to the salon the next day for color and cut and they all were surprised as they did not see any roots!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be the same at Rita Hazan&#x27;s product but it&#x27;s a little different.  It&#x27;s got a brighter color so it doesn&#x27;t look as natural in my hair as the blonde Rita Hazan version.  It&#x27;s half the price, though, so I&#x27;ll get over it.  :)</li>
    <li> My hair is platinum..this color blonde is &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34;.  Also, I had to use a liberal about of it to cover the dark roots.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the reviews on Amazon, and was so disappointed when I tried it.  It looks horrible and is not even close to blonde.  You cannot return this item. Complete waste of money.  Better off using baby powder or dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect to conceal grey hair on my part in between getting my hair colored.</li>
    <li> The color is not natural and it does not provide coverage. Not sure how anyone could give this product a good rating.</li>
    <li> If you are very grey like me and need a touch up before appointments then this is your product, I usually use it just a few days before my color appointment.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this spray as the color is so light that it did not even cover the gray. I had read this in other reviews but I thought I would give it a chance. I barely saw any color at all. Three stars.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!  Took the place of Grey Away which was discontinued in the blonde shade for some reason</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT TWICE AND BOTH OF THEM THE COLOR IS NOT ACCURATE, LIKE THE TITLE SAYS.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M NOT SO GOOD TO APPLY THIS, BECAUSE I ALWAYS PUT THE SPRAY ONTO THE SCALP INSTEAD OF THE DARK LINE OF MY HAIR. AND LATER ON SOMEHOW THE SPRAY WILL BLEND THE COLOR AND IT WILL COVER MY DARK ROOTS LITTLE BIT.  ALSO  STICKY AFTER COUPLE HOURS, BUT WILL GO AWAY AFTER YOU WASH YOUR HAIR, I WILL SAY IT WORKS, AND NOTHING IN THE LIFE IS PERFECT SO GIVE IT A TRY...</li>
    <li> My wife uses as a touch up.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably natural-looking! It certainly covers the gray &amp; there&#x27;s no &#x27;chalky look&#x27; or mess. I LOVE this product! I don&#x27;t think that I will ever fail to keep a little can handy - even on travels!</li>
    <li> Some have mentioned the weird color.  I have medium brown hair with blonde highlights.  I get my roots touched up every 4-5 weeks.  This color works for me, and blends in very well with my hair color.  I say if you are on the fence, go ahead and buy it.  The product itself really does what it is supposed to do, and the color works for touch-ups around the temple area, where my gray shows.  It&#x27;s not that much money to try and see if you like it.  When I had darker hair, I used the medium color, and it worked very well, also.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest hair product out.  It is easy to apply and covers all unsightly gray between dye jobs.  I am been so pleased since a friend introduced me to it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the blonde, and everyone who says it&#x27;s too yellow is correct.  At least for on the grey that grows out between coloring.  I used it on my dry hair, and the next time I&#x27;ll try it on wet hair.  If it makes any difference, I&#x27;ll post again.  But as of right now, on dry hair, absolutely not.  And I sprayed it a good distance from my head, and it&#x27;s still to yellow.</li>
    <li> There wasn&#x27;t much in the bottle.  Very disappointed. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> If you get  crazy when even one root starts to show, this product will help you stay out of the salon for a couple of extra weeks. if you have highlights, blonde and brown are both good especially blonde. Problem is that its not shiny, but you can help that putting in some gel on top of it, which will also keep it from fading.  This manufacturer gives a more generous amount than other brands.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair looking more yellow than blonde not sure. Then it&#x27;s kinda flaky.</li>
    <li> Good coverage for roots  between coloring and covers scalp, too, where hair is thinning a bit.  But hard to find just the right color; they only make four choices, as far as I know.  I wish the company would create a color between blonde (too &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; for me) and medium brown (just a bit too dark).</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for covering between coloring.</li>
    <li> love this product works when your in a rush in between colors my Hair is med to light brown and i just spray it on and even though it looks yellow when i brush it in it blends perfectly i only wish the price with shipping was better</li>
    <li> good color match and came fast - just avoid the scalp so you don&#x27;t have yellow scalp</li>
    <li> Great product for grey or fix a thinning area !</li>
    <li> This stuff works great between salon visits.  It is easy to apply and blends nicely.  Is it the greatest thing ever?  No.  But does it get the job done and look pretty darn good, yes.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product Thanks for the prompt service</li>
    <li> Great easy and covers great</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works so well and saves me a lot of money between salon appointments! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> It was too dark and almost looked orange, made my hair look bad. I was embarrassed with it on.i returned it</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff not only covered my gray, but added color and shine to my roots! I am sold!!!! :)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical after reading the reviews but it really works well. I have a white patch of hair that never really colors completely with hair color and this helps it blend in nicely. I have medium/dark blonde hair and the Blonde shade is perfect.</li>
    <li> The brown works well, but you have to work at blending it into blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;The blonde is a weird yellow color that I found totally un-useable.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested I use this as a root touchup and it is PERFECT!  Matches the hair, spreads evenly, not distinguishable from your own hair.  Doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling powdery or cakey.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I do not longer have to retouch the roots often, since I&#x27;m using it.  I am going to order more bottles. I had my doubts, that color blonde was very yellow, but is perfect.</li>
    <li> Need to be able to choose a shade. I have white blonde hair, and this is dark golden yellow and looks like spray paint. I won&#x27;t use it, and don&#x27;t know what to do with the 2 cans I bought......maybe Halloween......lol.</li>
    <li> Works good. The color blends well. I have a small patch of gray along forehead area. When my hair is washed, wet and wrapped in a towel, I pull the towel back put a tissue to cover the over spray on the towel, spray a small amount on the gray, then use the tissue to wipe any excess off my forehead. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it was recommended by my sister.  However my sister has brown hair.  It works well for her.  I have blond hair and it doesn&#x27;t work.  One of the former reviewers mentioned that the blond was a canary yellow and she was right!  I am glad that the other colors do work but would love to have my $$$ back.  If you are a blond, do not purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product....I have blonde hair and this product covers the gray completely...just spray it on...&lt;br /&gt;It gives me an extra week or more  before I have my hair colored at the salon.....</li>
    <li> Really like this.  I have dyed hair (dark brown, caramel, blonde) and have been looking for a satisfactory blonde to cover up the grey roots in between salon visits that was easy and quick to use (i.e., no painting on, no waiting, no rinsing out).  This product is exactly what I needed and was priced right.  I shake the can gently before using, keep it just a few inches from my hair while spraying, and spray lightly in short, sweeping motions -- like you would use spray paint, just much shorter strokes.  I find that a couple or three light &amp;#34;coats,&amp;#34; about a minute apart, work much better than trying to glop it on in one &amp;#34;coat.&amp;#34;  It seems to go on a little brighter than the final dried colour, but in three or so minutes, my greys are covered and the blonde blends very well with my tri-tone colours.  I have used my first can several times and, by the feel of its weight, I believe I can get several more sprays from it, for a total of at least a dozen covers.  I wash my hair twice a week (definitely not oily!) and therefore use the spray twice a week when the greys peep through, and then on the part, around the face, and some at the crown.  It works on both a smidgen of grey and a half-inch of grey.  It truly does not come out until washed, so I do recommend putting an old towel around your shoulders just in case of a wayward spray or drip, and focus for a few seconds on spraying precisely where you want colour.  Will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> this product was a horrible yellow.  I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Save your money! This stuff doesn&#x27;t cover anything. It&#x27;s a watery blonde that doesn&#x27;t cover the hair at all, just the scalp, but barely even that! It just doesn&#x27;t do what it says it supposed to do. I would return it, but Amazon WON&#x27;T let you return the product because it&#x27;s flammable --well, they have no trouble shipping to you, but won&#x27;t let you return??? That&#x27;s not a good way to run a business. There are two products that are MUCH better: Euphora has a great touch-up color hair spray and so does Bumble and Bumble. These two work and are great. Sadly, Style Edit doesn&#x27;t work at all. Now I&#x27;m stuck with this color and the medium/light brown...arg!</li>
    <li> I do love it.  It&#x27;s so convenient for touching up roots.  One can&#x27;t help but get it on the skin but it washes right off.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that performs as expected! The price can&#x27;t be beat, either. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Do not spray paint on your skin, it is a JOKE. I could not get it out of my hair. Be careful girls !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This little can is a life saver for my roots until I can get to the hairstylist!  It looks natural and blends in well with my hair...no one ever knows but my hairdresser!!</li>
    <li> Works very well when one hasn&#x27;t the time to do a regular root treatment.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for inbetween color.</li>
    <li> Not A big fan.  The blonde is way too yellow and there was no dark blonde like their competitors also I didn&#x27;t care for the consistency too thick</li>
    <li> Repeat buyer. I use it between colorings</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this actually works well.  It does not flake off or get on my pillow or clothing. I would definitely buy it again. And have also bought the brown one.  Works for covering grow out, or toning down a too-white blonde highlight job.</li>
    <li> My hair is thinning a little in the front on my bangs. I just squirt a little amount on the roots of my bangs and it makes it look like my hair is fuller. I love this stuff! :)</li>
