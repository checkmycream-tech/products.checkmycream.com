      <li>I would throw it way, but I certainly won&#x27;t be buying any more of it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have always loved the smell of Herbal Essences, love the way it feels in my hair, The 2 in 1 makes it a quick wash and go when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
    <li> Smaller pkg size than expected</li>
    <li> Great product for the money.</li>
    <li> Right now in my bathroom cabinet I have no less than two dozen shampoos/conditioners... I have sulfate-free lines and $25 shampoo/conditioners along with pricey top salon products... Know what? This inexpensive 2/1 shampoo/conditioner tops them all... Seriously... I grabbed it when I was away one weekend with a coupon out of the newspaper just to use those two days... Never, ever would I expect to use this product or even like it.... I thought that you get what you pay for, but this shampoo/conditioner does everything it claims... My hair is soft, shiny, tangle-free and luscious (its texture is fine and tends to be wavy and prone to frizz on humid days).... Some days I&#x27;ll slap on a gob of top salon conditioner that takes 15 minutes to work... Then the next time I&#x27;ll use the Herbal Essence.... My hair looks so much better after Herbal Essence than after the expensive, time-consuming conditioning treatment... It always comes up trumps when I use the Herbal Essence..... Unbeatable for value... I&#x27;d pay much more to get such great results, but it just shows you don&#x27;t have to spend half a paycheck to get great looking hair.... Convince yourself about this great product.....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It was a great deal. It doesn&#x27;t condition deep well, though. Seems to do ok otherwise.</li>
    <li> Great when Im in a hurray and don&#x27;t have time to use several products!</li>
    <li> I generally love Herbal Essences products, but this one just did NOT rinse well.  One day I actually had to re-wash my hair using the only other shampoo in the house - kids 3-in-one shampoo/conditioner/bodywash.  It worked better.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and cleans my hair well</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job and smells great!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best 2 in 1 -s I have found that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out, perfect for those days when I&#x27;ve hit the snooze button a few too many times!</li>
    <li> just the right amount of conditioner</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. A+++</li>
    <li> Love this 2-in-1 shampoo conditioner!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother. He likes to use it to keep his daughters&#x27; hair shiny and clean!</li>
    <li> I love this, it leaves my hair really soft and manageable. And i love the price, this is a lower price than local retailers sell it for. I am very happy . Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells and cleans wonderfully!  I love that my kiddos can use this in half the time.  Great moisturizing 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo, makes you hair feels so good and smell like coconut.</li>
    <li> Weird blue shampoo that left my hair feeling unclean. Not much of a coconut smell either.</li>
    <li> My 12 yr old daughter and I both love this shampoo! It is one of the nicest smelling ones out there! It leaves you hair clean, less frizzy, and doesn&#x27;t look weighted down.  We both have very thick, wavy hair. And the color of the shampoo is really pretty--opaque blue (the bottle is actually clear)!</li>
    <li> very good and great scent</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this scent! Normally I dont buy 2 in 1 hair products but I really like this one! Great product, great lather, great smell!</li>
    <li> love it love it love it.</li>
    <li> Smells great, make my hair squeaky clean.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Dryed my hair out and caused dandruff.</li>
    <li> works well and smells great</li>
    <li> I love the coconut scent.  It just seems to go great with other typical summer scents:  sun block, lip gloss, and a pina colada!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hydration my hair has seen in a long time GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I use this product on my wigs and it conditions and cleans all in one wash I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this to help my curly hair look less frizzy. I used it a few times and noticed that near the roots of my hair it was feeling very stiff.  The next time I washed my hair I made sure to get my scalp and roots. A few days later I noticed my head was itchy and I was getting dandruff flakes in it.  I tried scrubbing my scalp really good and it didn&#x27;t help. I started using my husbands shampoo and my hair immediately felt better and my scalp went back to normal.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be finishing that bottle up.</li>
    <li> for me pert plus works much better</li>
    <li> smells great, works perfect, dont have time for 20 minute showers.</li>
    <li> My teen daughters prefer this and its effective with just a little even with very long hair.</li>
    <li> cant beat the price -- good for my guest bathroom</li>
    <li> Saves time by combining shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
    <li> My husband uses this shampoo and it smells wonderful(coconut) and cleans his hair.</li>
    <li> Great value for a good hair care product.  Smells great and hydrates well. GF loves my hair after I use it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for when I&#x27;m showering quickly at the gym! Awesome scent too! Love this!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, we should all use shampoo and conditioner every morning.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s also be honest - there just isn&#x27;t always enough time to take care of both when you are in a rush. Herbal Essences 2-in-1 takes care of both and is one of the few 2-in-1&#x27;s I&#x27;ve felt actually does both successfully! (My wife loves the smell on top of that!)</li>
    <li> Good Product and good seller, recommended</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SHAMPOO,IT IS GREAT TO USE ON A WEAVE,IT MOISTURIZES THE HAIR AND IT TRULY DOES MAKE IT SOFT AND MANAGEABLE.</li>
    <li> It is a great shampoo and smells great. My only issue(I guess it&#x27;s just my scalp) is that, my scalp becomes more dry after having a wash with this. Assuming it is just my scalp that gives this kind of reaction, I give 5 stars for its amazing smell.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful!! I love herbal essence!!</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells! Does exactly what it says</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old man who typically does not put a ton of time or effort into grooming.  I want to look nice, but to be honest I have simple needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 2-in-1 shampoo is probably the worst I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel particularly soft, smooth, or conditioned.  It feels a little like those \\&quot;volume\\&quot; shampoos (which make your hair a little sticky), only without the increase in volume.  Also, they could have left out the blue coloring from this shampoo and been all the better.  It just does not looks like something you should be putting in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through half a bottle now and it&#x27;s not so bad I would throw it way, but I certainly won&#x27;t be buying any more of it.</li>
    <li> Smells and works great! I absolutely love Herbal essences! :)</li>
    <li> My husband is lazy and loves two in one shampoos. This is cheap, smells great, and does the job!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay smells good but not for me I just can&#x27;t do the two in one. Leaves my hair looking like i didn&#x27;t rinse it out all the way</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend this to anybody who has dry wavy/ straight hair like my own. I&#x27;ve been using this, nym kinky moves leave-in conditioner, and herbal essences moroccan me a miracle 7 in 1 serum for a few months now in an attempt to save my hair. I see a big improvement in my hairs health. No flatness and no oilyness.</li>
    <li> THIS LEAVES MY HAIR FEELING WAXY WHEN ITS DAMP</li>
    <li> Great conditioner, love the scent. leaves my hair soft and manageable!</li>
    <li> keep this available for guests</li>
    <li> love the smell and makes hair soft</li>
    <li> It was okay. Did not leave my hair very manageable. I prefer shampoo and conditioner separate.</li>
    <li> Smells good and does the job. 2 in 1 shampoos sometimes don&#x27;t have enough conditioning power but this does the job without weighing the hair down.</li>
    <li> I have a really finicky scalp with extreme dandruff at times. Using dandruff shampoo dried my scalp and hair out too much so I&#x27;ve been using this every other time I wash my hair and it helped the dryness a bit. I like that its a 2 in 1 so quick and easy, and just moisturizing enough. I have short hair around 3 inches and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down it actually seems to volumize it a bit. Smells good and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> Thanks it packed really good one by one. Came on time. And i like the shampoo coz of the price too thanks</li>
    <li> Smells great on the husband. He likes it. Great price</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Great shampoo</li>
    <li> Really love the smell of this stuff and the convenience of a two in one.</li>
    <li> it smells nice, but it makes my hair dry and rough... i need to use a seperate shampoo and conditioner  but i love herbal essences</li>
    <li> Worst shampoo ever..don&#x27;t buy...hair feels more dirty and dry than before using it. The old formula was good but they changed it and it is now horrible for your hair and scalp. Should be recalled..Had to do a mayonaise conditioning for my hair to get back to somewhat normal..BEWARE!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Herbal Essences products for a while now. But just recently tried this one. I dont always have time to use shampoo and conditioner so Herbal Essences 2 in 1 is perfect for me to save some time. It Ieaves my hair smooth&amp;looking great. Best hydration my hair ever got I also love the coconut scent. Great price, cheaper than in the store. Came really fast!!</li>
