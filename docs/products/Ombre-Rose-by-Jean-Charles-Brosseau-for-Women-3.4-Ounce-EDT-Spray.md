      <li>Prices are better than anywhere else I saw, and I looked at a lot of sites.</li>
      <li>and I was glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase and will be ordering more soon.</li>
      <li>She was thrilled to receive her very favorite fragrance after much searching.  </li>
      <li>a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered a mini Ombre Rose in pure parfum strength to dot on at pulse points in hopes that this will boost both sillage an staying power of the more diffusely applied Ombre Rose EdT spray.</li>
      <li>It is very special  CLS</li>
      <li>So glad I have it again, it is beautiful, soft and light.</li>
      <li>I love ombr&amp;eacute; rose and have worn it for years with lots of positive responses</li>
      <li>The scent lasts awhile and is not too strong or obnoxious or fruity.</li>
      <li>Not too strong and just yummy.  </li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and mild, very clean-smelling and powdery.  </li>
      <li>I wish that I could say with certainty that the fragrance is exactly as I remembered it, however, I am enjoying this version and glad that I went ahead with the purchase.</li>
      <li>A sultry light powdery scent that lasts for awhile.</li>
      <li>I searched in Paris for it when it was no longer available in the States and found that it was no longer manufactured.</li>
      <li>So glad to have it arrive as a surprise in her mail box ;-)</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time 19 years ago and since then it has been my favorite fragance.</li>
      <li>It has a sweet powdery smell and it&#x27;s not something I gravitate towards</li>
      <li>She loved it, she said it brought back memories.  </li>
      <li>It is soft, sweet, powdery and feminine, with nice staying power.</li>
      <li>I have worn Ombr&amp;eacute; Rose for about 25 years and it is the only perfume that I feel comfortable wearing.</li>
      <li>This was a present for my wife, but I think I love it more than she does.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and came in a sealed box from the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>So when I saw it on Amazon, I was so excited to purchase it right away.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is very pretty, too.</li>
      <li>Very pretty.</li>
      <li>My elderly and terminally ill aunt was thrilled that I was able to find Ombre Rose for her</li>
      <li>Very reasonably priced and shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>I first purchased Ombre Rose back in the 80&#x27;s?  </li>
      <li>It has a soft almost baby powder scent, but it&#x27;s not too strong.  </li>
      <li>The mention that the item might not be exactly as pictured added to my concern.</li>
      <li>This was my favorite cologne back then and it still is now.</li>
      <li>but if you been searching for it this is the real thing!</li>
      <li>Reminds me of our time in France, where we first bought a bottle of</li>
      <li>Will definately buy some more when I get low.</li>
      <li>I receive constant comments on what a lovely fragrance it is.</li>
      <li>Starts off with notes including fresh geranium and develops into a rosy &amp; mildly powdery fragrance with notes of honey, soft spice notes, and vanilla.  </li>
      <li>After sampling the frag in a store, reading other positive reviews, and considering the relatively low price for this kind of item, it seemed like a worthwhile gamble.</li>
      <li>Pretty much as I remember it years ago.......</li>
      <li>thanks for the product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s discret, fresh and feminine, it smells like soft baby powder.</li>
      <li>Often layer it with the much cheaper Vanilla Musk by Coty.</li>
      <li>It came fairly fast.</li>
      <li>I use it daily ,,it is light ,,airy and not a perfume that would upset people.  </li>
      <li>The real test was when my mom tried it though.</li>
      <li>It makes me feel good when I wear it, so, I wear it everyday!!</li>
      <li>it will complement my stock and it is the same i used in the past and the price was great.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of an older smell.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This has been my everyday fragrance for many years.  </li>
      <li>This has been my favorite perfume since the 1980s--quite hard to find.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume, so hard to find...</li>
      <li>Its my favorite perfume and so hard to find,  </li>
      <li>When I wear this complete strangers ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
      <li>or if you are in a group of people, because it is not overwhelming or too strong like some perfumes.  </li>
      <li>I keep an eye on how low the bottle is and srder a new one to have on hand and wrap ahead of time.</li>
      <li>It has a subtly addictive candy aspect while steering far clear of cloying.</li>
      <li>Powdery fresh small.  </li>

    <li> I received what was promised</li>
    <li> I love this scent, and used it for years but was unable to find it for a long time.  So glad I have it again, it is beautiful, soft and light.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this bottle of Ombre Rose! It arrived quickly and came in a sealed box from the manufacturer. The bottle is excatly like the one i still have from the 80&#x27;s and it smells even better than i remember!! I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase and will be ordering more soon. I especially want to get the powder and lotion!! Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I used it for the first time 19 years ago and since then it has been my favorite fragance. It&#x27;s discret, fresh and feminine, it smells like soft baby powder. Try it, you will never regreat. And another good thing: its price is excellent!</li>
    <li> A great deal with a great price and the company delivered it super fast so I got it in time to put under the Christmas tree. I highly recommend. Prices are better than anywhere else I saw, and I looked at a lot of sites.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  I get so many compliments.  Will definately buy some more when I get low.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, so hard to find... good price and arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> This is not the fragrance I am used to.  IT DOES NOT EVEN SMELL GOOD..AND LAST LESAS THAN A MINUTE.</li>
    <li> My mom has been searching for this perfume for a while now but wasn&#x27;t able to find it in stores. I was so happy to find it on Amazon! It came fairly fast. I got it five days after I placed the order. The real test was when my mom tried it though. She says it&#x27;s the perfume she remembers and still loves it! It has a sweet powdery smell and it&#x27;s not something I gravitate towards but if you been searching for it this is the real thing! Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I first purchased Ombre Rose back in the 80&#x27;s?  So when I saw it on Amazon, I was so excited to purchase it right away.  It has a soft almost baby powder scent, but it&#x27;s not too strong.  This was my favorite cologne back then and it still is now.</li>
    <li> It reminds me of an older smell.  powder and roses.  it isn&#x27;t really strong, but has a nice linger.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this for years and found it on Amazon.  It was my favorite scent years ago.  It smells just like I remember.  Not old or stale.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite perfume since the 1980s--quite hard to find. It arrived quickly, was well-packaged, smelled great, and is a very good value at this price.</li>
    <li> I love this and I got it before the estimated delivery date!</li>
    <li> I was identified by this perfume in the 80s. I searched in Paris for it when it was no longer available in the States and found that it was no longer manufactured.I was so glad to find it here.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I remembered it smelling years ago but a nice addition to my fragarance collection anyway.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a while and the smell would last but this bottle didn&#x27;t seem to last very long at all.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a bad bottle or the product is just weaker.</li>
    <li> For my mother-in-law and she loves it.  Could not find it anywhere else.</li>
    <li> .I used this scent for years and always loved it. Unfortunately, I have recently ordered the eau de toilette and eau de parfum, and the scent is the same but lasts for a very short time, maybe 15 or 20 minutes, after that nobody notices you are wearing it.</li>
    <li> When I wear this complete strangers ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.  Not overwhelming like some perfumes.  Powdery fresh small.  Often layer it with the much cheaper Vanilla Musk by Coty.</li>
    <li> thanks for the product.  Its my favorite perfume and so hard to find,  I have to order it at least once or twice a year.  Always looking for the best deal</li>
    <li> This was a present for my wife, but I think I love it more than she does. Reminds me of our time in France, where we first bought a bottle of Ombre Rose more than 10 years ago.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. I went to several stores in my area to find this, but no one carries it. I found it online and it arrived in time for Christmas. The recipient was elated.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume I have used it  for 25 years.</li>
    <li> I love ombr&amp;eacute; rose and have worn it for years with lots of positive responses</li>
    <li> My elderly and terminally ill aunt was thrilled that I was able to find Ombre Rose for her and I was glad to find it on Amazon.  She was thrilled to receive her very favorite fragrance after much searching.  I have not used this product, but my aunt was very particular, she was soooo happy - and that purchase made me happy.</li>
    <li> Really like this product, great smell, lovely bottle. I get compliments every time I wear it.  The scent lasts awhile and is not too strong or obnoxious or fruity. I was also glad to find this on amazon.</li>
    <li> I wore this fragrance twenty years ago. I was very pleased to find that it was still available. I hesitated a little on this purchase both because of a problem another reviewer had with the EDP bottle leaking, and the No Return policy of this item. The mention that the item might not be exactly as pictured added to my concern. After sampling the frag in a store, reading other positive reviews, and considering the relatively low price for this kind of item, it seemed like a worthwhile gamble. My order arrived in record time and great shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is beautiful. I wish that I could say with certainty that the fragrance is exactly as I remembered it, however, I am enjoying this version and glad that I went ahead with the purchase. It is soft, sweet, powdery and feminine, with nice staying power. It has a subtly addictive candy aspect while steering far clear of cloying. I find myself craving it when I am not wearing it.</li>
    <li> I have worn Ombr&amp;eacute; Rose for about 25 years and it is the only perfume that I feel comfortable wearing. I receive constant comments on what a lovely fragrance it is.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this scent and was told it was discontinued - never to be made again. So when I saw it could be purchased I jumped.</li>
    <li> Ombre Rose has been my signature fragrance for many years. It smells wonderful and not over-powering.</li>
    <li> All good, totally pleased.  My partner has been looking for this fragrance for quite some time, it is just not available on store shelves. So glad to have it arrive as a surprise in her mail box ;-)</li>
    <li> I have given this to my wife for years, Christmas, birthdays, anniversaries and so on. I keep an eye on how low the bottle is and srder a new one to have on hand and wrap ahead of time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this from Amazon.  They take an eternity to ship the product. Once they eventually get around to shipping, they put it on the slowest method they can find to ship even if you have Amazon Prime.  Unbelievable. Not the usual slick service you expect from Amazon.  I suggest the following personal algorithm, if you must:  Place Order with Amazon. Give them 48 hours to ship. If they have not shipped, cancel the order and get it from someone else.</li>
    <li> Starts off with notes including fresh geranium and develops into a rosy &amp; mildly powdery fragrance with notes of honey, soft spice notes, and vanilla.  It&#x27;s a lovely ladylike scent.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s low both on sillage and staying power, otherwise I would have rated it a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered a mini Ombre Rose in pure parfum strength to dot on at pulse points in hopes that this will boost both sillage an staying power of the more diffusely applied Ombre Rose EdT spray.</li>
    <li> This fragrance comes boxed, nicely sealed in cellophane.  The scent is pleasant and mild, very clean-smelling and powdery.  It reminds me of soap or bubble bath.  I think it would be a good fragrance choice for an office or if you are in a group of people, because it is not overwhelming or too strong like some perfumes.  The bottle is very pretty, too.</li>
    <li> Pretty much as I remember it years ago.......sweet , flirtacious.......and a little naughty underneath it all. Very pretty.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife on V-Day. She loved it, she said it brought back memories.  To me it is subtle and feminine, not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of Ombre Rose.  It is not overpowering nor cloying.  It makes me feel good when I wear it, so, I wear it everyday!!</li>
    <li> it will complement my stock and it is the same i used in the past and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I have been fond of Ombre Rose perfume for years.  I could not find it until I checked Amazon,,,and there it was.  I use it daily ,,it is light ,,airy and not a perfume that would upset people.  It is very special  CLS</li>
    <li> A sultry light powdery scent that lasts for awhile. Perfect for work, date, or school.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my Mom who loves Ombre Rose. It was well received.</li>
