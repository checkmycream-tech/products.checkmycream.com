<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It makes the hair very difficult to comb and I have to use a conditioner with it while the product itself does not come with one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using alter ego products for 5 years. This is by far one of the BEST shampoos I&#x27;ve used--and I have used plenty. For starters, it makes your hair feel very clean, silky and detangled. After a deep conditioner, and dry, your hair will be very fragrant, light and bouncy. I suffer from excessively dry scalp and this shampoo along with the alter ego dandruff leave in conditioner helps to control my flaking. I absolutely love this shampoo and I would recommend it to anyone. BTW-I am a woman of color with relaxed and dyed hair and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> When I wash my hair it feels as if every strand is being cleaned individually. I really like the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It gave my scalp a unique tingly feeling which helped me believe it is worth the few extra dollars. I&#x27;ve been wearing a weave for quite awhile and am considering dispensing that in favor of my own hair so that I can shampoo more often with this product along with the Emu Oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo as I was experiencing lots of shedding.  Not only does it have a very strong perfume scent (very fake smelling), but it did not help with my shedding at all.  I now use a shampoo by Avalon Organics called Thickening Shampoo with Biotin.  It has worked amazingly.  However, Alter Ego does make one product that helped a lot too.  It&#x27;s a garlic mask hot oil treatment for the scalp.  Takes a few weeks to work but it&#x27;s really great.  Hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Besides clean hair its good for when your hair is falling. I love it, I would not chaging it!</li>
    <li> I am almost finished using a whole bottle and I don&#x27;t think my hair has stopped falling out any less then prior use of this product ( and I was also using it with the leave in cond and leave in treatment) bit if your believe in big names then your might like this product.it&#x27;s not bad it&#x27;s does leave silky.</li>
    <li> I do love it but I had to give it 4 stars because it does get my hair. I&#x27;ve used GNC&#x27;s biotin shampoo and this one which are sulfate free shampoos so I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s the reason why it gets the hair tangled. I tried using another shampoo with sulfate and it doesn&#x27;t tangle the hair nearly as much. I comb out the hair after the second wash because that&#x27;s usually how many washes it takes to cleanse the hair.</li>
    <li> I have bought this shampoo twice before. Since I am using this shampoo, I have been able to grow out my hair. It is not only growing faster, but people are complimanting how healthy my hair looks. Even my hairdresser is impressed and he is telling his other clients who have thin hair like I do, that I am using this product.</li>
    <li> great product , it left my frizzy hair soft and manageable. would recommend it to other people to buy it</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!! My scalp feels great after a used it after one use. I&#x27;m telling everyone about this shampoo. ..</li>
    <li> This product arrived as promise.  I used it today at the hair salon and love the way it smell and how my hair felt when my stylist finished washing my hair.</li>
    <li> I use this for two reasons. One I dyed my hair over the summer and it began to shed from the dye being in my hair too long. Two, styling over time with heat just wreaks havoc on your hair. Since using I have less shedding and not as much hair in the comb.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Helps with hair thinning, though no extra growth. Very gentle on my dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner about a month ago. I love the scent and it leaves my hair very soft. I had a problem with hair loss and it stopped falling out and is beginning to grow back. Today my hairdresser asked could she wash her hair with it. I guess she loves it too. By the way, I am an African American and she is Dominican, so it works for all types of hair. Great product!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair like a broom after 10 years. Really bad product</li>
    <li> i like the smell of this shampoo i only used a little it&#x27;s very rich since i have very thick and course hair it builds up my hair also product came within the delivery expected would purchase again from this seller no problems here</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have even used.  I plan on getting all the products that will help restore my.</li>
    <li> this shampoo made my scalp feel cleaner than it ever has.  makes your hair feel fuller and I lost less in the shower.  great product</li>
    <li> Nice aroma. Good for hair loss with the energizing alter ego. I really love it. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great product.....will continue to enjoy!</li>
    <li> I was having my hairdresser use this product on my thinning and frail hair to help grow it back. I have seen some improvement.</li>
    <li> This product is great for hair that is breaking I use it religiously</li>
    <li> Very good Product. My hair look healthier, shiny and my hair loss stop completly. So definetly i recommend this product for sure.</li>
    <li> Works Great for stimulating the scalp...only thing is that It leaves hair feeling dry. It should come with a Conditioner for hair softness.</li>
