<li> They are the only game in town.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t let my money waste.</li>
<li> Also, the thicker/fuzzy portion was not really that thick.</li>

<li> I recently discovered this floss and after trying it feel it will save me from bad gums due to insufficient cleaning.  </li>
<li> The long strands of floss were also difficult to get out of the box without creating a tangly mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> But I had a hard time using it as I found out.</li>
<li> The tread is too thick.</li>
<li> The Thornton was too thick to thread between my teeth.</li>
<li> Too expensive though.</li>
<li> I am disappointed since I bought 4boxes.</li>
<li> Horrible product!</li>
<li> Worst thing I ever purchased!!!</li>

    <li> I recently discovered this floss and after trying it feel it will save me from bad gums due to insufficient cleaning.  Just avoiding gum surgery and treatments will more than pay for this floss, not to mention bad breath and other negatives due to ineffective cleaning on my part.  I just ordered 5 boxes of Regular, not Mint, from Dentist.net at $4.49 each, plus $4.95 shipping.  These will last 5 months and I am happy.  I do not understand the prices that Amazon is posting for this item and I suggest Amazon do some price comparisons on its dental items. I love you, Amazon, but someone needed to tell you why some items don&#x27;t sell.</li>
    <li> I recently had quite a bit of dental work, including a bridge to replace a lost molar. I&#x27;m new to bridge work and am finding it to be a little more high maintenance than I thought it would be. Thankfully, I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the threader floss, a Superfloss type, as recommended by my dentist. It did the job, but I did not care for the long strand of attached floss to use on the rest of my teeth, as I prefer a waxed product. Also, the thicker/fuzzy portion was not really that thick. Glide floss has a threader version, but it does not have the fuzzy cleaning portion. The long strands of floss were also difficult to get out of the box without creating a tangly mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thornton Bridge and Implant Cleaners are perfect. They are shorter, and have a stiff threader section on each end. The fuzzy cleaning area is much thicker and does a better job. The shorter length means they are easier to get out of the box than the threader floss. Now I can use this on my bridge, and just use my preferred brand of floss on the rest of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reviewer was correct in that they are cheaper on Thornton&#x27;s website, although they must be purchased in multiples.&lt;br /&gt;They also are almost impossible to find locally, so buying online may be the only option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricey even still, but worth it!</li>
    <li> to big can&#x27;t go under..waste money</li>
    <li> If you have a need for this type of floss, these work very well. They can be ordered directly from Thornton at a better price, however their customer service has not always been the best.</li>
    <li> It is a must if you have a fixed bridge that you need to get under.  The ends are stiff enough to get under the bridge and the thick area really cleans. You have to be gentle with this floss because it scrubs.  I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have all bridges and implants. These are the easiest to use for cleaning. The tips hold up well and there is enough stiffness for the back teeth.</li>
    <li> works great. thanks for having them</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.  Gets where Super Floss misses.  I have a mouthful of implants and learned of this product when I last visited dentist.</li>
    <li> Thornton cleaners work  well. Too expensive though. Should be a better deal somewhere.</li>
    <li> It does its job, get things clean, but it hurts my gum since it is very rough on the foam, but I guess that is how it does its job.</li>
    <li> I ordered the mint, however, I did not receive the mint. I did not want to return because I was out of the floss.</li>
    <li> took forever to get them but they work really well</li>
    <li> I guess these are bridge cleaners but I use them as interdental cleaners and find them very effective. The smaller wire interdental cleaners are not as effective. Problem these cleaners are not available in regular drug stores</li>
    <li> Were OK. But I had a hard time using it as I found out. I have arthritis in my right hand and it makes certain movements are difficult.</li>
    <li> I have implants upon which bridges are attached. This product keeps the underside of bridges clean and debris clear. If I am not mistaken this is the only product of its kind on the market. This product works really well in its stated advertised usage. I do recommend highly.</li>
    <li> These work very well.</li>
    <li> works great......... but price is high!!</li>
    <li> This item does what it is supposed to and does it well.&lt;br /&gt;But the cost is prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;At almost a dollar each they are really quite a rip off!</li>
    <li> I used this product for a bridge only. It is highly over priced. I went ahead and ordered this (30 total count) with expedite shipping and 5 boxes of 50 count Oral B Superfloss (250 total count) with normal shipping. They were about the same price. (30 vs 250). The oral b showed up 3 days quicker and work better for the tight fit of my bridge. Referring to the little space between my gums and the bridge. The Thornton was too thick to thread between my teeth. I normally do not post reviews, but I only purchased this because of a review I read from the oral b super floss recommending this to be the superior product. I greatly disagree.</li>
    <li> This is what you have to use now to get any strength or any fuzz.  The 3 in 1 floss USED to be this thick and strong but it has gotten cheap just like Ultra Floss did years ago.  If you have bridgework, this is the floss to use.</li>
    <li> The price is outrageous.  You can get  5 boxes for $19.95 at the Thornton website or on drugstore dot com.  Ripoff.</li>
    <li> Works when others don&#x27;t....love this product</li>
    <li> These should be priced at $4-$5 as on drugstore.com, Thorton&#x27;s own site and many others. What good is Prime free shipping when the goods are way overpriced?</li>
    <li> The dentist recommended this &amp;#34;fuzzy floss&amp;#34; things but I could not find them at&lt;br /&gt;any drug store.  Only amazon.com had them. They work great for cleaning under&lt;br /&gt;my permanent bridge.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Would recommend it to anyone that has dental work.  Worked well for me and I plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> The tread is too thick. It could not pass under my bridge. I cut my gum trying. It could not do the job. I am disappointed since I bought 4boxes. I will have to strip the middle. I can&#x27;t let my money waste. I know OralB works much better for me for sure.</li>
    <li> Functional floss. Similar products cost less</li>
    <li> These are the ONLY giant flossers available so you really don&#x27;t have a choice to make. They are the only game in town.</li>
    <li> Horrible product! It sheds everywhere and makes a big mess!!! Worst thing I ever purchased!!!</li>
    <li> Product is ok but somewhat expensive</li>
    <li> I never heard of these cleaners until my dental hygienist used it on my last cleaning.  I have a few caps that are attached making it necessary to use a threading type dental floss.  These are all in one without having to thread your floss through the plastic eye type.  The floss part is a bit thicker so once it is threaded, it will feel a different than the average floss thickness.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> These are the best for cleaning under bridges</li>
    <li> Great price, quality Floss.</li>
