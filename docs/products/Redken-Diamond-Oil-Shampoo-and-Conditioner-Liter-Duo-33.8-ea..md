    <li> I love the RedKen Color Extend so I wanted to try this one.  It smells amazing, but even using liberal amounts of the conditioner my hair does not want to comb out after using this.  It just doesn&#x27;t condition well at all.  Plus my hair feels oily after a couple days and my hair is very dry with very little oil so I don&#x27;t like that oily feeling either.  I switched to an all natural, organic shampoo and conditioner that I like much better</li>
    <li> Great product!!  This shampoo and conditioner leaves your hair easy to manage unlike others.  It does not leave your hair too soft to contend with.  Love it, love it, love it!!  ;)</li>
    <li> My hair stylest burned my hair with high lights. This helped keep my hair from breaking off and made my hair very soft and not dry it out.</li>
    <li> Really happy with the outcome of this Shampoo &amp; Conditioner I bought a big one because I wash my hair every week and this was a great deal</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Arrived quick. Very happy</li>
    <li> My hairdresser was excited to have me try this line because she knew I had been looking for something that would allow me to let my hair dry naturally for years and had tried every product on the market. I have long, white hair that has some natural curl and wave in it (although the curls have relaxed some with age!) but always had to wet set it so that I could tame the frizz. Not any more! This line, paired with 3-4 drops of the diamond oil, has made my life much happier! It took a while to play with the amounts I used. If I used too much, I lost most of the waves and curls and the curls that were left didn&#x27;t last until the next wash. Because my white hair is coarse and tends to be dry, I only wash it once a week. All I have to do now is put my Tron curling iron through my bangs and layers around my face and I&#x27;m set for the week. I was thrilled to find this larger set for such a great price.</li>
    <li> I found that the shampoo and conditioner are very high quality for moisturizing my long highlighted hair.  The shine is by far the best of any product I have used so far.  The softness is quite noticeable.  Prior to this I have used Redken So Soft for shine and softness.  I find both products to be top notch and if I had to choose, I probably would choose this one!</li>
    <li> great product for damaged or dry hair.  Smells delicious!</li>
    <li> Both shampoo and conditioner work great. My hair is very thick and wavy and the conditioner works especially nicely. Sometimes I use a touch of conditioner for the frizzes on dry hair, too.  Plus I love the way they smell, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a girl who used to believe in spending money on expensive shampoo and such because I thought they were all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo and conditioner set has made a huge difference in my overly-processed hair. My hair stylist recommended this to me.  I&#x27;m now a believer that you get what you pay for with products such as these.  My hair feels like silk.</li>
    <li> So far, this has been the best shampoo and conditioner I have used in a long time.  Spent a lot of money on Wen and it was crap.  This is great and smells SO good.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner has done a great job making my dull hair look shiny. I have always had healthy, thick hair, but tho shampoo and conditioner really did a great job. It also has helped with my hair not being so oily.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Got there right away.</li>
    <li> Great seller, fast shipping. I&#x27;m still getting used to the shampoo but it looks like my hair loves it. Nice choice!</li>
    <li> Purchasing these large bottles saved me a lot of money. I love the feel of my hair and I love the smell of this product!</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair looking dirty and, or too oil so itis very limp and heavy. My boyfriend points it out all the time. The smell reminds me of a cheap cologne my ex wore. I do not like this product. But Iam sure it would be great for another hair type. I have blond hair, so though i have a head full of hair, the strands are thin, i have tighter follicles. I would be better suited with a volumizer. I am dissapointed for the price I payed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking this shampoo and conditioner! I wish they came with the pump though.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It works amazing on my hair. Will always use this product, please don&#x27;t ever change it, ever</li>
    <li> My stylist told me I should by this because my hair was feeling dry.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not that impressed.  It’s just average if you ask me....and my hair is still dry.  I probably won&#x27;t purchase again. I guess I need something with more intense conditioning however my blonde color still looks great.</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly and product was exactly as advertised. Great product at a great price! Will order from this seller again.</li>
