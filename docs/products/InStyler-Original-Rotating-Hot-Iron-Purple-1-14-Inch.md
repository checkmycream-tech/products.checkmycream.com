      <li>Love this product and shipping was perfect</li>
      <li>It leaves hair nice and shiny- great for hair straightening.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s probably a good idea to use this.    </li>
      <li>A good idea to help prevent heat damage.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The good news for those of you who are NOT klutzy like me</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, add a cool tip and a barrel that rotates in both directions, and you have a PERFECT product</li>
      <li>So, if you want a nice look for an evening, this is a good iron to use.</li>
      <li>My daughter wanted to try this out as she does like to style her own hair; she is surprisingly good with it.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product, the new design is great and my wife loves it.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it made my hair look and how easy it was to use.</li>
      <li>If you are patience, which is not my strong suit, this works great.  </li>
      <li>It could just be me though, as I don&#x27;t often spend a lot of time on my own hair.</li>
      <li>One of the concerns I ran across when I was doing my research questioned the ability to use a rotating barrel without catching hair in the process</li>
      <li>The InStyler has lots of things that it can do to your hair and quite effectively.  </li>

      <li>But this has happened once or twice in the two years that I&#x27;ve own them.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t even have to warm up.  </li>
      <li>I own both the 1/4&#x27; and the 3/4 in InStyler</li>
      <li>The rotating iron does come with its own protective mat, which is a nice thing to include with something like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Your hair will be gorgeous - strong, shiny, undamaged.</li>
      <li>but i can make perfect soft waves leaving my hair unoily and looking like it was just done in a salon.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
      <li>Love Love Love the Instyler!</li>
      <li>As a beginner, this was a great tool to prevent my fingers from hitting the hot barrel.</li>
      <li>Ive had it for 2 years, and still works perfectly fine!</li>
      <li>The InStyler gave me the most perfect wavy curls, pretty much exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>I have lots of fine hair and it does an amazing job of curling it.  </li>
      <li>They love it.</li>
      <li>We love it..</li>
      <li>that I never seemed to be able to fully straighten with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>My Babyliss cost way more</li>
      <li>Just read the instructions and maybe go to their website also if you need to, to be sure you understand what it does and how to use it.</li>
      <li>This product is ingenious.</li>
      <li>There were better results as this friend had thicker hair.</li>
      <li>Make sure you go online and watch how to use it has lots of tips and ideas.</li>
      <li>This is just an ok product.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Works well- make sure you go on youtube and watch some videos on how it works.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE the instyler.</li>
      <li>This works better than the blow dryer and brush, but I&#x27;m still an uncoordinated klutz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>AND I love this product.  </li>
      <li>and I ended up with tangled hair and hair caught in the top of the barrel.</li>
      <li>and I did burn myself a couple times, but I&#x27;m sure it gets easier the more you do</li>
      <li>and I love that it adds volume to hair as it straightens.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love my InStyler.  </li>
      <li>Unlike most infomercials, this product stood out to her as something she wanted to try.</li>
      <li>most of you hair</li>
      <li>Love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Instyler instead massages, separates and smooths those curly ends :)</li>
      <li>so I thought I would be okay with not getting it tangled</li>
      <li>Makes my hair so smooth!</li>
      <li>but I still love it</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>If you have wavy or curly hair then you might want to purchase this item as it would be perfect for your hair, especially for straightening.</li>
      <li>but I wish it had more tension to have a stronger hold on my hair.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE -</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love that it includes a sectioning comb with the rat tail end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are so many uses for the InStyler.  </li>
      <li>from the many split ends it gives me, it is my go to styling tool when going somewhere fancy, but would never use more than once in a month.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The part of adding volume to the top of your crown?</li>
      <li>, my hair was healthy,</li>
      <li>simply love my instyler.</li>
      <li>This time it caught at the top, tangled in the so-called &amp;#34;safety tip&amp;#34</li>
      <li>It is so much more than that</li>
      <li>I Think I&#x27;m going to love it once I get use to it??</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product and shipping was perfect</li>
    <li> Daughters love it. So easy my 12 and 14 year old girls use it alone</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved it nothing bad to say about it!</li>
    <li> This thing is more work than it&#x27;s worth. Takes me twice as long as using my flat iron and I don&#x27;t think it gave me the best looking style. I don&#x27;t like the motorized turning of the center part. I&#x27;m returning it and getting a round brush dryer instead which I like more. If you do plan to get this you will have to take some time to learn how to use it. There is definitely a trick to it. But I need quick and speedy for my mornings and this wasn&#x27;t it for me.  The other thing I don&#x27;t like about it is it&#x27;s bulky so if I was traveling I would leave this behind for a smaller, more streamlined styler.</li>
    <li> This is my second instyler. I have a sick obsession with them! Gives you the most perfect curls, perfect waves, and if you want to straighten your hair with it, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the volume!</li>
    <li> I have BABY fine naturally straight hair...that being said humidity, ponytail holders, sleeping or just about anything makes my hair kink, flip, &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34;, and go anyway put pin straight.  I stopped washing everyday about 5 years ago, so I end up wearing a ponytail because by day 2 my hair is flat, but looking like I wet my hair then went helmetless on a motorcycle then slept on it.  I bought the InStyler somewhere other than Amazon. I love it.  My hair is so fine and &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t have to part it out to straighten, I just run it through (on the first setting for fine hair) almost like I am brushing it and viola my hair is pin straight in minutes and it looks like I washed, blew it dry then straightened it! It is also SO easy to use.  All you do is plug it in, turn it on to your favorite heat setting and it&#x27;s ready to go. It doesn&#x27;t even have to warm up.  If your debating about buying this product...go for it.  I also have to say I am a SIMPLE woman when it comes to my hair and primping, so anything that takes more than minutes I just don&#x27;t do.  I actually put off trying this for about a month because I thought it would be all involved and time consuming.  I&#x27;m glad I was wrong.  I will use the InStyler on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything to my hair.  I think it&#x27;s not getting hot enough.</li>
    <li> I love that I can straighten my hair but still have the movement and volume that you lose with other straightener&#x27;s. I also like that it makes my hair look and feel healthier and it&#x27;s so shiny.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone so long without this straightener. I have hard to manage thick curly hair and not only does it straighten my hair but i can make perfect soft waves leaving my hair unoily and looking like it was just done in a salon. Great product!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly so it&#x27;s very hard to get it straight, but the InSyler works great.  My hair isn&#x27;t frizzy now and it&#x27;s nice and straight.  I recommend this product for anyone who has natural curly hair.  You&#x27;ll be surprised how your hair looks.</li>
    <li> I love my InStyler so much got one for my daughter. Make sure you go online and watch how to use it has lots of tips and ideas.</li>
    <li> Got this for the wife, seems to help speed up the wait time for her to straighten her hair. So 5 stars for less wait time. And she never complained at the product.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these ever since they came out.  Last one lasted about six years. Love it</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try out the Instyler after reading reviews, checking out the demos, and finding a really good deal from the merchant to buy one and get one free.  I had hoped that this would replace my Chi straightener and provide some much needed body and smoothness to my fine, thin hair.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not what happened.  One of the concerns I ran across when I was doing my research questioned the ability to use a rotating barrel without catching hair in the process (the premise of the Instyler is that a rotating barrel and ionized bristles will provide smooth straight or curly hair, depending on your technique).  My experience included having different sections of my hair either completely ripped out or so thoroughly tangled that i had to take the Instyler apart to free my hair.  The first time it happened I thought maybe I&#x27;d done something wrong.  Perhaps I&#x27;d tried to run too much hair through at one time?  So i did an even smaller section and tried again.  Same result, my hair was caught at the base of the barrel and ripped out at the root.  Stupidly, I kept going thinking that maybe it was the heat guard that was catching my hair and forcing it into the base of the barrel.  I took of the heat guard and returned to straightening my hair.  After a few passes without incident I thought I&#x27;d solved the problem.  Wrong!!  My hair caught again!!  This time it caught at the top, tangled in the so-called &amp;#34;safety tip&amp;#34; that screws into the end of the barrel.  Such a large section of hair caught that i had to unplug the iron and frantically attempt to untangle it before it&#x27;s extended stay on the iron caused it to catch on fire.  I didn&#x27;t see many negative reviews, so I suppose it&#x27;s possible I got some kind of defective product.  However, even if it hadn&#x27;t ended up tearing my hear out I would still be returning my Instyler.  It really didn&#x27;t provide the kind of smooth finish that i was looking for.  Truthfully, my hot rollers and chi work much better to give me the body and smoothness my hair needs.  I hope this helps provide a different perspective for anyone who is researching this product.  The one thing I will say is that the merchant had great customer service and were very courteous when I called to talk to them about returning my product.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both use it.  We love it..</li>
    <li> It worked great but stopped working after 30days! Such a disappointment because I absolutely loved it when it WAS working</li>
    <li> Happy with both items.Reccommend highly.</li>
    <li> Very sad that this did not work the way I had expected. I have wavy curly hair and was hoping it was going to straighten as it looked on commercial. But no. It did not. You have to take a very small amount of hair to make it work and it takes forever to do your whole head of hair.</li>
    <li> So I have had my original instyer since early 2010. Just two days ago, it finally died :(. [Overheated] Even up until then, I continuely got the same great results as I did when I first used it. I love that it is versitile on all hair types, from my kinky hair all the way to my friend&#x27;s silky thin hair. I love it, obviously since I&#x27;m buying it again. Added bonus is now that they have a smaller barrel which get even closer to the roots to get a better straighten. I have dropped my instyler countless times and no extreme damage. Maybe if I wouldnt have dropped it so much i wouldnt have had to buy a new one. I cant wait to get my new in mail. This is the only flat iron I will ever be buying for as long as I am alive or until they stop production. I would highly recommend purchasing it.  There is a smal learning curve but by the time your are done flat ironing most of you hair you&#x27;ll get the hang of the rotating barrel. Don&#x27;t miss out on a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I purchased my InStyler several years ago, I LOVE it. This is the only tool that REALLY WORKS! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this product, price is too high but I still love it</li>
    <li> too much money i can go n the actual website and buy it for only 15.99! save money live better go to the website lol althugh the instyler is a very impressive took i still recommend the website brand</li>
    <li> This works just like the videos. I just don&#x27;t know if you NEED one</li>
    <li> The InStyler has changed my life!&lt;br /&gt;I confess, I use to get my hair blow out professionally - a lot. One day a friend let me use her InStyler and I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it made my hair look and how easy it was to use. Even for me.  Now I own the original InStyler and the Wet to Dry, and I love them both.  I can&#x27;t believe how much money, time, and hassle (making appointments/driving/parking - ugh!) I wasted!!!!</li>
    <li> Definitely definitely definitely definitely does work. If you do exactly as instructed you will have nooooo problem. Came with dvd. If that doesn&#x27;t help you then watch videos on YouTube. Will definitely help you. I&#x27;m getting the Wet to Dry next. I&#x27;m always cautious of spending money on stuff on tv. This is definitely worth every penny. The Instyler together with WEN® BY CHAD, you can&#x27;t go wrong! 😄👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> I needed a new curling iron and I ordered this thinking it was a basic curling iron with a brush.  It is so much more than that and it is way too much for me to use.  The InStyler has lots of things that it can do to your hair and quite effectively.  It is lightweight and easy to use and it heats up quickly.  But the problem is that I have very very straight hair and the InStyler is basically for wavy or curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is absolutely nothing wrong with the InStyler but it is not the hot iron that I need. If you have wavy or curly hair then you might want to purchase this item as it would be perfect for your hair, especially for straightening.</li>
    <li> The InStyler is a rotating curling iron that can flip hair up, flip hair out, or create curl. It does take a certain amount of skill to operate it. You also need to be careful not to burn yourself. The barrel is large and rotates so it seems slightly more intimidating than a regular curling iron or flatiron.    A plastic clip on heat guard comes with this, in our tests we left this on to avoid clumsy burns. The shaft rotates fine, and the hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the guard, so it&#x27;s probably a good idea to use this.    In our tests we were able to get our hair to flip in, and flip out and smooth out some unruly waves. We have thin hair so we used the lowest setting. No one, had hair long enough to wrap around the shaft and test out the curl wave effect, but in theory it looks like it would work.    Hair came out smooth with no burns. A little shine spray seems to help, but is not necessary. There is definitely a learning curve to using this, but there are a lot of videos on You Tube that help.</li>
    <li> This is a unique styling tool.  I should have gotten the ¾” one for my shorter hair but it worked just fine with the larger one.  My curls were just looser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has three heat settings and I used the low as I have fine hair.  If you are patience, which is not my strong suit, this works great.  The rotating barrel even gives your hair a shiny look which makes your style look all that much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a something they call a thermal guard.  It prevents the iron from getting too close to your head.  It snaps on and off easily if you feel you don’t need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a nylon storage bag and a comb/pick combination as well.  The instructions are clear and they are correct when they say DRY hair.  I used it right after I dried my hair and it wasn’t as dry as the next morning.  It worked much better the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a great gift for someone with medium to long hair.</li>
    <li> This styler is the perfect solution to my hair troubles. It works quickly and stays throughout the majority of the day, something that a normal curling iron is most definitely not able to accomplish. It straightens, curls out, and under very well. The main place it is lacking is in the actual curling department. It does not create very impressive curls. This was not what I desire to do with my hair, anyway, so it really wasn&#x27;t a downside for me. If, however, you would like to get big curls, I would recommend either a wand or a curling iron, not the instyler.</li>
    <li> The InStyler is easy to use. It gets hot quickly and stays at a constant temperature. I did find the need to use thicker pieces of hair. Also, it smooths, but not as much as a flat iron. I have natural, 4B hair and needed to blow dry first thoroughly. It did leave a nice final bump of curl, but wasn&#x27;t long lasting. So, if you want a nice look for an evening, this is a good iron to use. If you are looking for a longer lasting, smoother curl - use Curl Formers or a similar product. Good for occasional use by naturals, but couldn&#x27;t be used for long term maintenance due to the high heat needed.</li>
    <li> It is a vast improvement on non rolling hot iron with brush like Conair&#x27;s. It leaves hair nice and shiny- great for hair straightening. This product will work for medium to long hair but will only be partially good for short hair because you cannot use it to hair close to your nape lest you want to singe it. First time I used it even with medium hair, I burned the back of my neck trying to curl my hair in that area. The #1 setting is sufficient for partially dried hair, otherwise it will be too hot, you will see your hair steaming. Overall I love the product, did not give it a 5 star because of the cautions in using it.</li>
    <li> There is not original with him a CD-ROM</li>
    <li> My wife saw this in an infomercial. Unlike most infomercials, this product stood out to her as something she wanted to try. Why? Because she has super fine hair, and most products don&#x27;t do much for adding body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When giving the InStyler a whirl, it was a little confusing at first. So I went to the InStyler website and watched a few videos. The most relevant one was the video named, \\&quot;Fine or Thin Hair.\\&quot; The hair on the model used in the video had much thicker hair than my wife, so when I sat her down in a chair and followed the directions, I wasn&#x27;t entirely surprised when we had no positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next we took the InStyler to a friend&#x27;s house and tried it on her. There were better results as this friend had thicker hair. However, the friend still preferred her Perfecter Fusion Styler over this one. So next I tried it on my mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother has really thick, frizzy hair. Which is often out of control and hard to manage. When using the InStyler on her we were met with pretty amazing results. The frizzles vanished and was replaced with slick, silky hair. My 5-year-old daughter even commented on it saying, \\&quot;Grandma, your hair looks really soft.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the InStyler proved to be ineffective on my wife&#x27;s thin hair, but it did prove to be useful for thicker hair. It even did wonders for making a grandma look classy :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be warned that the InStyler roller gets extremely hot. We&#x27;re talking 225° - 430°F, so be careful and keep it out of the reach of children.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife for Christmas. She has used it several days and really loves the results it has on her hair. Awesome product according to her</li>
    <li> I love the InStyler for some purposes and am not a huge fan of it for others. I&#x27;m a huge fan of the hair straightener I already have so I was really looking for something that would give me curls. Specifically, light beachy curls. Whenever I use my current curling iron, the curls are so tight and bouncy even on a low heat setting. The InStyler gave me the most perfect wavy curls, pretty much exactly what I wanted! The tool also does wonders for hair volume, making it easy for you to add lift to your hair. It&#x27;s not necessarily the easiest tool to use and I did burn myself a couple times, but I&#x27;m sure it gets easier the more you do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say my hair is pretty average. It&#x27;s not thick nor thin and it&#x27;s not really curly or straight. If I let it dry without styling it, it has a wave to it (but not really a pretty wave...). The InStyler also does a great job straightening and I love that it adds volume to hair as it straightens. However, I probably wouldn&#x27;t replace my current straightener with it as it doesn&#x27;t get close enough to the root for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s pretty impossible to find one tool that does it all, so I&#x27;m just happy I found the InStyler to give me voluminous loose curls!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love my InStyler.  I have lots of fine hair and it does an amazing job of curling it.  This is my second purchase....the first one lasted six years and I use it everyday.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my hair.</li>
    <li> VERY CHEAP PRODUCT SENT IT BACK</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted to try this out as she does like to style her own hair; she is surprisingly good with it.  As a nearly bald guy, I didn&#x27;t have much input for it myself, so I quizzed her on this product which she was excited to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing that she wanted to note that it will scare you just a tad at first because of the noise it makes as it spins, but once you get used to it, it works really well.  It heats up quickly and has 3 heat settings per the instructions - a relatively low heat setting of 285 degrees if you have fine, delicate hair up to 410 degrees for thick hair.  Just as with any hair iron, handle this with extreme caution, especially given how hot it gets and don&#x27;t simply rest it anywhere after use.  The rotating iron does come with its own protective mat, which is a nice thing to include with something like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter does give it top marks for what its intended for and felt that it was fairly easy to use.  I figure that if an 11-year old can handle it fairly well, then that&#x27;s a pretty good vote of confidence for me.  Of course, always be careful when using this with your young children (we don&#x27;t let her use it unsupervised), but its ease of use for her makes me feel that it&#x27;s worth endorsing.</li>
    <li> I started out with this original InStyler one-way rotating barrel and was continually frustrated.  It would have worked great had I wanted to have my hair flip up on one side and turn under on the other side.  With the one-way rotating barrel, trying to maneuver the InStyler around without burning myself was almost impossible.  I returned it and purchased the InStyler 2-way rotating barrel - what a world of difference!  Now with 2 clicks of the handle, the barrel rotates in the other direction.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron 3/4&amp;#34; for short hair&lt;br /&gt;InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron 1-1/4&amp;#34; for shoulder length or longer hair</li>
    <li> The hot iron functions well, but my hair is too short for this styler to be useful!  I think your hair would have to be longer than 2&amp;#34; to get the benefit of this tool.  Having said that, I am going to grow out my hair so I can try it.</li>
    <li> The first thing that impressed me about the InStyler was how fast it heated up to the Max temp.  My Chi straightener takes at least 5 minutes to come up to the 450 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse, Italian curly hair and rely on straighteners on a daily basis.  I was afraid that this tool would tangle my hair.  I cut the length of my hair to the bottom of the neck length a couple of weeks ago so I thought I would be okay with not getting it tangled and I was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ease of the roller action was fantastic.  I liked the fact that I could just pull down and straighten and/or curl at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat didn&#x27;t affect me.  I didn&#x27;t feel like I was going to burn myself at all.  The Instyler is designed to work on fully dry hair.  I have heard stories of hair frizzing with use if used on damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sectioning the hair is key with this Iron.  I love that it includes a sectioning comb with the rat tail end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Iron will not only straighten and curl but will give lift and body to thin, straight hair.  There are so many uses for the InStyler.  I love it and I think all professional beauty stylists should have one at their stations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Instyler is pretty easy to clean and I recommend you give it a quick wipe with a damp cloth on a daily basis to keep product from building up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a long list of DO NOT do warnings in the manual, the funniest to me being \\&quot;NEVER use while sleeping\\&quot;.  Yeah, that might not produce great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Because of the need to have completely dry hair and having to make slower rotation passes, I will probably use the Instyler about twice a week.  I will be keeping my Chi because I can use that on damp hair and make faster passes.  The InStyler makes a great addition to my hair styling tools.</li>
    <li> InStyler is an excellent styling iron that doubles both for curling and straightening.  My wife and daughter have both been very impressed with the product and both have commented that it leaves their hair feeling silky.  There are different heat settings to allow for exactly the effect you want (and both instructions and online videos to see how) and unlike some other models does not damage your hair.  It has become a hit it my house and sometimes a battle over who gets to use it first.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, I really did! I have fine, straight, soft hair that is hard to curl with regular curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this several times but each time it just would not curl my hair. From what I have read in other reviews, this doesn&#x27;t work well with fine hair. I had hoped they were wrong but apparantly not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in yet another tool that didn&#x27;t live up to its hype for me.</li>
    <li> I still prefer my flat iron.  I have very thick, long, coarse, wavy hair.  This does not get my hair nearly as straight as my flat iron.  I found the the brush to actually cause more of the fly-aways and frizzies.  It is also very awkward to use.  The how-to videos show a stylist doing a model&#x27;s hair.  This should be your first clue that it is hard to do your own hair with it.  I could not make it work easily to try the &amp;#34;curling&amp;#34; aspect.  The brush gets in the way and it is hard to figure out how to wrap your hair successfully without burning your fingers.  As a straightening tool it may be helpful for someone with thinner hair who wants to straighten without decreasing volume.</li>
    <li> First it&#x27;s not that easy to use and its definitely a pain to get the slightest curl. It doesn&#x27;t work for very well on thick hair and it takes me entirely too long. After purchasing it, i found out the barrel is completely metal which is also not good to use on your hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend investing in this product at all. Definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I Think I&#x27;m going to love it once I get use to it??</li>
    <li> It is an amazing tool for both daughter&#x27;s hair (Thick) and my wife&#x27;s hair (silky). My wife does not let my daughter near hot appliances but after initial hesitation and seeing how easy it is to use, allowed her to use it.  It only took about fifteen minutes of use to get the desired hairstyle saving atleast 5 or 10 min over the existing styler . There are three settings that will suit you, which  is thin, Medium and  thick. I will certainly update here if it breaks .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A winner every way !</li>
    <li> So far, my daughters and I love this.  All three of us have some natural curl in our hair and this product helped us add some lovely curls.  I did find that this was much easier for me to use on the girls rather than on myself.  It could just be me though, as I don&#x27;t often spend a lot of time on my own hair. We haven&#x27;t actually used it to straighten our hair yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s ability to straighten hair.  I will update this review once we do.</li>
    <li> I believe the one I got is either a fake or defective. I had the same exact one before and it worked great. I lost it though so decided to get another. This one does not heat up as high as the one before. Makes the whole process take longer.</li>
    <li> Santa (aka my husband) brought me an early Christmas present this year – an Instyler! My hair is long, coarse and wavy (in an untamed way). I found that the Instyler is a great tool to straighten my hair without making it look flat and lifeless like a regular flatiron would. It was also easy to use and took less time than the flatiron. As for adding curls, I found that the tutorials (videos) were very helpful as I was never good at curling my hair.  The package also came with a &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34; which goes over the rotating barrel. As a beginner, this was a great tool to prevent my fingers from hitting the hot barrel. Once you are used to working with the Instyler, I don&#x27;t think you will need to use the guard anymore. What a great present!!!!</li>
    <li> My Caucasian hair is coarse and a bit wavy. It does work as described. However, I feel I can get the same results with a straightening iron in half the time. I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money on this, but now that I have it, I will probably use it occasionally, simply to justify the expense. I really wish the rotating iron barrel would move in both directions, as this seriously makes things more complicated.</li>
    <li> They should not advertise this product for people who has curly hair. I just bought it and used only once and petty because it doesn&#x27;t worth the money i paid.... i have a soft curly hair and it is not effective at all. so i will be back to my hair hair dryer and my professional ceramic straightener</li>
    <li> While I love my Instyler, I recently started combing my hair on the right, which leaves the majority of my hair on the left side of my head. I find that, due to the barrel only turning in one direction, it has become practically useless. It will still flip my hair under, but it makes my hair frizzy instead of smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing beats it as far as quickly adding volume to my flat, straight hair, but I WISH it rotated in both directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be VERY careful, it is very easy to burn your ears if you&#x27;re flying through styling your hair. The barrel gets extremely hot and there is no end to grab like on a regular curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, add a cool tip and a barrel that rotates in both directions, and you have a PERFECT product</li>
    <li> Still working with it. My hair is about four inches long and wanted it for lift. It works great but still wondering if I should have gotten the smaller barrel</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the deal,&lt;br /&gt;I simply love my instyler. I have very long wavy hair and wouldn&#x27;t attempt a flat iron to straighten it in fear of it taking more than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;With the instyler, I can straighten my hair, which is long and thick, in just over 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The kicker is that I have to use it on the highest setting or it won&#x27;t budge my waves, which are not even that wavy.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I had to rate only a 4 star:&lt;br /&gt;After a haircut, my hair was healthy, no splits, nothing. The first time using the instyler after my haircut, I found split ends the very next day after I washed my hair. I do use heat protectant and am very careful when it comes to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, I can only use the instyler for special occasions, or else I&#x27;d be doing my hair a lot of wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth noting the very bad smell upon first using the tool, but that quickly fades away. The instyler does what it says in the sense that it straightens easily and tames frizz, but only temporarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part of adding volume to the top of your crown? Don&#x27;t even attempt it if you have long hair. You WILL end up looking like you just took a really tight hair tie out of your hair, and it left that ugly crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t work on wet or damp hair, and works best with day old hair, given you don&#x27;t get too greasy within one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the many split ends it gives me, it is my go to styling tool when going somewhere fancy, but would never use more than once in a month.</li>
    <li> This is great!  Hard to figure out at first, but much better when you get the hang of it.  Actually gives you volume you don&#x27;t get with a flat iron.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I have to dry my hair first, I was hoping to alleviate that step, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my college age daughter to use and this is what she had to say:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This is an excellent product that is a breeze to use.  My hair is straight/relaxed and this transforms it into a glossy, blow-out look within minutes.  I&#x27;ve also styled my friend&#x27;s hair with this product and it works well with different hair types.  If your hair is naturally curly, it will likely hold a more defined curl using this product.  Because of my straight hair, it is easier for me to achieve tight curls with an iron, but I would still highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, the new design is great and my wife loves it. The thermolon reduces the heat compared to the old design.</li>
    <li> Is pretty amazing, works fine for me, my hair is softer and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have very thick little curls (mixed chic hair) and this is the only thing that actually makes my hair straight. I think that the money is worth it, mine stopped rotating after a year so I am buying another one because I think the money is worth it and as I mentioned this is the only thing that gets my hair straight from all the other 100 flattening irons that I have tried this works the best. People should not forget to put the right products in their hair before using the straightener, even though in the instructions it might say that there should not be anything in your hair when you use it. I put allot of products (anti frizz) in my hair before I use it and it ends up being very straight without my hair sticking together or looking like i straightened it with an iron.</li>
    <li> Buy went with no issue. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I own both the 1/4&#x27; and the 3/4 in InStyler and I use them on a weekly basis, they are my one and only flat irons.  I literally got rid of all my other flat irons after trying this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a little learning curve, specially if you are used to traditional flat irons and it does make some noise but the results are phenomenal.  Now mind you, I have thin, blonde hair and I used it on medium heat and it leaves my hair bone straight each and every time.  Now I do find myself having to trim the ends of my hear due to exposing them to the heat but that&#x27;s to be expected from using any heating tool.  I have not used it to curl my hair but I do plan to and I&#x27;ll do an up-date if it does or doesn&#x27;t works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had them for well over two years and they are working perfectly and should they stop working, I would most definitely repurchase and I do recommend them, just give it the benefit of the doubt and use it a few times before throwing in the towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH AND PLEASE BE CAREFUL, THIS THING GETS REALLY HOT AND IT CAN BURN!  I&#x27;ve lightly tapped my forearm with it and let me tell you, it hurt intensely.  But this has happened once or twice in the two years that I&#x27;ve own them.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE - TO TOO FLAT - NOT TOO WAVY - JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
    <li> Works great on my long frizzy, curly hair but I wish it had more tension to have a stronger hold on my hair.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, best gift I ever bought her.</li>
    <li> This is a well-made product, but buyer beware, it is not easy to use. My wife found it much harder than standard irons to use on herself, and it does seem easier to use on someone else. It makes for softer-feeling hair due to the brush, and is more effective at the tips of hair, but the time and care needed does not make for a good everyday tool.</li>
    <li> This is awesome and I love it. Even works great on my shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love the Instyler! A quick note on my hair type, I am mixed black (chinese, scottish, Ivory Coast) and my hair inherited the THICK THICK THICK of all three...whew! To top it off my hair is natural (no chemicals) and it&#x27;s 3C &amp; 4A tight corkscrew curls all over and down to the middle of my back.  Now with that said, I love wearing my hair straight due to it being much easier to manage straight, plus I wake up late for work everyday, so I only have about 5 minutes to get &#x27;er done in the morning.  I admire the curls, but when you have gots to go, I don&#x27;t have time for the untwist, re-hydrate, fluff, tuck, smooth, define and re-hydrate again and I like to wash about once a week, so time is of the essence.  If I can&#x27;t get it done in under a minute, something is wrong with the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in steps the instyler....World of difference. With this, a quick blow dry with my beloved Conair tourmaline styler (first love!!, dry in 15 minutes flat), and then a spray of heat protector and a run of the Instyler through my mane, hair is done in under 15 - 20 minutes and I&#x27;m set all week long. The key is to learn how to use it correctly. I keep reading of burning, not straightening, etc. and a lot of it is in that learning curve. Basically if you are use to doing a chase method to flat iron, this removes the chase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using it, I wash, deep condition so the curls are moisturized and flexible and detangle under water in the shower using a pink tangle teaser.  Then using a great leave in (Aphogee green tea spray and then Proclaim argan serum), I let that sit for a minute, and hit it with the blow dryer or air dry.  If you deep condition, the curls will flex and do your bidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it&#x27;s dry, I run the Instyler through my hair in sections, and this runs through like butter. Now I originally had this version (which works wonderfully) but recently upgraded to the Instyler IQ and OMG!! That thing cuts through my hair like silk on silk! No reversion, just straight, easy to manage hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, is that due to the bristles separating the hair, I notice WAY LESS hair damage.  When I first started using the instyler years ago, my hair was not past my neck, but with less heat being needed (I use mine on medium), my hair is like ragweed because this think helps to retain the length and in under a year, due to less heat needed with the Instyler, my hair was down to mid back length because my normal flat iron wasn&#x27;t breaking it off at the ends anymore.  Instyler instead massages, separates and smooths those curly ends :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, now back to the process:  After all of this, which takes about 45 minutes once a week, I don&#x27;t have to hit my hair with heat again until the next deep condish. All I do at night is a 5 second rub of coconut oil and off to snore land I go, in the morning, pull it up into a clip and hair is done in 15 seconds! :)  Love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re like me, thick head of corkscrew curls, do your hair once a week and have a need for speed to get the hell out the door to work in the morning without messing with your hair for an hour, grab this thing! You&#x27;ll get your life back and time spent in the bathroom can now be spent grabbing a great frapp at Starbucks! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
    <li> Works very well. I like the volume vs a flat iron and flat hair</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be impressed, but I was wrong.  I&#x27;ve had the product for a few days, and I love how it straightens my hair.  I have a regular straightener, but I haven&#x27;t used it once since getting the InStyler.  I have very thin hair, and for my hair it is fast and easy.</li>
    <li> This product works well.  I have baby fine hair so it does not take much to straighten it; however, my hair is waving and can be frizzy at times, so I am very satisfied with how the InStyler straightens/curls my hair.  The only problem I am finding now is that it tends to freeze and not spin when I am almost done styling my hair.  I just bought it 2 months ago so it is a bit disappointing that it’s already acting up.  Not sure if it’s just hot and needs to cool down, but then again, it’s a hot iron!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product, does such a great job on my hair, and lasts all day long!!! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This is probably a great tool for a hair dresser or a skilled individual.  I have used the regular InStyler that only rotates in one direction and I love it.  This changes direction of the barrel too easily and I ended up with tangled hair and hair caught in the top of the barrel. I had to cut my hair out with scissors.  I certainly hope they continue to make the older model.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get get hot enough and only the tip spun not the whole barrell. Returned :(</li>
    <li> mY DAUGHTER AND I love this product.  Much better than a regular straightener.  My daughter has really curly hair and this does a great job and lasts for 3 or 4 days.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> this is not good for really curly thick it it worked pretty good when I first got it bit than it made my hair frizz I don&#x27;t if it was me  but I gave it away</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very clumsy with a hair dryer and brush, trying to get two hands to operate while looking at my opposite self image in the mirror, and somehow I thought that this brush-curling iron combo would help me to wrangle my hair into something nicer than Naturally Dried. Sadly, I&#x27;m still a klutz. This works better than the blow dryer and brush, but I&#x27;m still an uncoordinated klutz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news for those of you who are NOT klutzy like me, this is a well made tool. It heats up quickly, and is well built while still being lightweight enough so as not to be tiresome to hold for the duration. There are three different heat options, a nice carry case for traveling, a hair pic and a heat guard, if you&#x27;re inclined to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep practicing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the instyler. Ive had so many straighteners that i hated, but im in love with this. Ive had it for 2 years, and still works perfectly fine! Recommend it for everyone</li>
    <li> The InStyler is interchangeable with a flat iron, with just a little more flexibility.  You can straighten or curl, once you get the hang of it.  The rolling barrel makes it a little easier to smooth hair as your are straightening, so no funky crimped pieces.  The rolling action does make it difficult to use on your non dominant side, as it only rolls in one direction.  That makes it a little awkward to get those underneath pieces, or some spots in the back, BUT...it isn&#x27;t really much different than using a flat iron.  Awkward the first couple of times, then once you get the hang of it its no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InStyler has adjustable heat settings, and the instructions included give suggestions for which hair types work best with which temperature.  The medium heat setting seemed to be accurate for my normal thickness curly hair.  A good idea to help prevent heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;The brush piece helps to smooth hair as it rolls through, but it also seems to collect hair as it rolls through.  I had to stop a few times and clear it out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very good quality hair straightener, especially for a newbie like me, or for someone who won&#x27;t be using it often.  If you plan to straighten your hair frequently, a heavier model with a larger head would be handy.</li>
    <li> I returned this.  It is great in theory but I could not make it do what it did on the commercial.  I am just not that great with hair tools.  If you have the knack this might be great for you.  It wasn&#x27;t that it seemed like a bad product it was just that I could not make it work for me.  My neighbor had one and she loves it and I watched her do it but just did not have the same luck. (she is a hairdresser) I only had it for one day so I didn&#x27;t continue to try because it was very hot and I didn&#x27;t want to get burned.  I got frustrated and sent it back.  If you have the knack I bet it is great but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my instyler for 5 years and it just died the other day. I have thick and very long (down to my belly button) frizzy hair. This tool is the only way I can flat iron my hair in an reasonable amount of time. I regular straightener would take an hour + where the instyler gets my whole head straight and soft in about 10 minutes. It&#x27;s results are unmatched.</li>
    <li> This is just an ok product.  Its not worth the $100 you have to pay for it.  The video makes it look so easy to use but in reality its rather difficult.  I have had it for a month and use daily before work.  I know, if I have given such a bad review why am I using it so much?  Well I wanted to give it a fair shot, use it lots to see if I adjust to it, learn new tricks etc.  Its not a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; product, just priced too high for no better than it works.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no getting around it - using the InStyler IS cumbersome. If your hair is curly, kinky, or anything other than stick straight (in which case, why would you have this at all?), the InStayler will polish your hair and render it smooth, silky and shiny. The price for this will be sore arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is wavy, and to get the full benefit from the InStyler, I have to section it off an let the barrel run through it. The appliance is not light; you will find your arms starting to ache, and you still have half a head of hair to get through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the thing is that this is one of those devices that actually does what it says it will do. Your hair will be gorgeous - strong, shiny, undamaged. And it keeps the frizzies away, no matter how strong the humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day, the time spent with the InStyler will make it worth your while. It&#x27;s not cheap, it&#x27;s not lightweight, but it works better than any other hair device I&#x27;ve used for keeping the body in your hair while working out the kinks. For the strong of arm, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is ingenious. Having used a Babyliss flatiron for some time, this product takes a little getting used to, but I think it&#x27;s worth it. Just read the instructions and maybe go to their website also if you need to, to be sure you understand what it does and how to use it. And remember, go slow through your hair - let the tool do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a flat iron and curling iron in one, and it actually works!  I can see paying this much for a multiply purpose tool that gets the job done. My Babyliss cost way more and it&#x27;s only a flatiron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no problem with frizzies. I use the tool at a slower speed through my hair, letting the roller do its job, instead of slamming it through over and over as fast as I can just so I can finish fast. It takes less passes. Using styling products helps the look last longer. It&#x27;s supposed to be less damaging than standard flatirons. We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can actually get my hair to REALLY curl under or flip instead of &amp;#34;sorta&amp;#34; like flatirons do. My hair isn&#x27;t long enough to try the loose spiral curls that this product claims to do so I can&#x27;t comment there. I like how the teeth on the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; side comb through my hair to really straighten it with less effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to see the snap on plastic &amp;#34;trainer&amp;#34; sleeve that protects your scalp from the hot, bare roller side. I put it on and am not taking it off! Those wanting those long curls will have to though since you actuall wrap your hair sround the roller. You can&#x27;t do that with a flatiron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They warn you not to use oil-based heat protector products with this tool. Maybe it causes a build up on the roller or effects the mechanism over time. They encourage you to always use a heat protectant though. I use Tressame with no problem so far. They give you instructions on how to clean the roller if you do get a product build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t give it the 5th star because I don&#x27;t know how long this tool will last or how my hair will look down her road. If it dies out on me anytime soon of my hair gets trashed, I&#x27;ll be back to update the review.last or how my hair will look down her road.

    <li> I have fine, very curly hair. I typically just wash my hair, scrunch it with some gel, air dry it 75%, and then blow dry with a diffuser to finish it out and add some volume. I had bangs in the past, and I would straighten them with an average old straightening iron. I&#x27;ve been thinking about trying out bangs again, so when I had the opportunity to try this out, I jumped at the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I just can&#x27;t seem to make this iron work satisfactory for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it&#x27;s loud. I try to get up before my little ones(5,3, and 1) and get dressed for the day as *quietly* as possible. Our house is small, and this thing makes too much noise for me to risk waking them up. (That may not be an issue for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it&#x27;s kind of awkward to use. It seems to work best one way, and I had to keep turning it to get it in the correct position. I prefer one that works either way I hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, this thing takes so long to use! I just don&#x27;t have THAT much time to put into my hair! I spent quite awhile trying to get satisfactory results and never did. Which is my fourth negative. I never got satisfactory results. With my old (cheap-o) straightening iron, it didn&#x27;t take me long to straighten my bangs, and they were completely straightened(as opposed to waves close to my hairline that I never seemed to be able to fully straighten with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that said, after my hair was somewhat straight, I tried out the curling feature, and although still a little awkward, it makes some cute curls. Of course, I&#x27;m not going to spend forever trying to straighten my naturally curly hair just to put curls in it. If you want curls, this might still be worth a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m left handed and could not use it so I have it for when my daughter in laws visit.  They love it.</li>
    <li> Better than any flat iron I have had! Makes my hair so smooth! Love it!</li>
    <li> Works well- make sure you go on youtube and watch some videos on how it works. I have fine hair and I do not use it on wet hair at all. The product claims you can- but I just end up with hot/wet hair. I also wouldn&#x27;t say it saves time- if you are using it properly- you need to still section out your hair and move the iron through your hair slowly. Its is so much better than a flat iron because you can add bounce and curl with this product.</li>
    <li> does not work properly :(</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!! Couldnt believe how well it worked!!!</li>
