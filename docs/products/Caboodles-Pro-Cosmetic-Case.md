      <li>I purchased this case from another retailer and am very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this case on Amazon!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I own lots of make-up</li>
      <li>It is a great size I was able to fit all my makeup, lotion and perfume in it.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
      <li>It fits all of my make up, and I love that I can organize everything.</li>
      <li>Well - unlike most of the people that bought this case, I am not using this for makeup, but for a case to hold all of our Canine Nosework equipment (scents, tins, scent holders.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more usable than I think it could be.  </li>
      <li>Though I wish I would have looked around more.  </li>
      <li>I Love It</li>
      <li>Yes the trays aren&#x27;t the most sturdy</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, the case is nice looking and very functional; the large trays offer good organizing capacity and there is ample roomy-ness in the compartment below.  </li>
      <li>The case looks very good, good price, inside part not so good quality but not that bad, Size is great but in my case the keys dont work.</li>
      <li>I have been looking a long time for something to put all of my make up in and this is perfect.</li>
      <li>This is replacing a caboodle I owned for over 13 years, wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this one as much as my original one</li>
      <li>Other than that this product is the best make up case ever!!</li>
      <li>PROS  - Easy to carry around.</li>
      <li>For those purposes it will do just fine.</li>
      <li>nice large space at the bottom.</li>
      <li>It looks great and seems to be sturdy and roomy for cosmetics or similar products.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly packed</li>
      <li>Only drawback is that although this is the perfect size it does not have a fold out mirror like the one slightly smaller..</li>
      <li>I love it and highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>This case looks great and price is good, but when it arrived it was very flimsy and poorly made</li>
      <li>The hinges and other hardware are good quality</li>
      <li>Oh, and did I mention the price is right too.</li>
      <li>Perfect for storing all kinds of little medical things that could get lost around the house.</li>
      <li>The trays are perfectly sized, and the depth of the case is generous to hold my larger round brushes.</li>
      <li>I much prefer the black over the silver and it was a pleasant surprise, but still I ordered silver</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for 4 years now and it&#x27;s been pretty sturdy.</li>
      <li>No need to spend $100+ for expensive train cases, this case is perfect!</li>
      <li>It locks and is very sturdy!</li>
      <li>In deciding whether to keep it I tried to play up its virtues, but in the end I concluded that my money would be better invested in a different product.</li>
      <li>I use mine as a first aid box for my house.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I bought both and wish to goodness I could combine them into 1 box so it would be a large case w a foldout mirror attached...</li>
      <li>but I like it just as much</li>
      <li>, this one has a modern twist to it.</li>
      <li>It is large and roomy with special places for tall bottles as well as smaller ones.  </li>
      <li>product itself is decent for $30.</li>
      <li>the top of it was missing a piece of plastic</li>
      <li>it actually is just the right size and keeps the scent contained as well.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure this case will last for a very long time!</li>
      <li>This case is perfect for my purposes (holding dental hygiene intruments) and is as described except mine came in the wrong color - black.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large enough for all my stuff with room to move around</li>
      <li>I thought it was going to be smaller, but it is actually an average size and very spacey, my make-up and other things fit just right.</li>
      <li>so far Very Spacious , &amp; made well I guess but not a fan of the way the trays slide to open up....</li>
      <li>Do NOT waste your money buying it for an overpriced $</li>
      <li>Early</li>
      <li>The cardboard trays side finally broke off and its pretty beat up from constant use for about 5 years.</li>
      <li>As a professional makeup artist I thought all train cases are created equal!</li>
      <li>Only because I wanted something a little higher quality than a caboodle this time.</li>
      <li>The trays are not flat, but tilt backward.  </li>

<li> Bigger than expected, but lots of storage space.</li>
<li> It is not large enough.</li>
<li> I recently had to chuck mine out because it broke down after me banging and bashing it around for 4 years.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m replacing a black similar caboodle I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s sturdy enough to withstand everyday use.  </li>
<li> I opened and closed the case once.  </li>
<li> so the inside was visible when closed  </li>
<li> When closed you can not see anything that is inside.</li>
<li> It organizes my mineral make-up the way I wanted and there is room to spare in the bottom compartment for other beauty products.</li>
<li> but the possibilities are endless.  </li>
<li> I would recommend this to any other artists who will take care of it and to any person who&#x27;s not an artist that just has it sitting at home when they need it.</li>
<li> im not sure how long its gonna hold up.</li>
<li> I almost purchased a more expensive case from a make-up retailer but felt guilty about the price.</li>
<li> - Total price paid for this item including shipping and handling($59.11)was too much. &#x3D;(</li>
<li> I just noticed that from the store the little silver \\&quot;ridges\\&quot; were already dinged and damaged on the box exterior here and there.</li>
<li> Specifically, the hinge construction of the trays seems weak and of lower quality and in addition the trays rub against one another every time you open up the case.  </li>
<li> I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter because she has quite a collection of beauty products and a little sister.  </li>
<li> so she can lock her things up  and keep her little sister out of trouble.  </li>
<li> Its ok,just a little small for my needs.</li>
<li> Although less expensive than the other case I doubt it would hold up as well</li>
<li> So if you are looking for a case to keep your things locked, this is not a good option.</li>
<li> Does not fit all my make up &#x3D;(  </li>
<li> Very poorly made.  </li>
<li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
<li> Now if someone gets sick or hurt, everyone knows where to go to get what they need.</li>
<li> - Does not keep everything in one place after being moved. &#x3D;(  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bigger than expected, but lots of storage space.</li>
    <li> An excellent purchase</li>
    <li> This case is perfect for my purposes (holding dental hygiene intruments) and is as described except mine came in the wrong color - black. I much prefer the black over the silver and it was a pleasant surprise, but still I ordered silver so I&#x27;ll take off a star for that.</li>
    <li> I have a mobile salon service and need to pack my items as concisly as possible. This case holds all my combs, brushes, shears, razors, clips, etc. in one convenient place. The trays are perfectly sized, and the depth of the case is generous to hold my larger round brushes. It is sturdy and well constructed. I love it!</li>
    <li> To be fair, the case is nice looking and very functional; the large trays offer good organizing capacity and there is ample roomy-ness in the compartment below.  In the context of its affordability, the one thing that did not satisfy me is the design of the trays and how they connect to the case parts that open every time you use it.  Specifically, the hinge construction of the trays seems weak and of lower quality and in addition the trays rub against one another every time you open up the case.  This suggested that while the case looks sturdy, the trays may not last as long- I&#x27;d prefer that the trays open up manually to prevent the undue wear! In deciding whether to keep it I tried to play up its virtues, but in the end I concluded that my money would be better invested in a different product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great purchase.  I received the article on time. It&#x27;s bigger than expected.  It&#x27;s more usable than I think it could be.  Wonderful purchase.</li>
    <li> Once this make up box came I realized the box was shipped from target! So the next time I went to Target I looked for it and I realized I had payed double the actual price!!!  Other than that this product is the best make up case ever!! So if your looking to buy it just go to Target and buy it!</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be smaller, but it is actually an average size and very spacey, my make-up and other things fit just right.</li>
    <li> I got this case because I have a lot of makeup and kids that don&#x27;t seem to want to leave it alone. It is a great size I was able to fit all my makeup, lotion and perfume in it. It locks and is very sturdy! When closed you can not see anything that is inside. I just wish it had a mirror.</li>
    <li> I have been looking a long time for something to put all of my make up in and this is perfect. Plenty of room and great price. This will be on my Christmas list for my daughter and daughter-in-law.</li>
    <li> fits all my make up (lots of BM pots).  nice large space at the bottom.</li>
    <li> I use mine as a first aid box for my house. Perfect for storing all kinds of little medical things that could get lost around the house. Now if someone gets sick or hurt, everyone knows where to go to get what they need. A must for every household.</li>
    <li> This is a very basic and simple design.  It does what I needed it to do, hold makeup.  Though I wish I would have looked around more.  I think it&#x27;s over priced for the quality.</li>
    <li> As a professional makeup artist I thought all train cases are created equal! Boy was I wrong! This case looks great and price is good, but when it arrived it was very flimsy and poorly made the top of it was missing a piece of plastic so the inside was visible when closed  Don&#x27;t get this case....</li>
    <li> PROS  - Easy to carry around. &#x3D;)  CONS  - It is not large enough. Does not fit all my make up &#x3D;(  - The corners get stuck when i try to open it. &#x3D;(  - Does not keep everything in one place after being moved. &#x3D;(  - Total price paid for this item including shipping and handling($59.11)was too much. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> This product is NOt the best quality. im not sure how long its gonna hold up. I looks great but once you get it , it&#x27;s some what cheep.</li>
    <li> I bought this and returned it. Only because I wanted something a little higher quality than a caboodle this time. I&#x27;m replacing a black similar caboodle I&#x27;ve had for years. The cardboard trays side finally broke off and its pretty beat up from constant use for about 5 years. I just noticed that from the store the little silver \\&quot;ridges\\&quot; were already dinged and damaged on the box exterior here and there. I know that will start to bother me. lol. I also would worry about banging it on anything should I carry it around.</li>
    <li> This cosmetic case is as advretised.  It looks great and seems to be sturdy and roomy for cosmetics or similar products.</li>
    <li> This train case is awesome!!!  I can keep liners and mascara in one tray, lipsticks in another, eyeshadows in another and lipglosses in yet another tray leaving the bottom open for foundations, mineral powders, blushes, bronzers,  brushes, wedges etc. and I still have room left. I own lots of make-up so that&#x27;s the only thing I use it for but the possibilities are endless.  The inside is lined in cloth including the trays, it also comes with a shoulder strap and keys.  This is replacing a caboodle I owned for over 13 years, wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this one as much as my original one but I like it just as much, this one has a modern twist to it. Oh, and did I mention the price is right too.</li>
    <li> I have several makeup palettes and needed a case with a lot of storage.  This one works perfectly and looks fabulous.  The hinges and other hardware are good quality and I&#x27;m sure this case will last for a very long time!</li>
    <li> It Came A Day Early I Love It so far Very Spacious , &amp; made well I guess but not a fan of the way the trays slide to open up....its a good purchase for make up &amp; nail products not hair though hope this helps.</li>
    <li> The case looks very good, good price, inside part not so good quality but not that bad, Size is great but in my case the keys dont work. So if you are looking for a case to keep your things locked, this is not a good option.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly packed well no damage double boxed. The description matched the product. Would give it a 5 star but my wife has yet to see or use it yet...</li>
    <li> Love this.  I have all of my makeup in it.  I&#x27;ve had it for 2 or more years now, and it&#x27;s still in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> Its ok,just a little small for my needs. Also,i didnt order this and when i tried to return it Target couldnt take it since the invoice showed that it was paid for by another person.</li>
    <li> I purchased this case from another retailer and am very pleased with it. It organizes my mineral make-up the way I wanted and there is room to spare in the bottom compartment for other beauty products. I almost purchased a more expensive case from a make-up retailer but felt guilty about the price. Although less expensive than the other case I doubt it would hold up as well but I plan to keep mine in my bathroom and not use it for travel. For those purposes it will do just fine. Yes the trays aren&#x27;t the most sturdy but I&#x27;m no professional, just needing a storage solution.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter because she has quite a collection of beauty products and a little sister.  This case comes with a key so she can lock her things up  and keep her little sister out of trouble.  It is large and roomy with special places for tall bottles as well as smaller ones.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> I had been looking into buying a make-up case for personal use and I wanted something big enough to hold make-up, skincare and hair products.  I was going to buy a Yazmo case but I couldn&#x27;t get over the price and then I remembered Caboodles. I&#x27;m so glad I found this case on Amazon!  It&#x27;s large enough for all my stuff with room to move around and it&#x27;s sturdy enough to withstand everyday use.  I love it and highly recommend it.  No need to spend $100+ for expensive train cases, this case is perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 4 years now and it&#x27;s been pretty sturdy. I recently had to chuck mine out because it broke down after me banging and bashing it around for 4 years. I&#x27;m a makeup artist so I carry this everywhere with my ZUCA however because of wear and tear it finally gave up. I would recommend this to any other artists who will take care of it and to any person who&#x27;s not an artist that just has it sitting at home when they need it. Loved it but now we parted ways.</li>
    <li> Well - unlike most of the people that bought this case, I am not using this for makeup, but for a case to hold all of our Canine Nosework equipment (scents, tins, scent holders.  It works perfectly.  it actually is just the right size and keeps the scent contained as well.  So when looking at this case - consider what else you could use it for!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. It fits all of my make up, and I love that I can organize everything.</li>
    <li> I opened and closed the case once.  The second time I tried, one side did not even open at all.  It was stuck! The trays are not flat, but tilt backward.  Very poorly made.  I am returning!</li>
    <li> I bought this same silver Caboodles makeup train case from Target for $30. Do NOT waste your money buying it for an overpriced $60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is decent for $30. It is kinda flimsy, but it did what I wanted it for: organize and hold my makeup.</li>
    <li> Only drawback is that although this is the perfect size it does not have a fold out mirror like the one slightly smaller.. I bought both and wish to goodness I could combine them into 1 box so it would be a large case w a foldout mirror attached...</li>
