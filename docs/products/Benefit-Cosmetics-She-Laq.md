      <li>I would like to find out how to purchase more of this amazing product!</li>
      <li>The dealer, \\&quot;Newkurier,\\&quot; replied to my inquiries quickly and was VERY fair with a problem that arose in the delivery.</li>
      <li>If you are a beach goer like me who wants to be sexy at all times... then buy this! &lt;3</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
      <li>Macys no longer sold She lac, I searched and was so thrilled to find it here.</li>
      <li>It is by far the best brow sealer ever!</li>
      <li>OK someone make some new perfect</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this product!  </li>
      <li>I have very light eyebrows and have to use eyebrow pencil.  </li>
      <li>THis is a VERY good product so far.  </li>
      <li>well, my sis came up with a great idea , she said put the bottle in a little empty jar , perfect , my sis is smart!   , by the way I HAVE the oiliest eyelids and T zone in the world!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I love this product.   </li>
      <li>the product works, I just need more experience putting it on.      </li>
      <li>I would rather use more than I need than to get smudges.  </li>
      <li>It is the best product on the market in respect to keeping eye make up on the eyes, especially eyebrows and eyeliner.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I want to look sexy on my beach outings</li>
      <li>This stuff is magical...</li>
      <li>I have used she laq since it first came out and was very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>the other thing that would make it perfect is if it was in a spill proof bottle, as any product I have had in a bottle like this is so easy to knock over and spill, which I have done</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t overdo it and you will be fine.</li>
      <li>I smile a lot throughout the day which was causing the problem!</li>
      <li>also I might super glue the bottle bottom to a lid or something.     </li>
      <li>the first time I got no smudging at all for at least 8-10 hrs   which is excellent!!!!!!!!!    </li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, it&#x27;s a fantastic product, if you can get the real one.</li>
      <li>Make sure not to dip the spoolie directly into the liquid after you have coated one eye.  </li>
      <li>Only product of its kind I have ever found.  </li>
      <li>So many mascara formulas that I like are not water proof or if the formula is water proof, it is not the same as the original.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Expensive yes, worth the investment, most definitely.</li>
      <li>Also, the first time, I used the brush</li>
      <li>I think what would be ideal for this is a wand applicator that has tiny short firm bristles or nubs instead of a full mascara brush , that way you could roll it on without combing out your mascara or wasting product.    </li>
      <li>At last I can enjoy a meal without eating my makeup.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup much anymore</li>
      <li>your ready to go...</li>
      <li>However, since I really needed itor I guess wanted it I went on and purchased  bottles.  </li>
      <li>Benefit has discontinued this product so I tried to get it from somewhere that I knew was risky, but I was willing to try it because I really don&#x27;t wanna live without She Laq.</li>
      <li>When I am done, I use a daily brush cleaner to clean the spoolie.  </li>
      <li>Seals my eyebrows, which is the only thing I pretty much seal.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live w/out this product.  </li>
      <li>Very sad that this incredible product has been discontinued by mfg.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and have had the chance to compare it to other similar products.</li>
      <li>Complete fraud.</li>
      <li>What Makeup Pro is selling, has a serum consistency that completely rubs into your skin.</li>
      <li>So far, NOTHING else works.</li>
      <li>so I can brace my shaky hand, two use more product.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many products to wear on my eyes to keep my eyeliners and shadows on my eyelids due to extreme oiliness and the colors rolling off and going into my creases.</li>
      <li>I can go swimming and as long as I remember I have eyebrows on, they stay on until you&#x27;re ready to take off your makeup.  </li>
      <li>So the second time I just kinda dabbed ; patted it on , this stuff is clear</li>
      <li>Does what it says and it&#x27;s the only thing that completely prevents my mascara from smudging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Seriously, it seems as if they filled the bottle with Water.....</li>

<li> Seriously, it seems as if they filled the bottle with Water.....</li>
<li> If you put too much on, your eyebrows or eyelids will feel stiff.  </li>
<li> Put it on a little darker  than you normally would as it lightens a bit after you put the product on.    </li>
<li> so it is hard to see how much and where you put it.    </li>
<li> was a little different which led me to believe that someone altered and or tampered with th product or tried to reproduce the actual product.  </li>
<li> and you can also feel it dry up, so don&#x27;t touch it</li>
<li> what i will do next time using is ONE set down</li>
<li> the second time I got just a little smudging under the outer corners of bottom lashes, that being said, I do have to admit I had a harder time putting it on the second time and less time to do so, I was feeling rushed and shakey, so that could have had a lot to do with it.    </li>
<li> or if you use it on your eyes, keep it closed until it&#x27;s completely dry!  </li>
<li> like I was putting on a second coat of mascara and noticed it thinned my mascaraed lashes just a little.   </li>
<li> This little bottle lasts a long time.</li>
<li> They put some other liquid in the bottles.  </li>
<li> You will want to count on this for those big emotional moments in life, as well as a daily fix for no more embarrassing raccoon eyes!!!!   </li>
<li> Due to alopecia universalis, I draw on my eyebrows.</li>
<li> small problem...the brush inside of the bottle is crooked, and the little brush for the eyebrows fell apart.</li>
<li> Anyway, the real She Laq when applied on your hand, dries to a shiny finish and feels a little bit like a very thin layer of superglue.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s better than eyebrow tattoos (less painful and doesn&#x27;t require a commitment!).</li>
<li> A little pricey but bottle has lasted over a year and works for lashes and brows like nothing I&#x27;ve ever ttried.</li>
<li> /&gt;Here&#x27;s hoping another will cosmetic firm will pick up the ball and make a product comparable to She Laq.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of so-called waterproof, smudgeproof eyeliners, but they all smudged within a few hours.</li>
<li> Both times I did what one reviewer suggested and used the brush in the bottle to put the She Lac on the mascara wand that came in the box, then washed and dried the mascara type wand.     </li>
<li> Not sure what I am going to replace it</li>
<li> I was initially disappointed by the very high price advertised on Amazon.  </li>
<li> This product is somewhat expensive but it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> I live in honolulu and I am ALWAYS at the beach without makeup :(   </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the upper eyelid liner, but it smudges badly on my lower lid.</li>
<li> She Laq, it is very hard to find in store&#x27;s</li>
<li> If it shines, just powder it down, no problem!!!!  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t over do it, all you need is a thin layer, you can feel it go on</li>
<li> gave this just one star because I want to somehow alert people that the seller Makeup Pro sells fake</li>
<li> Before I started using She Laq, I would notice that sooner or later my eye make up would end up looking horrible, giving me the dreaded Raccoon eyes.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, Benefit decided not to carry it their line of cosmetics anymore.  </li>
<li> I have always had a difficult time keeping my eye makeup and lower lid eyeliner where it belongs..</li>
<li> The fake one from Makeup Pro, well, is fake.</li>
<li> I go to the beach all summer and was always frustrated  </li>
<li> I was greatly disappointed that Sephora quit selling this</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very light eyebrows and have to use eyebrow pencil.  I go to the beach all summer and was always frustrated  coming out of the water with all the eyebrow pencil gone.  Using She Laq has helped.    I have learned that you need to use pencil rather than an eyebrow cake (brush on powder).  Put it on a little darker  than you normally would as it lightens a bit after you put the product on.    The dealer, \\&quot;Newkurier,\\&quot; replied to my inquiries quickly and was VERY fair with a problem that arose in the delivery.</li>
    <li> I wish Benefit would bring this back. Now Amazon does not carry anymore.</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable product!  At last I can enjoy a meal without eating my makeup. I no longer have to re-apply makeup during the day. I use She Laq once in the am and it last until I wash it off.  I am completely happy with this product and I have already ordered my next bottle.</li>
    <li> I like She Laq, it is very hard to find in store&#x27;s, I use it just about every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the upper eyelid liner, but it smudges badly on my lower lid. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of so-called waterproof, smudgeproof eyeliners, but they all smudged within a few hours. A Sephora SA suggested She Laq and it did the trick! My eyeliner lasts all day and holds up in swimmimg pools and on beaches.</li>
    <li> THis is a VERY good product so far.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup much anymore so I have only it used twice.    the first time I got no smudging at all for at least 8-10 hrs   which is excellent!!!!!!!!!    the second time I got just a little smudging under the outer corners of bottom lashes, that being said, I do have to admit I had a harder time putting it on the second time and less time to do so, I was feeling rushed and shakey, so that could have had a lot to do with it.    Both times I did what one reviewer suggested and used the brush in the bottle to put the She Lac on the mascara wand that came in the box, then washed and dried the mascara type wand.     Also, the first time, I used the brush like I was putting on a second coat of mascara and noticed it thinned my mascaraed lashes just a little.   So the second time I just kinda dabbed ; patted it on , this stuff is clear so it is hard to see how much and where you put it.    the product works, I just need more experience putting it on.      I think what would be ideal for this is a wand applicator that has tiny short firm bristles or nubs instead of a full mascara brush , that way you could roll it on without combing out your mascara or wasting product.    the other thing that would make it perfect is if it was in a spill proof bottle, as any product I have had in a bottle like this is so easy to knock over and spill, which I have done and it&#x27;s always exspensive.    a squeeze tube with an applicator like I discribed would be wonderful . OK someone make some new perfect she lac!!    what i will do next time using is ONE set down so I can brace my shaky hand, two use more product.  I would rather use more than I need than to get smudges.  also I might super glue the bottle bottom to a lid or something.     well, my sis came up with a great idea , she said put the bottle in a little empty jar , perfect , my sis is smart!   , by the way I HAVE the oiliest eyelids and T zone in the world!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many products to wear on my eyes to keep my eyeliners and shadows on my eyelids due to extreme oiliness and the colors rolling off and going into my creases. This is the ONLY product that give me almost an all day wear with no creasing what so ever. I was greatly disappointed that Sephora quit selling this and I&#x27;m so grateful that I can purchase this on line. So far, NOTHING else works. I love this product.   Thank you,  Marti Howell  602 758 9494</li>
    <li> Macys no longer sold She lac, I searched and was so thrilled to find it here. I love it. She Lac keeps eyebrow pencil on all day..and it&#x27;s not visible....  small problem...the brush inside of the bottle is crooked, and the little brush for the eyebrows fell apart.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but bottle has lasted over a year and works for lashes and brows like nothing I&#x27;ve ever ttried. Lasts 12 plus hours without retouch.</li>
    <li> I have been using She Laq for a while now and it&#x27;s an amazing product. Does what it says and it&#x27;s the only thing that completely prevents my mascara from smudging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this just one star because I want to somehow alert people that the seller Makeup Pro sells fake She Laq. Benefit has discontinued this product so I tried to get it from somewhere that I knew was risky, but I was willing to try it because I really don&#x27;t wanna live without She Laq. Anyway, the real She Laq when applied on your hand, dries to a shiny finish and feels a little bit like a very thin layer of superglue. What Makeup Pro is selling, has a serum consistency that completely rubs into your skin. No trace of it even when you try to leave it alone to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, it&#x27;s a fantastic product, if you can get the real one. The fake one from Makeup Pro, well, is fake. So it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I have always had a difficult time keeping my eye makeup and lower lid eyeliner where it belongs..I use these beauty products daily. Before I started using She Laq, I would notice that sooner or later my eye make up would end up looking horrible, giving me the dreaded Raccoon eyes.I smile a lot throughout the day which was causing the problem! This was a total embarrasment for me. She-Laq puts some sort of invisible protective shield over the makeup products, sealing them in place.This product is somewhat expensive but it lasts a long time. Nothing I have tried before, worked like I had hoped it would. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and I can promise you this product works especially well!!! You will want to count on this for those big emotional moments in life, as well as a daily fix for no more embarrassing raccoon eyes!!!!   I can smile with confidence!!!!!</li>
    <li> Due to alopecia universalis, I draw on my eyebrows. Without this wonderful product, which stands up well even to rigorous workouts, my brows would \\&quot;melt\\&quot; off in no time. I use this every day. It&#x27;s better than eyebrow tattoos (less painful and doesn&#x27;t require a commitment!). I also put a bit of SheLaq on my eyeliner to prevent \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot;. Works great! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product!  I can&#x27;t live w/out this product.  Seals my eyebrows, which is the only thing I pretty much seal.  I can go swimming and as long as I remember I have eyebrows on, they stay on until you&#x27;re ready to take off your makeup.  If it shines, just powder it down, no problem!!!!  Don&#x27;t over do it, all you need is a thin layer, you can feel it go on and you can also feel it dry up, so don&#x27;t touch it or if you use it on your eyes, keep it closed until it&#x27;s completely dry!  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I live in honolulu and I am ALWAYS at the beach without makeup :(   Well I just lost 23 pounds and I want to look sexy on my beach outings so I purchased this at Macy&#x27;s and let me tell you THIS STUFF WORKS!  I put it over my eyebrow, makeup, eyeshadow, and eyeliner!  It stays on!  I know that some people says that it turns yellow after awhile and smells... wash your brushes... it says so in the instructions.  If you are a beach goer like me who wants to be sexy at all times... then buy this! &lt;3</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and when I ran out of my last bottle, I looked everywhere for it.  Enter Amazon, what don&#x27;t they have?  I use this over my mascara to make it water proof.  So many mascara formulas that I like are not water proof or if the formula is water proof, it is not the same as the original.  She-Laq takes care of this problem.  Make sure not to dip the spoolie directly into the liquid after you have coated one eye.  I use the bottle brush to refill the spoolie for the 2nd eye.  When I am done, I use a daily brush cleaner to clean the spoolie.  I have also use this to seal my eye liner and eye brows, same technique, I just the different brushes included.  If you put too much on, your eyebrows or eyelids will feel stiff.  Don&#x27;t overdo it and you will be fine. This little bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magical...you put on your eyebrow pencil, swipe on some She Laq and bam...your ready to go...Its even waterproof!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and this is definitely NOT She Laq.  They put some other liquid in the bottles.  Complete fraud.</li>
    <li> Very sad that this incredible product has been discontinued by mfg.  Only product of its kind I have ever found.  Nothing else comes close.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and have had the chance to compare it to other similar products. Not a chance of anything coming close to it. It is the best product on the market in respect to keeping eye make up on the eyes, especially eyebrows and eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive yes, worth the investment, most definitely.</li>
    <li> This product is now obsolete. I wish they would have never done away with it. It is by far the best brow sealer ever!</li>
    <li> I have used she laq since it first came out and was very pleased with it.  Unfortunately, Benefit decided not to carry it their line of cosmetics anymore.  I was initially disappointed by the very high price advertised on Amazon.  However, since I really needed itor I guess wanted it I went on and purchased  bottles.  It didnot set my make-up as before.  I compared my last bottle that I kept to the one from Amazon and the outer packaging was a little different which led me to believe that someone altered and or tampered with th product or tried to reproduce the actual product.  I wish that I could have sent both bottles back.  I feel as if I have been deceived in some way.</li>
    <li> It is a shame Benefit no longer makes She Laq.  They are the only company that made anything like this.  Not sure what I am going to replace it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s hoping another will cosmetic firm will pick up the ball and make a product comparable to She Laq.</li>
    <li> Seriously, it seems as if they filled the bottle with Water..... never again. NEVER again. I wish Benefit still made this product.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT- MAKE UP SEALER- WORKS GREAT ON EYE BROWS- NO SMEARS OR SMUDGES -I AM USING SPARINGLY -NONE LEFT IN STOCK!!!!!</li>
    <li> I would like to find out how to purchase more of this amazing product!</li>
