      <li>Had a lot of fun with these!</li>
      <li>Most people didn&#x27;t realize they were not jewelry until they really looked at it.</li>

      <li>Product arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
      <li>Beautiful and lasted a few days.</li>
      <li>this is such a better deal!</li>

      <li>I have only tried one of the tattoos and it went on fast and stayed on fairly well.</li>
      <li>Delivered right on time</li>
      <li>The gold in the gold ones will turn more gold/silver after you bathe but they are still on and other than that look fine.  </li>
      <li>Cute designs,but they started looking gummy and gross after a day at Coachella.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>And this is amidst camping and partying and hot tubbing.</li>
      <li>Love them easy to put on with a little amount of water !</li>
      <li>They go on easy and are fairly easy to remove with a little scrubbing.</li>

      <li>For the price you can&#x27;t really expect much.</li>

      <li>Highly reccommend.</li>

<li> As far as I could tell, the least expensive of these metallic tattoos.</li>
<li> so much less then buying in stores!!</li>
<li> But they are really hard to get off</li>

    <li> Loved these! Exactly like the Flash tats I bought from Sephora except at a way better price.</li>
    <li> ️Love flash tats so much less then buying in stores!! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Birthday gift for fashion conscious granddaughter of 11</li>
    <li> Purchased these flashing tattoos for Vegas and they came just in time! I absolutely love them! Great price, and tattoos actually lasts longer than 5days!! True to the picture, and comes with everything you see!!</li>
    <li> alot for your money and they are so cute and work great, mine dont even crack when they get streched . love</li>
    <li> Very pretty, but they do rub off faster than some of the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past. Regardless, they&#x27;re a steal for the price</li>
    <li> The gold lose its color after getting wet. The silver looks great though. But they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Everything as expected!</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
    <li> Lasts one day then ends up on your sheets</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM!!!!! Easy to put on and looks great! Can&#x27;t wait to wear them on vacation!</li>
    <li> Purchased the product for dayclub and it came just in time! I thought it would be cheapy, but the tattoos actually lasted about a 3-5 days! A must buy item!! :)</li>
    <li> Cute designs,but they started looking gummy and gross after a day at Coachella. I guess you should re-apply every day?</li>
    <li> Fun and easy to use, did not rub off too easily !</li>
    <li> The quantity was good for the price. My only problem is that they only last long if you put them in a low traffic area. I had two on the inside of my ankles and they lasted almost 2 weeks but the ones on my hands only lasted a day. Sunscreen or any kind of oil is their arch enemy. Otherwise good product for the price.</li>
    <li> As far as I could tell, the least expensive of these metallic tattoos. Arrived as pictured, stayed on up to a week, looked great.</li>
    <li> Love them easy to put on with a little amount of water ! Great purchase :) Grandma even rocked them!!</li>
    <li> These are super cute! and the company takes care of their customers!</li>
    <li> Very happy.  Perfect for my party.</li>
    <li> fast shipping to Canada. I have only tried one of the tattoos and it went on fast and stayed on fairly well.</li>
    <li> Look really awesome. But they are really hard to get off but I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> I loved them, they shipped fast and we&#x27;re all pretty cute</li>
    <li> Worked out well! Beautiful and lasted a few days.</li>
    <li> These temporary tattoos were very nice, they actually stayed on, i excepted them to fall of or not even stick on but they actually did. They stick on really fast, which is good. If you don&#x27;t scrub them off they wont come off.</li>
    <li> They are really pretty and good quality.</li>
    <li> These are cute for a 1 day event. They start to wear by the second day. They are fun and a good intro to the gold and silver temproary tattoos. I like the LuLu DK tattoos better but they are much pricier and I only wear those on special occasions and when I want it to lasts 4-5 days like on vacation or at a conference. They look like jewelry. Most people didn&#x27;t realize they were not jewelry until they really looked at it. I got so many compliments. I will definitely keep purchasing them. They go on easy and are fairly easy to remove with a little scrubbing. I wear them on my wrists like bracelets. You get so many in this pack it almost doesn&#x27;t matter that they come off in a couple days. They will start wearing/disappearing where they get rubbed, like on the bottom of my wrist or the outside wrist. The top stayed for 3 days. The gold in the gold ones will turn more gold/silver after you bathe but they are still on and other than that look fine.  For the price you can&#x27;t really expect much. I am happy with my purchase and would buy again.</li>
    <li> After a day or 2 it starts to fade ... but that&#x27;s ok!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter love it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use on vacation.  There were enough sheets to give out to all the &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34; on the trip.  They were easy to apply and lasted several days.  When it came time to remove them, they came off easily.  I wouldn&#x27;t use these all the time, but they&#x27;re great for festivals, vacations and concerts.</li>
    <li> Love these! There are a ton in the package so you get a lot for your money and they stay on for a few days. I had to scrub mine off actually. Definitely recommend for parties, festivals, the beach, etc.</li>
    <li> More value more saving, I love all these designs. We are going to share to all my family and party together. I give them 5 star.</li>
    <li> I loved the fact I received more than one sheet.  I loved the versatility of the designs, and they wear well.</li>
    <li> Worked great! I was worried about the quality, but no need. They went on so easily. Did it for myself and a bevy of beautiful friends. Once they went on they stayed on for a few days. And this is amidst camping and partying and hot tubbing. So easy to and so much faster than airbrushing or facepainting! Would def get again!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these!</li>
    <li> These tattoos are awesome!!! I went to EDC with these and even after all the sweat they lasted an entire 9 hours of heat!!! Definitely recommend, and I will be using them again.</li>
    <li> Pretty darn impressed. For temporary tats these went on easy and stayed unless you had sunscreen or lots of water activity.</li>
    <li> Had a lot of fun with these! They look great. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These are awesome!!! I looked to buy some at a boutique but it was like $30 for 4 sheets this is such a better deal! They are fun and bc they were so cheap I don&#x27;t mind that they only last like 3-4 days on hands/wrists area.  But if you put it in an area that does bend a lot and doesn&#x27;t get washed a lot (back of upper arm was super!) It last about a week. Would def buy more.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Delivered right on time</li>
    <li> I live in a very hot and sunny place, and these are great for going out. I do exercise quite frequently and these will come off a bit with lots of sweat, oil, and showering (haha. Of course.) but they do last fairly well and look awesome. It&#x27;s a great alternative to heavy body jewelry at festivals and going out. These are really good quality, and there are so many of them! Highly reccommend.</li>
