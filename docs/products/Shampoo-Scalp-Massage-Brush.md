      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The quality is fine and the seller was fine but the &amp;#34;assorted colors&amp;#34; of purple, gold, green, and blue meant all 4 were purple in my case.</li>
      <li>Many years ago I had a firm rubber massager like this</li>
      <li>Probably my least favorite color.</li>

    <li> These are good when I use them GENTLY. They are made of plastic and even though the teeth are flexible they can still hurt my scalp if used with too much pressure. After a good shampoo but before rinsing out, a 30 second scalp massage with this will make your scalp feel really good - and healthier. Many years ago I had a firm rubber massager like this but it looks like they aren&#x27;t made anymore. This is the next best thing. Also, with short hair, I can use this as a hairbrush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4-pack is much more economical than just buying a single one. I keep one in the shower, one on the shelf to use as a hairbrush, one in a travel kit, and one as a spare.</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful. I use them for so many things from a scalp massage to brushing my old, super sensitive old cat.

    <li> It helps my hair to have more nature oil from my skull. My hair is more healthy now. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does a great job of getting your scalp clean.</li>
