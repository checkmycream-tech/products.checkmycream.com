      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I am fair-skinned, but like the Tan color because it gives me a healthy glow.  </li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27; does so many things in one.</li>
      <li>I do think that the sample was more moisturizing though.</li>
      <li>Smooth and silky!  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love the feel of Miracle Skin Transformer on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Also love the concealer, too.</li>
      <li>Fast, easy and covers beautifully.</li>
      <li>Can not go a single day without it!!&lt;br /&gt;A must to provide light coverage and a wonderful silky feel to your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy.</li>
      <li>It is silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>AND IT GIVES YOU A SMOOTH LOOK WITHOUT CAKING  AND LOOKING MADE</li>
      <li>It is light and creamy, yet matte finish.  </li>
      <li>great product - would definitely purchase again!</li>
      <li>Great for middle aging skin.</li>
      <li>This feels nice on my face but it doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my skin silky smooth, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, even after all day wear.</li>
      <li>Too light.</li>
      <li>The coverage is light</li>
      <li>It was too light.  </li>
      <li>I am fairly light skinned and bought it in a Medium at another store.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like a heavy foundation, so this is a perfect alternative.</li>
      <li>But the problem was more that the medium wasn&#x27;t the right color for me.  </li>
      <li>It is super.  </li>
      <li>Quick way to get a tan quick.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, its like satin on my skin snd evens it out while still looking totally natural.</li>
      <li>Will use this in addition to my bare minerals, but will not order more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really good coverage but light; does not look like thick &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34;..</li>
      <li>Based on another review, I bought the tan tone and mixed the two together and now really love the way it makes my facial skin look very smooth, yet feels weightless.  </li>
      <li>I use this alone, or for more coverage and stronger SPF protection, blend this with a heavier BB cream such as Jane Iredale, or Elta MD tinted sunblock.  </li>
      <li>I really like the way this makes my skin feel!</li>
      <li>I first tried this as a sample that was included in another product I bought.  </li>
      <li>Heard about this product and saw it elsewhere at significantly higher prices.  </li>
      <li>The bottle busted open at the top when I tried to squirt it out, and foundation went everywhere.</li>
      <li>and it is the only product I have found that provides the right amount of moisture without causing my skin to breakout or becoming shiny at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>Because it gives only light coverage used alone, I generally use a powder foundation to touch up areas that need a bit more coverage.  </li>
      <li>On the positive side it does provide some coverage if you don&#x27;t use a foundation.</li>
      <li>The texture is amazing once it&#x27;s applied to the face, since it becomes extremely soft and &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;, leaving the skin very very soft, with a nice and subtle glow.</li>
      <li>Maybe I would like this product better if I had really dry skin?</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover flaws very well.  </li>
      <li>If you just want a natural look without heavy coverage this will be your favorite!</li>
      <li>I have use this product in the past and liked it but just received this product and the expiration date was January 2015.  </li>
      <li>I would really like them to just send me a new one.</li>
      <li>It only takes a little bit to get that kind of air-brushed effect.  </li>
      <li>I did a little checking and discovered my old favorite is not the same.  </li>
      <li>My skin is combination with oil in the T-zone and I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Not heavy or oily.</li>
      <li>It was no where near a tan shade.</li>
      <li>This is definitely a wonderful tinted moisturizer (skin transformer is a bit of a stretch and a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; would mean it can turn back at least 10 yrs, which it doesn&#x27;t)</li>
      <li>I bought it at full retail (not something I typically do).  </li>
      <li>Coverage not greater and too light.</li>
      <li>This is the only product I found that doesn&#x27;t cake up in my wrinkles - actually softens them - highly recommend</li>
      <li>It just evens out the skin and it is not dry.  </li>
      <li>I first tried the medium tone and thought the coverage made me look a little pasty .</li>
      <li>Made me look super pale, and made my skin look crepey!!</li>

<li> Other foundations look like masks; this product is natural looking.  </li>
<li> Sadly, it went in the trash with so many other beauty supplies you can&#x27;t try before buying.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for a long time.</li>
<li> Complete waste of money if you have any flaws you need covered.</li>
<li> It has a strange feel, like a layer or coating of grease on my face.</li>
<li> The tube goes a long way!  </li>
<li> IT MIGHT WORK FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS REAL DRY SKIN</li>
<li> Be careful with the skin tones, however.  </li>
<li> and this just isn&#x27;t thick enough or heavy enough to cover those problem areas.  </li>
<li> and it has almost no smell to it, or at least not a intrusive, lasting smell.</li>
<li> I am buying the Dark (also from Amazon</li>
<li> I ordered tan because all reviews said lighter than expected, they weren&#x27;t kidding!!</li>
<li> but I prefer it this way because I don&#x27;t want the chalky look of a heavy makeup.</li>
<li> Evens out splotches and uneven texture.  </li>
<li> The medium and medium tan made me look pale.</li>
<li> I am not completely sure this product solidifies on my face.</li>
<li> I really like the coverage of this makeup base.  </li>
<li> I received a small sample of the lighter color and that made me want to order this!</li>
<li> And I definitely like that it&#x27;s a moisturizer, makeup base, and sun screen--all in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> All I could think about was how weird my skin felt.</li>
<li> AWFUL!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Don&#x27;t agree with comments that encouraged me to pay good money for this. I prefer Loreal $13</li>
    <li> I really like the way this makes my skin feel! Smooth and silky!  I received a small sample of the lighter color and that made me want to order this! I do think that the sample was more moisturizing though. If you are looking for anything with a lot of coverage this is not it. If you just want a natural look without heavy coverage this will be your favorite! You can also use it like a primer and put mineral makeup over it if you so desire.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It smoothes, covers and protects.</li>
    <li> I tried medium. Too light. Tan perfect. I have oily complexion. I have no blotting all day and no cakiness. Pores look smaller and face moisturized. Love it</li>
    <li> great product - would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice if you have perfect skin already.  It doesn&#x27;t cover flaws very well.  Will use this in addition to my bare minerals, but will not order more.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a wonderful tinted moisturizer (skin transformer is a bit of a stretch and a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; would mean it can turn back at least 10 yrs, which it doesn&#x27;t) and it has almost no smell to it, or at least not a intrusive, lasting smell. The texture is amazing once it&#x27;s applied to the face, since it becomes extremely soft and &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;, leaving the skin very very soft, with a nice and subtle glow. The colors are a bit lighter than depicted and I had to buy too different shades to find the one that fits. But now I use the lighter shade as an under eye concealer.</li>
    <li> Not heavy or oily. I have a tan and this shade blends perfectly with my skin tone.  No need for a moisturizer.  Just put it on your face and blend it in. Easy.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for some&lt;br /&gt;time.  It is super.  It is non-drying, minimizes pore size &amp;&lt;br /&gt;does not sink into lines &amp; wrinkles.  I use it as foundation &amp;&lt;br /&gt;sun protection.  Other foundations look like masks; this product is natural looking.  Luv it!</li>
    <li> I really like the coverage of this makeup base.  I first tried the medium tone and thought the coverage made me look a little pasty . But the problem was more that the medium wasn&#x27;t the right color for me.  Based on another review, I bought the tan tone and mixed the two together and now really love the way it makes my facial skin look very smooth, yet feels weightless.  It only takes a little bit to get that kind of air-brushed effect.  And I definitely like that it&#x27;s a moisturizer, makeup base, and sun screen--all in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy this product again (but will buy both the medium and tan colors to mix).</li>
    <li> This feels nice on my face but it doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage.  I have acne, acne scars and sun damage and this just isn&#x27;t thick enough or heavy enough to cover those problem areas.  It does help minimize appearance of pores.  It does have a great silky feel on the face.</li>
    <li> This does NOT conceal blemishes even if you cake on several coats. Complete waste of money if you have any flaws you need covered.</li>
    <li> Feels great when applied.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of Miracle Skin Transformer on my skin.  It is light and creamy, yet matte finish.  The fact that it also protects my skin from the Maui sun is a big bonus!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, its like satin on my skin snd evens it out while still looking totally natural. I use it as my makeup. Great for middle aging skin.Nothing else comes close.</li>
    <li> I haved been using this for years and loving it.  But with this order I noticed something was up.  I did a little checking and discovered my old favorite is not the same.  I never get blemishes but this caused breakouts.  I will never use it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and believe me, it does improve the texture of your skin. I have oily/combination skin and it is the only product I have found that provides the right amount of moisture without causing my skin to breakout or becoming shiny at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Heard about this product and saw it elsewhere at significantly higher prices.  Be careful with the skin tones, however.  I am fairly light skinned and bought it in a Medium at another store.  It was too light.  The Tan is good.  I am buying the Dark (also from Amazon so I now have 3 tubes) to mix with my Medium so that I&#x27;m not wasting the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really good coverage but light; does not look like thick &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34;..</li>
    <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s my staple beauty product. I love that it&#x27; does so many things in one. I don&#x27;t like a heavy foundation, so this is a perfect alternative. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the description said 1.7 ounces and it&#x27;s actually only 1.5 ounces.</li>
    <li> I first tried this as a sample that was included in another product I bought.  This product goes on with such ease leaves the skin silky feeling.  Stays on all day, does not rub off.</li>
    <li> Love it. Skin looks great, smooth and rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> Can not go a single day without it!!&lt;br /&gt;A must to provide light coverage and a wonderful silky feel to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s no joke, it&#x27;s a miracle skin transformer...like a retexturizing product for an amazing price.  The tube goes a long way!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time. It is silky smooth.  The coverage is light but I prefer it this way because I don&#x27;t want the chalky look of a heavy makeup. It just evens out the skin and it is not dry.  I wish it had a better SPF sun protection than just 20.</li>
    <li> My skin is combination with oil in the T-zone and I have sensitive skin. I use different products depending on the season. I used this product during the winter months. I am not completely sure this product solidifies on my face. It has a strange feel, like a layer or coating of grease on my face. Also, there was no way I could use a foundation with this product. All I could think about was how weird my skin felt. On the positive side it does provide some coverage if you don&#x27;t use a foundation. Maybe I would like this product better if I had really dry skin?</li>
    <li> I have use this product in the past and liked it but just received this product and the expiration date was January 2015.  I would really like them to just send me a new one.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I found that doesn&#x27;t cake up in my wrinkles - actually softens them - highly recommend</li>
    <li> Went to a cosmetics store and was madeover with these products. I bought it at full retail (not something I typically do).  Once I realized it was on Amazon, I made a beeline to buy more.  Great coverage.  Evens out splotches and uneven texture.  Also love the concealer, too.</li>
    <li> IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK FOR ME.  IT MIGHT WORK FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS REAL DRY SKIN</li>
    <li> THIS FOUNDATION IS GREAT LOOKS LIKE YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE ANY MAKEUP ON AND IT GIVES YOU A SMOOTH LOOK WITHOUT CAKING  AND LOOKING MADE UP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY.</li>
    <li> This product goes on silky smooth and does a great job of evening out skin tone. I have olive undertones and the tan is perfect for my coloring. The medium and medium tan made me look pale.</li>
    <li> Too oily on my face. Coverage not greater and too light. Order two shades darker than you expect. Sadly, it went in the trash with so many other beauty supplies you can&#x27;t try before buying.</li>
    <li> AWFUL!!!! The bottle busted open at the top when I tried to squirt it out, and foundation went everywhere. I ordered tan because all reviews said lighter than expected, they weren&#x27;t kidding!! It was no where near a tan shade. Made me look super pale, and made my skin look crepey!!</li>
    <li> Quick way to get a tan quick.</li>
    <li> I use this alone, or for more coverage and stronger SPF protection, blend this with a heavier BB cream such as Jane Iredale, or Elta MD tinted sunblock.  I am fair-skinned, but like the Tan color because it gives me a healthy glow.  Remarkably, it blends beautifully and looks totally natural. Because it gives only light coverage used alone, I generally use a powder foundation to touch up areas that need a bit more coverage.  Since using this product people have routinely commented on my skin looking so great.</li>
    <li> Fast, easy and covers beautifully. Leaves my skin silky smooth, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, even after all day wear.</li>
