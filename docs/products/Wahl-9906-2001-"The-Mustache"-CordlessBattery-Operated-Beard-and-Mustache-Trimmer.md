      <li>I like it better because you can use your own rechargeable batteries that are cheaper.  </li>
      <li>The best method that I have found so far is to use a jeweller&#x27;s screwdriver blade to pry the batteries out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad Wahl is still making this model.</li>
      <li>It works ok, but build quality is not what it used to be.</li>
      <li>but thats what most of you want.</li>
      <li>I would buy one more but they are discontinued.</li>
      <li>but i am pleased with the shaver</li>
      <li>The theory is that you should be able to tug on the ribbon and remove each battery in reverse order of their installation.      </li>
      <li>I have used these for many years.  </li>
      <li>This replacement is excellent and it should be the last trimmer I will need!</li>
      <li>I used this same mustache trimmer for like 20 years and it worked excellent, finely it died.</li>

      <li>The attachments work well and are easy to get on and off.</li>
      <li>Keep your old head as I have since the cheap plastic ones are not so great.</li>
      <li>That one was still running strong til</li>
      <li>I accurate and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>they&#x27;ll raise the price on this fine trimmer.)</li>
      <li>If it does not, I have this one and it works fine.</li>
      <li>The trimmer is fine for a moustache but tends to stall out on my beard.</li>
      <li>Plastic is cheap.  </li>

      <li>The two cell trimmers don&#x27;t have the horsepower you need to keep the blades moving at full speed when you hit a dense spot.</li>
      <li>It works well on my full beard.</li>
      <li>On the plus side (\\&quot;the good\\&quot;), it cuts facial hair cleanly and effectively.    </li>
      <li>The surprising thing is that after ordering this, I purshased a &#x27;Wahl MUSTACHE Cordless Battery Powered Travel Trimmer&#x27;, and it included a well designed, fully adjustable length guide that clips onto exactly the same trimmer mechanism.  </li>
      <li>It feels heavier (which is nice) than my older one, and all the old attachments fit this one.  </li>
      <li>First of all, this product is made in the USA!  </li>
      <li>Now it is held together with plastic steel and rubber bands with some missing plastic, but still functions great.</li>
      <li>This model is far more quite and well-built</li>
      <li>I keep coming back to the WAHL cordless model because it is so handy as I have a trim at home in the morning, travel around the world or on a camping trip in the Outback</li>
      <li>but he&#x27;s thinking he won&#x27;t get as many years out of it as he did his old model.</li>
      <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;it is decently powerful</li>
      <li>The price is right and WAHL is as dependable as it gets.</li>
      <li>and it still fit the new trimmer.</li>
      <li>Overall quite satisfied.</li>
      <li>this does exactly what it says it will do use it to trim the mustache and sideburns.</li>
      <li>I actually like this one better.</li>
      <li>I knew exactly what it was and got a kick out of opening my bag for security.</li>
      <li>Overall, extremely satisfied with this Wahl product and no shortcomings with functionality, quality, and performance.</li>
      <li>Works great on my 1/8&amp;#34; thick beard.  </li>
      <li>I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer.</li>
      <li>Previous trimmers were much more comfortable.</li>
      <li>If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m assuming this is as good as it gets, and that this is just the nature of a small, battery powered trimmer.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just as easy to inadvertantly shave off an entire beard/mustache as it is to trim.</li>
      <li>This Wahl trimmer should last for a good long time.</li>
      <li>Secondly, this product is precise in construction and trimming.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a much slower process, and you can expect some pulling.</li>
      <li>The 3 batteries give it some power and it cuts really well.</li>
      <li>Handles well with accessories capable of performing what you need it to do whether trimming a mustache or beard.  </li>
      <li>This Wahl doesn&#x27;t take up much space, in cabinet or luggage.</li>
      <li>WAS VERY REASONABLE.I</li>
      <li>It was a real hassle to install and remove the batteries.  </li>
      <li>Not loud...minimal sound in conjunction with low vibration.</li>
      <li>AA batteries are available worldwide versus Lithium Rechargeable in which I have to pack a charger along with the internal batteries installed.  </li>
      <li>For two of the batteries I had to tug on the ribbon while also prying them out with a lever, and had to use so much force that I gouged the surface of two batteries.  </li>
      <li>However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own.</li>
      <li>I have an old identical model that has been in use for 20 years and actually still going strong.</li>
      <li>I dropped my first one, it was six years old.</li>
      <li>Bought to replace an older version...</li>
      <li>Who ever decided to take this attachment out made a big mistake and should get canned, lucky for me</li>
      <li>I had an older model rechargeable groomsman and every replacement battery</li>
      <li>It could use a little more horse power if it is to be used for beards.</li>
      <li>I bought this particular trimmer because I&#x27;d had good experiences with Wahl&#x27;s products in the past, and because I wanted a model that ran on standard AA batteries.  </li>
      <li>Battery life has never been an issue, I have used normal alkaline&#x27;s, lithium, and rechargeables (3 triple A&#x27;s) and all give satisfactory life compared to their cost.</li>
      <li>You can get the replacement battery on Amazon for ~$12, but for a few bucks more you can get this trimmer.  </li>
      <li>It is pricey compared to other available products of this type.</li>
      <li>Without going into detail that might embarrass our little pet, we are able to clear an area of hair in seconds without causing any distress.  </li>
      <li>I bought a Wahl trimmer in 2003 in Italy and it has lasted all these years, in fact I still use it, but i thought i would update it with this new one.</li>
      <li>I GOT USED TO.COST OF THIS NEW 9906</li>
      <li>They last forever and provide a huge amount of current when the motor calls for it.</li>
      <li>It basically is the same exact in style and features but he has noticed that the blades are already getting rusty.  </li>
      <li>My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What can I say, It&#x27;s a Wahl product.  Wahl makes professional clippers and trimmers for professionals.  I can&#x27;t think of anything else to comment on except.  Well packaged,good instructions on care and use,came with everything I needed except batteries.</li>
    <li> I bought this particular trimmer because I&#x27;d had good experiences with Wahl&#x27;s products in the past, and because I wanted a model that ran on standard AA batteries.  But I ended up returning it.    On the plus side (\\&quot;the good\\&quot;), it cuts facial hair cleanly and effectively.    On \\&quot;the bad\\&quot; side is the cheapness of the three \\&quot;guide combs\\&quot; and the razor stand. The stand is so lightweight in comparison to the weight of the trimmer + batteries that I found it pointless to use.  And the \\&quot;guide combs\\&quot; are made of the cheapest thin and flexible plastic I could imagine them using.  They do the job, but are difficult to remove when you need to clean the trimmer, and the awkward way of removing them means you are sure to break them sooner rather than later.     The ugly: the battery compartment.  It was a real hassle to install and remove the batteries.  What they make you do is wrap a strip of ribbon around each of the three batteries, in a serpentine fashion, as each is installed.  The theory is that you should be able to tug on the ribbon and remove each battery in reverse order of their installation.      Let&#x27;s ignore for now the fact that my trimmer didn&#x27;t come with a removal ribbon, something I hope was just an isolated problem.  When I improvised a replacement ribbon and tried following their directions, I found the batteries to be so tightly and awkwardly stacked inside the compartment that I had trouble putting the battery cover on.  Then, when I tried to remove the batteries, the ribbon alone couldn&#x27;t pull the batteries out as intended.  For two of the batteries I had to tug on the ribbon while also prying them out with a lever, and had to use so much force that I gouged the surface of two batteries.  To my eye, it looks like they didn&#x27;t bother designing the case of the trimmer for AA battery use: instead, it looks like they took the case from a rechargeable corded version of the same trimmer and minimally adapted it for consumer-installed batteries.    In short, I give it one star because of the unworkable battery compartment design and the flimsy and hard-to-remove guide combs.    P.S. This could also benefit from a switch to Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;Frustration-Free\\&quot; packaging...</li>
    <li> Bought to replace an older version...Not quite as nice but works as described and good value for the $$$...</li>
    <li> I have been using the same 110v powered trimmer for years and was dissapointed to have made a mistake in ordering - and ordered the battery powered.  The cost of the rechargeable battery was outrageous, even though it lasted for years, compared to the trimmer cost! I even tried to order one and got the order messed up - never receiving one.  I was always amazed at the durability and length of time that the 110 charged batts lasted and the quality of the cutting, but now the battery powered replacement is the same in trimming performance.  The only thing you should improve is the plastic stand.  It is topsy and too light weight, as well as having a poor storage for the attachments.  Plastic is cheap.  Double the area that the stand sits on and maybe include the power cord in the bottom,(wound around the base?) to add weight.</li>
    <li> I have an old identical model that has been in use for 20 years and actually still going strong. I dropped it several years ago sending plastic pieces everywhere. Now it is held together with plastic steel and rubber bands with some missing plastic, but still functions great. I use it to trim my beard and mustache once a week, and trim my hair line around the ears and back of my neck (I have cut my own hair with the \\&quot;flowbee\\&quot; for 20 years. Bought the flowbee and trimmer at the same time.)It trims close enough on my neck that I have never had to use a razor or electric shaver. It is true, as some have complained, the batteries are difficult to remove from the battery bay. On my old one they seemed to get looser over time. The new one is very tight. Small inconvenience to pay for such a handy device. Battery life has never been an issue, I have used normal alkaline&#x27;s, lithium, and rechargeables (3 triple A&#x27;s) and all give satisfactory life compared to their cost. Even when battery charge is very low and blades slow down, you can trim without pulling if you don&#x27;t rush it. I wanted to have a back up as the old one is getting long in tooth. Highly recommended for everything I have mentioned above, and ease of use, long life, insignificant initial cost and operating cost.</li>
    <li> I had an older model rechargeable groomsman and every replacement battery I got seemed to be too weak.  You can get the replacement battery on Amazon for ~$12, but for a few bucks more you can get this trimmer.  I like it better because you can use your own rechargeable batteries that are cheaper.  It feels heavier (which is nice) than my older one, and all the old attachments fit this one.  If you want to get a battery for the rechargeable model, look at the Wahl website - they are $5 (shipping included).  I have ordered that one, and if it works, great I now have one for home and one for travel.  If it does not, I have this one and it works fine. (review by Liz&#x27;s husband, Liz doesnt need a mustache trimmer!)</li>
    <li> Use it for trimming my husband mustache it gives a great trim, and can get  close with out putting holes in the mustache.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is fine for a moustache but tends to stall out on my beard. It could use a little more horse power if it is to be used for beards.</li>
    <li> To be fair this review starts off by giving the trimmer three stars. It gets one extra star for its low price. Then, it gets one star minus for the fact that three supplied guides all are ridiculously short and are only good if you want that short mustache or beard. If Wahl wants to limit the guides to three lengths, at least distribute them over a larger range. It gets another big star minus because the hairs have a tendency to get stuck in the guides, so it feels like waxing hair by hair without the wax. The sum equals: two stars. Happy shopping.</li>
    <li> 1. Well made with Wahl quality trimmer blades.    2. Uses 3 AA batteries ( I use my rechargeable NIMH batteries ), so no worry about a \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; proprietary    rechargeable going bad.    3. The price for this quality is excellent.    4. Nice and compact, yet rugged.    5. Precision trimming.... creates a great trim on the upper lip line.    Not much more to say..., I&#x27;d buy it again if it were to go away.  Heck, I&#x27;d even buy another one in 6 months if it broke and wouldn&#x27;t feel like I was cheated.  (Don&#x27;t tell Wahl this though.. they&#x27;ll raise the price on this fine trimmer.)</li>
    <li> This replaced a beard and mustache trimmer with a sealed rechargeable battery, an adjustable blade guard, and a blade head which could be switched for a nose and ear trimmer. The battery on that prior unit eventually deteriorated to the point where the trimmer no longer held a charge. The adjustable blade guard broke. This Wahl unit uses common batteries and I can choose to use rechargeable or non-rechargeable and can easily acquire replacements batteries, while I am traveling. The included blade guards are simple (they don&#x27;t adjust) and I hope they will last longer than a more complicated, adjustable guard. This Wahl doesn&#x27;t take up much space, in cabinet or luggage. So long as the switch, motor, and blades last, there doesn&#x27;t seem much that can go wrong with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Wahl 5567-200 Ear Nose and Brow Dual Head Trimmer, at the same time.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my trimmer. It works well on my full beard. It is very quiet and does not hurt my ears when I use it. Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> SOME WHAT SIMILAR THAT I  HAD 9920 RECHARGEABLE BUT THEY CHANGED THE COLOR AND MODLE NUMBER GREAT TRIMMER.I SHOULD OF SAVED AND GOT A REPLACEMENT BATTERY BUT THIS IS SAME HANDLE COMFORT THAT I GOT USED TO.COST OF THIS NEW 9906 WAS VERY REASONABLE.I SHOULD HAVE FOR A LONG TIME .</li>
    <li> I have always used a standard, electric trimmer - the sort you use to cut hair. My old one died recently, and I decided to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I&#x27;m not delighted with the way it cuts. I have to assume that my disappointment is largely with the change from an electric trimmer to a battery one, but I have no way to validate this. It could be that all battery trimmers have the same downsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the downsides that I&#x27;m not happy about are primarily in how the blades cut. It&#x27;s a much slower process, and you can expect some pulling. I find I need to slowly make several passes to get a complete trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve heard that these blades could sharpen a bit over time, this seems a bit dubious to me. I&#x27;m assuming this is as good as it gets, and that this is just the nature of a small, battery powered trimmer. If I had it to do over, I&#x27;d go ahead and get another electric trimmer and avoid the aggravation.</li>
    <li> The compartment on this unit is poorly designed.  Once you insert batteries it is impossible to remove them unless you use a knife or thin flat-head screw driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the [[ASIN:B000FJ9M5K WAHL 9962-717 Compact Travel Trimmer]].  It takes a single battery instad of 3, battery compartment is well designed, and it actually cuts noticeably better than this big clunky unit.</li>
    <li> I have used these for many years.  They are reliable and last a long time.  The old plastic guide head worked great, but I cannot find where they sell them anymore.  Keep your old head as I have since the cheap plastic ones are not so great.</li>
    <li> I have owned this cordless WAHL model for 30 years. It has taken me through heavy, full beards,light and tight comtemporary stubble and in-between...plus it&#x27;s great on sideburns. I keep coming back to the WAHL cordless model because it is so handy as I have a trim at home in the morning, travel around the world or on a camping trip in the Outback I never have to worry about foreign outlet connections, electricity or service centers. It did cause a stir at airport security when the switch accidently got bumped on and the noise from my carry-on created a bit of an alarm. I knew exactly what it was and got a kick out of opening my bag for security. This model comes with a neat little soft-sided travel pouch that I&#x27;ve used ever since. The price is right and WAHL is as dependable as it gets.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;it is decently powerful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The head starts rusting in a few weeks time&lt;br /&gt;- Takes 3 AA batteries and drains fast&lt;br /&gt;- It is pricey compared to other available products of this type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed with this trimmer.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a battery operated trimmer to travel with (ie - not a rechargeable unit, but something that has replaceable, traditional batteries). I knew this was a no-frills model, but the design of the trim-length guides that snap onto the trimmer is terrible.  If the trimmer is held the wrong way (maybe during a groggy morning shave) it&#x27;s just as easy to inadvertantly shave off an entire beard/mustache as it is to trim. There are no &#x27;safety&#x27; guides, and the length guides aren&#x27;t adjustable.  The unit comes with three different adapters, but they have to be switched out, and they&#x27;re very difficult to attach and remove.  The surprising thing is that after ordering this, I purshased a &#x27;Wahl MUSTACHE Cordless Battery Powered Travel Trimmer&#x27;, and it included a well designed, fully adjustable length guide that clips onto exactly the same trimmer mechanism.  And the travel trimmer was less expensive!      If you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer to groom a beard or mustache (and not shave it completely off), I&#x27;d look elsewhere. Even to the less expensive &#x27;travel&#x27; trimmer by the same company...</li>
    <li> For me, the best feature is that it operates on household batteries -- no need to worry about keeping it out in a base, plugged into an outlet.    As for trimming a beard, even Wahl&#x27;s operating instructions don&#x27;t make that claim. The booklet is for a \\&quot;Mustache Trimmer\\&quot;; the instructions (and illustrations) are for \\&quot;Trimming Your Mustache\\&quot;; and there are only three quides: 3/16\\&quot;, 1/8\\&quot; and Taper. Even though the product is clearly designed to trim a mustache, the instructions and illustrations are not much of a teaching tool either for those nervous about making a mistake, or semi-pros looking for styling tips.     If you want a closely trimmed beard you can probably make this work for you, but mustache/beard-wise, this is not an equal opportunity trimmer.</li>
    <li> the shipping was a little slow but as far as the product goes its a good buy. mind you i dont have to shave daily and i havent had it long enough to test the battery life but i am pleased with the shaver</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband for Christmas to replace the older model he had that was dieing a slow death.  It basically is the same exact in style and features but he has noticed that the blades are already getting rusty.  Possibly a cheaper steel that the previous model he had?  Still using and works great though but he&#x27;s thinking he won&#x27;t get as many years out of it as he did his old model.</li>
    <li> This is just the right size and shape to trim my mustache every few days.  I accurate and easy to use.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer. My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years. I took a 3 year break using a Norelco (which was a Christmas gift), however, I was never satisfied with the cut at longer settings. I ultimately went back to various Wahl trimmers, yet they all gave out (battery, motor, etc) in less than 2 years.    Deciding to give Wahl one last chance. I purchased the \\&quot;All-in-One Trimmer Kit,\\&quot; given that it had a 5-year warranty. The battery quit recharging after the 3rd month, and Wahl&#x27;s position was since I failed to keep my receipt, there was no warranty coverage. Please note that my failure to keep the receipt was definitely my fault. However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own. If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later. If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
    <li> really sharp and gets the job done. I mean I definitely needed this for my beard and this product provided me with what I needed. I mean you cant ask for anything more</li>
    <li> The best mustache trimmer I ever owned.It trims closer then any trimmer I&#x27;ve used,great product.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd trimmer of this model I&#x27;ve owned over the last 25 years (the last one I bought was in &#x27;96).  I have always kept my beard trimmed close, so the trimmers get very regular use.  They&#x27;ve held up exceptionally well, and being battery powered makes it convenient for travel.  As another reviewer mentioned, I learned the hard way that you should remove the batteries when packing for a trip to prevent the trimmer from accidently switching on in your travel bag.    My only complaint, and this is minor, is I prefer the older version of the trimmer attachments.  This trimmer previously came with a single adjustable attachment that I prefer over the multiple attachments included with the current version.</li>
    <li> This is the best battery operated beard trimmer that I have used so far. The 3 batteries give it some power and it cuts really well.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a year or so and the reason I gave it a 3 is that I does cut close for trimming my mustache.  I threw it away today. The frustration with changing batteries is the reason and today I could not get them out.  When I put in a fresh set of batteries, the trimmer runs at full speed for a few uses, then very mediocre.  I do not recommend this even for the good price.</li>
    <li> I used this same mustache trimmer for like 20 years and it worked excellent, finely it died. So I just bought another one how can you go wrong! The only thing is the new one didn&#x27;t come with the multi adjustable comb attachment that came with my old one. Who ever decided to take this attachment out made a big mistake and should get canned, lucky for me I still had my old attachment and it still fit the new trimmer. So that&#x27;s why I took 1 star away, all those little trimmer attachments you get with it now stink and really hurt this products performance.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other two reviewers who gave it a 2. I&#x27;ve bought 3 Wahls in my lifetime and this one is the poorest quality of the bunch. Not only are the attachments poorly made but they are also very pointed and scratch my face when I try to use it. Previous trimmers were much more comfortable.</li>
    <li> I looked around for just a mustache trimmer.  It works well for that.  I have another beard trimmer, so I have not used it for that, I doubt it would work well.  Overall quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and works great</li>
    <li> This will be my second one after receiving my first from my grandmother over 10yrs ago.  That one was still running strong til the day I lost it.  I recently bought their new and \\&quot;improved\\&quot; cordless version but threw it in the trash after being extremely disappointed with it.  This model is far more quite and well-built so I will be going back to it.</li>
    <li> First of all, this product is made in the USA!  Secondly, this product is precise in construction and trimming.  Not loud...minimal sound in conjunction with low vibration. Handles well with accessories capable of performing what you need it to do whether trimming a mustache or beard.  Battery option provided me flexibility while travelling. AA batteries are available worldwide versus Lithium Rechargeable in which I have to pack a charger along with the internal batteries installed.  Overall, extremely satisfied with this Wahl product and no shortcomings with functionality, quality, and performance.</li>
    <li> These trimmers were to use sometimes. But I use them all the time. They do not pull or snag. I am very pleased with these. I would buy one more but they are discontinued.</li>
    <li> had this model for over 15  years loved it. it finally died and has to look for a new one. this does exactly what it says it will do use it to trim the mustache and sideburns. gives nice clean straight lines and helps to trim the beard. I would recommend this item</li>
    <li> I got this item to replace an older unit that got broken by house cleaning staff. I actually like this one better. The motor seems to run faster.</li>
    <li> This product makes it easy to keep your mustache well groomed and looking good. There are several attachments which allow for a variety of other uses as well.</li>
    <li> I dropped my first one, it was six years old. The drop bent the blades, so I bought another one...good prodct, as all Wahl products are..</li>
    <li> I have owned and used both the Wahl 9906-2001 and Wahl 5537-1801 mustache/beard trimmers for a number of years.  Both have worked well for me; I keep my facial hair trimmed very short, using the blade as opposed to the combs -- so I can&#x27;t comment on the combs and other accessories. I like the AA-battery feature as I travel to places without 110v electricity.  I use Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries (on almost all my battery operated gadgets) and a single charge lasts a long time (a few months) when using the trimmers every other day at home. -- While they have taken a lot of use, neglect and rough handling over the years of use and travel, they are not indestructible -- tonight I dropped my 5537 on a tile floor and broke the blade. &lt;frown - about my carelessness&gt;  So I&#x27;m online tonight, placing an order for a replacement.  While I&#x27;m waiting for it to arrive, I&#x27;ll pull the other 9906 trimmer out of my travel pack to use.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Wahl 9906-2001 batteries are hard to replace&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Wahl 9906-2001 for several months now and have had to replace the batteries twice.  Unfortnately, getting the batteries out of the case has been extremely difficult.  The best method that I have found so far is to use a jeweller&#x27;s screwdriver blade to pry the batteries out.  While the trimmer works well and it has a long battery life, changing batteries are a real pain.  Hence, I am lowering the rating from 5-star to 3-star.</li>
    <li> Husband loves i bought this to replace the same one he has owned and used for over 25 years!!  That should say alot for this company!!</li>
    <li> We are using the cordless trimmer to help solve a discreet problem under our pet&#x27;s tail.  Without going into detail that might embarrass our little pet, we are able to clear an area of hair in seconds without causing any distress.  I think this is truly a wonderful tool.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best product on the market for my needs...</li>
    <li> I bought a Wahl trimmer in 2003 in Italy and it has lasted all these years, in fact I still use it, but i thought i would update it with this new one. I should have saved my money. This one is cheaply made, flimsy and plasticky and the add ons not great. It works ok, but build quality is not what it used to be.</li>
    <li> Been using Wahl for about 25 years now. Getting a little harder to find but worth looking for. It is easy to operate and it makes a neat, clean trimming of beards and mustaches.</li>
    <li> Works great on my 1/8&amp;#34; thick beard.  Simple to operate.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t work well with anything longer that 1/4&amp;#34; or really thick hair.  The selling point for me was the standardized size batteries.  I use rechargeable batteries and it works great.</li>
    <li> The recipient of this Wahl likes it, uses it regularly with no complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these 15 years ago and it finally fell apart due to extensive suitcase time. The blades were also getting a bit dull. I&#x27;m so glad Wahl is still making this model. This replacement is excellent and it should be the last trimmer I will need! It looks to be identical to the old one. Don&#x27;t mess with a winner! The trick is to get this model that takes three AA cells. They last forever and provide a huge amount of current when the motor calls for it. The two cell trimmers don&#x27;t have the horsepower you need to keep the blades moving at full speed when you hit a dense spot. That&#x27;s why they get caught in your mustache. Forget the rechargeable/expensive models. A set of alkaline batteries runs this one for me for about a year. I just trim my sideburns and mustache with it but thats what most of you want.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Mustache and Beard trimmer that finally died, There wasn&#x27;t any thing wrong with the trimmer, But the rechargeable battery had expired after 4yrs. That&#x27;s why I looked for a trimmer that uses replaceable batteries. This Wahl trimmer fits the bill. The attachments work well and are easy to get on and off. This Wahl trimmer should last for a good long time. It&#x27;s well built and uses common, replaceable alkaline batteries.</li>
