<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The lotion was packaged perfectly and delivered before due date. The seller met all expectations there. However, I think there was a problem with the manufacture of the lotion. I ordered 3 of these same lotions from two different sellers. The other two were perfect, but this one does not feel or smell the same as ones from Fragrance.net.  I think McClintock lotion is being discontinued and this order was substandard. I would order from the seller again- just not this product.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite so how can you go wrong.</li>
    <li> What a silky smooth feel and the scent is so pretty!</li>
    <li> Loved this fragrance for 30 years.  Prefer the lotion over the perfume.  Lotion is delicate and subtle.  I cannot smell it on myself, but others notice. If I can smell the fragrance I&#x27;m wearing, it is too strong. Received many flattering compliments from people who are allergic or cannot tolerate other scents.  The scent lingers softly on my skin and clothing and is a beautiful and lasting signature fragrance.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for someone who loves Jessica McClintock.  Smell is very nice.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I get many compliments on this fragrance, and your prices are also better than the department stores.  I will purchase this again,[[ASIN:B0017JV6EM Jessica Mc Clintock By Jessica Mcclintock For Women. Body Lotion 8.5-Ounce]] as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. It is yellow in color and not white. It is watered down and appears old. I will never order from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> GREAT,GREAT GREAT, will order form Parfum 1 again.It can in a timely manner and I have a good experiences with Parfum1.</li>
    <li> I did not get pump bottle as depicted . I received squeeze bottle. Also- I have been using this lotion for a long time and the smell was not the same- ? Old</li>
    <li> My wife said that it wasn&#x27;t fresh--- maybe from old stock.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s used this product for at least the past 5 years that I know of&lt;br /&gt;and loved it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jessica McClintock lotion for over 20 years ... will never stop using because I am constantly getting compliments!</li>
    <li> My mother truly loves all Jessica McClintock Beauty Supplies. And that&#x27;s why I did bought this Jessica McClintock Body Lotion for my Mother&#x27;s Birthday.</li>
    <li> wish this was more available at a better price, comparable to the cologne, which is reasonable. but, a necessary luxury!</li>
    <li> Product was as expected! Excellent :)</li>
    <li> This is not the real thing. It stinks! Font waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff.  It has a soft mint of fragrance that lasts and lasst.  IT feels silky  Thank you</li>
    <li> Love this body lotion. I can&#x27;t believe I could get this at such a terrific price and so quick.</li>
    <li> Jessica McClintock is simply the most beautiful fragrance I have ever worn.  I love this lotion to layer my fragrance every day!  It is the only fragrance I have worn in 30 years!</li>
    <li> The lotion is exactly what I wanted although the container refused to pump making it a downer for the Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;Deliberating what to do I contacted Amazon, got an immediate response. They said they would check with the company but to make it easy for me would be sending a replacement immediately. Which they did. I only gave 3 stars as I think the pump issue was a concern.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying wearing this body lotion! I already had the perfume and dusting power and wanted to add the lotion as I like to &amp;#34;layer&amp;#34; fragrance. I love this fragrance not only because it smells so good, but because it is light and not overpowering and my husband likes it on me. So many others makes him sneeze! I would recommend this to any one who wants a beautiful light fragrance.</li>
    <li> Not new to me.  It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and am constantly complemented on how good I smell. It&#x27;s a very subtle floral scent, not in the least overpowering, just fresh smelling. Even at work, whenever anyone enters my room, they comment how nice it smells (small room!). I only use the body lotion, no spray, etc. The only drawback is that I wish it moisturized a little better.</li>
    <li> Jessica Mc Clintock is one of my favorite fragrances.  The lotion, to me is even better than the cologne or perfume because it stays with me all day.  I am glad to be able to find it through Amazon.com because it is not easily found anymore in local stores at such a great price.</li>
    <li> I gave it as a gift for the Holidays and it was a total surprise.  She didn&#x27;t know it came as a lotion.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed.  The lotion smells stale, like it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf in a warehouse for a really long time.  It has a plastic odor, like it&#x27;s taken on the scent of the plastic bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it smells so good. Everything to love, and it works on the skin well too.</li>
    <li> This was not a cheap replica and was not the real thing. Do not Buy!</li>
    <li> This is not one of my most favorite scents, I order it because I do like it enough to wear on casual days, which helps my faavorite scents to last longer...i save those for special times.  It is a nice lotion and the delivery was fast.  I would feel good recommending this Seller to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find this scent any longer. I had purchased the perfume months ago and had to have the lotion to go with it. It&#x27;s great paired or wearing alone. I bring the lotion with me and freshen up with it throughout the day. I get lots of compliments when wearing. It&#x27;s a nice spring/summer floral and citrusy scent. I would highly recommend this lotion!</li>
    <li> I felt that the product was old.  It had very little fragrance.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, quick delivery.</li>
    <li> It was great to find this so much less than it is sold in the stores!  I always get compliments when I wear this :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother in law for Mother&#x27;s day and she said smells so wonderful.  She loves the pump.</li>
    <li> I anticipate this to have a warming and soothing feel and fragrance. Jessica Mc C perfume has a very nice fragrance and is always reasonably priced. Better than a few high end perfumes in my opinion. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My wife loves Jessica products, therefore so do I. The fragrance of Jessica products is the only one that my wife has used that I really enjoy!</li>
    <li> Fast deliver and product was perfect.  Highly recommend.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this lotion.  I have been wearing this lotion for over 20 years!  My children won&#x27;t let me wear anything else because they say that is doesn&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;mom!&amp;#34;  I started buying this lotion at Nordstrom years ago, then they discontinued it.  I then started buying it at Macy&#x27;s and/or directly from Jessica McClintock.  Now, they both don&#x27;t carry it.  I SURE hope that Amazon doesn&#x27;t discontinue it.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the smell of this lotion!</li>
    <li> This perfume lotion smell just like the perfume.it also last for a very long time.♥LOVE THE WAY IT MAKES MY ALREADY BODY SOFTER AND SMOOTH.FEELS LIKE BUTTER. FIVE STARS FOR THIS PERFUME LOTION!!!</li>
