      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Miracalis line, so when they asked me to test this product, I was thrilled to try it out.  </li>

      <li>But so far its very nice.</li>
      <li>Awesome product other</li>

      <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
      <li>I will definitely use it until the bottle is gone and hopefully have some great results to post here.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, once the bottle is gone if my opinion has changed and great things have happened (or not happened) I&#x27;ll be back to update my review.</li>
      <li>It has a light orange smell to it bc of the Vitamin C in it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I did noticed smooth skin</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Smells good and makes my skin so soft.</li>
      <li>This cream is specially formulated to absorb quickly and hydrate the skin, giving it more flexibility and elasticity</li>
      <li>Have only been using a week so hoping to get better results with longer use!!</li>
      <li>bc pregnancy makes smells VERY OVERPOWERING!!!</li>
      <li>It smelled good and was nice and thick :)</li>
      <li>One positive is that it is non-sticky and goes on very smoothly.</li>
      <li>The cream has a light, clean smell if any and aborbs quickly without leaving any greasiness.</li>
      <li>When I put it on, it smoothed on perfectly, it&#x27;s super moisturizing, and it did not leave any greasy residue.... which is another huge plus for me.</li>
      <li>, this product glides on smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>, however that doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as being able to see them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t give a full review</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and it has faded my stretch marks so much</li>
      <li>Shipped to me quickly.</li>
      <li>I put on the cream in the morning after I shower and it absorbs quickly and hydrates my skin not feeling oily or greasy.</li>
      <li>I am currently pregnant and i&#x27;m going to be using this on my bottom and thighs</li>
      <li>Smells great, absorbs quickly (no residue on my clothes), and is full of quality ingredients that have proven beneficial for stretch marks.  </li>
      <li>So my recommendations is not only for women after their pregnancy but also for anybody who wants a good-looking belly with nice skin!</li>
      <li>The packaging is pretty basic and not the most appealing but don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
      <li>so i&#x27;m excited to see the rest of the promising results that this will offer!</li>
      <li>It has a light grapefruit/citrus scent and is pleasant feeling, not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about half way through my first tube and hoping to see my marks improve.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love this stuff so far.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work as I had expected. Makes my skin red and irritated.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have used this for the past few days and my skin feels really moisturized. It has a wonderful amount of natural ingredients that really help smooth out the skin. I am currently pregnant and i&#x27;m going to be using this on my bottom and thighs which are my problem areas. The packaging is pretty basic and not the most appealing but don&#x27;t be fooled. Not everything has to be &#x27;pretty&#x27; for it to work. The smell is nice and not overpowering like some creams can be which is really great seeing as all smells at the moment seem over the top. Looking forward to using this for the rest of my pregnancy!</li>
    <li> Wow! So many great ingredients: Vitamin E, Organic Olive Oil, Aloe, Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter, Jojoba Oil, Mango Butter and Rose Hip Seed Oil ! I used to take jojoba oil so far but this one is way better! I like the smell which is very important for me when I use creams! I apply it every day and it helps strengthen my belly skin! I didn&#x27;t take it right after my pregnancy but as a woman with 40 now I thought this could help anyway.... and it does! So my recommendations is not only for women after their pregnancy but also for anybody who wants a good-looking belly with nice skin! Just try!</li>
    <li> Still using this and I can&#x27;t give a full review but I can tell you that my stretch marks are less noticeable</li>
    <li> I love it! Just a week of using this cream has made a huge difference!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. It seems to form my skin especially my stomach. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> my sister used this cream before and shes seen some great results so i ordered for my pregnancy to prevent them still had no stresh marks great product !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and while I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my stretch marks yet, it definitely leaves my skin moisturized and smooth. I like the scent (very subtle but nice) and love that it absorbs so well. My son is now 14 months and now that summer is here I&#x27;m really hoping this will help at least fade my &amp;#34;mommy marks&amp;#34; to a more reasonable level. I know that they aren&#x27;t going to just disappear, so I&#x27;m not holding out unrealistic hopes of this cream doing that. However, I am hoping for some toning and perhaps lessening of them. At this point while I am really liking this, I&#x27;m not yet at the point where I would say you HAVE to have it. However, once the bottle is gone if my opinion has changed and great things have happened (or not happened) I&#x27;ll be back to update my review. Note: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/22/15: I&#x27;ve been using this once to twice daily on my stomach and thighs. I still really like the scent and how well it absorbs, but unfortunately it&#x27;s mainly just acted like a standard lotion for me. Maybe my stretch marks are beyond help (sad day!), or maybe it really does take the entire bottle to notice a difference. I think I&#x27;m about 1/3 of the way through the bottle at this point. It definitely does moisturize, but for me it&#x27;s not making a difference with the appearance of the stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I received this crram to review. I have been using it for a week and it does seem to make my skin smoother how ever the stretch marks are still visible.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Label and box looks like it was printed off of an inkjet printer, which wouldn&#x27;t really matter. If the stuff inside worked then fine. I wouldn&#x27;t care it it was in a reused Elmer&#x27;s glue bottle but it did nothing. No difference in appearance of skin. In fact, had better results with lotions such as Jergens, St. Ives, and Aveeno and for MUCH less money. I suspect a lot of the WAY hyped up reviews for this product were fake/solicited and made up. It offers a money back guarantee, but even better, save yourself the time and shipping expense and try something else!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying this product for about a month or so but haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.  I did noticed smooth skin but that&#x27;s it.  I will keep trying it and update as I see results.</li>
    <li> Bottle is double sealed. Has a cover over top under cap and is sealed on outside. Upon opening, the smell is somewhat fruity. It&#x27;s not oily and absorbs fast and well. Already noticing that the color of my marks are fading a bit. Looking forward to when they blend in. Received this product for review.</li>
    <li> Great product! Eliminated the itching I was experiencing with pregnancy stretch marks. The marks quickly faded from bright red to pink. I would defiantly recommend this product for pregnancy stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Love the cream, its smells wonderful and its just the right consistency. Will def get again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product other then it&#x27;s a tad bit oily</li>
    <li> Although I am not pregnant, I have stretch marks from weight/muscle gain from a few years ago and from more recently so there are a mix of faded white marks and red marks. After using this cream for about a week and a half, I can say that I really do like it so far! The cream has a light, clean smell if any and aborbs quickly without leaving any greasiness. I&#x27;ve been using it once in the morning and once at night, and my skin definitely feels firmer and more moisturized. I am anxiously awaiting even more results, but nonetheless I love that I saw some results so quickly!</li>
    <li> This cream is specially formulated to absorb quickly and hydrate the skin, giving it more flexibility and elasticity I have surgical scars plus stretch marks from two kids. quite noticeable. I have come to terms with it being there, but I wish that it wasn&#x27;t. It is noticeable and makes me self conscience at times. Needless to say, I was pretty excited to try Miracalis Stretch Marks cream.&lt;br /&gt; My surgery was over 2 years ago and the scar is still there. Per my Doctor&#x27;s instructions I just applied coco butter to the scar and tried to keep it out of the sun. I was using a Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter stick most of this time. I now know that not all coca butter is equal. It goes on easily and makes your skin feel extremely hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has definitely improved the look of my scar in the little timing that I have been using it. I tried to photograph my scar up close for a before and after comparison, but the pictures did not come out very well. It is hard to photograph scars when you want to. However, when you don&#x27;t want them in your pictures they are there. Sigh. The scar looks less bright and red. It is more flesh colored and faded when using this cream. I wish I had owned this cream 2 years ago when I first had the scar.</li>
    <li> Shipped to me quickly. Feels really nice</li>
    <li> I love it!!!  It&#x27;s been a month now in I&#x27;ve been using this product in its works great. See results within the first week. I need one more bottle in my stretch marks or gone for good.  I never felt this great about showing off my stomach....</li>
    <li> It smells really good and I like how it just soaks into my skin. It isn&#x27;t a miracle cream that takes stretch marks away or anything, but it&#x27;s very moisturizing. I would probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail a few days ago. It&#x27;s still to soon to post about results; however, I wanted to leave a review according to the product thus far. Currently being pregnant, I was super excited when I saw this. I have used it 3 different nights. It surprisingly doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell; which  personally, I don&#x27;t mind bc pregnancy makes smells VERY OVERPOWERING!!! I was afraid it would smell like medication or even just smell bad. It has a light orange smell to it bc of the Vitamin C in it.&lt;br /&gt;I looked on the box at ingredients, it&#x27;s filled with great oils and vitamins, so I was excited about that. When I put it on, it smoothed on perfectly, it&#x27;s super moisturizing, and it did not leave any greasy residue.... which is another huge plus for me. I will definitely use it until the bottle is gone and hopefully have some great results to post here.&lt;br /&gt;The box it came in was nice, the only thing I could suggest would be the label on the front be a little more appealing to the eye. However, the label has nothing to do with the great product inside! As they always say, never judge a book by it&#x27;s cover.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product. Using for new and old stretch marks. Good seller and fast shipment!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks, and have noticeable difference in my stretch marks!  I went through a transplant in 09&#x27; and suffered from cushings syndrome as a side effect from my steroid use.  I have suffered from these marks and scars for years and been embarrassed to go swimming or around other, but this cream has given me real hope for once.  The price for the quality is un-matchable, and I would recommend this to anyone who is in my same boat!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife. She loves it and has seen vast improvement in her skin. I have always pretended they were never there (since I was the cause of them) But we have seen a great reduction of appearance. We highly recommend.</li>
    <li> so far no stretch marks during pregnancy</li>
    <li> I got this product witha great price, with a discount and i used it for more best result and i am happy that i try this for my stretch mark and it gives a best result for me..</li>
    <li> I started using this cream a week and a half ago and I&#x27;m liking it so far. it has lightened my stretch marks and helped a little with cellulite. It comes in a good size tube. The cream is not too thick but not watery either. It absorbs very nicely into the skin and does not leave it greasy. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent. I did receive it to  review.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:563b226b5488ec6ae36263d21f45969c]] This product has virtually the SAME ingredients as a product I used during my last pregnancy.  That other product worked, but it cost almost $100 a bottle!  I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Miracalis line, so when they asked me to test this product, I was thrilled to try it out.  Smells great, absorbs quickly (no residue on my clothes), and is full of quality ingredients that have proven beneficial for stretch marks.  So happy that I can afford to keep treating my stretch marks.  They may never go away completely, but even a little bit of improvement helps so much when it&#x27;s bikini season!</li>
    <li> Love this! Smells good and makes my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff so far. Seems to be working in the week i have been using it. I will have to update this after i have been using it for a while. But so far its very nice. Love the feeling on my skin. Not oily like a lot of products out there. It goes on nicely, It doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell witch is good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been almost four years since my youngest daughter was born and I finally decided to try and do something about the stretch marks I got during pregnancy.  I was given the opportunity to purchase Miracalis Stretch Mark Cream at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what type of results I would see as my skin had been this way for so long.  After using the product for about a week I could begin to see results.  My stretch marks were fading and becoming less visible.  I can still feel them if I run my fingers across them, however that doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as being able to see them.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is a semi-thick cream that you rub onto your skin in a circular motion.  Neither the box nor the actual bottle specified how often the product should be used so I applied it once a day after bathing.  I plan to continue to use the product to see if I will continue to see positive results</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, unsure if it is helping with my stretch marks but it does help with the hydration of the skin.</li>
    <li> One of the great things about it is there is no scent to it.I don&#x27;t&#x27;t see the result yet since  i just started but I will update later the results.</li>
    <li> This far, I have only used this cream for two days and it is already helping! My stretch marks are fading and getting softer. And the scent is kinda lemony, I really like it! I would recommend this to my friends for sure!</li>
    <li> The Stretch mark cream was delivered in protective packaging and&lt;br /&gt;was as described on product page.  We purchased the cream in&lt;br /&gt;a promotion for testing and review.  The cream is very rich and&lt;br /&gt;absorbs nicely.  Premium ingredients, all excellent for skin&lt;br /&gt;nourishment, so feeling very safe using.  Have just began using,&lt;br /&gt;and hoping the cream will be effective on stretch marks occurring&lt;br /&gt;from weight loss.</li>
    <li> This product absorbs fast and no smell at all. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to review if it actually works on my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I truly like this product. I started using it a few weeks ago and already see a noticeable difference in my skin. As most women, I got a few stretchmarks while I was pregnant and this cream really worked. I use a dermaroller and massage my skin thoroughly after the shower. In any case, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used 1 tube of this while pregnant and really liked it. I ended up with only a couple small stretch marks but used other lotions too! It smelled good and was nice and thick :)</li>
    <li> my wife likes this cream. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I just received this product and I hope it will help with my stretch marks. One positive is that it is non-sticky and goes on very smoothly. I will submit another review after a month to see if it has improved my stretch marks</li>
    <li> worked on my stretch marks</li>
    <li> I really hate the stretch marks I have from my kids years ago. I am embarrassed by them so I figured why not try this. I use in the morning and at night after my evening shower. I don&#x27;t use a whole lot, about the size of a dime is more then plenty. I simply rub it in and go on with my business. I have not encountered stains on my shirts/pj&#x27;s. I dont know yet if it has shown me results BUT my belly is smoother. I like that the smell is not a nasty medicine stench. It&#x27;s a nice size bottle so i&#x27;m excited to see the rest of the promising results that this will offer! I got this for a discount for my honest feed back</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about the cream was the delicious scent. Citrus and floral notes are very different than the smell I&#x27;m used to with other stretch mar creams which tend to smell medicinal; a very welcomed change! The cream is rich and highly moisturizing. It stays in place where I put it and leaves my skin very soft. The packaging makes it easy to apply. This is also different from other creams I&#x27;ve used that came in tubs. I prefer the easy squeeze method. The rich ingredients of aloe, cocoa, mango and Shea butters and vitamin E can definitely be felt when applied and are soaked right up by my skin. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results with continued use! *Discount given for unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order form the seller again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for the past 2 months and it&#x27;s working so far.  The stretch marks on my thighs and upper arms are lighter.  I know they will never disappear but I will continue to apply it every night after my shower and hope for the best.</li>
    <li> After having 3 kids, I&#x27;ve pretty much tried every product out there to minimize the appearance of the stretch marks left behind. With that being said, when I was offered a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review, I went for it. I&#x27;m very happy that I did!! A thick, white, odorless cream, this product glides on smooth and absorbs quickly. After just a few days, I noticed a difference in the most prominent of my scars, as well as the surrounding skin. The scars are far less visible and my skin is super soft!! This product has out performed others that I&#x27;ve tried that are four times as much. A plus product!!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly!! Skin feels firmer!!! Not too bad of a smell!! So far good outlook on helping to reduce cellulite and stretch marks! Have only been using a week so hoping to get better results with longer use!! Skin feels softer and looks healthier</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 tubes after I read the reviews, however, I have yet to see my stretchmarks lighten.  I use it morning and night diligently.  It has a light grapefruit/citrus scent and is pleasant feeling, not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about half way through my first tube and hoping to see my marks improve.&lt;br /&gt;I will give more feedback as I continue the use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it and it has faded my stretch marks so much</li>
    <li> All though I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my stretch marks as of yet, I have however felt the lotion tightening my skin. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. And unlike most stretch mark cream this product doesn&#x27;t have an unsightly smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little bit and to be honest it seems a tad bit oily and for me that has sensitive skin I have to use this sparingly or else I break out. I would recommend this product to those who are not super sensitive to oily lotions and creams.</li>
    <li> Miracalis is becoming a go to product for me.. great product absorbs fast.</li>
    <li> Yessssss. I can&#x27;t believe this really works. It&#x27;s the best product beside cocoa butter. The real coconut oil. This cream clear my stretch marks out. It jus blend in with my skin tone. Never have to worry about wearing short shorts with people laughing. I can exposed my legs all day summer. Thanks again very satisfy. It is also good for pregnant women. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I have tried this item on stretch marks that I already had and they appear to be diminished. I really like this product. After having the stretch mark cream for a while now, I would highly recommend it to anyone male or female that wants to do something about their stretch marks.</li>
    <li> It visibly reduces the appearance of stretch marks and scars. The ingredient lists is impressive!</li>
    <li> it smells good and I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of change in the last two week. I have to admit that sometimes I forget to apply it but still the stretch marks started to fade away.</li>
    <li> I received Miracalis Stretch Mark Cream at a discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased and honest review. I&#x27;ve had 3 children and they have all given me many stretch marks that I thought would never fade or go away. Even though they might night completely disappear, I&#x27;ve noticed after just a couple of days that they are not as red and my skin seems tighter. I put on the cream in the morning after I shower and it absorbs quickly and hydrates my skin not feeling oily or greasy. I love that this product was also made in the USA!!</li>
    <li> After having a tummy tuck I still had stretch marks so I searched for a product that would assist me in my fighting of stretch marks. This product does everything it says that it would do.</li>
    <li> It reduces the appearance of stretch marks and scars. Smells great</li>
