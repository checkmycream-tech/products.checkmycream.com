      <li>I was satisfied with it.</li>

      <li>I love this size.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted something nice and presentable to store my homemade lipbalm and this is what I saw and liked on Amazon.</li>
      <li>also thank you for the free sample of eye shadow. :)</li>
      <li>The lids twist on and off easily.  </li>
      <li>They work well, close easily, and don&#x27;t leak.</li>
      <li>The jar is fine for price and does its job to eyebrow gel.</li>
      <li>these are perfect little containers for balms and samples of salves that i make.</li>
      <li>The little containers are perfect in size and made well.  </li>
      <li>but it did not come with a free eye shadow sample</li>
      <li>is exactly like picture and described, will buy more in future&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
      <li>I received this product in time and absolutely fell in love with these containers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m about ready to get more....</li>
      <li>They are very small, but perfect for lip gloss or ear rings or contact lenses.</li>
      <li>The lids screw on nice and easy and have a tight fit.</li>
      <li>I also received a free powder eye shadow from myo makeup and its very pigmented and creamy.</li>
      <li>but they are as pictured and arrived pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>They are just the right size for carrying around in your purse.</li>
      <li>They also make a 3 gram version which is great for smaller samples such as glitter pigments.</li>
      <li>Good material and lids close tightly.</li>
      <li>I use these for homemade cosmetics and they do exactly what I need them to</li>
      <li>will come back to buy more.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Not sure what would weigh five grams in them but still a good product</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are also good for holding small treasures, like Lego bits, and arts and crafts supplies, like glitter, since they seal nice and tightly.</li>
      <li>My grandson loved this little pot of clear, yet strawberry flavored lip balm!  </li>
      <li>and I bet they&#x27;d make nice little gift basket additions.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, very protective packaging.</li>
      <li>Thanks Myo Makeup</li>
      <li>Arrived very prompt.</li>
      <li>They take a week or so to arrive but the jars are as pictured and very sturdy.</li>
      <li>They still worked for homemade lip balm very well.</li>
      <li>The tops are easy to screw on and off and fit perfectly - no snagging or eternal twisting to get it on just right.</li>
      <li>These are great little jars for travel especially when you only get one quart size zip-lock container for all of your makeup!</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s just enough room to fit your finger in there comfortably for use as a lip balm container (unless you have long nails, then forget it and buy something bigger).</li>
      <li>but just the right size will definitely order again</li>
      <li>Smaller than expected, but they are ok.  </li>
      <li>Much smaller then I thought they were going to be, but was exactly what was stated in the ad.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed to created solid perfume and lip balm.</li>
      <li>The lids fit tight.</li>
      <li>Use clear tape to label them so they can be reused but won&#x27;t have any residue or block what the product looks like.</li>
      <li>I really only needed 1 jar but this was the only qty I could find for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>No sharp edges or marks on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My only issue is that I wish I saw a container like the \\&quot;Darice 2025-251 Clear Bead</li>
      <li>Small enough and cheap enough.</li>

While my product did not come with an eyeshadow sample, there was a sheet of really cute nail decals.  I already had plenty of broken eyeshadow anyway.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will provide a photo of one of the containers on my computer keyboard.</li>
    <li> Received all 25 containers. None were cracked. I use these for cracked, powdery eye shadows that can&#x27;t stay together even after trying to fix it with rubbing alcohol.</li>
    <li> 👍 Amazing for samples for my home made lotion :) perfect containers dont leak:)</li>
    <li> Ordered these jars to use when we make lip gloss for daughters birthday and they&#x27;re perfect! Make labels with one inch stickers (I printed them out on Avery sticker sheets and used 1&amp;#34; punch). Great value!</li>
    <li> Loved these! Perfect size for homemade lip balm, will buy these again.</li>
    <li> Seem a little on the cheap and small side.  (Yes, I read the gram count before I bought)  It&#x27;ll serve the purpose but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Great price and just what I needed for making my homemade flavored lipgloss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needed something small to put in my Christmas cards this year as a gift.</li>
    <li> I just got them today it was smaller than I thought but how big is a 5 gram container is suppose to be but it did not come with a free eye shadow sample so I was disappointed on two fronts</li>
    <li> these are the perfect size for samples and lip balms I can make hem pour them seal them and be done In a jiffy will be ordering more wish they had a larger bulk size lot to buy like say 250 or even 500 depending on price, that would be great</li>
    <li> these are perfect little containers for balms and samples of salves that i make. will come back to buy more. also thank you for the free sample of eye shadow. :)</li>
    <li> Very good product. I make homemade lip balm, and it&#x27;s a great container.</li>
    <li> They take a week or so to arrive but the jars are as pictured and very sturdy. The perfect size for giving out samples of cosmetics or lotions. They also make a 3 gram version which is great for smaller samples such as glitter pigments.</li>
    <li> Great product, I transferred some pigments into these containers, they were the perfect size for what I needed and got just the right amount of them. Cannot complain! I would recommend!</li>
    <li> I use these to decant samples of skincare and what have you to friends and bottle up trail products. I&#x27;ve also used them to decant my own samples in stores though some places frown on this. Which larger amounts like this you expect a couple duds but all of these arrived perfect! Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip- Use clear tape to label them so they can be reused but won&#x27;t have any residue or block what the product looks like.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, but they are ok.  I use them for homemade lip gloss containers.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to created solid perfume and lip balm. Small enough and cheap enough. I was satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the lip balm I make!  I love this size.  These seal up perfectly.  I&#x27;m about ready to get more....you won&#x27;t be sorry if you get these!  I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> I am reordering this product.they are greatwith anice finish that makes them stand out.&lt;br /&gt;I am starting to review products as they help me decide whether to buy from seller or not.&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> They are very small, but perfect for lip gloss or ear rings or contact lenses.</li>
    <li> Used for homemade lip balm.  My grandson loved this little pot of clear, yet strawberry flavored lip balm!  The little containers are perfect in size and made well.  I will purchase again.</li>
