    <li> Perfect Low Haircut Blade!!!</li>
    <li> the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; of the blade broke on my first hair cut!! The quality was cheaper than the original blade.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace!! Nice to have especially when you send your others off to get sharpened.</li>

    <li> Great blade! It&#x27;s perfect for blending! It gets that extra tight skin fade that you need.i am very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and it cuts SUPER close.  Wish I had found this fade blade long ago.</li>
    <li> Broke my blades currently on my fade masters. Amazon hooked me up with the replacement blades quickly. Fademasters back up and going so I can make this money.</li>
    <li> It worked wonderful in every way, I would strongly encourage to get this product . Money use as an investment and quality</li>
    <li> This Blade is perfect to get a very close shave on the head, gets very very short and cuts like butter, best purchase in a while</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t be a hypocrite I love these blades, there amazing. I&#x27;m a professional barber. Both me and my Son use these blades, my son is getting there in terms of proper technique but he knows what his doing. Poing being, is even with experience and tact, these blades have broken twice in our barbershop. Don&#x27;t know what it is, but seems that they are quite weak. There is a small level of expected impact, every time I grab and set them back down on my desk or drawers. Albeit, the amount of force is minute. That being said, I&#x27;m quite disappointed in the quality of them. Although for the purposes of cutting Hair, they are GREAT! but buyer be ware, they can and will brake if not taken care of them properly.</li>
    <li> Thank you I am very happy! Great product and very fast shipping. I purchase all my hair supplies here. Top notch goods.</li>
    <li> works great..good price</li>
    <li> The teeth broke the second time I tried using them. Took an L for that.</li>
    <li> First off let me say that I don&#x27;t think the Blade I received was new. It looked very dirty and it has scratch marks on the bottom and groove marks on the inside which means this was clearly was used before. That said I waited to long to get this Blade to send it back so instead I will take it out on this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned the residue (whatever it was) off of the blade with Alcohol and let it dry, then connected it to my Masters. How did it perform? Perfectly, sharper lines making it  much easier to make that Professional look happen. If it weren&#x27;t for the used condition of the Blade it would earn 5 stars easy. I can&#x27;t wait until my sons need a haircut again.</li>
    <li> excellent timing, it came ahead of schedule.  i cant wait to attach them to my andis masters making them essentially a fade master.  cant wait to see the performance.</li>
    <li> This blade cuts well and fades better but it&#x27;s so sharp it actually pokes my clients in their follicles.  I get around this but using it very slowly but who has time to waste.  Any recommendations would be great.</li>
    <li> Great Service and item</li>
    <li> First off to those that say the blade gets under the skin are wrong. Unless either 1. The clients head is sweaty and it tugs (which can havppen with a fade or taper blade), 2. You&#x27;re a beginner barber with no experience with a regular taper blade. The fade blade is completely flat and extremely skinny at by the top teeth (moving blade). That means you cut more hair and more precisely. Also noting if you you try to dig into the skull to fade out lines (with this blade you do not need to), then you with get into your clients skin and tug. The taper blade is angled at the tip which means you have to tilt your clipped into the head to get the most of your cut. Fade blade knocks out lines easier than my Wahl Legends (my hitters), which amazed me. Anyways, it&#x27;s great blade or clipper once you get light handed or fluent with the clipper in your hand! For $20 i&#x27;d rather pay that then spend an extra 10 mins taking out a line with my outliners!</li>
    <li> After my purchase as I i was putting it in my bag 1 of teeth broke off,I didnt drop it I just stick in my clipper bag and for whatevr reason the teeth are very week.I wont ever buy this blade again</li>
