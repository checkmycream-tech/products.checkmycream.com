      <li>I love this product and can not grow nails with out it.</li>
      <li>recommended this product after getting my acrylics off of many years wearing them.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the cuticle oil, Rejuvacote &amp; Miracote top coat.</li>
      <li>My nails seem a bit better and stronger.  </li>
      <li>It works like magic.</li>
      <li>I came across Duri Rejuvacote online and read such great reviews I figured &#x27;why not&#x27;, I&#x27;ve tried everything else!</li>
      <li>though I didn&#x27;t really get the result I&#x27;d hoped for, I still think this is a good product.</li>
      <li>Now, they are beautiful &amp; I actually have to trim them.</li>
      <li>They are long, strong and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
      <li>AND MY NAILS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND LONG.  </li>
      <li>it is worth every cent!</li>
      <li>i CAN&#x27;T SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>First time in years to have strong nails.  </li>
      <li>THEY ARE SO PRETTY AND STRONG.</li>
      <li>so of course it damaged my already problem nails tremendously.</li>
      <li>Best product ever for weak nails.  </li>
      <li>For the first time ever I have nails - LONG, beautiful, real nails.</li>
      <li>My nails certainly look better and they are so much stronger,  </li>
      <li>worth it to buy it...</li>
      <li>Great for nails that are not strong.  </li>
      <li>It really does help nails grow, and it is really great quality and helps the polish dry faster and look really shiny.</li>
      <li>Now I have nice long nails that do not break.  </li>
      <li>In a very short time, using Rejuvacote, they became strong and long.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
      <li>My mom saw Duri advertized in a fashion magazine and bought me my first bottle 1.5 years ago.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a first for me.</li>
      <li>My daughter was to married</li>
      <li>I used it the way that the packaging recommended, (I did get sort of a tingling when I first used it</li>
      <li>This is the first nail hardener that has ever worked for me.  </li>
      <li>I will certainly purchase this product again.</li>
      <li>I never thought that my nails will grow so much and be strong at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>Within 3 weeks my nails have grown so much that I had to shorten them in order to type.  </li>
      <li>I will keep paying my $14 for the REAL THING.</li>
      <li>This stuff really is a miracle.  </li>
      <li>I really wish I could find something that lived up to its claims, but I haven&#x27;t yet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now, and while I do think it helps nails grow stronger, I don&#x27;t really think it makes your nails grow any faster than usual.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can really notice a difference.  </li>
      <li>Then my mom recommended this one to me, and when I saw how much her nails improved, I gave it a try.</li>
      <li>Within weeks of using  Rejuvicote, they became long and strong.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other products for my britle nails but was convinced that nothing will help.</li>
      <li>love long, natural nails?  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle, but I think it is a decent product.</li>
      <li>Started using after removing nail tips and my own nails were stronger and longer than ever, then I made the mistake of using a gel overlay--now I&#x27;m back to Rejuvacote regularly until my nails grow back strong and long.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product and they fell through.  </li>
      <li>AND I actually have length to my nails for the first time in my life!</li>
      <li>than they normally would have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Used them pretty regularly and what a difference....</li>
      <li>so I stopped getting them &amp; was resigned to having soft, cracked, stubby nails.  </li>
      <li>This was recommended to me by a nail professional</li>
      <li>and I was shocked to see she had 10 beautiful nails.</li>
      <li>It dries fast and the only negatives are the bottle gets gouged up around the top which needs to be kept clean with a paper towel and acetone and half way through the bottle you might need to add a few drops of acetone to thin back the nail polish consistency.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s going to take awhile to get them grown out and get rid of all this mistreated nail surface, but even at that, this product is strengthening them enough so that they aren&#x27;t tearing clear down like they normally do.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best product ever for weak nails.  I removed my acrylics and my nails were paper-thin.  In a very short time, using Rejuvacote, they became strong and long.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
    <li> This will harden your nails and help them to grow. People continue to ask if my nails are fake, this is a must have. Everyone in my office has now started to use it!</li>
    <li> My mom saw Duri advertized in a fashion magazine and bought me my first bottle 1.5 years ago.  I have been using it ever since.  For the first time ever I have nails - LONG, beautiful, real nails. Nails that I actually have to cut down because they are too long!  I threw away about 10 bottles of everything else I had tried which never worked.  Duri is amazing.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended Rejuvacote, and although I was skeptical, I decided to try it.  After only 2-3 weeks, my nails are longer than they&#x27;ve been since I was a teen.  They&#x27;re not peeling, and they aren&#x27;t splitting at the ridges.  Nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried has yielded this result.  I&#x27;m happy and amazed!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for long, but I think it is going to work for me. My nails were in such bad shape from wearing acrylics for years. It&#x27;s going to take awhile to get them grown out and get rid of all this mistreated nail surface, but even at that, this product is strengthening them enough so that they aren&#x27;t tearing clear down like they normally do. So far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It has done wonders for my thin, split peeling nails.  HOWEVER...  USER BEWARE.  Am I the only one out there who experiences pain in the fingertips after application ? The pain is identical to not wearing gloves on a really cold day and your fingers throb with pain.  This sensation lasts for about 5 min. then goes away.  I am concerned  that there is something in this product that is dangerous and is being absorbed into our blood stream.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is a miracle.  I have always had thin nails that peel and rip and they just got worse after wearing acrylic for a few years.  My manicurist suggested rejuvacote (and used it on me in the salon).  Within 3 weeks my nails have grown so much that I had to shorten them in order to type.  They are long, strong and beautiful.  I&#x27;m telling all my friends about this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  My nails certainly look better and they are so much stronger,  I can really notice a difference.  I will certainly purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I purchased Duri Rejuvacote for my very thin nails.  It&#x27;s fantastic.  No more breakage.  I sure would recommend it.  Very good price.</li>
    <li> My nail tech. recommended this product after getting my acrylics off of many years wearing them.  They were in bad shape, peeling and just jaggered for 3 months.  I read the reviews before purchasing this and decided to try it.  In the reviews one or two people stated that the product was burning their nails.  I didn&#x27;t feel that at all.  After using rejuvacote for about 4 weeks now, I think it could be working.  My nails seem a bit better and stronger.  It&#x27;s not a miracle, but I think it is a decent product.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product and they fell through.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month.  It did not work for me.  My nails are still weak and peeling.  I really wish I could find something that lived up to its claims, but I haven&#x27;t yet.</li>
    <li> This is the first nail hardener that has ever worked for me.  My friend recommended Duri Rejuvacote  after I complained about my nails.  I didn&#x27;t like what fake acrylic nails did to my nails so I stopped getting them &amp; was resigned to having soft, cracked, stubby nails.  After using Duri Rejuvacote for a week, my nails were noticeably improved.  Now, they are beautiful &amp; I actually have to trim them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now, and while I do think it helps nails grow stronger, I don&#x27;t really think it makes your nails grow any faster than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to bite my nails as a habit, and when I stopped biting I decided to buy this product in the hopes that my nails would grow faster and I&#x27;d get the satisfaction of having longer, nicer looking nails sooner. I used it the way that the packaging recommended, (I did get sort of a tingling when I first used it, I&#x27;m assuming because I had really weak nails), but I don&#x27;t feel like they grew any faster than they normally would have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I didn&#x27;t really get the result I&#x27;d hoped for, I still think this is a good product. Now I use it as a base coat for when I&#x27;m applying nail color. I think my nails are a lot stronger, but really the best thing to do when trying to grow your nails is just to be patient and make sure you&#x27;re eating a healthy diet.</li>
    <li> Duri makes a great product for ones nails.  Whether you wear it on the clean nail or on top of the polish it does a great job.  I will be ordering many more bottles and recommending it to others.</li>
    <li> I never thought that my nails will grow so much and be strong at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a product to stop using fake nails, this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;I have buy so many and give it to my friends, they cannot believe how healthy and beautiful their nails are.&lt;br /&gt;is worth it to buy it... trust me :-)</li>
    <li> I began using this product 2 weeks ago and see no difference. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My sister who has never had nails in her life told me about this product. She now,  66 years sent me a pictures of her hands and I was shocked to see she had 10 beautiful nails. So I decided to give it a try. By the end of the second week applying a coat everyday my nails were stronger, no more splitting, and were growing evenly. I am now on my second bottle and have a third in the medicine cabinet. I hope that all of you that want nails try it because it works. You MUST put a thin coat on everyday for it to work and maintain strength. It dries fast and the only negatives are the bottle gets gouged up around the top which needs to be kept clean with a paper towel and acetone and half way through the bottle you might need to add a few drops of acetone to thin back the nail polish consistency. Give it a try it is worth every cent!</li>
    <li> I have never been able to grow nails.  Now I have nice long nails that do not break.  I love this stuff.  Try it,  you will like it too.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other products for my britle nails but was convinced that nothing will help. Then my mom recommended this one to me, and when I saw how much her nails improved, I gave it a try. I was hooked on it ever since. It really does help nails grow, and it is really great quality and helps the polish dry faster and look really shiny. You have to use it everyday at first to see results, and then you can use it less often. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like this product and will continue use of it, but sometimes it peels off my nails. This product with nail, hair, and skin vitamins you will see a growth in your nails.</li>
    <li> Best top coat EVER!!!!  and I mean EVER!!  manis and pedis will last and last when you use this!  Great for nails that are not strong.  It works like magic.</li>
    <li> Started using after removing nail tips and my own nails were stronger and longer than ever, then I made the mistake of using a gel overlay--now I&#x27;m back to Rejuvacote regularly until my nails grow back strong and long.</li>
    <li> My daughter was to married, my nails were brittle so i kept them short. When I mentioned how I would like to have some nails for the wedding to some friends, one of them had recommended this product. Both of my daughters and myself used it for two months and we had great nails for the wedding! just follow the directions. Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  First time in years to have strong nails.  Love it.  Have recommended  it to many friends..  Wish it was in stores.</li>
    <li> Tried so many and this one is the best. If you follow the 7 day treatment it will work well for you!!!  10 times better than the expensive brands !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this anytime I remove my acrylics and it works wonders to being my nails back to life. I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
    <li> So yea i heard this product was great. Too bad i didnt get to try it! It was all dry and spilled and hardened i just threw it away. Not well shipped. Beware!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with it.  Other Sally products I have used the seem to peel off.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> It works. I don&#x27;t use anything else for my nail growth and hardner.</li>
    <li> After one use when tightening the cap, the bottle broke in my hands. Of course I couldn&#x27;t return a broken bottle. I will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have always had problem nails, could never get them to grow, always peeled then broke so I always ended up getting acrylic tips on to make my nails look nice! I did this for years so of course it damaged my already problem nails tremendously. I came across Duri Rejuvacote online and read such great reviews I figured &#x27;why not&#x27;, I&#x27;ve tried everything else! I purchased the cuticle oil, Rejuvacote &amp; Miracote top coat. Used them pretty regularly and what a difference....FINALLY something that worked! My cuticles are no longer torn and ripped up AND I actually have length to my nails for the first time in my life! This is the only product that EVER WORKED FOR ME! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> love long, natural nails?  mine were cracking,  peeling, and breaking.  Within weeks of using  Rejuvicote, they became long and strong. Receive constant compliments! Never be w/out it!!</li>
    <li> i CAN&#x27;T SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.  IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY&lt;br /&gt;NAIL TECH WHEN I TOOK MY NAILS OFF TO GIVE THEM A REST.  THAT WAS OVER A YEAR&lt;br /&gt;AGO AND MY NAILS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND LONG.  EVERYONE THINKS THEY ARE REAL&lt;br /&gt;BECAUSE THEY ARE SO PRETTY AND STRONG. I DO PUT A COAT ON EVERY DAY AND&lt;br /&gt;WOILDN&#x27;T BE WITHOUT IT. MY NAIL TECH LOST A CUSTOMER AND WON&#x27;T TELL ANYONE&lt;br /&gt;ELSE ABOUT IT BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ANY BUSINESS.  A GREAT PRODUCT,&lt;br /&gt;YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> I love this product and can not grow nails with out it.  I love this product and can not grow nails with out it.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a nail professional and it does work for me.  Without this,my nails do not seem to grow.</li>
    <li> My nails haven&#x27;t looked this good in years! I&#x27;m actually having to file them down. That&#x27;s a first for me.</li>
    <li> The bottle in this picture is the product I know and have been using for years. The one I received in the mail looks like a bootleg and wasn&#x27;t made by the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; DURI. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while and know what the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; bottle looks like. The writing on the bottle has a different font which makes me believe this product is FAKE. I will not be ordering this product online anymore. I will keep paying my $14 for the REAL THING.</li>
