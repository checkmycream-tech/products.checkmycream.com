      <li>Very light, pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>:) Will update if it helps in that department!</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite hand creams!</li>
      <li>Nice non-greasy hand lotion..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many moisturizers, some are good (like AHAVA)</li>
      <li>Silky hands, nice smell, quality ingredients.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hand lotions and this is the absolute best.  </li>
      <li>It smells pleasant, good on the whole body, but not the HANDS!</li>
      <li>I have tried 100&#x27;s of lotion and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>The item got to me quickly and was definitely of good quality.</li>
      <li>I love this hand lotion.</li>
      <li>can safely call this a hand miracle</li>
      <li>but NOTHING can compare to the IMMEDIATE PHENOMENAL RESULTS in Gardener&#x27;s Hand</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for over 10 years and continue to be pleased with both the texture of the cream and the results.  </li>
      <li>Love love love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Okay beyond that, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s miraculously softened my cuticles or anything, but it&#x27;s pretty good stuff</li>
      <li>I love the feel of this lotion as it goes on, and I love love love the scent of it, fresh like the garden after a rain.</li>
      <li>I use it on my hands too, but really was hoping it would be good for my hands.</li>
      <li>I originally bought it as a gift fir my sister who love to garden and thought I would try some to see what it was like.  </li>
      <li>The scent is light and citrusy as well.</li>
      <li>This lotion is so silky smooth and leaves my hands feeling silky smooth even after a morning in the garden or cleaning house.</li>
      <li>Best for dry cracked hands ever!!!!!</li>
      <li>Light and non-greasy and cool on the hands.  </li>
      <li>It has a light, citrus smell, absorbs quickly into the skin and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
      <li>The light scent is really pleasant and unisex too -- slightly herbal and lemony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really keeps my hands nice and soft.</li>
      <li>If your hand are very dry you may have to apply twice, but it really does a good job.</li>
      <li>It absorbs very fast and leaves no greasy residue.</li>
      <li>I plan to buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>I received my first tube as a gift.  </li>
      <li>This product really comes through in that regard!  </li>
      <li>This is good for knee&#x27;s, elbow&#x27;s, and almost over all the body; however, I got it for my hands as they stay cracked and bleeding year round.</li>
      <li>/&gt;What makes THIS PRODUCT DIFFERENT from the others is how it goes on (with a lovely scent) and as soon as you rub the lotion on your hands, it literally creates a \\&quot;hand glove\\&quot; of pure protective immediately soothing, immediate repairing lotion and with all natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
      <li>my husband really likes this hand lotion.</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t remember how I came across it - I think I bought it at Whole Foods Market)</li>
      <li>Very hydrating without that greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>YOU HANDS REALLY NEED</li>
      <li>Wow I&#x27;m really focusing on greasiness.</li>
      <li>I am a professional horticulturist and my hands really take a beating regardless of the season.  </li>
      <li>(it goes on like a cream and dries soft and wax-like) that will prevent or help cure skin cracks.</li>
      <li>and within SECONDS I RECEIVED IMMEDIATE RELIEF, AND MY HANDS ARE SOOOO SOFT - FROM ONE USE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this lotion, especially for winter use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am positive anyone who tries this will be as amazed as I</li>
      <li>It really helps put the moisture back into your hands and helps with rough cracked skin.</li>
      <li>Makes very dry hands baby soft again</li>

<li> Trades people and those who work outside in the cold and dry of Winter:  </li>
<li> It smoothes and seals in moisture without being too greasy or thick.</li>
<li> Not a fan of the scent though :(</li>

    <li> Trades people and those who work outside in the cold and dry of Winter:  This is the best &#x27;cream&#x27; (it goes on like a cream and dries soft and wax-like) that will prevent or help cure skin cracks. Put on your thumb and finger ends at bedtime.  It remains on your hands all night.  Will not rub off on your bed clothes when dry.  Washing in the morning with soap can take it off .  If your skin cracks are serious - open to red tissue - use Superglue to seal the cuts during the day for a few days will speed the healing.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  This is a reorder.  I received my first tube as a gift.  This lotion is so silky smooth and leaves my hands feeling silky smooth even after a morning in the garden or cleaning house.</li>
    <li> There are thousands of hand lotion products on the market so what makes this one exceptional?  I am a professional horticulturist and my hands really take a beating regardless of the season.  I need a moisturizer that does not linger on the skin as a greasy film and yet smoothes and sooths that damaged skin.  This product really comes through in that regard!  The scent is light and citrusy as well. This is a good product for either men or women.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. I have tried 100&#x27;s of lotion and this is by far the best. Silky hands, nice smell, quality ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this lotion as it goes on, and I love love love the scent of it, fresh like the garden after a rain.</li>
    <li> My wife got some of this lotion for a girlfriends birthday and tried some. She immediately ordered some for herself, when she got home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many moisturizers, some are good (like AHAVA) but NOTHING can compare to the IMMEDIATE PHENOMENAL RESULTS in Gardener&#x27;s Hand Repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week my hands were REALLY dry - from household cleaning detergents. They were chafed and they hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remembered I had this product (I don&#x27;t remember how I came across it - I think I bought it at Whole Foods Market) and within SECONDS I RECEIVED IMMEDIATE RELIEF, AND MY HANDS ARE SOOOO SOFT - FROM ONE USE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I carry it in my purse and won&#x27;t use another hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes THIS PRODUCT DIFFERENT from the others is how it goes on (with a lovely scent) and as soon as you rub the lotion on your hands, it literally creates a \\&quot;hand glove\\&quot; of pure protective immediately soothing, immediate repairing lotion and with all natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HANDS REALLY NEED HELP - GET THIS PRODUCT! Now, I Carry this in my purse, and I don&#x27;t waste time with the other hand lotions after EXPERIENCING THIS ONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the dry, chafed, raw skin on my hands was GONE in One Use!&lt;br /&gt;I can safely call this a hand miracle lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am positive anyone who tries this will be as amazed as I am.&lt;br /&gt;If you hands need help - THIS IS THE BEST ON EARTH!</li>
    <li> This is good for knee&#x27;s, elbow&#x27;s, and almost over all the body; however, I got it for my hands as they stay cracked and bleeding year round. Now, wish I had gotten the stuff advertised on TV. It smells pleasant, good on the whole body, but not the HANDS! I use it on my hands too, but really was hoping it would be good for my hands. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> my husband really likes this hand lotion. It&#x27;s non-greasy and does a good job of healing cracked knuckles. He&#x27;s been using this product for several years.</li>
    <li> Makes very dry hands baby soft again</li>
    <li> Nice non-greasy hand lotion.. Not a fan of the scent though :(</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years and continue to be pleased with both the texture of the cream and the results.  My skin is very dry and soaks this cream up very quickly, with no oily residue left behind.</li>
    <li> My local store stopped carrying this.  I was relieved to find it on Amazon...the product is great for chapped fingertips (my problem).  In a couple of days, the cracks smoothed out.  I use it regularly to keep my hands and fingertips smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cb</li>
    <li> Very hydrating without that greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I searched for months to find it again.  And of course Amazon had it.  I went to numerous stores.  But back to the product.  It is wonderful.  Light and non-greasy and cool on the hands.  I just think it is the BEST.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hand lotions and this is the absolute best.  I originally bought it as a gift fir my sister who love to garden and thought I would try some to see what it was like.  Now I have to buy another one for her!</li>
    <li> Great product. Very light, pleasant fragrance. Soothing to my dry hand. Came across this at a local TJ max cost 1/3 of amazon price. Of course one might argue the freshness of the product. At the bottom line I would buy again!</li>
    <li> My uncle, who works on a printing press and puts his hands through the wringer 5 days a week, swears by this cream and got me hooked on it when I was visiting in December. It smoothes and seals in moisture without being too greasy or thick. It soaks in within a few minutes, which I love, but also leaves a lasting moisturized feel behind. The light scent is really pleasant and unisex too -- slightly herbal and lemony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With continued use I have found it improves the texture of my skin as well (undoubtedly due to the exfoliating action of the alpha hydroxy complex) and I&#x27;ve never found it irritating, probably thanks to the colloidal oatmeal and aloe vera it contains. Highly recommend this lotion, especially for winter use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I&#x27;m going to start using it on my feet at night under a pair of Earth Therapeutics Aloe-Infused Socks to see if I can soften my scratchy heels too. :) Will update if it helps in that department!</li>
    <li> This hand cream is the best I have ever tried. I would recommend this product to anyone. I plan to buy more in the future. It really helps put the moisture back into your hands and helps with rough cracked skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t entirely non-greasy, so I try not to use it at work so it doesn&#x27;t transfer onto my laptop. I typically use it before bed due to the slight graesiness. It isn&#x27;t THAT greasy, but I&#x27;ve tried about 10 different hand lotions so I&#x27;m just saying I&#x27;ve experienced lotions that are more non-greasy than this one. I&#x27;ve also experienced greasier lotions. Wow I&#x27;m really focusing on greasiness. Okay beyond that, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s miraculously softened my cuticles or anything, but it&#x27;s pretty good stuff and it truly leaves my hands feeling moisturized. I don&#x27;t feel the need to keep reapplying.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite hand creams! It really keeps my hands nice and soft. The item got to me quickly and was definitely of good quality. Will use vendor again.</li>
    <li> She asked for it specifically for her birthday and if I&#x27;m good, she lets me use it after I&#x27;ve been in the garden as well.</li>
    <li> Best for dry cracked hands ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion works very well for hands that are very dry and tend to crack from heavy use. It has a light, citrus smell, absorbs quickly into the skin and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this hand lotion. It absorbs very fast and leaves no greasy residue. If your hand are very dry you may have to apply twice, but it really does a good job.</li>
