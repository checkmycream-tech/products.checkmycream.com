      <li>Tea tree oil is amazing.</li>
      <li>This works amazing for me.</li>
      <li>This is amazing for me.</li>
      <li>This is amazing moisturizer.</li>
      <li>(I used up a pump bottle of the matching cleanser and liked it a lot), but every time I use this it burns and stings my face.  </li>
      <li>Overall, this is a wonderful product from a really great skin care line.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely fair and prone to many skin imbalances.  </li>
      <li>It smell nice &amp; tingles when applied.</li>
      <li>And as my Acne comes in cycles I am nearing the end, and I am very pleased with most of the products I&#x27;ve purchased here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is honestly the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve had so far.  </li>
      <li>The Very Clear Problem Skin Moisturizer has created the perfect balance for me.</li>
      <li>It smells very strongly of tea tree oil</li>
      <li>- add this one to my most favorite!</li>
      <li>Love the product, love the price!</li>
      <li>I was mixing my own tea tree oil into a moisturizer but this works better.</li>
      <li>The consistency is perfect and spreads out very evenly and easily.</li>
      <li>I have tried many brands in market, Clinique, Lancome, Estee Lauder, Vichy, Neutrogena, and all the time, by noon my face was shining, but this moisturizer is amazing, it keeps my skin balanced, of course at night I am having shine in my face, but the oil balance effect is better.</li>
      <li>To be honest my skin looks a lot better and is tighter and more toned.</li>
      <li>I liked it, but It would irritated more my blisters and create more.  </li>
      <li>One jar lasts me 9-12 months! :)</li>
      <li>Most of it is hormonal, although probably genetic too.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It is not as moisturizing as I need, however I basically use it as a spot treatment on my chin and forehead where I tend to break out and love it for that purpose.</li>
      <li>I love Derma-E products.</li>
      <li>The smell is overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>The tea tree oil smell is beyond overwhelming and is disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I also have more cyst like acne which may be why it did not work as well for me.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE them all.</li>
      <li>This product is just okay.</li>
      <li>Benzoyl Peroxide works better but it has side effects</li>
      <li>I have never been able to find one that doesn&#x27;t break me out, none of the ones formulated for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; or that promise to be non comedogenic have ever worked.</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer</li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>I have been using it morning and night and almost all of my acne has disappeared and scars are healing (on top of using their spot treatment).  </li>
      <li>I love all of the Derma e products</li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>Some people don&#x27;t like the smell - it smells like tea tree oil - kind of clean and medicinal.</li>
      <li>I love the tea tree smell and it honestly makes my skin look great in the morning- smooth and clear.</li>
      <li>I pair it with pure tree tea oil at night, and although I don&#x27;t have supremely smooth skin now, I&#x27;m fairly happy with it.</li>
      <li>Also, great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes better than neutrogena oil free.  </li>
      <li>I love the clean smell.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the smell wasn&#x27;t so strong.</li>
      <li>Please note, that it DOES have a strong smell.  </li>
      <li>so if you don&#x27;t like strong smelling stuff on your face this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>I truly love the tea tree oil smell because it&#x27;s so earthy and cool, but it might not be for every taste.  </li>
      <li>Hands down the best moisturizer for acne.</li>
      <li>The texture was fine</li>
      <li>Today I left the house makeup free and my skin felt great.</li>
      <li>All natural ingredients of superior quality.  </li>
      <li>Derma E has really good and natural products that I feel comfortable using.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have major acne, but it can be an issue and this product has been the best solution so far.</li>
      <li>I use very little and it hydrates great!</li>
      <li>Smell is great (which doesn&#x27;t stay long).</li>
      <li>The bottle doesn&#x27;t match the original.</li>
      <li>Those are both amazing natural oils for acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>I have been a fan of Derma E products for years now and have found most of their products work very well.</li>
      <li>If you are drinking, try to avoid using this around your mouth until bedtime or you may get a mouth full of tea tree oil flavor.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is like Sweet salvation in a f-in jar.</li>
      <li>I bought this cream because i wanted a good moisturizing cream for my acne prone and dry skin.</li>
      <li>I like the smell, but the smell is pretty strong for the first 15 mins</li>
      <li>It has a really nice fresh smell from the tea tree oil, and even though it is an acne product, it is still very moisturizing and makes my skin very soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I also like that it has willow bark which seems to calm the skin a lot.</li>
      <li>A bit pricy, but worth it.</li>
      <li>so I was looking for a cream that would clear up the breakouts and prevent more.</li>
      <li>, I ordered this online right away</li>
      <li>It also has a small amount of tea tree oil in it so it has an antibiotic quality that is great for acne and shrinking pours.</li>
      <li>When you first put it on your face you think it&#x27;s going to be way too thick, but once it is rubbed in it dries quickly and feels great.</li>
      <li>The only downfall is there is no sunscreen, but that&#x27;s fine as my face make-up takes care of that!</li>
      <li>I use this twice daily: by itself in the morning under my makeup, and then also at night, but at night I mix it with the Derma E Age-Defying Creme (in a purple jar) to get more moisturizing power.</li>
      <li>Works great , smells icky but eases up in a couple of minutes.</li>
      <li>I tried so many different acne products</li>
      <li>Works exactly as it says &amp;#34;Clear Problem Skin&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, my face was sort of reddish, but that didn&#x27;t seem to happen again.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just started using a few days ago, and I don&#x27;t really want to jinx it, but so far has worked pretty good. I can tell that the break outs that I do get heal a little faster so far. I&#x27;ve been using Cereve recommended by my dermatologist for a really long time &amp; never saw too big of a difference with that. So hopefully based on previous reviews of this product I will keep seeing results.</li>
    <li> Clears acne and moisturizes at the same time! If you have combo skin, like me, this product will reduce the amount of oil your skin produces over time (eliminating breakouts)... love it! And way cheaper through Amazon than other retail stores I&#x27;ve found it in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering acne for 8 years and I&#x27;m 20 now. I first used proactiv solutions then switched to clean and clear, then University Medicals Acne-Free 3 step system, and tried so many different products after that. I tried so many different acne products I don&#x27;t remember which one I&#x27;ve tried. None of them seem to work. I researched about benzoyl peroxide and found out that it might cause cancer and also MAKES MY SKIN DRY FOR 8 YEARS EVEN WITH MOISTERIZER!!!!! I hope I don&#x27;t get cancer. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m am using natural products for acne. And Unfortunately, it made no difference. Benzoyl Peroxide works better but it has side effects so I don&#x27;t want to go back to it or else I&#x27;ll start over. Ok back to reviewing this product. If you have oily skin, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!! It makes your skin look oily and feel greasy. and last of all I break out even worse. it is not worth the money and expensive. it might work for people with very dry skin with blemishes. so right now I am using MyChelle Clear Skin Serum. Very expensive and heard great reviews about it. i hope it works.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the transformation of my skin since I received this 2 weeks ago.  I have been using it morning and night and almost all of my acne has disappeared and scars are healing (on top of using their spot treatment).  I love all of the Derma e products - add this one to my most favorite!</li>
    <li> I actually found this product at the store.  I was looking for something natural that would not irritate my very sensitive skin.  The organic ingredients are promising.  I truly love the tea tree oil smell because it&#x27;s so earthy and cool, but it might not be for every taste.  This is honestly the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve had so far.  It keeps the dry areas around my nose and chin moisturized and soaks up the oil on the cheeks and forehead.  I did not find it greasy at all.  After it absorbs in, you don&#x27;t seem to find traces of it everywhere.  I wear it under makeup.  It&#x27;s actually made my particular skin better, especially in the horrible humidity and heat.  My skin is looking younger.  I have used it around my eyes with no problems, although the tea tree smell would indicate otherwise, it doesn&#x27;t seem harsh.  The first time I used it, my face was sort of reddish, but that didn&#x27;t seem to happen again.  It&#x27;s cleared and prevented any summer and sweat-induced breakouts from appearing.  If you are drinking, try to avoid using this around your mouth until bedtime or you may get a mouth full of tea tree oil flavor.  I really love this product, but I did see the other reviews and understand this may not do the same for all skin types.  I&#x27;m extremely fair and prone to many skin imbalances.  The Very Clear Problem Skin Moisturizer has created the perfect balance for me.</li>
    <li> My skin was initially red on the first application of this product, but is adjusting fine now. It leaves your skin soft and fresh looking. The problem is the SMELL. It is TERRIBLE until it is fully absorbed. The tea tree oil smell is beyond overwhelming and is disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this a 5 star rating if the smell wasn&#x27;t so devastating</li>
    <li> This cream won&#x27;t work any miracles, but it&#x27;s a nice, light moisturizer, and my face does seem less irritated and blotchy now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks. I pair it with pure tree tea oil at night, and although I don&#x27;t have supremely smooth skin now, I&#x27;m fairly happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Derma E products for years now and have found most of their products work very well. My skin started breaking out more recently after trying some new Vitamin C serum so I was looking for a cream that would clear up the breakouts and prevent more. This seems to work fairly well and after seven days of use I now have clear skin. I like that the cream is not heavy, absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t promote oily skin. I&#x27;m using it in the morning and at night. To be honest my skin looks a lot better and is tighter and more toned. I think it has something to do with the essential oils in this product. This has tea tree, rosewood, lavender and chamomile in it. I also like that it has willow bark which seems to calm the skin a lot. Today I left the house makeup free and my skin felt great. I&#x27;d recommend this for oily or combination skin. I was mixing my own tea tree oil into a moisturizer but this works better. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> Moisturizes very well and has helped with my acne.  You can actually feel it working. Have purchased before and will continue purchasing.</li>
    <li> I love Derma E products!!! If you are looking for a new skin care line to try, you need to give Derma E a shot!! I have 4 of their products so far and I LOVE them all. I especially like that their acne-fighting products contain tea tree oil and/or oregano oil. Those are both amazing natural oils for acne-prone skin. This specific moisturizer is one of my favorites. It has a really nice fresh smell from the tea tree oil, and even though it is an acne product, it is still very moisturizing and makes my skin very soft and hydrated. The consistency is perfect and spreads out very evenly and easily. I use this twice daily: by itself in the morning under my makeup, and then also at night, but at night I mix it with the Derma E Age-Defying Creme (in a purple jar) to get more moisturizing power. Overall, this is a wonderful product from a really great skin care line. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I think this was a fake. I have bought this product many times from the actual company and I had the last bits of my old bottle left and when I opened the new one it smelled differently and had a slightly different consistency. I was disappointed to discover that amazon would be selling something that was not the actual beauty product. I wish it was real so I could repurchase.</li>
    <li> When you first put it on your face you think it&#x27;s going to be way too thick, but once it is rubbed in it dries quickly and feels great. It is definitely moisturizing but the moist feeling does not stay for more than a few seconds. Makeup sits nicely for long periods of time on top of this moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t make your face look oily at the end of the day, which is common with other products.</li>
    <li> Was a boon to my skin. I use it everyday and would not want to be w/o it. All of derma e products are superior to all that chemical based, animal testing junk on the market.</li>
    <li> This smells really bad, I don&#x27;t think I can purchase it again :(</li>
    <li> This product is just okay.</li>
    <li> This is amazing moisturizer. I love it, it is perfect for people with oily skin, it moisturizes but isn&#x27;t greasy. Tea tree oil is amazing.</li>
    <li> Works great , smells icky but eases up in a couple of minutes.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Really great for blimished skin. It smell nice &amp; tingles when applied.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a teen who has had consistent breakouts on their face for a of couple years.  They were using an antibiotic cream to help control the breakouts.  This person complained that their face was also dry. They&#x27;ve been using the derma e cream for the last month without using the antibiotic and their breakouts have subsided and skin is no longer dry.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this moisturizer! I have never been able to find one that doesn&#x27;t break me out, none of the ones formulated for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; or that promise to be non comedogenic have ever worked. The only downfall is there is no sunscreen, but that&#x27;s fine as my face make-up takes care of that!</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the planet :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll use this for a long time. I tried a lot of lotions for my face and nothing worked as well as this. I don&#x27;t have major acne, but it can be an issue and this product has been the best solution so far.</li>
    <li> Very good for oily, acne prone skin.  I love the clean smell.  Moisturizes better than neutrogena oil free.  My daughters use it too.  A bit pricy, but worth it.</li>
    <li> A great product.  All natural ingredients of superior quality.  Keeps my face looking as fresh and blemish free as any product I have used in the past and for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> This seems to help minimize my breakouts, though I still get them due to hormones, heat (it&#x27;s summer!) and stress. Not the prettiest smell.</li>
    <li> Love the product, love the price!</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this cream would do as a night cream for my mature, combination skin. The texture was fine but I could not get past the heavy smell of the tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is thick, and smells like tea tree oil (not too strong). It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy, and i&#x27;ve only been using a little bit, but it has reduced the shine on my face significantly. I plan on trying out the rest of this line. Derma E has really good and natural products that I feel comfortable using.</li>
    <li> This works amazing for me.</li>
    <li> This lotion helped with my dry skin, but I didn&#x27;t see a drastic change in my acne. I also have more cyst like acne which may be why it did not work as well for me.  However, it did not necessarily work on what I wanted it to.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 6 months now and only use it where I tend to break out and it has helped immensely with my acne. It is not as moisturizing as I need, however I basically use it as a spot treatment on my chin and forehead where I tend to break out and love it for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert, so it could be that my face is just THAT dry, but the moment i put this on my face, my skin sucks it up and then itches. And no matter how much I put on, it just gets sucked up again. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to work, but I&#x27;m used to using moisturizers that leave my face feeling moisturized, and not the opposite.</li>
    <li> This is a great night time moisturizer. I love the tea tree smell and it honestly makes my skin look great in the morning- smooth and clear. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it in the morning, since it&#x27;s a think cream my makeup didn&#x27;t go on as well. Definitely recommend this cream!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this. It smells very strongly of tea tree oil and I do not like that smell. The smell does not last after its dried however, so I can tolerate putting it on. The other big problem I have with it though is that its not very moisturizing... I live at 7,000 ft in a very dry environment and while I do have acne, I need a decent moisturizer. I can use this once a day as long as I put on a thicker moisturizer at night but otherwise my skin gets too dry. I also have to use a much larger amount than other moisturizers so it doesn&#x27;t last as long as expected. Between that and the smell, I will not be purchasing this product again. The one good thing is I did not notice any worsening of acne. It has gotten slightly better but I&#x27;m on some medications and am not sure whether it was those or this cream.</li>
    <li> Great lotion- I have super dry, sensative skin that is acne prone. The tea tree in this lotion does a GREAT job of preventing break outs (especially the large, painful, cystic kind-) without clogging pores. I started using it on my upper back too because it works better than the Rx the Dermatologist gave me! Doesnt have any of the anti-aging properties of other lotions, but does what it says its going to do, so Im sticking with it for now!</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands in market, Clinique, Lancome, Estee Lauder, Vichy, Neutrogena, and all the time, by noon my face was shining, but this moisturizer is amazing, it keeps my skin balanced, of course at night I am having shine in my face, but the oil balance effect is better. I have order my second one.. so I am happy with this moiturizer, besides, if there is a prone comming, I just wear my moisturizer and next day the prone is dry... great&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Smell is strong but product is great! I love Derma-E products. This one does not disappoint. Great for all kinds of skin problems - blemishes, rashes, irritation...</li>
    <li> My skin looks the same before and after . Still lots of acne. Not healing at all.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It&#x27;s thick, not oily, and it does moisturize well. I use it at night. It also has a small amount of tea tree oil in it so it has an antibiotic quality that is great for acne and shrinking pours.</li>
    <li> It made my acne worse.</li>
    <li> Anyone who has problem skin, knows that there will be a point in time when you OD on the drying agents and thus end up with dry peeling skin.... This is not appealing at all! I could see this happening to my skin and as it is apart of the healing process with Acne it can also be uncomfortable. I have been using tea tree oil as a part of my daily regiment so the smell of this thick cream isn&#x27;t harsh at all to my senses. This cream is soothing, and very thick, has tea tree oil, as well as willow bark. What I recommend is using this at night to soften and remoisturize your skin. If you use too much of this it can cake up as it is a very thick cream, so alil goes a long way. What I typically do in the day is take alil of this cream and mix it with my Olay day moisturize with SPF. It&#x27;s make my skin supple again, and it has helped with some of my inflammation.. And as my Acne comes in cycles I am nearing the end, and I am very pleased with most of the products I&#x27;ve purchased here on Amazon. I have also been pretty impressed with the Derma E products.</li>
    <li> BOOTLEG!!! The bottle doesn&#x27;t match the original. The label has been recreated and doesn&#x27;t match the images online or the one sold in Whole Foods. The smell of this one is different as well. Who knows what&#x27;s actually in it. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> If your looking for a moisturizer for your skin but don&#x27;t want something greasy, than this is it.  Also, great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for clearing up my skin. I am writing this review three weeks after purchase and I use it twice a day and I have not seen any improvements.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been desperately searching for a reliable moisturizer for my troubled, sensitive, combination, acne prone skin for YEARS. This is it. This stuff is like Sweet salvation in a f-in jar. Definitely give this one a shot but do keep it away from your eyes, obviously.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best moisturizer for acne. Other products are too harsh and cause irritation and more oil production because they dry out my skin. Rub in well because it is thick.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I wanted a face moisturizer without salicylic acid for acne-prone skin. The one I bought before lasted over a year. I used a little bit, only when I felt that my skin is dry. Whenever I changed to other creams, my skin didn&#x27;t like the change and my acne came back. This one has controlled my acne. I presume because of the tea tree.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because i wanted a good moisturizing cream for my acne prone and dry skin. I have been using this cream since a week and believe me this cream did wonders to my skin. Breakouts are in control, blemishes are fading, skin is well moisturized. Smell is great (which doesn&#x27;t stay long). Works exactly as it says &amp;#34;Clear Problem Skin&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin with some acne and redness. This is amazing for me. It moisturizes like no other and gets rid of all of my redness and acne. It couldn&#x27;t be more perfect (for me). I don&#x27;t know how it would work for any other skin type but if you have a similar skin type to mine than give it a try! I have used so many other moisturizers and they either break me out or dont give enough moisture but this just balances everything out. My skin is moisturized, acne and redness gone. Seriously my skin has never looked so good in my life. And obviously the all natural ingredients are a MUST! I use this after using trader joe&#x27;s tee tree oil face wash. I&#x27;ve been using this for a while, just ordered my 3rd jar.</li>
    <li> I have combination, sensitive, red, acne prone skin. Acne creams work for me but leave my skin red and dry. I use this with retinols, salicylic acid, etc. and this takes the redness and flaking away without breaking me out. It is a heavier cream - you only need a tiny bit- but it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. The jar has lasted me a long time, so don&#x27;t let the price scare you off. Some people don&#x27;t like the smell - it smells like tea tree oil - kind of clean and medicinal. I like the smell, but the smell is pretty strong for the first 15 mins so if you don&#x27;t like strong smelling stuff on your face this isn&#x27;t for you. I&#x27;m 32, and I can&#x27;t imaging using this heavy of a cream in my teens. Its good for drier skin.</li>
    <li> Non greasy and great for any skin type. Just do not put too much on. I use very little and it hydrates great! One jar lasts me 9-12 months! :)</li>
    <li> Nice thick moisturizer that is great to use on skin without feeling heavy. I don&#x27;t have severe skin issues or acne, so I can&#x27;t address how well it works on those issues, but it does help keep minor blemishes at bay.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works great.  With the super cold and dry weather we&#x27;ve had it has done wonders to keep me from being dry and flaky. Please note, that it DOES have a strong smell.  It dissipates after 5-10 minutes, but until that time, you will smell like a green pond.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the smell wasn&#x27;t so strong.</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuff is great. I&#x27;m 50+, have tried numerous moisturizers, but have not stuck with any of them. I&#x27;ll stick with this one though. My skin is clear (I would occasionally have mild acne), blemishes have cleared up, and my skin looks better than it has in years. I use this every other day, alternating with derma e anti-wrinkle vitamin A Retinyl Palmitate Creme. I use their hydrating night cream every evening. I swear my skin looks years younger.</li>
    <li> I live in a small town and in the store we only had the skin brightening Derma E moisturizer and I got it out of disparity knowing I have acne prone skin but really needing moisturizer, and I broke out of course, I ordered this online right away and Once I was back on it My skin cleared up again. Love this stuff. And its VEGAN so win win.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin with an oily t-zone and dryer cheeks.  When I tried using this product it burned and stung my face.  I tried it a few times because  I really wanted to like it (I used up a pump bottle of the matching cleanser and liked it a lot), but every time I use this it burns and stings my face.  It is also very unpleasant to put on because it is very thick and almost dry-ish when you try to apply it, so it doesn&#x27;t soak in very well and if you reapply over somewhere you have already used it, then it sort of balls up and comes off like sunscreen.  It did not notice it moisturizing at all, and I think may have made my face drier.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so it may work better for someone else, but I would not recommend it.  I missed the window to return this so I will probably have to throw it out.  I would normally use it up even if I didn&#x27;t care for it, but this burns too much to use.</li>
    <li> I like that I can smell the natural ingredients used in this moisturizer (like tree tea oil), but it quickly drys as soon as I apply on my face. I do not have any issues with dry skin, more of an oily/normal combination skin. I use it at night after cleansing, apply a sun screen/ moisturizer during the day. Probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> For months my wife had a dry patch on her face which she couldn&#x27;t get rid of. This product solved the problem in just two days.</li>
    <li> I tried the product. I liked it, but It would irritated more my blisters and create more.  But I like natural product.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years and it works better than prescription products.  I use it on areas prone to acne such as my chin as spot treatment and general area for prevention.  I also like that it is all natural unlike prescription products that are harsh to your skin.</li>
    <li> Goes on quite well, not greasy at all and has helped heal several small pimples quickly. Love all Deram E products!</li>
    <li> Derma E very clear moisturizer contains a lot of tea tree oil.  The smell is overwhelming.  I&#x27;ve had suspicions that I was allergic to tea tree oil in the past because I used it on my toe once to help clear a fungal infection.  My toes broke out in a rash at that time.  Sure enough, after I smelled this product I knew that I might be allergic.  Yup,  I broke out in a rash after using this product and it looked worse than my small pimple that I was using it on.  My face had bumps and was extremely red.  In addition, this product burns after you put it on!  Maybe it was just me because tea tree oil does something to my skin.  It may work for you but I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I very rarely write reviews, but this creme is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for acne. I&#x27;m over 50 and have struggled with acne since my 20&#x27;s. My skin is also sensitive. Tried everything. This is the only product that has worked. My skin is now perfectly clear. Also did wonders for my teenager&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was recommended to me by a friend. It has been working really great for me. Plus a little goes a long way so this  bottle will probably last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have battled cystic acne, blackheads, whiteheads, and discoloration for over 10 years.  Most of it is hormonal, although probably genetic too.  This line by Derma E is the best line of products I have found so far that helps clear and heal the acne without irritating my sensitive skin.  I started with the cleanser, moved on to the spot treatment, and I have, in last few weeks, added in the moisturizer to my daily cleaning routine.  I use the cleanser twice a day and the spot treatment whenever needed.  I apply the moisturizer twice a day, morning and night.  I did notice that it takes a few minutes for the moisturizer to absorb into my skin, and it does smell strongly of tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer but I live on a budget so I was not sure about keeping up with the price. No worries! Just a tiny amount is enough to moisturize your whole face and it works so well! I use it in conjunction with the Very Clear Problem Skin cleanser and my face is not over dry or irritated. I really love this product.</li>
