      <li>Love the scents</li>
      <li>The reason I give it a three star is because the bottle of shampoo had a hole in the bottom of the shampoo bottle and most of it spilled out</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping, thank you.</li>
    <li> My child hasn&#x27;t had lice since I bought this. It&#x27;s very rosemary smelling, but in a nice way. And again, no lice...</li>
    <li> So far so good, haven&#x27;t experienced my child to have these nasty bugs this year. I love this stuff &amp; I hope it continues to work on my children.</li>
    <li> Keeps the lice away! If you have young kids and lice is an issue this is a must!&lt;br /&gt;my kids have been using this all thru elementary and middle school and it works.&lt;br /&gt;Not a guarantee they will never get lice but it will cut the odds down dramatically.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using the whole Fairy Tales line products on my children for a year now, since my older one started pre-school. We&#x27;ve had one lice scare in her school and have had three separate playdates in our home which we later found out that the children had lice and the parents were not aware of. We have yet to see one of those little buggers. (knock on wood)&lt;br /&gt;My complaints on the product is that the smell is pretty strong, not unpleasant, just strong. Also I&#x27;ve noticed that it weighs down their hair. Both my children have curls and I&#x27;ve noticed that when I use California Baby or Johnson &amp; Johnson all Naturals their hair is much lighter and curlier.</li>
    <li> Not a single worry about lice from school since we began using this - awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo after my children had an episode with lice. My hairstylist recommended this and I have my kids use it all school year. Its gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> I used to get irritated when I would read about 1 star for spilled product...not sure why but until it happens to you, you don&#x27;t realize all the money that you spent went straight in the trash. The box was filled with spilled shampoo everywhere which must have happen before because it was enclosed in a plastic bag and yet still left open to spill everywhere and out into the box and I was left to clean it all up and to realize that it was a huge waste of my money.  So I closed the bottle, washed up the mess and put it away.  Good luck with this shipper.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves these!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff keeps hair clean and soft. Knowing my son is protected from lice gives me one less thing to worry about</li>
    <li> good buy would buy again</li>
    <li> This product is completely and utterly useless. We&#x27;ve done lice treatments, washed sheets, boiled/freezed brushes, quarantined pillows, daily nitpicking, you name it. All of our furniture/car seats/bedsheets are sprayed. We use the shampoo, conditioner, and spray. My conclusion is that lice think rosemary is as delicious as I do! They THRIVE in an environment of this product. It makes for nice, soft hair.... But it does absolutely nothing to deter these horrid little bugs. Pity, it sure did cost a lot for negligible effect.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!  We&#x27;ve made it through two outbreaks of lice at our schools without getting it!!  Even one IN my daughters classroom!  Love the scents and I even use it when I work in te schools.</li>
    <li> Exellent product great value and fast shipping! This was a great experience!</li>
    <li> i have used this for years. my daughter had gotten lice twice from school. since using this for almost 4 years..has NOT got lice again&lt;br /&gt;its not cheap..but it works!</li>
    <li> We got lice.  First time ever!  Couldn&#x27;t get ride of it.  No matter how many treatments and washing everything in hot water. After 3 weeks I saw this and a post on line.  I again washed  everything in hot water. Then shampood and conditioned everyone&#x27;s hair with Fairy Tales.  Then blow dried the hair as hot as we could stand it. Close to the scalp.  It finally got rid of it.  We still do it once a week just to be safe. No more putting chemicals in my kids hair.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviews, I liked the shampoo even I never have head lice. I bought it because of the good review and the natural ingredients it has.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it twice. When I received them, the cap of the bottles were loosen and the shampoo was dripping all over in the package. It was all wet.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel this product works. We switched from other lice prevention shampoo and conditioner we were using and my daughter got lice twice. We are switching back and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. It is not worth the money and doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell! But dont like how it makes my hair look oily.</li>
    <li> Love that you don&#x27;t have to worry about the little ones getting lice while they are in school. Will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> We purchased the shampoo and conditioner combo after our first experience with lice with our eldest child and a little web research on ways to prevent lice.  This was a decent price for the combo product package.  The bottles are large/heavy for small hands, so we will pour into smaller containers, but don&#x27;t see this as a big deal.  The shampoo/conditioner work well as a wash and I love the fresh smell.  We haven&#x27;t had another outbreak of lice, nor has the rest of the family been affected.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!  Have been using on both my daughters since an outbreak of lice at the school last year. Have had no issues with lice and keeps hair shiny and clean.</li>
    <li> we had friends with lice...not sure if it was luck or the shampoo but we dodged it!  Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> This was a really good buy as a combo.  We love the fresh herbal smell of it.  It should last a really long time since the bottles are huge.  They also came with pump dispensers.  I wish all shampoo/conditioner bottles did!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a precaution due to my daughter being exposed at camps and school. It&#x27;s a very strong rosemary smell. I don&#x27;t mind it, but my daughter thinks it stinks. Shampoo lathers ok, conditioner works just fine.</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff i use this everyday we are now lice free. Haven&#x27;t  had a issue with bugs. It makes my daughter hair more healthier it also helps with dandruff too. I would recommend for the whole family too use this. I read other people reviews and what say are true it really does work.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, makes hair nice &amp; soft.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love using it for my kids. Had no problem with shipping. Most likely will buy it again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Not only has it prevented my daughter from getting lice this year, I began using it as well--and it has completely changed my coarse, wavy hair, to slick, smooth straight hair! My hair has also gotten significantly healthier and shinier looking, and I&#x27;ve had folks notice numerous times since using the shampoo and conditioner on a weekly basis. Will bu this on a regular basis, as it is now my shampoo/conditioner of choice, in addition to my daughter&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Our elementary school has been lice infested all this year but my daughter has remained lice free - I attribute it to these products.</li>
    <li> knock on wood, 60% of my daughter&#x27;s class mates had lice and she is so far clear. smells great, her hair is soft and the large bottles last a long time.</li>
    <li> So far we have enjoyed this shampoo.  The smell is good and my 2nd grader has had no issues with it.  As long as it helps repel lice it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> The only product that worked! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works very well have not had any lice since using!</li>
    <li> Product smells great but a month after using it my daughter came home with lice.  I know it wasn&#x27;t a guarantee but I wish I would not have bought the shampoo.  Disappointed...</li>
    <li> I am in total love with the fairytales products!! We struggled with lice for a month when my daughter came home with them from preschool. We finally got everything under control and I ran across this stuff after trying several preventive shampoos. I like tlhe smell of the conditioner better then the shampoo but my 4 year old daughter is the opposite. Both of them smell good though.The conditioner leaves her hair feeling great and the citrallea smell doesn&#x27;t stay around long. But if it&#x27;s going to help keep those nasty lice away, we can deal with the smell for a short time. I use the shampoo and conditioner every other day on her during bath, then I also purchased the leave in conditioner and use that on her every day before leaving for school. And as of today, we are lice free for a month!!  My daughter is a huge fan of princesses and she gets so excited to use her princess shampoo at bath time!!!</li>
    <li> My girls loved the scent of this shampoo and conditioner.  We used it in tandem with the leave in conditioner spray.  We had no lice, so it worked!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product for school age kids.....a preventative to keep lice away. good price and well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shampoo and I love the name but the easiest thing to rid your children of head lice and to prevent head lice is to use a COCONUT shampoo daily on your children, especially during the school year months. A cheap coconut suave shampoo will work but an organic coconut shampoo without harmful ingredients would be best. If your child gets a case of head lice, use coconut oil and use.</li>
    <li> I will use this product each and every year my son is in school. I suggest that every mom and dad use this for their children and every teacher.</li>
    <li> Reason for 3 stars was because The package came and The shampoo Was open and it&#x27; was all spilled inside the package lease one quarter of it was  spilled out .And for what I payed for this You should get all that you payed for . But otherwise I do love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner and it does make your  hair very clean feeling and shiny and Very soft . They say it&#x27;s good for lice . I&#x27;m  not sure about that because I never used it for that reason . But the smell of Rosemary is powerful so it&#x27;s possible because supposedly lice don&#x27;t like the smell of rosemary or tea tree . I would buy it again but hopefully they would have data packages.</li>
    <li> Product arrived and was exactly what I was looking for. Disappointed with the lack of packing. Two bottles rolling around in a box. Tips came loose and some of the shampoo leaked.</li>
    <li> The smell is almost repugnant&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well, but, strips natural oils to the point where it makes hair dry, and fly away&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Huge fan of this line.</li>
    <li> In my family, we have thick, clean hair. The exact favorite habitat for lice. Yes, we have battled with those annoying bugs on 3 separate occasions and I am fed up! Fairy Tales has helped us stay lice free since we started using it 2 months ago. During that time, I have already received notices of lice in my daughter&#x27;s class. That used to mean we were going to have to start treatment ourselves but not this time! I highly recommend this product to all families that have clean, thick hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I buy out once a year at the beginning of the school year because of those pesky hair bids that seem to travel the continent!  Thanks fairytales for making mommaKat sleep a little easier.</li>
    <li> Before my child&#x27;s hair got infested with lice, I looked for a detangler to help with her curly hair. So once the lice was gone , I saw this on Amazon and decided to give them a try. Thank God for your wonderful product! My little grand babies love getting their hair washed and detangler spray on and its so soft and she loves it so so so much not having to fight and cry like before. I have tried all things possible for curly hair and the adult products would get in their eyes and burn and then we both would cry but thanks to this wonderful products we have been blessed not to ever deal with lice again and I will be ordering more!  Thank you all and God bless on such a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> My son has used this shampoo and conditioner since before he started kindergarten.  He is now in 5th grade.  He has never gotten head lice!  Love this product!!!  Oh, and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> received package today, could smell the product when the box was opened. Opened the second package to find the lid to the conditioner open and product everywhere. Not a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I have never seen a conditioner work magic on my daughter&#x27;s hair like this product and it smells so good.  Leave on for two to three  minutes before rinsing and basically EVERY knot on the head comes out like a gem.  No screaming, just smiles.  Ahhhhh.  Why did it take me so long to find this product.  I think the bottle will last a long time as we don&#x27;t need much each washing.</li>
    <li> This item is a great lice preventative.  I swear by the product .  I will never use another lice preventive shampoo/conditioner again !</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo for my daughter!</li>
    <li> After getting lice for the first time EVER last year, My family has been using this product ever since!&lt;br /&gt;I do daycare and with kids here all day and my own in school I want to be extra protected!</li>
    <li> The bottles were not well packed and they opened during shipment, creating a gooey mess inside the shipping carton.  Be aware that, in addition to the rosemary essential oil in these products, there is synthetic fragance added also.  The fake smell was overwhelming.  We returned this order.</li>
    <li> Whenever there is lice going around my daughter&#x27;s class, she is always spared due to using this product!  The 32oz is also a great value.</li>
    <li> I put ok because I didn&#x27;t pay attention that the conditioner is a spray conditioner to go in after your shower. It gives the hair, a hair spray dirty feel.  One daughter was found to be allergic to the shampoo and spray. I just wash her hair and give her body a good rinse after. She is still scratchy do to allergy to it, but worth it to not  have  bugs. Seems to do ok. I have up kept  on checking her head. There are eggs but no bugs. Not sure if bugs wash away using this stuff  but with checking , washing , spraying no one else has gotten it and we have managed to keep hers under control.  Her class has a bad case soo we may over wash at times:) I&#x27;d say hey give it a try, you aren&#x27;t putting a nerve damaging liquid on your child&#x27;s head and you can use it daily. I even spray their back packs and anything that goes to school with the conditioning spray:)</li>
    <li> Leaves hair silky smooth. Lasts a really long time. A must for kids in school.</li>
    <li> The smell is great. The conditioner works well to detangle. You don&#x27;t need a ton of product to do the job. After using for 5 mos, we got the lice AGAIN. I have 5 kids. You can imagine how awesome that is.</li>
    <li> Not only does it smell good and make our hair soft and shiny, it actually DOES repel the lice :)  YAY!</li>
    <li> Very happy with our purchase. My daughter brought lice home from school a few times last year and it is so much work to get rid of it once it is brought home. Laundry, hair treatment, beds sprayed down, not to mention I freak out. This is pricey, but well worth the expense. No lice since this purchase. I also purchased the leave in conditioner and am super happy with it as well. Amazon has great pricing on the product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this as a preventative measure since we got the lice note home from the school last year.  Started out using just the conditioner.  The scent is lighter than other lice-deterring shampoos.  Not sure if this is the reason or not, but we have been lice free (fingers crossed).</li>
    <li> We continue to use this product and have not yet gotten lice. Staying hopeful! My sister&#x27;s daughter had lice and after we visited we did not get it. Thank goodness!</li>
    <li> Aside from the fact that this shampoo and conditioner leaves your child&#x27;s hair smelling oh so great, I am thrilled that the natural oils repel lice and other insects.  With a recent outbreak of lice in my kid&#x27;s school, this was a great way to protect them daily.  I highly recommend these Fairy Tales products.  They are wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love Fairy Tales Shampoo and Conditioner.  The reason I love it is that my 3 children use it year round and we have never had a lice outbreak.  The conditioner is fine for my son, but my daughters have to use a stronger/more effective conditioner for their long curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My daughter has sensitive skin and this prevents her from breaking out and itching, and has prevented her from getting lice!</li>
    <li> Everyone comments how good this is for lice.  True.  That&#x27;s how we got turned on to it.  But it&#x27;s also a natural product and we have continued to use it as our daily shampoo &amp; conditioner even though no one in the house has lice anymore.  The shampoo works well (you only need a little), the conditioner rinses out well, yet still makes it easy to comb through for long hair.  As for the smell, yes it smells different when you are applying it, but it isn&#x27;t noticeable one you get on with your day.  For a natural product it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product smells. It has a very clean scent. My daughter loves this shampoo. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> After my daughters got lice for the second time a friend recommended this product and we&#x27;ve been using it along with the repel spray and haven&#x27;t gotten lice again.  Thank goodness!</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo and conditioner.  My children use it to prevent lice.  I think it works. The shampoo and condition don&#x27;t create a lather, but it does rinse smoothly and leaves their hair soft and tangle free.  When I have tried it, it seems like a strong citranella smell is left behind, but I don&#x27;t notice it when my children are using it..it&#x27;s a nice rosemary smell.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because it should come with a pump since it&#x27;s a bit pricey.  The pumps are sold separately.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, I do not write reviews. However, I feel it is warranted for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my daughter started pre-school two years ago, she had a friend who had lice, really really bad. Of course my daughter ended up with it and brought it home to the other four children in the house. Between all of the kids we spent around $300 trying to get right of the lice. Then one day I came across this shampoo on the internet. My thinking was, \\&quot;We&#x27;ve tried everything else and spent that much money already, what is it going to hurt to try something else?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received the shampoo and conditioner and leave-in conditioner and began washing the kids&#x27; hair with it. After that we never saw another bug. It&#x27;s been two years and the only time we do not really use this shampoo is during the summer. I will say, though, that even during the summer months this stuff is great because not only does it help keep lice away, but other little buggies too. There was one time I was getting eat up by mosquitoes, and so I went inside to take a shower and wash my hair with the Rosemary Repel Shampoo and went back outside. I didn&#x27;t have any more mosquito problems for the rest of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also good to use on dogs for fleas. Kind of expensive to use on the dogs, but if you&#x27;re that worried about the fleas, it works well. I use a combination of that and their flea medication.</li>
    <li> whole  family uses every day.  Great product, lice or no</li>
    <li> When I heard a gal at my daycare had lice I cringed and immediately went to this shampoo and conditioner, however I do not know how well it does to prevent lice. I don&#x27;t think I will be using it long enough to find out.&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about it...it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about it....it does not clean the hair very well.  My daughters had some chalk hair color in their hair and this shampoo did not take it out.  I had to rewash their hair with a different shampoo.  It leaves their hair oily and scraggly.  Their hair is more tangled even if I use the detangling spray.  There is more breakage and I just cringe when I see how much hair has been collected in the haribrush from them trying to yank the snarls out of their hair.&lt;br /&gt;When they come home from school after being in the wind and just playing as little girls do their hair looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed or brushed in days.</li>
    <li> Love these.  My daughter has had a couple of experiences with head lice and I now have her using these products as a preventive.  So far, no issues in over a year.  Smells great too.</li>
    <li> I came across this product in an article about natural lice prevention and decided to give it a try. At first the smell was a little strong; I got used to it and now love it - especially after my hair dries. In fact, I tried it on my colored hair and found it amazing. I still use the Original Sprout detangler (on my long haired 5 year old) since it&#x27;s great and the FT detangler reviews were lukewarm at best. My only hope now is that I never know what it&#x27;s like to have lice - Happy Kindergarten!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this to me to prevent lice.  I haven&#x27;t been hit by the bug yet.  It does a really good job too for brushing hair.  My daughter has really long hair.  It isn&#x27;t sweet and girly smelling, but it&#x27;s not bad.  It smells like rosemary.  Better than having lice.</li>
    <li> Love this product, definitely gives you the peace of mind you need after going through treating Lice.  I use this daily for my girls and their hair has actually started looking ten times softer.</li>
    <li> We have used this in lice season for 3 years and so far so good. It works for us. Though pricey I worry less and that is huge!</li>
    <li> The best lice repel shampoo! All natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product really repels head lice-but I like both the shampoo and the spray-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My seven year old grandchild brought head lice home and I went into a flurry of activity.  I hate bugs. We treated everyone in the house with Rid and combed nits into oblivion by the time this product arrived. (I discovered if you use a conditioner and a nit comb every other day and flat iron the other days-all signs of lice and nits were gone by day seven.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do know that both the shampoo and spray-on conditioner smell wonderful.  My granddaughter uses the conditioning spray every morning now in the hopes to keep critters from school at bay.  I use is because it is light and my hair needs the moisture. We all are using both products because maybe they will protect us and we just plain like them.</li>
    <li> Great product and so far NO MORE LICE! Plus, we love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
    <li> I usually use Aveda products, but with my daughter in elementary school, we needed added protection against hair the dreaded lice situations that come &amp; go  in most schools.  This smells good &amp; seems to work well, as well as being gentle.  Its also the best price I can find!</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the spray. I&#x27;ve been using all three on my daughter for the past month and she still got it after a month.</li>
    <li> The reason I give it a three star is because the bottle of shampoo had a hole in the bottom of the shampoo bottle and most of it spilled out and I don&#x27;t know who to email to try to get another one with out paying for a new product... But the product works great they just need a customer care emailer some we can get a hold of them if there is a problem!</li>
    <li> I can only hope that lice are repelled by Rosemary.  I&#x27;m not taking any chances and I will use it at each lice outbreak and I&#x27;m sure another one will be coming down the pike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice.  My only complaint is that it did seem to leave a bit of a residue.  Perhaps that is the point.  But it really was no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered along with the comb, and conditioning spray.  Get all three, You will be happy when you are prepared for the next outbreak.</li>
    <li> Great especially if your kids are in public school!</li>
    <li> Great product and works so far!</li>
    <li> Lice suck! My 9 year old neice got lice from school and so graciously passed them on to my 1 1/2 year old (who hasnt ever had a haircut), my 3 1/2 year old, and my lovely wife. We didnt notice that everyone had lice till about three weeks in, so there were plenty of lice along with nits (eggs) on all three of there heads. After spending a good $200 of &amp;#34;professional lice and nit removal proceedures&amp;#34; at a local business who specializes in this area, we decided to purchase this product in order to finally put an end to this agony and prevent it in the future. The lice are finally gone, and we use this shampoo and conditioner once a week. We havent had an lice or nits since. Both the shampoo and conditioner smell good, and im a man who likes dirt meat and sweat! But i like the way it smells in my kids hair. Great product and seems to be working great so far.</li>
    <li> Having a child in an elementary school can prove unnerving when it comes to lice infections. This shampoo/conditioner combo is one that my wife swears works as its supposed to. While indeed not cheap it has worked now for 2-3 years to hold off the lice that undoubtedly are found in schools/daycare.  She highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> This is what we always use on our school aged children and so far no lice.  Love this and the leave in spray.  This price is better than any retail store I have found.</li>
    <li> No stars for me!!  We have been using this shampoo for 8 months and my daughter came home with live lice bugs!  I had hoped that this product would eliminate the possibility of getting head lice ever again.  Very disappointed and mislead!</li>
    <li> We went round and round with the &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; Monster at my daughter&#x27;s daycare! (Wreckless employees failing to clean their facilities and remove infected children during nap time and bag infected items promptly! What do you expect when the inmates run the assylm??) Shhheeeeshh! I was at my wits end - then a friend turned me on to this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW! Any nits that hatched after we started using this shampoo/conditioner had those nasty little monsters running for their lives! And evacuating my house screaming since I sprayed Teatree Oil/Water mixture all over our house daily for weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this product is that if my daughter comes into contact with active lice - the lice repell from her hair because of the RoseMary scent.</li>
    <li> We love these products - these plus the hairspray have (so far- knock on wood) prevented lice in our kindergartner even though it&#x27;s gone through the class several times. These big bottles are convenient and cost-effective.</li>
    <li> Been using this for almost 2 years on my daughters hair.  So far, so good!  We just bought the leave in spray too for added protection.</li>
    <li> Our family loves this product. Our hair feels and smells wonderful and we are happy with the results of the repellent.</li>
    <li> I generally like this product and have ordered it several times on Amazon but from a different shipper. I opened the package this time to find spilled shampoo everywhere. So I sealed it up and am returning it. It&#x27;s way too expensive to deal with a mess!!! Next time seal the lids!</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and was as described.  Problem was cap had become loose and there was shampoo all over the bottle.  There was still basically a full bottle but I had to clean it off before use.  I think top should&#x27;ve been more securely wrapped so that top didn&#x27;t come loose.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great also. Two elementary aged girls with long hair and no problems since using this product. I recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I feel as though this product does help keep lice away. It does make your hair feel greasy but no lice it worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, smells amazing and leaves our hair feeling great. Best part... Knowing my daughter&#x27;s hair is protected from lice.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed, she still got lice.  Expensive shampoo and conditioner that didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m not sure anything works except long hours, a good light and a fine-toothed comb. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used so far-- I love that me and my girls (5&amp;7) can all use the same hair care. &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> After experiencing lice on my daughter for the first time, which by the way is a living nightmare, I decided to take some more proactive preventative measures. I read the reviews and wasn&#x27;t quite sure which way to go. I finally decided on the Fairy Tales Rosemary Shampoo and Conditioner. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad as I had read on other posts, but to each their own. Actually, I liked the scent. When I used it on my girls I just made sure to cover their eyes with a washcloth and was extra careful when rinsing out in the tub. I wanted to try it for myself so I gave it a whirl. I did experience some mild tingling when it got on my skin (temple area) in the shower but nothing that was extreme or painful. My girls never complained about the tingling. I will continue to use this on my girls during fall and spring when lice seems to &amp;#34;break out&amp;#34; or becomes more prevalent in the schools. It&#x27;s done it&#x27;s job thus far and anything that will help deter lice is a good thing.</li>
    <li> We had to deal with head lice when my daughter was in preschool. We started using these products right away (it&#x27;s not something you want to deal with more than once if you can help it). Thankfully, we have not had any problems with head lice since we started using Fairy Tales products. I will defintely keep using this. I have even used the shampoo and conditioner a couple of times when I have run out and I actually like it.</li>
    <li> I want to protect my child from headlice using a natural product.  I do not want to have to give her the toxic medication.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! The only issue I had was with packaging. Some of the product leaked out in shipping.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased smaller bottles for lice prevention.  This product has natural ingredients and was the recommended shampoo from the lice treatment service we used.  The product smells great, lathers up really well and due to the ingredients, seems gentle enough to use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids use it every day and I use it periodically alternating with my normal color shampoo/conditioner.  We love it so we ordered the larger formats.</li>
    <li> This is a MUST HAVE for you and your school aged children.  It also helps with detangling unruly hair.</li>
    <li> Its supposed to repel bugs in your hair.  I haven&#x27;t had any, so I can&#x27;t say if it works for that, but it is a clean scent that is more natural, and definitely more gentle than other bug shampoos.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this nightly and the smell is different but not horrible.</li>
    <li> cleans hair beautifully and the lice have not returned!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandchildren.  Love the scent and it works. What I loved about the product - No harmful ingredients -</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and leaves my coarse thick head of hair looking&#x27; good.  My daughter had a lice outbreak at her school and we nit combed and religiously used this.  We didn&#x27;t have any lice issues, and people kept sniffing my hair (ewwww) and saying how good I smelled.  I am no Greta Garbo, so I credit it to the shampoo and conditioner.  ;-)</li>
    <li> This was a good deal.  The bottles leaked a little during shipping. So far, no lice, so we are happy with the purchase.  It really is just a precautionary item.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell great and made my hair soft and shiny. My hair is foil highlighted and the shampoo and conditioner were safe to use. I teach elementary school and lice outbreaks are a common occurrence with our students. I even caught it once from a student, so I am hopeful that these products will prevent another occurrence!  I&#x27;ve even recommended them to fellow teachers at my school.</li>
    <li> We use this daily on our kids to wash hair and have never had an incident with live!&lt;br /&gt;Every year there are lice cases in both my kids&#x27; classes and we have never gotten it. Truly has kept those buggers away!</li>
    <li> Great price and does the trick!</li>
    <li> A Must Have for anyone with school age children.  As a precaution I began using it on my daughter at the start of the school year.  Well it worked out wonderfully, the entire class had lice, including the Teacher, but my daughter was the only one who was not affected.  I aslo would spray her hair daily with the Repel Conditioning Spray.  This is truly great stuff, much more effective than the stuff that ia sold in the Pharmacy.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using both the shampoo and conditioner (as well as the spray and gel) off and on for the last three years since two of my kids came home with lice and it worked pretty well...up until this year, that is.  My daughter came home with it last month, though it seemed to be a mild case...I only found one louse and less than ten nits.  I think we caught it earlier this time than last is all.  I&#x27;d gotten lax about using the leave-in spray and/or conditioner and I think those are probably key to keeping lice at bay.  I just don&#x27;t think the shampoo and conditioner leave enough residual product to be effective.</li>
    <li> This works wonders!!! My daughter had lice that we couldn&#x27;t get rid of. We tried everything, they kept coming back! This product is wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> Worked great, killed the head lice and smells great. Lice are gone and I still use it once in a while.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few weeks on my two young daughters.  So far, it&#x27;s great.  I don&#x27;t completely rinse out the conditioner, because I&#x27;ve heard the shampoo and spray (which I use) dry the hair out.  My daughters have not been exposed to lice but I&#x27;m using it as a preventative measure, so let&#x27;s hope they never do! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, is that the bottles should have been taped better and more filling in the shipping box because it leaked a little.  Otherwise, great seller and smooth transaction.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and repellent</li>
    <li> Lice was a problem in my children&#x27;s class-- 75% of the class had been sent home because of lice.  I bought these as a preventative.  While I still continue to check my children&#x27;s hair regularly--knock on wood-- had not found a nit or a bug.</li>
    <li> Its excellent for children and really works as a repelent!!</li>
    <li> Last year was our household&#x27;s first experience with lice.  I wanted it to be our last.  I don&#x27;t know how effective the shampoo/ conditioner really is... all I know is that we have been lice free since.  Yes, it&#x27;s a strong rosemary smell, but if it keeps the lice away, I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It leaves my kids&#x27; hair soft and shiny. My daughter has long, straight hair, my son has short curly hair. Both of their schools have sent out &amp;#34;exposure to lice&amp;#34; letters multiple times this year and neither of them have gotten lice.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the leave-in spray for my daughter and that helps me detangle her hair.</li>
    <li> After my kids got lice at school last fall, we started using this shampoo and conditioner. They are pricey, but I really like the smell, and it makes my girls&#x27; hair soft. Most of all, we didn&#x27;t want to get lice in the house again! Well, it&#x27;s one month into school, and guess who got lice again? I guess nothing is truly lice-proof.</li>
    <li> I bought this in case we should encounter some lace issues... but since we were lucky so far there was luckily no need for it. But I love the smell of this product, so I love to use it anyway !</li>
    <li> I like the size of the bottle for the household to use all during the cooler hat and coat wearing weather. It does well so far for us to help prevent reoccurring instances for almost the whole household. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some hair care products and can be used for little ones as well.</li>
    <li> I daughter got lice from daycare and I bought this stuff and used it. She hasn&#x27;t had lice ever since and I will continue to buy this product</li>
    <li> We have had a lice free house for a few years. My children use Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel every time they wash their hair. My oldest child was in a show and shared a dressing room with 12 girls, 9 got lice. All the girls were required to go to a professional salon to check for lice. My daughter had a clean bill of hair health. We told the lady at the salon that we use Fairy Tales exclusively and she was skeptical. But after being checked, we continued to be lice free (I was checked too!). We will ALWAYS use Fairy Tales! I cannot recommend it more.</li>
    <li> Works great on my kids&#x27; hair and no lice even though several classmates do have continuing head lice. Lasts a couple of months too with daily showers.</li>
    <li> There was a pretty significant lice outbreak at my girls&#x27; school...but my kids never got lice (thankfully).  We heard about Fairy Tales, so I ordered it.  The kids love using it, and chose to use it on their own.  It smells good, and leaves their hair soft and easy to comb.  We now use both the shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s more expensive than regular shampoo, but there&#x27;s a new breed of lice out now that&#x27;s resistant to treatment... so for me, it&#x27;s preventative and worth it!</li>
    <li> Love this product and my daughter uses it every day.  Incidentally she has not had a problem with lice since using this!  It was recommended by a hair salon.  The smell is fresh, rosemary like, hair is soft and manageable and most important: no more critters,</li>
    <li> The product came nicely packaged and the pumps actually work. This product has made my daughter&#x27;s hair shiny and easier to brush.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
    <li> We love the the smell on our hairs and softness and shine. We are ordering more of this in the future.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this shampoo.  Lice problems or not it&#x27;s a regular keeper.  It smells great.  It&#x27;s the only shampoo my husband has raved about.  It really leaves your hair looking great.  A great addition.... the added protection against school creatures.</li>
    <li> After my child would spend the night with their other parent  they would always come back with unwanted guests.  Since I had exhausted all legal matters in not letting them go over there for a day or two I gave these products a chance.  So far I am very pleased with the results.  The last four times of them visiting with the ex there have been no unwanted visitors coming back, and no exhaustive nit picking that night.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a coincidence or not, but I&#x27;m going to continue using this product, when (or IF) the unwanted creatures return.  I&#x27;ll just add that my child had lice at least seven times when going to their other parents for a weekend visit.</li>
    <li> I had read some reviews about leaking bottles, so I just thought I would say this arrived today in perfect shape.  The 2 bottles were in a sealed bag, and each bottle had so much shrink wrap around the top, I don&#x27;t think any liquid would have escaped even if the caps were missing.</li>
    <li> Some may not like the smell, but this stuff works!  My daughter had lice three times before we found this. Haven&#x27;t had any issues since (going on 3 years now)</li>
    <li> Great Product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> My grandkids loved the way it makes their hair feel and the smell of it also.And so far it has kept the lice away.</li>
    <li> This is great smelling shampoo and conditioner.  After my kid&#x27;s class was infested with lice, we kept her nit free using this and diligent checking!  Would use it even if there weren&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> this helped keep others in our family from getting lice.  Great product.  would buy again and recommend to other friends.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo for anyone but I especially use it on my kids to help in the prevention of lice.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever &#x3D;) I told all my friends that have daughters about this! And they love it too. Will be buying more soon!</li>
    <li> I have 2 young girls after 2 years in a row of them coming home with lice I bought this as well as the leave in spray. I use the shampoo and conditioner twice a week and the leave in spray daily. So far no bugs since using them. :-) Also a reminder bugs like clean hair my girls only get their hair washed every 2 to 3 days. I also use hair spray after the leave in. My youngest has long to her butt hair and this makes their hair soft after using it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great and works well. We also use the repellant detangler.</li>
    <li> Got it bc my dd got lice and after getting rid of it did not want them to come back :/...good smell,shipped fast and even got a thank you note with my order!</li>
    <li> We had a lice issue about 4 years ago then a year later, and I switched my daughter to fairy tales. Haven&#x27;t had any lice since. It smells good, and lathers nice - you don&#x27;t have to use a ton to get the job done. Definitely use the conditioner,  as the shampoo can leave the hair a bit tangled when brushing. But we love fairy tales!</li>
    <li> My three young daughters love it. I love it. Shampoo is wonderful. We get compliments. Hair is healthy looking. Smell is clean and naturally fragrant. The conditioner is a bit on the thin side but I would still recommend to anyone and we will be buying again</li>
</ol>
