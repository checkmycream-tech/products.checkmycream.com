<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it really works! I had many stains on my face because of acne and took two weeks using it and see the difference and it is big! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love my serum I use it at night under coconut oil and it doesn&#x27;t break me out which every other antiager I have used does it makes it hard to be turning 30 but with this I will be 29 (or younger) forever!</li>
    <li> First off, very fast shipping was pleasantly surprised when the serum arrived in my mailbox. I have been using the product for 5 days now and can already see a dramatic difference in my skin. After using it for the first night, I woke up to glowing skin, less breakouts and looking more refreshed. A few days later, I am already noticing dark spots starting to lighten and my breakouts are being healed much faster! I&#x27;m thinking the products is definitely helping in the increasing of collagen production and that&#x27;s why my skin looks &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; each morning. I will continue to re-order this serum once I run low because I am already obsessed! Excellent product-you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bees knees. My skin is already feeling so much softer and refreshed after only a few uses!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, awesome product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product not knowing how well it would work. I was so surprised how well the Vitamin C helped to smooth my complection and got rid of my wrinkles! The seller was extremely fast with shipping the product and I have recommended it to all of my friends! I now look years younger and love Life Essentials Skin Care!!</li>
    <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At less than $20 a bottle for 1 fl. oz of Life Essentials Skin Care Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum you are guaranteed to experience a healthier skin and newer you. This serum is powerful to use towards scar removal, fine lines, wrinkles, acne, stretch marks and age spots. This little bottle holds a lot of power for rejuvenating your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is made for both men and women and is FDA registered and animal cruelty free. The serum is 20% vitamin C and A concentrated base with pure hyaluronic acid. After cleansing the face before bed and in the morning, I applied 2-3 drops and placed on my face and neck. Within a few weeks, I have seen a difference in pore reduction and my skin feels much tighter. I also appear to have less acne breakouts now. The oil has no real fragrance and is natural smelling with no greasy feeling left on the skin.</li>
    <li> Using it about a week and a half and already see a lot of improvement in my wrinkles. Skin looks healthier and fresher. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like after a month!</li>
    <li> Great product. After three weeks of use my skin is more radiant, and I&#x27;ve noticed reduction in hyper-pigmentation. Definitely worth the money. Try using it with a 0.5 derma roller.</li>
    <li> Life Essentials shipped my order right away.  The serum is top quality.  I&#x27;m very pleased and will buy from Life Essentials again in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference since purchasing and using this product. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t have a distinct odor, is not oily, and leaves no residue. I recommend at least twice a day for a couple weeks and you&#x27;ll start to notice a difference. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This has helped lighten the dark spots on my face. I apply it regularly. The skin looks better. I have used it for about 4 weeks now and it has made a difference.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery! First time user and tried the product after day one and noticed a subtle glow and smoothness. Looking forward to the results after 30days. Gotta love the organic factor too!</li>
    <li> Being an aesthetician for over 19 years, this product is an excellent addition to my skin care collection. The product goes on smooth and shows visible results after continuous use! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I like the cost/benefit of this product!  Really looking forward to using it.  I&#x27;ll let you know how it works in a month or two!</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this product to me, and I was not disappointed! My skin feels so moisturized, and my acne spots are less visible! I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love this! started using immediately and saw results immediately</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products to diminish my acne scars but this by far has worked the best. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple weeks now and I have noticeably smoother skin and my marks are fading rapidly! Highly reccomend!</li>
    <li> After only using this product for a month and I can already see changes in the dark spots on my face!!  Excellent product for sensitive skin.  Will buy   again!</li>
    <li> great product !! Also the shipping was unbelievably fast</li>
    <li> After trying this product for a week.  I saw results my skin was less dry and glowing.  My Co workers kept complimenting me on my skin and how youthful my skin look. Definitely will continue to try this product for the amazing results.</li>
    <li> My wife and I bought this product at Amazon a couple of weeks ago and we are already seeing results. Both of us have &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; spot that seem to spring up as a gift of aging. We have both noticed that the dark spots we have been using this product on are starting to fade. Will it get rid of them all together? Only time will tell. We will come back and keep you posted but so far, we are very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;The End.</li>
    <li> This is about the next best thing to a miracle! i&#x27;m only 20 so I don&#x27;t have wrinkles but I did have some fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead. The biggest problem for me and the main reason why I bought this product was because the past year I had serious problems with acne and it left me with embarrassing scars. I still have the occasional breakout but for the most part its all scars and red marks. After just one use of this serum I noticed an amazing difference. I used this nightly for about a week now, and every line on my forehead is completely gone and under my eyes look better than ever! As for the scars it is a MAJOR difference, but it is not completely gone yet. However I know that scars take more time to heel. I have faith that if i continue to use this they will be gone in no time! I will continue to use this even after my scars are faded. My skin looks so bright and I got so many compliments that my skin looks glowing. I am extremely pleased with this product. It work wonders!</li>
    <li> The vitamin C serum is an excellent choice  for anyone over 40. You will be even smarter to began using before age 40. The serum has definitely improved the under eye area (which is why I bought it.)  However, my face,  neck and declotage are plumper and visibly noticeable. I will order more, as the price is affordable.</li>
    <li> This product has been amazing. I am almost 24 and I discovered that I was beginning to have lines on my face and around my eyes. After seeing the reviews, I decided to get the eye cream and skin care products and its been amazing! After only two days, the lines on my face have started disappearing and I have this healthy glow. I would definitely keep using the products and absolutely love it. Also, although the bottle is small, a little goes a long way and it would take a while before you need to get another.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have been through serum after serum, lotion after lotion and have had a difficult time finding one that is effective.  It was not until I ran across this product that I found something that works.  Within days, my scars started to decrease.  Overall my skin looks healthier.  The only downside to this product is I wish it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> After two weeks of use, my skin is noticeably softer and clearer and a few people have commented on how much better my skin is looking. My acne scars are still visible but seem slightly less so.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but am not sure about buying it again.  I use so many products, I don&#x27;t know which one&#x27;s help my skin and which one&#x27;s do not.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference. I used for four week and it not worked.</li>
    <li> Used this product a few times and it seemed to alter my personality, so I stopped using it.  Even though I received a card with the shipment for a free bottle if I write a review, I cannot accept a free bottle, or request one, because of the adverse effects I have by using the product.  Wish it were different.  it may be perfectly fine for you to use however.</li>
    <li> Love it! My skin looks more vibrant! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this product and she is totally in love with it. it made her skin softer.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought me this vitamin c serum as a christmas gift. I&#x27;ve been using the two bottles for a little over 2 months now and I must say, I&#x27;m very happy with the results! Organic ingredients, great customer service when I had application questions and also very reasonably priced for a skin care product. I&#x27;m getting low and my birthday isn&#x27;t for several months so I will be buying a new bottle very soon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and I really like it. I usually have sensitive skin, but I have not noticed any irritation when using this product (twice per day). I received several complements about the soft texture and coloring of my face since using this stuff. Will definitely keep using it in the future.</li>
    <li> All organic ingredients. Love the dropper top for easy application. Very excited to see the results on my face. Feels great when applying.</li>
    <li> After much research I purchased this skin care product to fade and remove some dark age spots on my hands and forehead ( I am 71 and been exposed to the sun).  After just a few direct applications the spots began to change in color toward the surrounding skin.  After additional applications this process is continuing and these immediate results are very much welcome.  I would recommend this product for application to limited areas on your skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product,  I have seen an improvement in my skin tone and deep wrinkles since I stayed using this product.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! This contains am amazing power combination of ingredients including Vitamin and Hyaluronic Acid! While vitamin C impacts collagen production and improves wrinkles and dark spots, Hyaluronic acid impacts it a different way and is known as a plumper. They actually inject this into people&#x27;s faces (not for me) but I will certainly put it on in this serum! The more I read about them...the more I wonder why I wasted time with a department store brand that was super expensive!   Ingredients include Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe, Vitamin C, MSM, botanical hyaluronic acid, Witch Hazel, Vitamin E, Carbomer, (2s)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid, Ferulic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Jojoba Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.   It&#x27;s nice and thin and completely fragrance free. Not oily at all. I use the dropper to apply it to my forehead, cheeks and neck. I tip my head backwards so it doesn&#x27;t roll down and I spread it around. It&#x27;s absorbed so fast and my skin feels soft. This is an instant pick-me-up because I Know I&#x27;m doing something amazing for my skin. I use this on my off days from a retinol product. It&#x27;s great for when my skin needs soothing, but still benefits from the anti-aging ingredients. I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference. I would recommend this to a friend, family member or give it as a gift!   Disclosure; I received a product sample to facilitate my review, however the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery per always Amazon Prime! My face is looking so much better no more breakouts awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this vitamin c serum for about 10 days so far and I am hooked. I have mild rosacea and I&#x27;ve noticed how much the redness has faded as well as some acne. I use it at night after washing my face and sometimes in the morning too before I put on makeup. I like that it&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t smell. Another positive is that I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is less flaky and feels more hydrated. My skin texture has definitely improved. Since it&#x27;s only been 10 days, I&#x27;m going to keep using it and I&#x27;ll update my review in the future.</li>
    <li> Am very pleased with life essentials product. I am starting to see a little progress. Will definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have seen an improvement in my dark spots and the overall texture of my skin is smoother and more even. I have been very happy with this product and plan to continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Just make my face worse</li>
    <li> First you need to keep this liquid in the fridge, which to me is a bit of a hassle. Second it is VERY WATERY and you can&#x27;t put it on your fingertips to rub into your face, you have to put it in your palm and then rub the liquid in your palm onto your face. The potion itself is okay it;s just too watery for my liking.</li>
    <li> This product actually does make wrinkles much less noticeable. I have used it for several weeks now, it took about two weeks to really see a difference but even my husband noticed. I am 52 and I have deep wrinkles around my chin, after two weeks they were much less visable. I wash my face and neck with neutragena face wash with baking soda added as an exfoliant, then I use this product pretty liberally. Once it dries I use olay sensitive lotion uv15. Doing this daily and just this product at night has changed my skin. I highly recommend Life Essentials skin care, it really does work.</li>
    <li> Great product! It feels terrific on my skin and I&#x27;m seeing positive results already after only one week of usage. I&#x27;d buy this item again in a heartbeat and fully intend to do so.</li>
    <li> It is a bit early to say if I see any changes to my skin from this product. So far it seems ok and nothing adverse to report.</li>
    <li> Works great. Quick shipping.  Kind of expensive for a small bottle. It makes my skin smooth and reduces brown spots and acne.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s beginning work,I Love it</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Oil is one of the best oils. I absolutely love it. I use it on my face everyday twice daily. It makes my skin feel soft, takes away excess oils and overall is starting to take away small wrinkles and my skin tone is more even. Life Essentials makes a great Vitamin C. It helps with my slight acne. I am not breaking out as much since I have been using Vitamin C. My skin tone is becoming more even. I even just learned that it is great to make your nails whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MADE IN THE USA: Life Essential&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum Is Proudly Formulated Here In The USA In An FDA Registered Laboratory &amp; Is Cruelty Free&lt;br /&gt;100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEE</li>
    <li> I have to say, I love this product. After only a few days I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and the brightness. I would recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved vitamin C serums, but they were always so insanely expensive and generally only available from dermatologists or boutique/spa brands. To be able to find a serum of this quality at such a low price is incredible. It&#x27;s a large bottle and will last forever, you only need a few drops. It&#x27;s nourishing and feels really good when you put it on your skin and I saw results almost immediately. Discolorations fade and the skin tightens- it does a particularly good job on the back of your hands at turning back the clock. My hands look younger and smoother and the skin is tighter while some of my heavy freckling is fading. I&#x27;m a big fan of this blend as well, you get not only a high level of vitamin C, but a ton of other wonder ingredients to boost it&#x27;s efficacy. This is a good serum to use in the mornings under your makeup to boost sun protection and the prevention of free radicals!&lt;br /&gt;It also has Vitamin E and Hyaluronic acid!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I did receive this for review purposes, all opinions expressed are mine own</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks and I already see a difference. My skin is smoother and clearer. Will order again.</li>
    <li> It feels good. It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it evens out dark spots.</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle for me and one for my godmother. We both see an awesome difference in the texture and tone of our skin since using it. We use it daily. I still get a few breakouts though so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong. I only use organic and natural skincare. I do have more of a glow and my dark spots have lightened up. Excited about finishing the bottle and seeing even clearer skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this not too long ago and so far I have noticed that it leaves my skin feeling very nice and soft</li>
    <li> I HIGHLY recommend this Vitamin C Serum! Vitamin C serum is my favorite serum to use for anti-aging, brightening and dark spots. Top quality ingredients are used within this particular vitamin C serum that will TRULY deliver results! I appreciate skincare products that have a short ingredient list, because this means less chemicals and harmful ingredients for your skin! Even better, this serum contains ORGANIC ingredients! It is formulated with a high percentage and stable form of vitamin C, which is crucial in order to receive the benefits of vitamin c. I love that they use pure vegan hyaluronic acid as well. My skin has felt smoother, plumper and I am noticing dark spots starting to fade after just a week. Results will continue to increase. This serum is also CRUELTY FREE, which is very important to me! This seller also had phenomenal customer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for short while but am very happy with my purchase. This will remain part of my daily skin care.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I appreciate the organic ingredients and the fact that the product is made in USA. It has almost no fragrance (no it doesn&#x27;t smell like oranges); it smells very natural. It feels neither astringent nor greasy. And it Works! Wow. My skin looks brighter and heals very fast now.  It starting working quickly after first use, too. I&#x27;ve put it on some points of other skin irritation and it helped clear those issues, as well.</li>
    <li> Got my order on time. Love this product</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for the past 3 weeks and it has been the best serum i have ever had. I have always picked on my skin and i always had red marks because of that, but since i have been using this product I have less blackheads, my skin heals so much faster, and it leaves no scars behind. It is also a very good make up base that tightens the pores and hydrates the skin.</li>
    <li> But not ordering any more.</li>
    <li> I was lucky to receive this as a gift from my sister. I assumed it wouldn&#x27;t make any difference but after only 2 days I looked better!! It&#x27;s hard to determine what is better but I just overall look fresher. I will never stop using this and can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after a month.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Feels great!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately we had a really bad experience with this  : My wife bought it as she had acne on forehead,  scars on her right cheek and brown spots on her face : the five star rating and positive reviews a big reason  After using it for 3 weeks...it made her  skin breakout real bad and changed it to a  rough texture. It didn&#x27;t work on acne scars and brown spots either  . May be the heavy dose of Vitamin C was not good for her sensitive skin. The company also offered a free bottle for a positive review  on Amazon but if this serum didnt work then the free bottle is useless ofcourse . Well... you win some you lose some</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this product I&#x27;m using this victamin about 2 weeks now and I see the results my face looks a lot better love it. Happy Mami</li>
    <li> Feels good - I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This serum is truly amazing. I&#x27;m 58 years old, and this makes my skin feel and look more youthful. I would not have believed it, but will not be without this going forward! Bought some for my 31 year old daughter too!</li>
    <li> Can definitely see improvement, especially around neck area. Not sure if I like the dropper for dispensing; but minor detail considering such positive results!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 91 year young mother who at her age is still quite the fashionista and takes great pride in her appearance and was concerned about the dark spots appearing on her face and arms.  I searched the internet looking for something that would be gentle enough for her to try and Life Essentials Vitamin C Serum seemed to fit the bill. She received it promptly and has been using it for almost two weeks and is very pleased with the results.  She says it makes her skin feel so soft and upon first application the skin on her face seemed firmer.  As far as the dark spots, she hasn&#x27;t seen  a big change yet but does notice a slight lightening and believes with routine use they will become much lighter if not disappear completely.  All in all she is very pleased with Life&#x27;s Essential Vitamin C Serum and I am too because I made Mom happy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference, but what works for one person may not work for another. Might be the best serum for someone else, just didn&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff...after reading the reviews, I thought i would try it for my dark spots...I have been using for over a month and my spots are almost gone....I like the smell and its very reasonably priced...will definitely buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 stars, because it works on some dark spots but not all.  The product has to be refrigerated, so it&#x27;s not as convenient to use or take it with me on a trip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of co workers talking about vitamin c serum...I was skeptical until trying this product! I&#x27;ve been using the serum twice a day, morning and evening, for a week now and have noticed a significant difference. My skin is softer an my acne scaring has faded. I highly recommend this product! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Mainly because of the difference it&#x27;s made on my skin and because of how natural the ingredients are.  It took me one week to notice less scars and acne fading quicker if I do breakout. I apply a generous amount at night and follow up with either coconut oil or rosewater. Coconut oil- if my skin is super dry and it&#x27;s winter, Rosewater- if my skin is somewhat dry, irritated, and if it&#x27;s more humid.  I feel more confident doing a &amp;#34;half-up, half-down&amp;#34; hairstyle where you can see the sides of my face because my scars have cleared up (my scars aren&#x27;t pitted but they&#x27;re very stubborn). I used to always put my hair in front of my face because of my acne scars. It helps so much with discoloration. I also apply this serum after showers onto my chest where I have many scars and discoloration. Now I can feel more confident wearing tanks in the summer. I would keep this in the fridge.  The smell is basically odorless if you&#x27;re picky of product smells like I am. The consistency is very &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; and not at all oily. I would put 3-4 drops on my fingers then pat it onto my skin. I hope this works as great for you as it did for me. I also changed my diet to a mostly plant-based diet, which has also helped my skin. So I wouldn&#x27;t depend on this ONE product, but it has worked very well on my skin.  Great product, for a low price. :)</li>
    <li> Initially skeptical, I am thrilled with this product! After just two days of using this, my skin looks brighter, clearer and dark spots that I&#x27;ve had for a few years with no luck lightening, look lighter! I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Great product to healthy and glowing skin .</li>
    <li> thank you so much i love my new essential skin care vitamin c serum, my face is happy also i will order more of your fabulous products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pleasantly scented serum for two days and already seeing results with improved skin tone and texture. I will post before (yikes) photos and after in a future update. Very nice communications from seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this in combination with a micro needle roller. Hey I&#x27;m 55 and what&#x27;s a few needles lol</li>
    <li> I feel like it didnt work for me</li>
    <li> My skin is addicted to this!  What a difference this has made. I&#x27;ve had dry patches on my face for years and had tried several expensive skin serums&lt;br /&gt;with little or no results.  I bought the Life Essentials because of the reviews and am amazed at the change in my skin.  The dry patches are gone!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good about it.  I use it twice a day, morning and night and the results have been far more than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing product and recommend it so much that I&#x27;m ordering a bottle for my sister.</li>
    <li> Feels a bit thick, has a slight OK smell that lasts for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work much as a dark spot remover, but skin did definitely feel a bit tighter and haven&#x27;t spotted new acne.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now for some dark spots on my skin and didn&#x27;t see any difference at all.  It might work for other conditions, but not for dark spots.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks but I have already noticed that my skin is softer, smoother and more even!</li>
    <li> I saw the reviews for this product and thought I would try it out. After a few days, my skin was smoother and more even. I cannot wait to see what it looks like after on month.</li>
    <li> I am so excited to have found this product! I see a big difference in my skin... It&#x27;s glowing again! :) I would definitely recommend this product! It is so reasonably priced too, which is rare with good skin care products... Thank you!</li>
    <li> It has made my face and neck break out</li>
    <li> Great product, it&#x27;s still early but it&#x27;s a great product. I plan to keep using it to see how great it will tighten my aging skin and lighten my age marks. If I get any other results I will post it here, but I really enjoy the product so far.</li>
    <li> I tried this product so i feel that is smoother, this is my 1st week , my dark spot  is begging to light . I hope  that my dark spot disappear  asap.</li>
    <li> Love this product - got here on time - no perfumy smells and works great. My skin already looks better!</li>
    <li> Great serum for the price!  My product arrived within a week of ordering. It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks, but I have already started noticing a slight decrease in the brown spots on my cheek that I have been trying to cover up.  I like the convenient eye-dropper for application.  Aroma is mild and my husband even likes the smell. I use it twice daily and follow it with a Vitamin E lotion.  It does require refrigeration so travel with this product by air may be difficult so I will leave it at home while I am away.  Give it a try, I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  4/8/15:  It has been about four months since I first tried this product.  I have noticed some decrease in the brown spots and some minor wrinkle removing.  However, I am disappointed in one thing about the company.  When the product arrived (Jan 2015) a small card was included which invited me to submit my Amazon review by email so I would receive a &amp;#34;free bottle&amp;#34; of this product.  I submitted my review by email as instructed and NEVER RECEIVED MY &amp;#34;FREE BOTTLE&amp;#34;.  I Have emailed the company twice and visited their website for a phone number but have not  gotten the free product.</li>
    <li> I have had troublesome, bothersome dark spots on my neck area for a while now. I have tried everything from toners to lightening creams but the spots still remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you can guess how surprised I was to find that this serum started removing dark spots from as early as one week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will be getting another bottle!</li>
    <li> I have  spent thousands of dollars on skin products I hoped to work. This product works. I have noticed a vast improvement in my skin. Wrinkles are noticeable improved. so far the dark spot remains. But I have only been using Life Essentials for two weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over two weeks and so far, I love it! My skin is super dry in the winter and it was literally flaking off. I&#x27;ve tried all different kinds of creams (including cortizone and eczema cream)  and most didn&#x27;t help my dry skin and made my chin break out. This serum has been amazing! My dry skin is so much better, it&#x27;s helped with the dark circles under my eyes and the wrinkles around my eyes (which are getting more prominent by the day). I really like this serum and you can&#x27;t beat the price! Definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I tried 2 best seller Amazon VIT C + Hyaluronic acid products, this one works better because it has 20% vitamin C and other ingredients that hold the wrinkles at bay and lighten + moisturize sun spots better. Both products are good, but I was specifically looking for something that would not dry out sun spots so makeup does a better job of covering them up.</li>
    <li> I love it. It refreshed my skin. Dark spots are fading slowly but surely.</li>
    <li> Feels really good on my skin. Dark spots are beginning to fade. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like the product.  I can see results already.  It has lightened the dark spots on my face.  THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I have not used this product for very long, but so far it&#x27;s GREAT!  Nice fragrance, good texture, and feels good!!</li>
    <li> Product arrived fast, and was exactly as described.  I waited to review it until I had used it for a little while.  I am very happy with my purchase and will definitely buy it again.  So far I haven&#x27;t had huge results but I am showing noticeable results.  Also love that it is made in the USA :)</li>
    <li> It is a nice product.  I received it fast.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. I&#x27;m incredibly cynical when it comes to serums, cream or oils that claim to be &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; but this serum has made me put my foot in my mouth. I&#x27;m shocked at how tight my skin is around my eyes. It has been several weeks since someone has said the &amp;#34;you look tired&amp;#34; to me. What a relief! A little goes a long way with this stuff. Momma is back!</li>
    <li> My mother was ranting about vitamin c 20% after seeing it on the Dr. Oz show a year ago...well, I&#x27;m not a huge Dr. Oz fan but this is something he got right. I struggle with melasma, or what is more commonly called dark spots. After 3 weeks of using the vitamin c serum I have seen a lot of fading on my face. It looks like my skin is starting to blend and look even again. I follow up this serum with a moisturizer. I will be sure to update my results! Thanks Life Essentials!</li>
    <li> I have used many Vitamin C serums, this one far exceeded any of the others!! I was so pleased with the results. Results being, I had had an extremely deep chemical peel. And after I was healed, the Life Essentials was exactly the moisture that my skin needed!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is Ah-mazing!  Noticed a major reduction in my acne scaring + dark spots within first 5 days.  Now, I&#x27;m two weeks in and my skin is almost completely clear.  (Even my hubby has noticed.)  Will be using this stuff for ever!!!</li>
    <li> This is for my wife, she likes it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Very good price for 20%. Good is in brown bottle to keep strength. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I have just received life essentials skin care serum and I have already noticed that my dark spots on my face and skin have lightened up. Definitely recommending this product!</li>
    <li> I was recently told by my dermatologist to use Vitamin C amdI purchased the serum.  I notice a difference in my skin in a matter of days.  I love it so much, I ordered it for my sisters and they noticed the same difference.  I feel like my skin feels smoother and looks brighter.  I am so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> This product is moderately effective in leaving the skin soft and supple. However, is essentially ineffective at removing dark spots or wrinkles after only two weeks of application twice a day. Perhaps with the free bottle Life essentials promised with completion of a review  I may eventually see more beneficial results. Additionally the product is overpriced and there is a very small amount in a very tiny bottle. Again,  with a free bottle, if delivered,  the cost and quantity may be more commensurate with similar products.</li>
    <li> My fiance gave me this as part of my Christmas present because I have been struggling with getting my skin clear for months. I waited a while to review to see how I like it. I use it in combination with Tea Tree/Melaluca oil morning and night and I must say I am impressed. My skin does not get dry like it used to. As for acne scars, my skin is still clearing. I had a  major break out after I stopped using BC pills and it&#x27;s taken forever to get my hormones evened out. After using this product with my daily routine I have finally started to see results. It has really helped to reduce my acne and since I&#x27;ve been using it I have purchased 2 more bottles and continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Not sure, have had an outbreak on my face and have had to discontinue.</li>
</ol>
