### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>these worked great to motivate my child to brush his teeth!  </li>
      <li>Great toothbrush!</li>
      <li>The toothbrushes are great!</li>
      <li>Great concept.</li>
      <li>and these are great for him.</li>
      <li>Toothbrushes work good, but I won&#x27;t be ordering from this vendor again.</li>
      <li>purchase experience was good until this time.....</li>
      <li>She sometimes turns off bathroom&#x27;s light and enjoys its beautiful lighting.</li>
      <li>This encourages her to brush her teeth more thoroughly and helps building good aural hygiene habit.</li>
      <li>The toothbrushes are nice toothbrushes by butler.  </li>
      <li>One won&#x27;t light up, another is so bright</li>
      <li>My kids love these tooth brushes.  </li>
      <li>OK Product -</li>
      <li>My kids enjoyed these, but the suctions didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped, so we ended up misplacing them and needing to replace them too soon.</li>
      <li>some are ok.</li>
      <li>When mine wear out I am buying more.</li>
      <li>My girls love these, I let them brush for 1 minute</li>
      <li>Cute, but the bristles fall out each time my son brushes w/ these.</li>
      <li>More of a connection issue.  </li>
      <li>It lit up a couple times and didn&#x27;t work any more.  </li>
      <li>Love that it comes in a variety of colors as well.</li>
      <li>This light up timer is such a great solution that kids and parents both will love!</li>
      <li>These would be great if they actually worked.  </li>
      <li>We opened another one and experienced the same thing.  </li>
      <li>I was happy to see that although they come as a pk of 6 -- they were individually wrapped -- so when I gave them away</li>
      <li>Flashing light timer, bright, cheery, sucker cap on bottom to stick to sink.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, why do they have to tape the toothbrushes to the original container?&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>The flashing timer is great because she gets an idea for how long to brush her teeth.  </li>
      <li>The suction cup at the bottom is a plus for keeping the brush head clean.</li>
      <li>The light is a good idea, and the suction cup should work well, but I&#x27;m thinking the kids will have to grow a little to use these brushes.  </li>
      <li>Fun and colorful.</li>
      <li>They think the brushes are fun</li>
      <li>This works great for our 10 and 7 year old, but will also be the right size for younger kids, too.</li>
      <li>We opened one when we received the package because our 4 year old was so excited for the light up toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Push the bottom and it flashes for two minutes, the right amount of time for kids to brush.  </li>
      <li>My 5 year old daughter loves using this tooth brush with timer light.</li>
      <li>Brush itself is soft to medium and does the job nicely on milk teeth and new adult teeth.</li>
      <li>It has certainly done the trick to get her to brush and to brush longer than she would have with out it.</li>
      <li>I ordered these for my kids and, judging by the picture, I expected a better assortment of colors.  </li>
      <li>Suction cups are a hit and miss, some work really well and</li>
      <li>and Dads are a big fan because it makes brushing fun</li>
      <li>nephews loved it... and the extras mean they can destroy or lose one (or leave it at grandma&#x27;s house) and everyone can rock itout to keep the choppers clean</li>
      <li>look new to me...</li>
      <li>they each looked new and were sanitary.  </li>
      <li>What a terrific item to help make sure kids are brushing long enough.  </li>
      <li>It stays lit for a one-minute cycle, so we have the kids go through two cycles to completely brush.  </li>
      <li>so my 6 year old can push in herself.</li>
      <li>The bristles are also not as soft as I would like.</li>
      <li>I finally had to buy this one in bulk because my 6-year-old loves it so much.  </li>
      <li>These are as big as an adult size toothbrush, which is too long for my 5 and 2-year old grandchildren.  </li>

<li> BUT WHY IN THE WORLD would you create a toothbrush with a timer that is only a minute long when the standard recommended time is 2 minutes?</li>
<li> And the battery lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> since it tells them how long to brush their teeth!</li>
<li> Button to push for light on the bottom is a little difficult to push for the kids other then that it&#x27;s a solid product</li>
<li> Also, the suction cup at the bottom is a little hard to stick -- you have to really press it into the counter.</li>
<li> These are hard to find in my area and my husband likes a soft toothbrush and he likes to adhere it to the mirror of the medicine cabinet to store it</li>
<li> Pretty disappointed, I thought I was getting a decent deal on toothbrushes!</li>
<li> just afraid to use it when the original container was re-taped.</li>
<li> The timer is activated at the base of the toothbrush (where the suction cup is), and easy enough</li>
<li> Use it for other purposes now.</li>
<li> Not sure if that was by design so the child couldn&#x27;t press it, but a 2.5 year old will definitely have a difficult time pressing it himself.</li>
<li> It lasted for less than 5 minutes.  </li>
<li> Plus the little suction cup allows her to stand the toothbrush upright without having to place it in a cup.  </li>
<li> I would&#x27;ve preferred at least 1 of every color and a max of 2 of one color.</li>
<li> I was confused by the picture and the quantity</li>
<li> Nothing is wrong with the toothbrush itself...</li>
<li> 4 stars instead of 5, because the bottom button is very difficult to press.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed in the quality.</li>

    <li> My son loves these and now will not brush without a lighted toothbrush.  Great concept.</li>
    <li> these worked great to motivate my child to brush his teeth!  4 stars instead of 5, because the bottom button is very difficult to press.  Not sure if that was by design so the child couldn&#x27;t press it, but a 2.5 year old will definitely have a difficult time pressing it himself.</li>
    <li> Grandkids like the lights and the timer. Use it for other purposes now.</li>
    <li> The toothbrushes are great! I was confused by the picture and the quantity, I thought I would be receiving 24 toothbrushes, not just 6.  Pretty disappointed, I thought I was getting a decent deal on toothbrushes!</li>
    <li> The toothbrushes are nice toothbrushes by butler.  Push the bottom and it flashes for two minutes, the right amount of time for kids to brush.  They think the brushes are fun so it&#x27;s easier to get them to brush.  A winner!</li>
    <li> They blink for about 1 min, which my kids like - since it tells them how long to brush their teeth!</li>
    <li> One won&#x27;t light up, another is so bright it&#x27;s noxious. The bristles are also not as soft as I would like. Kids like them well enough though.</li>
    <li> Nothing is wrong with the toothbrush itself...I have ordered this item from different vendor before.&lt;br /&gt;My purchase experience was good until this time.....&lt;br /&gt;However, why do they have to tape the toothbrushes to the original container?&lt;br /&gt;They look new to me...just afraid to use it when the original container was re-taped. Who knows what is going on with these toothbrushes...</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my kids and, judging by the picture, I expected a better assortment of colors.  Toothbrushes work good, but I won&#x27;t be ordering from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> We bought these as a 6 pack.  We opened one when we received the package because our 4 year old was so excited for the light up toothbrush.  It lit up a couple times and didn&#x27;t work any more.  We opened another one and experienced the same thing.  It lasted for less than 5 minutes.  On to our third one and it seems to be working for now but it&#x27;s only been one night.  So of the 6 pack, 2 definitely didn&#x27;t work and we still have 3 unopened so I can&#x27;t speak for them.  It doesn&#x27;t appear you can change the batteries nor does it seem to be a battery issue.  More of a connection issue.  These would be great if they actually worked.  Very disappointed in the quality.</li>
    <li> I used these as part of our Halloween party favor gifts for my daughter&#x27;s class of 3 to 4 year olds --- (instead of candy). I was happy to see that although they come as a pk of 6 -- they were individually wrapped -- so when I gave them away they each looked new and were sanitary.  Mine had a purple too. I also like this product because both boys and girls like it.</li>
    <li> What a terrific item to help make sure kids are brushing long enough.  It stays lit for a one-minute cycle, so we have the kids go through two cycles to completely brush.  This works great for our 10 and 7 year old, but will also be the right size for younger kids, too.</li>
    <li> Cute, but the bristles fall out each time my son brushes w/ these.</li>
    <li> OK Product - the brush part of the toothbrush is pretty small.  Definitely not meant for anyone over toddler age.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old daughter loves using this tooth brush with timer light. She sometimes turns off bathroom&#x27;s light and enjoys its beautiful lighting. This encourages her to brush her teeth more thoroughly and helps building good aural hygiene habit. The suction cup at the bottom is a plus for keeping the brush head clean.</li>
    <li> I finally had to buy this one in bulk because my 6-year-old loves it so much.  The flashing timer is great because she gets an idea for how long to brush her teeth.  Plus the little suction cup allows her to stand the toothbrush upright without having to place it in a cup.  Great toothbrush!</li>
    <li> This light up timer is such a great solution that kids and parents both will love! The timer is activated at the base of the toothbrush (where the suction cup is), and easy enough so my 6 year old can push in herself. Love that it comes in a variety of colors as well. It has certainly done the trick to get her to brush and to brush longer than she would have with out it. BUT WHY IN THE WORLD would you create a toothbrush with a timer that is only a minute long when the standard recommended time is 2 minutes? Bummed about that. Also, the suction cup at the bottom is a little hard to stick -- you have to really press it into the counter.</li>
    <li> Flashing light timer, bright, cheery, sucker cap on bottom to stick to sink. No problem for the kids to use and get used to spending time on dental care. Brush itself is soft to medium and does the job nicely on milk teeth and new adult teeth.</li>
    <li> My girls love these, I let them brush for 1 minute then I do my part for them the turn it back on for another minutes, and didn&#x27;t break the bank</li>
    <li> These are hard to find in my area and my husband likes a soft toothbrush and he likes to adhere it to the mirror of the medicine cabinet to store it and these are great for him.</li>
    <li> My kids enjoyed these, but the suctions didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped, so we ended up misplacing them and needing to replace them too soon.</li>
    <li> My kids love these tooth brushes.  I had kids that looked forward to brushing their teeth after buying these.  And the battery lasts a long time.  When mine wear out I am buying more.</li>
    <li> Button to push for light on the bottom is a little difficult to push for the kids other then that it&#x27;s a solid product</li>
    <li> Fun and colorful. Though my kids don&#x27;t use the timer for it&#x27;s intended purpose. Suction cups are a hit and miss, some work really well and some are ok. Also, I got a bag with 4 purples out of 6 toothbrushes! I would&#x27;ve preferred at least 1 of every color and a max of 2 of one color. (Not 4!) Either way I still like the toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> These are as big as an adult size toothbrush, which is too long for my 5 and 2-year old grandchildren.  The light is a good idea, and the suction cup should work well, but I&#x27;m thinking the kids will have to grow a little to use these brushes.  Would have waited if I&#x27;d realized the size.</li>
    <li> nephews loved it... and the extras mean they can destroy or lose one (or leave it at grandma&#x27;s house) and everyone can rock itout to keep the choppers clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moms and Dads are a big fan because it makes brushing fun</li>
