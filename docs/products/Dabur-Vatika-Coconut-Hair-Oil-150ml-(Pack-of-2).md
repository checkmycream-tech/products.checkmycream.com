<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The oil is wonderful, but someone buying it should know. It comes solid. I live in the Eastern part of the USA and I ordered and recieved this product in December of 09. It is now April 2010 and the product has not \\&quot;thawed\\&quot; out. So I thought people should know- the quality is great- has a light scent somewhat a pleasant lemon scent- NOT like furniture polish at all. The oil texture is light, a olive oil appearance and slight olive oil texture. Since the day I recieved this product I have had to place the container in hot tap water for about five minutes. The product should be fully melted in that time. It does return to a solid state once cooled. I am sure in warmer climates or seasons it would be fully liquid. Like I stated, it is 4-2010 and it is still in solid form. The oil has various herbal ingredients with a fresh lite smell  You get two containers- small- but the oil is great quality. Good for ethnic hair mainly or a very small amount on other hair types. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This oil is great, it has Amla, Hena, Lemon and other great herbs that will make your hair feels healthy, glowing, and if you have bleached your hair white, then you will find magic retrieving your hair color back to normal dark in no time</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. Makes my hair very soft and manageable. Smells wonderful. If you are unfamiliar with coconut oil, it is typically solid--even the cooking variety. You just have to set it in a mug warm water (or boiled water and make yourself some tea at the same time :-) and it melts into a useable liquid in no time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, I don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my hair, and I don&#x27;t see an improvement of health in my hair. I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product, it is just a bad product for me.</li>
    <li> Seller sent item fast. So far I really like Vatika oil...I added it to my perm before applying to my hair and my hair came out super shiny and moisturzed would recommend to anyone with dry hair.</li>
    <li> I used it and it really gets into your hair...makes it quite smooth. Smells nice and early, natural smell. Can be a little hard to get out of bottle. Its white, and as it warms in your hands in turns into oil. Not sure if i noticed a big difference in my hair. I use Giovanni shampoo, and it tends to leave my hair a bit dry, so I use this on a weekly basis, to put a little moisture back into it. Was kind of hard to wash out.</li>
    <li> I use this as a scalp oil and it does leave my hair a lot softer. As far as making my hair thicker, Im not sure, my hair has always been thick so I can&#x27;t really vouch for that. It has a pleasant smell, it kind of smells like a coconut pastry, if you do not like coconut or REALLY sweeet smells than I would not recommend this, it is quite strong. Im vegan but this product is only vegetarian. I did not realize that this had milk in it so when Im done with the last two bottles I will not be buying again. Still a really good scalp oil, it can also be used when flat ironing hair. It leaves a really nice subtle shine.  Full list of ingredients:  Coconut Oil, Neem, Brahmi, Fruit extracts of Amla, Bahera and Harar, Kapur Kachri, Henna, Milk, Rosemary Oil, Lemon Oil, TBHQ, Fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and I received a great surprise. This product actually darkened my grays and greatly reduced the amount of visible gray hair. It does contain henna, so now I can hide my grays without having to buy hair dyes anymore. A little goes a long way! Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the greatest hair products Ive found.. I am a natural hair stylist of many years and I use this oil on many of my natural clients.  It also works on relaxed hair but not as well.  The ppl that have written bad reviews for this product may not have knowledge of natural oils or how to use them.  This product does not smell like something you would find in a typical beauty store, mainly because it is a NATURAL product and not filled with ingredients that are placed in many of those cheap hair growth-stunting products.  To get the best results from this product, use it on damp hair. If used on dry hair, use only a very small amount This products is a very lightweight oil and I use it on my own hair and it adds a brilliant shine..I also use it on my son to twist his hair after washing and it provides great manageability and softens his hair a lot.  The oil is solid when u receive it but u can just put it in a cup of warm water for a few moments or microwave it for about 15 seconds. I hope my review can help someone else out there.</li>
    <li> This product did not come as a liquid. It was solid in the container and impossible to get out. I don&#x27;t know if was ruined by getting frozen in the transportation process, but it is no good.</li>
    <li> Alot of people have complained about how stiff or mushy the product is. when i first got it, it was solid. like shea butter or maybe even thicker or harder then say crisco. my house has a steady temp of about 70-75 degrees. after a few hours the product is now moist and has a consistency of maybe vaseline or even better shampoo or conditioner. you have to pierce a hole at the top which i used scissors for and it spurts out just fine (no difficulties). since its made from coconut it does have a light smell of coconut which isnt bad. i add this product to a spray bottle with my favorite smelling oils to create a spritz. if you want to do that look up [[ASIN:B000W3V6US Lemon 100% Pure Essential Oil -10 ml]] natural oils on here. i use lemon grass, orange and lemon. lemon grass is the strongest of the three for smells and only requires 4 drops in a 8 ounces. im also thinking about using this product with shea butter to create a paste to apply directly to my scalp and maybe add some tea tree oil and other oils. im a natural, black, with type 4a hair. its dry and crunchy as hell and im hoping this product will help moisten my scalp and soften my hair. i will post later on the effects so far. hope this helps!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited about receiving this and nervous, too. I wanted to put it on and leave it on over night, but my two boys can smell things a block away and I thought they&#x27;d constantly complain about \\&quot;What&#x27;s that smell?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, to my complete surprise and delight, not one of them asked me the question. My little one did ask if I had coconut on my hair, which I replied, Yes...sort of. For me the smell reminded me of a very strong old fashioned soap that isn&#x27;t perfumed. I thought it smelled clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the results. I kept it in overnight. When I washed and hair-dried, my hair is so soft and manageable. It might have even turned it darker. I bought it mostly to darken my hair and draw out the grays, so I&#x27;m very happy. I do wish the bottle was bigger, but the order comes in two&#x27;s. One bottle should last me a about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very satisfied and happy with the results.</li>
    <li> So far, this product has been great. My scalp was very dry, and this has been the first product to make a noticeable difference after just a couple of applications. It smells good also.    The biggest issue with the product is, as other reviewers have noted, is that it turns into a solid. Before you use it, you have to put the bottle in a bowl of hot water for about 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li> The oil smile too strong and it is too oilish, and it does not work, I am disappointed. I felt of nasty when I applied the oil on my hair.</li>
    <li> This product has brought new life to my hair and scalp. The great benefits for me was healthy, shiny, and bouncy hair with great lift, since my hair is fine and flat. No more dry, frizzy, and lifeless hair it has been given a new lease on life! Being invigorated and vibrant has given it great elasticity and less breakage which is why it is deemed as a sumptously silky. This product is great as a daily moisturizer and leave in conditioner, it may work for you!</li>
    <li> i have been using coconut oil on my hair for a long time but this stuff is like coconut oil on steroids. for the past few years my hairline has been receding.  my mother and grandmother also had receding hairlines so i thought that would also be my fate.  after using this oil for a few months, i noticed my hairline growing back. i almost have the hairline of my youth.  i used to wear a glue in weave and the glue removal left my hair broken and thinning. my hair was so damaged that i had to do \\&quot; the big chop.\\&quot;  i decided to go natural after that.  i find my hair is much thicker now and really strong.  i will still use coconut oil on my skin but i will use vatika on my hair.</li>
    <li> I am an african american with natural hair, and I had researched this oil on youtube.com before purchasing it on here.  I love it! It arrived on time, and the product makes my hair feel amazing.  I use it in my hair mixes along with shea butter and other oils.  I finally see what the hype was all about.  If you have natural hair, then I suggest that you invest in this oil.  You can use it alone as a hot oil treatment or mix it in with other items.  All in all....great product!</li>
    <li> I just love this product, I have been using it for about 3 weeks now. I do use it like 2 times a week because my hair was really damaged at ends. I put it on at night (put a towel on pillow) on a loose ponytail and wash it in the morning. Like some other people I have seen my gray hairs start to disappear, it is so good not to go have to buy  hair color within 2-3 weeks of putting on. I think its the henna, I love it though!!!!!LOVE IT..Will definitely order more!</li>
    <li> I did it.     I tried this stuff on my hair and my partner&#x27;s hair just to see if the hype was warranted. I have locs and when I mixed this oil with my typical hempseed/plain coconut oil blend, it was like putting octane in a car. My locs were super soft, roots were wavy and my scalp drank its&#x27; fill! Dandruff? What dandruff? This stuff and henna will make dandruff a distant memory. My scalp is always tingling, so methinks the Vatika is working its&#x27; magic.    The real test was with my partner. He has coarse, angry biracial hair that can never be tamed and is always stupidly brillo like. I slapped this stuff on his head, as he howled in protest, put it in a braid and sent him on his way. He came to me this morning with his hair down and he looked like a different person! His hair was wavy, curly and after he shampooed, he had huge ringlets! His brush had very little broken hair.     0_0 Say. Whut.    Ladies and gents, I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair magic they do in India, but I&#x27;m giving credit where credit is due; if you&#x27;ve had a bad hair day for most of your life, get this stuff by the case. It&#x27;s magic, I tellz ya. Magic.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this indian coconut oil but I put it on my hair and literally my hair my NOTICEABLE softer!!! I was in total shock. The product looked like lard but quickly turned to oil when in your hands.  The smell was not great either, but the difference it made was worth it!</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic! It nourished my hair instantly. I left it on with a Shower cap and when I washed it, my hair was silky soft! Amazing! Love it!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried that this product might 1. smell too strong and 2. be hard to rinse out. However, neither of those things turned out to be true. It smells like any other herbal-type beauty product and I find the smell to be light and pleasant. It also rinses out just fine. I usually leave it in for an hour or two and my hair is always super soft, shiny, and manageable afterwards. A little goes a long way, too. I used it constantly through a Michigan winter, and still have some of the first bottle left. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wow!!!! I am way into my fourty&#x27;s and I have very course textured hair. I also have colored treated hair that is (was)very dry. This product has done wonders for my hair instantly. Where have you been Dabur Vatika Coconut Hair Oil all my life. Instantly I now have smooth, soft, managble hair. My hair has luster that it has never had before with out the sticky residue that hair lotions leave. This has added perfect natural mositure to my hair. Soft, I can hardly stop running my fingers through my own soft hair that I has never felt like this before. I highly recommended this product to anyone who has course dry, chemically treated hair such as mine. This prouduct is every bit of a five and more in the ratings. You will not be disappointed!Small amounts goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I was less than impressed with this coconut oil for the hair. It didn&#x27;t do a thing, didn&#x27;t even smell good at the very least so needless to say, it was a waste of money and worse yet, it cost almost as much to ship as I paid for the product. Will not be ordering hair products anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this after observing my Indian roommate using hair oils on her scalp. It&#x27;s fantastic. I stick it in a cup of hot water in the afternoon after my daily run to get the oil into liquid form.  Then I massage it into my scalp and the ends of my hair, clip it up into a bun, and then eat dinner.  When I shower, I only shampoo twice on my bangs, because they get oily faster if I don&#x27;t.  Otherwise, this oil leaves my hair shiny and soft.  I don&#x27;t even mind the smell at all. It&#x27;s kind of herbal and pleasant.  I&#x27;m Asian and have thick, wavy hair that frizzes.  If you use this hair oil, you can also use other hair products like leave in conditioner. BUT. Don&#x27;t use any additional oils in your hair.  I usually put Moroccan Oil or Macadamia Nut oil in and it won&#x27;t soak in because it&#x27;s already saturated. You end up looking like an oily mess all day.</li>
    <li> As much as I love this product and how it smells and softens my hair, I have just realized that TBHQ is in it, which is considered to be a carcinogen. Does anyone have any idea about how safe this product is if being used each day?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product once a week for the past 3 weeks as a pre-poo treatment and so far I love the oil. It has a nice scent(reminds me of Wella Balsam shampoo). My hair has gotten stronger and looks healthier. It has made my hair a little hard the first two times I used it. I think it was due to the henna so in addition I mixed the Vatika w/Nutiva coconut oil last week and my hair feels so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been transitioning for 20 months now and since I have incorporated coconut oil in my hair regimen for the past 7 months, my hair has improved greatly. I wanted to try the Vatika oil as well because of the great reviews. I will post another review in 3 months to let everyone know how much more it has affected my hair. So far, I have nothing negative to say about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the ones who have been don&#x27;t like using the bottle, after you get it open, and heat it, transfer it to a applicator bottle. It makes it easier to see how much you have left and it is easier to control the amount that comes out.</li>
    <li> This product sucks, is not even an oil, it&#x27;s so tick that you can not get it out. I would not recommend this product to anyone...</li>
    <li> As you might read from the reviews, people use this product in different ways---as a leave-in conditioner, prior to shampooing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a little bit of the product in my hair as you would Biosilk or a hair shine.  You only need a very small amount.  This took away the frizzies for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, right before I showered, I put some in my hair, then shampooed my hair once, washed, and used only a little bit of my regular conditioner.  When I blow-dried my hair, it looked like I had stepped out of the salon.  It had a silky sheen with volume and helped the blowdryer to give additional straightness to the hair with bounce.  This is a superb product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is kind of thick, but once you put it in your palm, it liquefies.  The scent is like a very mild botanical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small amount on the scalp felt refreshing and seems to help moisturize the scalp without clogging the pores.</li>
    <li> Know that you will only receive 1 bottle...not 2....Misleading advertisment as compared to other info. and sites....You will receive 1 300ml bottle...not 2.</li>
    <li> This is a really wonderful product. I will always purchase it.  I have long straight hair, and sometimes I like to oil it up at night so that I can refine it.  This does that.  It makes your hair so soft after you wash it out, its wonderful.  I live in Florida, so it so hot and dry outside right now, and it affects your hair.  I recommend it this.  My  husband has thick short hair and it does amazing things for him as well.</li>
    <li> I just moved over seas, and the change of humidity and temperature ruined my scalp. I have tried every single anti-dandruff product on the shelf, I&#x27;ve stripped and built, I&#x27;ve spent heaps on expensive shampoos and soaps, but nothing worked. Not even coal tar hair products.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a few things off of Amazon, and this was the first one to arrive. I drenched my hair in it last night after washing it, then washed it out this morning. (took two washes to feel not greasy enough.) It took a very long time for my hair to dry...&lt;br /&gt;The time spent shampooing, the oily sensation last night, the extended length of drying time... I would take them all 200 fold to have these results.&lt;br /&gt;My dandruff is totally gone. Not a flake or itch. My scalp is clear and my hair smells awesome. Like coconut macaroons. I love this product. It was so cheap and so effective. I was expecting to at least use it a few times before any result, FIRST TIME 100% CLEAR.&lt;br /&gt;I really can not say enough for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a go. Even if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, what have you lost? &amp;lt;$10.</li>
    <li> I guess this product is exactly what was advertised, but still not what I expected. It is a very viscous oil, and wil make your hair greasy and slimey when you apply it. It is recommended that you leave it in your hair overnight, but don&#x27;t do this unless you want your pillowcase to look like the bottom of a french fry basket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil does not smell anything like coconut. My kids think I smell like rotten pickles when I use it. I think it smells more like an Asian seafood marinade. Regardless, it&#x27;s not a look or smell you will find desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It congeals to a solid between uses, and has to be heated to turn it back into a liquid. Not interolerable, but inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the effect on my hair, I can&#x27;t say as I have noticed a significant difference. I have been using regularly for about 2 weeks, and while I have no particular complaints about my hair, neither have I noticed any difference in it. I have to believe that I can get similar or greater benefits from other hair oils with less of these unpleasant other qualities.</li>
    <li> Este aceite es excelente! Lo compre para mi hija que tiene el pelo largo y rizado, con sus clases de natacion lo tenia muy opaco y reseco.  El aceite le sano el cabello, ahora esta de nuevo sedodo y manejable.  Yo no lo habia usado porque tengo el cabello muy corto y temia me quedara grasoso.  Para mi sorpresa me le da volumen y se ve mas sano y brillante. Yo lo recomiendo ampliamente.</li>
    <li> good to use as a treatment product  to add a lot of moisture.  i put it on generously, massage it into my scalp, and let it sit for a few hours while i do housework, then wash out.  but it&#x27;s not something i can use and then go out into public with.  i can tell it&#x27;s good for my hair &amp; scalp...my hair feels healthier &amp; stronger since i&#x27;ve been using it...but even just using a few drops used sparingly on the ends of my mid-back length hair makes it look too oily.  i LOVE the scent!    it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle, because as most coconut oils are, it&#x27;s a solid at room temperature.  i&#x27;ve put it into a larger-mouthed container, which makes it possible to scoop out a dab, instead of having to try to squeeze it out.  that helps.</li>
    <li> So amazing! I love using this as a treatment in my hair over night and when I wash it out my hair is soft and feels so healthy! I love it, I got one for me and one for my mom and now she&#x27;s hooked too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for two days. I put in on my scalp and ends of my hair after I towel dry it after washing in the mornings while my hair is still damp. My hair was extremely dry and I have already noticed a major difference. It is very soft now. I have mixed (black and white) very curly, long hair. The oil looks very thick in the bottle, but just put a small amount in your hands and it melts instantaneously. I would buy again and have already recommended to friends.</li>
    <li> I had no problems with the order process or the product. Received the hair oil quickly and it was exactly what I was looking for. A small amount does wonders and I love the way the oil smells. Will certainly purchase again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product,  I use it in my conditioner, when I henna my hair, when my hair is dry... all the time.  Makes my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> Works great for pre poo&#x27;s and transistioner. I&#x27;m relaxed and considering going natural. 20 weeks post! This makes my hair feel strong. I DO NOT leave in or apply everyday. I have been using this product on me and my DH 3b/c hair every week before shampooing.</li>
    <li> I use a variety of oils on my hair and this one is definitely a favorite of mine. I love coconut oil, so the fact that this product is a combination of that and other great oils/ingredients convinced me to buy it. (I&#x27;d been hearing a lot of good things about this product as well). I have long, thick, relaxed hair, and I use about a quarter-sized amount on my entire head of hair after moisturizing. It makes my hair very soft, shiny, and manageable! I am on the fence about whether or not I like it better than plain coconut oil, but it is at least just as good! I was a little afraid of how it would smell since I&#x27;d been reading generally negative remarks about the smell, but I actually like it. It smells lemony, with a hint of coconut. The lemony smell makes it smell a bit like a cleaning product, though, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.     The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the packaging. There is a hole in the top of the bottle (you need to puncture it in order to make the hole) that you have to pour it out of. The oil comes out quickly, which means that it&#x27;s easy to pour out more than you need. It also gets pretty messy because what didn&#x27;t go into your hand after you&#x27;re done pouring will leak down the side of the bottle (this is also a waste of oil!). Additionally, I live in Chicago and it&#x27;s winter, so I have to heat this bottle up every time I want to use it because the coconut oil solidifies in cold temperatures. A jar would be a much more appropriate container for a coconut oil-based product.     Here are the ingredients, for those interested: Coconut Oil, Neem, Brahmi, Fruit extracts of Amla, Bahera and Harar, Kapur Kachri, Henna, Milk, Rosemary Oil, Lemon Oil, TBHQ (t-butyl hydroquinone), Fragrance.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, or what. But something is very wrong with this product. It had tiny crystallized chunks in it. I put it in my hair after washing and my hair was full of these tiny little rocky pieces from the product! I had to wash it all over again. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have thin &amp; damaged hair. I used this and for days had greasy hair. I&#x27;m sure that this is great for other, but it was not for me. I&#x27;d rather use a simple in shower hair masque.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know you had to wash this out it doesn&#x27;t say that on the bottle I&#x27;ve been leave it in like a leave in conditioner my hair is a lot softer and my curls were moister for longer after washing i will have to wash out next time but it didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair leaving it in so i don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a problem my hair was a lot easier to manage and comb out.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this hair product, but I still made the trek to an Indian store to try it out. All I can say is that I&#x27;m glad I did. I have only tried it out twice so far, and it has completely transformed my previously dehydrated, over processed, and frizzy hair to shiny, bouncy, silky, and tangle-free hair that I can&#x27;t stop touching. I mix in a little mustard oil with the oil, so it might be the mix that&#x27;s doing the trick, and I leave the mixture in overnight. The only con is the smell: it&#x27;s beyond bad. It smells sickly sweet and might be a deal breaker for some.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try this because of all the great reviews.  I have very fine hair and since I use natural shampoos, it can be a little on the dry side.  So, I purchased this wonderful coconut hair oil to help.  I should have tried it out on the weekend to make sure the effect if would have on my hair.  Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t..... so before I left for work one day, I washed my hair and put this oil on, then let it sit for a few minutes before I washed it out.  Then I went to work, letting my hair dry naturally (I don&#x27;t ever blow dry my hair).  But, it never dried...actually, it was saturated with oil still even though I washed it out.  Thank goodness I never put conditioner on the top part of my hair, only from the crown down.  Otherwise it would have been so much worse!  I took an early lunch to run home and shampoo my hair again.  Thank goodness I don&#x27;t live very far from my job!  It felt so disgusting and oily!  The girls at work thought it was pretty funny, and I had to laugh, too.  It was seriously oily!!!  So, after I washed my hair with shampoo, (I obviously didn&#x27;t condition again!), I sat in front of my fan to read and let my hair dry.  After it dried, my lunch break over, I headed back to work with nice clean hair.  I was really impressed with how shiny and soft my hair was after it dried, especially because I didn&#x27;t condition it after washing it again.  Normally, I always have to condition, otherwise my hair is a tangled mess.  But, I didn&#x27;t want to chance having greasy hair still, so I took my chances.  So, please learn from my mistake....if you have fine hair this is what I recommend... Wash your hair, then apply this coconut oil and let it sit for a few minutes, then shampoo your hair again.... and let dry.  And you will hopefully have wonderful soft and shiny hair like I did.  I am very pleased with this product, after finding a way for it to work for me.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this oil for a week, but I have already noticed a change in my hair texture and my scalp.  I used this after shampooing my hair by just adding it to my regular conditioner.  I rinsed my hair thoroughly and it was just fine (not at all oily).  I use it daily as well; in the evening right before I wrap my hair (just a nickle sized amount will do...TRUST).  By morning, my hair is silky smooth and looks like I just got a relaxer.  This product has also helped with my dandruff.  My dandruff usually tends to pop up about 3 days after a wash and its been one full week and still no signs of dandruff.  This product does harden so you will have to sit it in hot water for about a minute or so but I can appreciate that because it validates the naturalness of this product.  The smell isn&#x27;t that bad either. I am pleased with this product and will be trying out other products from Dabur.  I will post another review in about 3 months (if I remember lol) to share my more long term experience with this product.</li>
    <li> congealed like jelly unable to use would not come out of vial&lt;br /&gt;unpleasant smell unable to use did not hear back from seller when I emailed them Re: this.&lt;br /&gt;I think it may have been outdated?</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of the reviews on here, I can&#x27;t believe how dumb people really are. Coconut oil hardens when it is below 73 degrees. You can pop the bottle in the microwave for ten seconds to get it soft again. Anyway, I think it smells amazing, I saturate my hair with this before coloring with henna and indigo. I occasionally will leave it on overnight, just make sure you put a towel on your pillow or put a shower cap on.</li>
    <li> I was overseas for a little while and I watched what the Indians and Nepalese do with coconut hair oils (this Dabur oil is also made in India, but this particular one from Amazon is made in Europe). They apply in the evening and keep it on overnight (you should wrap your hair or use a protective pillow case) or if they&#x27;re not going anywhere they&#x27;ll comb it through their hair and braid it until they&#x27;re ready to wash it out. I&#x27;ve started doing likewise and now have more manageable, tangle free and silky hair using this product. The coconut smell is great and natural like real coconuts and not artificial. It doesn&#x27;t take but a few drops to cover my long, thick hair, and the applicator makes it easy to get just the right amount. It washes out easily. I wash my hair twice leaving the shampoo on for a few minutes the second time through and rinse well. I use my regular conditioner. I was very happy to see there was no oily buildup. I use this product about once every week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The product does solidify (natural coconut oils do this when they get cool below 75 degrees), but that doesn&#x27;t mean it has gone bad. You just remove the rubber part and squeeze some in your hand. Rub your hands together and the warmth will liquify it instantly. My hair has never looked better. I love this stuff! I have less dandruff, my hair color is more uniform, my waves are more defined and surprisingly I can go longer between washes.</li>
    <li> My hair been falling off alot I have try some many products none of them works until I discover Vatika Coconut oil.  I&#x27;ve been using Vatika hair oil for about 3months now I have seen the different about my hair soft, smooth and fuller. I&#x27;m so glad whoever made this product and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is another product I bought after reading rave reviews from different hair boards.  I wish I bought more.  I love this stuff!!  The scent is light and it gives my hair a nice sheen without looking greasy.  I use this in my treatment before I wash my hair and after when my hair is dry.</li>
    <li> I was a little surprised by the size of the bottle [5.07 oz each]. Anyway, I like how it makes my hair feel. My hair is soft but this makes it feel even softer. The product is very thick so a little goes a long way. I love using it on freshly washed hair. I use a small amount [the size of a dime] and rub it on my ends and through my hair. It has a nice citrus like scent which I like. It doesn&#x27;t weight the hair down while giving the hair a nice sheen. I love the fact that ALL the ingredients are natural and beneficial to the hair.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time, was well-packaged, and was as I expected it to be based on the description. Excellent product quality, as well.</li>
    <li> I have use plenty of oils on my hair (wet and dry hair)and this is THE BEST stuff I have ever used. It makes my hair really really soft, helps my hair to grow, and it smells wonderful. I apply it on my hair before going to bed at night just to wake up to soft, manageable natural hair. I did my research and the reviews was nothing but the truth. I love it and will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, dry, damaged hair. I have not been able to find anything that works at all! After being in the sun all day, I put this in my hair, covered it with a shower cap, and left it for an hour before rinsing it out. After shampooing and conditioning, I let my hair air dry, and it feels SO soft already! This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve read countless reviews on countless products, but this is the first i&#x27;ve ever written....i&#x27;ve been oiling my hair every night for a week now--oil, cover with a shower cap, and wash out and condition in the morning. i can&#x27;t believe the results! especially for a product that is this cheap! the smell is not the most indulgent, but it washes out easily, and leaves my dry, coarse, thick, and seriously PROCESSED hair smooth, soft, and healthy looking, ALL DAY! i&#x27;ve taken a couple courses of Accutane to cure my acne, but consequently has made my skin and hair incredibly dry. i&#x27;ve been looking for something to get my hair back into shape-to get that virgin hair shine and smoothness.  this stuff is better than all the expensive salon products i&#x27;ve been buying. to top it of, it&#x27;s SUCH a good price, and came in a couple days!</li>
    <li> I use this product before every wash, and I swear it makes my hair so strong! It does not have the best smell, but it really is a great prepoo treatment; I think it allows the hair to remain soft after washing and it keeps itching and dandruff away.</li>
    <li> You have to warm this to turn it to oil/liquid to put it on your hair. Smells great. I use it as a deep conditioner and it leaves my hair super shiny. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used after I put in some natural hair color for the first time. First off you will have to put it in a hot cup of water to make it liquid. Just put the whole bottle down in the hot water. It will liquefy super fast. Its very oily as it come out. I let it sit in my hair for about 15 to 20min. It can stay in over night but it&#x27;s really not needed. My hair was not oily. It was shiny and soft. Thumbs up</li>
    <li> This prodcut is o.k. It smells wonderful,i will admit i have just began to use this so i will have to see the results. it claims to condition the hair and help it grow in thicker. it did soften my hair but i do recommened to rise seriously after every use. let sit in hair hair for aboput 20 mins then rise.</li>
    <li> Okay hair oil.  Four stars for the weird lemony smell but overall it&#x27;s okay.  I have yet to see it make my hair thick but I havent made it through the bottle yet.  I read a lot a hype about this product so I may have been expecting too much but if you can easily get this at your local indian market I say go for it.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the product, makes my hair very soft. Be warned... a little goes a long way, you do not need a lot to cover your entire head. The shipping cost was too high, I will purchase product again, but will order from a different source.</li>
    <li> I use a small amount on my towel dried hair after I get out of the shower. I have naturally curly, hard to manage hair but with this product, I could get out of the shower and leave my hair down without adding any other products to it. I love it! I like that it came in a pack of two because I will definitely be using the 2nd bottle. The bottle instructions says to leave it on overnight for best results and I have found that this helps me de-tangle my hair in the morning.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this product melts in my hand, which makes it easy to throw in a purse or suitcase with no worries. I&#x27;ve heard great things about this from friends but I&#x27;ve only used it three or four times. I&#x27;m fact I forgot I bought it until Amazon requested a review. I liked the light feel but my hair holds odors and I don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like a spice rack. Maybe I&#x27;ll try it as a hot oil treatment since it would be rinsed out.</li>
    <li> Cannot live without this product makes my hair so soft especially when trying to stretch out the time between relaxers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on the reviews and I am so happy I did... The smell is outstanding but the effects are remarkable..My hair is so thick and healthy.My hair is permed and this is a must have for me.</li>
    <li> I am a female in my late 20’s with thin, chemically-processed hair. I purchased Dabur Vatika Enriched Coconut Hair Oil to use as a deep treatment for my hair. I originally came across some YouTube reviewers who recommended it highly so I went ahead and purchased this product in 2010 and have been using it ever since. I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is relatively small and compact. The oil’s fragrance was a new scent to me when I first opened the bottle. it was very pungent- the coconut oil, lemon, and henna was a pleasant surprise that I have learned to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At room temperature the oil is solidified, so you must heat the oil to rub it through your tresses. This can be done either by heating the bottle in the microwave or in a bowl of warm water. After is has been heated, it turns into a clear liquid that can be easily massaged and combed throughout your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I have rubbed it into my hair and scalp, I usually leave it on for about an hour and maybe run it a few minutes under the dryer to really penetrate the hair shaft.  Because the oil is light, I can do other things while it is in my hair, like watch TV or fold clothes for example. It does not drip down your neck. I then rinse it out in the shower and condition as normal. Sometimes I will even use this oil as a shine serum after I have styled my hair for a glossy effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great. My hair always feels softer and bouncier after each use. When I first started using it my hair felt immediately better, but after using this product for several years, the overall condition of my hair has improved. And, at a price of only $8, this product will last a long time. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for hair growth. It has my hair very soft and manageable with absolutely no breakage.  For hair growth clip your hair ends then apply this hair oil during the day or before going to bed at night, You will not be disappointed. I no longer use grease and leave in creams to moisturize my hair because this oil does such a great job.</li>
    <li> Fabulous deep conditioner! The herbs literally tingle on your scalp and hair. I bought my 300ml bottle for $4.00 at Lakshmi&#x27;s Cupboard (an online store) - it was totally worth the price. My hair detangled so much easier when I used it - felt softer too when it dried.</li>
    <li> My 79-year-old husband uses this before every shampoo and it has made his dark Italian hair much healthier and any grey he had is disappearing.  Also, the thin areas seem to be filling in again.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.... smells just like Sweet Potato Pie!! Duh it may arrive solid... warm it up for a few seconds and wallah! its a liquid again! Basic Chemistry... lol... This product leaves my hair feeling more moisturized than any other. I was only about a week and a half into using the product when I ordered another because I couldn&#x27;t imagine my life without this Coconut Oil!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I have long, thick hair with a slight wave. It has been a nightmare taking care of it especially since we have hard water issue in our house. It was always frizzy and unmanageable. I would drown it in conditioners but it never lasted. I even considered ovation therapy but instead i started doing some research and came across coconut oil. Ordered right away, made some mistakes in using it, figured out what works best on my head and now, i wish i had a pool of it so i could just marinate in it.   It does solidify but it&#x27;s easy to melt in some hot water. It&#x27;s clear (unlike let&#x27;s say Moroccan oil) and thus can be used by blonds and not color their hair orange. It does have a slight odor, but it&#x27;s pleasant and airs out of my hair pretty quickly. On my first try i put on a ton and didn&#x27;t wash it out. I then did a hot towel treatment (heat wet towel in a microwave, wrap around your hair until it cools, repeat). Then i left it on overnight. Next day i washed with my regular shampoo (do try shampoos that are clear of chemicals, sulfurs and perfumes &#x3D; they all dry hair out) and then conditioner. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, it&#x27;s too thick and long and i can&#x27;t do it by myself, so i just let it air dry half way and then roll it into a bun (or 2, like princess Leah) and let it dry completely that way. When it is fully dry, i let it go and it&#x27;s amazingly shiny, no frizz, and perfect wave. My hair is now soft to the touch, doesn&#x27;t brake easily and doesn&#x27;t shed as much as it used to. I love it. Also, my daughters are inter-racial, and both have very different texture to their hair, i started using coconut oil on them and it has softened their hair and now their curls aren&#x27;t as frizzy.   Overall &#x3D; amazing product, so inexpensive and so natural! Buy it and use it!</li>
    <li> I normally use pure coconut oil on my fine, dark, and wavy hair, but thought I would try this because of the small bit of amla and henna that is added in. I haven&#x27;t noticed any new benefits from these added ingredients that pure coconut oil doesn&#x27;t provide. The first reason I prefer pure coconut oil is the price - this enriched product is more expensive than the pure coconut oil I buy. The second reason is that the container is a little annoying. My pure coconut oil comes in a tub that I can scoop a little out with my finger and melt it in my hand. This bottle has to sit under hot water and be poured out, which isn&#x27;t really a huge deal, but it&#x27;s just a waste of a couple minutes every morning that I could be using sleeping.</li>
    <li> I just tried this oil for the first time yesterday and I was amazed!  I took the advice from some of the other reviewers and let the oil set in a cup of warm water for it to melt.  I applied it to my hair and it absorbed so well, and wasn&#x27;t too greasy.  It also added shine and softness. I have afro textured hair, and I wish I had found this product sooner.  It&#x27;s so good for natural hair!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, past my waist, that&#x27;s been colored and highlighted. I just use a little and run my fingers through my hair all the way through. You seen a difference instantly because of the shine from the oils. I use it on my daughters also and their hair is easier to comb through and style.   There is a distinct smell but that is how any coconut oil product will smell. My husband actually liked the fragrance. Other people said it needs to be warmed, but that&#x27;s not so. It is meant to be used the way it comes. It is a solid that quickly liquifies when in the hand to be used. Indian people have used this kind of stuff for a long time. It can cause a greasy look, so only a little needs to be applied. I think applying at night is best, then it doesn&#x27;t look as greasy but the oils are still in the hair.</li>
    <li> As a natural hair woman (4a/4b), I found this oil to be everything I wanted. The smell is a little strong but it leaves my hair soft and shiny and not frizzy at all when take down my twists. I was considering a ayurvedic hair regimen and this product pretty much has everything it that I want, minus all of the powders and loose herbs. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> i am in love with this product, this is one of my staple products it makes my hair so shiny and soft and it doesnt fade my black dye it also is good to do overnight treatment.[and to do the green house effect|.but i mainly oil my scalp with it daily and it doesnt make my hair oily.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will make it my staple. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, matter of fact, when you put it in your hair you don&#x27;t even smell it. Makes my natural hair silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> I got this to try because, honestly, I was feeling a little too cheap to shell out so much money for moroccan oil and wanted something that would make my hair super soft and manageable. I put this on one day while hanging out at home and left it in a few hours. When I washed it out, my hair was soooo soft, silky, and shiny, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!I was having a few issues with flaky scalp at the time and this helped a lot with that too. However, I noticed after using this twice that my hair (I have very thick, curly hair that is a light brown color) was significantly lighter in color...it almost reminded me of how my hair looks after swimming in a chlorinated pool, though that wasn&#x27;t the case. After that happening, I did a little research, and apparently, this product contains something (I don&#x27;t remember the exact details) to help preserve it that is actually a bleaching agent and not good for your skin/body! I ended up tossing it and am now looking for something different - but I&#x27;m going to look into the ingredients better this time! Some reviews I came across of this product mention that it helps with gray hairs, and this might be true, so if you&#x27;re needing help with that, you might like it. Another thing I&#x27;ll mention is that this is kind of stinky...not what you&#x27;d expect from the name \\&quot;coconut hair oil\\&quot;  - it also has henna and lemon or something like that in it too that gives it an odd smell, almost like a gross rancid smell.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!! Finally something that is what it says it is. I purchased Dabur Vatika Coconut oil to use as a conditioner/moisturizer for my hair. I wanted a conditioner/moisturizer that did not contain mineral oil, which is hard to find. I am a woman of color with thick, coarse, shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;Some years ago a college classmate, who happened to be from India, told me about using coconut oil to condition hair after I told her the issue of my hair being so dry to the point of breaking. My experience has been that until now, many products containing conut oil also contain mineral oil (which makes my hair brittle and irritates my very sensitive skin). Klumps of hair used to come out whenever I&#x27;d comb my hair because it was so dry. Since using Dabur Vatika Coconut oil my, hair is so soft (and I have no breakage). Also, every other night I put some on the ends of my hair.  I will definitely be purchasing this product on a regular basis as part of my hair care regimen.  P.S. I&#x27;ve also started using it on my skin and my skin is soooo soft. Please don&#x27;t ever change the formula. Kudos!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I gave it to my girlfriend as a birthday present and she loved it!! it smelled amazing and her hair looks like great!!!! and to add to that it feels a lot softer and it shines :D  tried some of it and i liked it a lot. im sure to buy more for both my girlfriend and my self.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 1-year natural who was looking to color my hair naturally.  Not only was this product very reasonably priced, it worked as well as it claimed.  My curls benefited from the conditioning properties and the color was amazing!</li>
    <li> This package arrived very fast. i was pleased to tyr the product. It has softened my hair and provided luster. i would definatly buy this item again.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for about 2 months now and its amazing. Ipurchased it because icut my hair very short an it seemed like it wasnt growing. i stumbled upon Vatika searching for hair growth products. i love love love this stuff my hair is stronger shiner softer and its growing much much faster.. it smells like coconut pastry with lemon. i highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I love coconut oil. I&#x27;m using in hopes that it will ease my hair from falling out as much and strengthen my hair. My grandmother said this is the best stuff on earth. So I will keep you updated on my progress</li>
    <li> So my product arrived early today and I was excited to use it. I love the smell of this oil my dog couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my scalp when I put it on. I&#x27;m so happy because lately I&#x27;ve been stressed and depress for over a year and I couldn&#x27;t control my dandruff it&#x27;s been about 5 hours now and I don&#x27;t have to itch my scalp. It leaves my hair motorize I would recommend this product for anyone who had dry scalp.</li>
    <li> Heard a lot good things about this oil, so I tried. It didn&#x27;t work for me.  My hair likes coconut oil, so I thought this would work. I have 4c hair.  I tried it as a pre-shampoo treatment and to oil my hair. But my hair wasn&#x27;t feeling it.  I think my hair doesn&#x27;t like the lemon that in it.  But it may work well for you.</li>
    <li> Because it  work great&lt;br /&gt;If it work I will like it&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to my friends and my family</li>
    <li> I was browsing amazon one day &amp; stumbled across this.  I have been wanting to try coconut oil for awhile now just never saw enough benefits in buying it. This coconut oil is enriched with henna, alma, and a few other special herbs. After further research on the added herbs i said gave in. I hate the opening. Although i do understand the need for it, I wish they could come up with something different. You have puncture a thick piece of plastic to get to the oil. Since it&#x27;s coconut oil It does solidify at room temperature. Placing the bottle in hot water for about 8 -10  minutes solves this problem. I recommend transferring the oil into a travel size container. The plastic in travel size containers in thinner so it takes a less time to melt when you are getting ready to use it. Enough about the packing.&lt;br /&gt;I like the oil itself. The smell is distinct but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I usually put it in before bed. By the next morning you cant smell it. I have tested this theory by having my roommates smell my hair when i get up just to make sure i hadn&#x27;t gotten used to the scent while i was sleeping. My hair has gotten softer and grown a lot with continuous use of this product. I would recommend it. I am going to buy the Vatika Hot oil treatment next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{I&#x27;m an African American with natural hair with dyed tips. Hair type:4a/4b hair APL }</li>
    <li> I got this for my hair and it worked really well. very moistuzing but be careful, if you use too much your hair can get very greasy. nice smell</li>
    <li> I am not one to write reviews on Amazon. But THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING and I feel almost guilty not sharing it with the world. As an Indian woman, I have always known coconut oil is good for the hair. My mom used to bring back coconut oil all the time from India. Don&#x27;t get me wrong- coconut oil is fantastic for your hair- but even none of those products COMPARED to this one!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had DAMAGED, DRY hair for years. It&#x27;s fine, wavy and breaks the minute I want to style it. It&#x27;s embarrassingly dry and I been falling out for years so that I can&#x27;t even grow it anymore. I have had awful split ends for 15+ years no and no matter what I have tried, it hasn&#x27;t worked. I even did the super expensive WEN- which is OKAY, but also doesn&#x27;t COMPARE to this product! TRUST ME, IF YOU HAVE DAMAGED HAIR, THIS PRODUCT WILL FIX IT IN A WEEK! I can&#x27;t believe how much I love my hair again! TRY IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO USE: Heat the bottle in HOT WATER for 1-2 minutes so it melts into the oil. Place all over your hair and massage in your scalp. Leave overnight in a haircap. Next day: WASH OUT with shampoo. BONUS: Compared to other coconut oils, this one washeS out INCREDIBLY EASILY! Use 2-3 times a week. Seriously, after a week, your hair will be soft, strong and wonderful- like it was before we started styling the life out of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH that I felt compelled to write a review! Enjoy your new healthy hair :)</li>
    <li> Vatika has a strong scent. It smells just like lemon poundcake. Oils, in their NATURAL state, are solid. You have to run the bottle under hot water to melt. I actually removed the plastic piece on the small lid making it easier to squeeze out. I apply oil to dry hair (especially my ends) and leave it on all day. It tames the frizzies and leaves a smooth shiny finish. Works well as a deep conditioner also. I have long curly dry unmanageable hair. If I put a little on my bangs, I can blow dry them and they look sleek and frizz-free. AWESOME product!!</li>
    <li> I am Afro-Caribbean and have mid-back length locs (as in thin dreadlocks) that I&#x27;ve been maintaining for about 10 years now. I just discovered Vatika and find that I absolutely love the smell and the way it leaves my hair! My hair feels very fluid, soft, and as if it is just flowing down my back (more so than usual), and it smells like heaven. A few points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I put the bottle in the hot shower with me in the mornings so that the congealed oil melts by the time I am done showering and ready to apply it to my hair. I also have done as others suggested and simply heated a mug of water up in the microwave, and then set the bottle in the heated water for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Because of the length and thickness of my hair, I use much more than the nickel or quarter-size amount suggested by one reviewer. In keeping with the change analogy, I&#x27;d say I use about a roll of nickels-size worth. Despite this, my hair does not feel oily after the application has had a chance to soak in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I do not use this as a pre-shampoo or deep conditioning treatment that I later wash/rinse out as other reviewers do. Instead, I apply it every other day or so, in the morning, and then go about my day. That said, as I wash my hair every few days, I suppose I am technically/inadvertently using this as a pre-shampoo or deep conditioner (and I guess we all would be if looked at in this way). ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I happen to find the smell of the product to be quite divine; I have read that some others find it unsettling. It might be important to note that I am a fan of all-natural products and, specifically, The Body Shop products. I wash my hair with The Body Shop&#x27;s banana shampoo and conditioner and have been using their Monoi oil in my hair for about a year. I happen to also like essential oils over perfume. I share this info because it suggests that I might like the smell of Vatika because I am used to and enjoy the smell of many other products with natural ingredients. A friend of mine jokingly and fondly said that, after application of Vatika, my hair smells like the store, \\&quot;Pier 1 Imports\\&quot;. I think that might actually be pretty accurate. ;) If you don&#x27;t like the smell of very natural ingredients or materials--a la an import store, let&#x27;s say--then you probably won&#x27;t dig Vatika.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a few days at the time of this writing, but I believe I am starting to notice the hair-color-darkening effect other reviewers noted. I am content with this phenomenon, however, since my hair color is naturally dark and I am in no way averse to covering up a grey hair or two without having to exert any more effort than that used in the execution of my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!friend of mine jokingly and fondly said that, after application of Vatika, my hair smells like the store, \\&quot;Pier 1 Imports\\&quot;.

    <li> Leaves hair very oily, so avoid the roots. Also, need to toss into the tub to warm and liquefy as you&#x27;re showering.</li>
