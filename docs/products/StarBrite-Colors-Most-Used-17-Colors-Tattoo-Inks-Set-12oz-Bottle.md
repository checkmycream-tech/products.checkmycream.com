      <li>This ink is amazing!</li>
      <li>These inks are nice and brite!</li>
      <li>But Starbrite is still good.</li>
      <li>Starbrite is good ink</li>
      <li>If you want brite color that pops and looks just as good healed as it did when you put it in the skin</li>
      <li>i hear starbrite is the best from so many people and where tattooing is a world of pick and choose i am not so sure if i like it.</li>
      <li>Awesome vibrant colors takes well looks great</li>
      <li>Love the colors everything you need to have  a great pallet to work with.</li>
      <li>all in one or two passes at most!</li>
      <li>Love the colors, they are bright and I have used them.</li>
      <li>a nice virity of colors works well</li>
      <li>They are very viberant and the colors are perfect for most applications.</li>
      <li>Love the assortment of colors, and even if you dont have the right shade is easy to mix for that perfect color you are looking for</li>
      <li>This is pretty good ink, and they send a nice variety of colors for this set.</li>
      <li>I had clients waiting so had to go ahead and use the ones that were ok.</li>
      <li>The items arrived very well packaged and in great condition.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!</li>
      <li>Will definitely be buying more of this brand!!!</li>
      <li>These are the best and most vibrant colors I have found and they really stick in any skin and can be noticed!</li>
      <li>Consistent and bright.</li>
      <li>The ink is absolutely amazing; came out extremely bright, dried bright as well..</li>
      <li>Great ink so far.</li>
      <li>but I prefer moms, which is sealed better, packaged better that comes in a box, and has a mixing ball in the bottle to mix up the ink better when you shake it up, and moms doesn&#x27;t settle in the bottle as much as starbrite.</li>
      <li>Colors are really smooth and goes in easily.  </li>
      <li>Quick shipping!</li>
      <li>Being sterilized and in easy open caps.. makes these very nice.</li>
      <li>So far everything I&#x27;ve used these on still looks good and brite</li>
      <li>so far i like all the inks i have used so as far as the ink goes awesome</li>
      <li>well to be more exact this item.</li>
      <li>Very pleased so far.</li>
      <li>My order came so quick</li>
      <li>They shipped it quick</li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast too!</li>
      <li>great inks, hold well in the skin, esp the red, we love the red.</li>
      <li>clean packaged correctly and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>But other than that there pretty good ink.</li>
      <li>the ink isnt as vibrant as it appears to be and also the way they seal their ink is so primitive!!</li>
      <li>Other than that it was delivered fast and was in good shape.</li>
      <li>only problem was the packaging, they were just tossed in a box with paper, i would like to have seen them packaged a bit better.</li>
      <li>Very upsetting since this is the first ink purchase I have bought through this seller.</li>
      <li>This is in the top 5 inks world wide.</li>
      <li>Fast service would order again</li>
      <li>colors show really well in skin ..</li>
      <li>I am a very upset customer because, these inks i have received have been tampered with.</li>
      <li>and they stay very brite</li>
      <li>There was a minor problem, but it was quickly resolved, which was very well appreciated.</li>
      <li>They go in solid with just a quick pass.</li>
      <li>but the packaging could a little more work.</li>
      <li>Not very happy on this order, most of the seals were open and seemed as if most of the bottles were not even measured with enough ink.</li>
      <li>all were sealed, new inks.</li>
      <li>ones with black letters which were easy to remove and ones with red letters which were not.</li>
      <li>Everything except my red was fine, it came burdened but was only wrapped in paper , the bottles were loose and covered in my red</li>
      <li>EXACTLY what I EXPECTED!</li>
      <li>nothing major.</li>
      <li>When I opened the box, the Violet and the Golden Yellow ink leaked all over the other bottles and within the box.</li>

<li> No complaints except my outlining black came half empty with the freshness seal shot to hell.</li>
<li> It was the tribal black</li>
<li> Gets really clumpy really fast and it makes it harder to pack in the ink very disappointed</li>
<li> ink cap arent made to be stuffed and pulled so when trying to pull these little buggers out they break and when they break ink gets everywhere.</li>
<li> The deep blue ink is really thick and smells weird</li>
<li> Messy and unsanitary!</li>
<li> The packing was not ideal for this product.</li>
<li> The ink got to my house on time, although i was really disappointed in the quality.</li>

    <li> i hear starbrite is the best from so many people and where tattooing is a world of pick and choose i am not so sure if i like it. well to be more exact this item. the ink isnt as vibrant as it appears to be and also the way they seal their ink is so primitive!! they couldnt just have a seal made instead they put #9 ink caps in there and ink cap arent made to be stuffed and pulled so when trying to pull these little buggers out they break and when they break ink gets everywhere. so far i like all the inks i have used so as far as the ink goes awesome but the packaging could a little more work.</li>
    <li> These inks are nice and brite! Just the kinda work I do. They go in solid with just a quick pass. And they stay in. Shipping was very fast too! Five of five.</li>
    <li> BEST and brightest tattoo I have ever seen.  Quick shipping! GREAT Price for a fantastic product!!!</li>
    <li> This is pretty good ink, and they send a nice variety of colors for this set. Colors are really smooth and goes in easily.  They shipped it quick and I did have one or two bottles that leaked a bit, but nothing major. So far everything I&#x27;ve used these on still looks good and brite and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with these inks.</li>
    <li> Love the colors, they are bright and I have used them. The colors pop out on the skin! AWESOME EXACTLY what I EXPECTED! VERY HAPPY!</li>
    <li> Everything except my red was fine, it came burdened but was only wrapped in paper , the bottles were loose and covered in my red</li>
    <li> Awesome vibrant colors takes well looks great</li>
    <li> was justwhat it was supposed to be</li>
    <li> Great ink so far. No complaints except my outlining black came half empty with the freshness seal shot to hell. The outlining ink was everywhere. But other than that there pretty good ink.</li>
    <li> Not very happy on this order, most of the seals were open and seemed as if most of the bottles were not even measured with enough ink. Messy and unsanitary! I had clients waiting so had to go ahead and use the ones that were ok. Will be hesitant on this purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> The ink container of red color came with the open seal and I ended up losing the product before it even get to my house.</li>
    <li> Love the assortment of colors, and even if you dont have the right shade is easy to mix for that perfect color you are looking for</li>
    <li> When I opened the box, the Violet and the Golden Yellow ink leaked all over the other bottles and within the box. The packing was not ideal for this product. The box was too big for the ink and the seller did not wrap in plastic or try to protect the ink in any way except using a few sheets of brown paper with the bottles stuffed at the bottom… Very upsetting since this is the first ink purchase I have bought through this seller.</li>
    <li> all were sealed, new inks.</li>
    <li> this ink is great !! has great colors !!! colors show really well in skin .. ALL FOR A GREAT PRICE !!</li>
    <li> All bottles were sealed properly with a foil seal this batch, none were jammed shut with ink caps but there were two different types of foil seal. ones with black letters which were easy to remove and ones with red letters which were not. The deep blue ink is really thick and smells weird so I&#x27;m probably gonna trash it. Starbrite is good ink but I prefer moms, which is sealed better, packaged better that comes in a box, and has a mixing ball in the bottle to mix up the ink better when you shake it up, and moms doesn&#x27;t settle in the bottle as much as starbrite. But Starbrite is still good.</li>
    <li> These are the best and most vibrant colors I have found and they really stick in any skin and can be noticed! Kudos! Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> GREAT INK. Some of the best you can get. Consistent and bright. Being sterilized and in easy open caps.. makes these very nice. I have used all of these colors in some wonderful tattoos already.</li>
    <li> I am a very upset customer because, these inks i have received have been tampered with. They were not sealed correctly! And finger prints with the ink is on the bottles</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! clean packaged correctly and fast delivery. I will order from them again! Love the colors everything you need to have  a great pallet to work with.</li>
    <li> I received my tattoo ink but I was short one color. Other than that it was delivered fast and was in good shape. It was the tribal black and I don&#x27;t like that color so I didn&#x27;t bother complaining about it</li>
    <li> This ink is amazing! If you want brite color that pops and looks just as good healed as it did when you put it in the skin then this ink is for you!! Will definitely be buying more of this brand!!!</li>
    <li> The ink got to my house on time, although i was really disappointed in the quality. The inks were leaking and only one of the bottles was sealed the rest were stuffed with ink caps and out of those ones three of them were leaking. I contacted customer service and they said they buy and sell the product not their problem the product is garbage...</li>
    <li> I received all of my inks way before I was expecting them to arrive. There was a minor problem, but it was quickly resolved, which was very well appreciated. The ink is absolutely amazing; came out extremely bright, dried bright as well..all in one or two passes at most! I thank the company for the great service!</li>
    <li> This is excellent ink and the colors take nicely.They are very viberant and the colors are perfect for most applications.</li>
    <li> Ive used Starbrite for years and the quality of in is in the 99th percentile. This is in the top 5 inks world wide. As any artist knows there are 100&#x27;s of brands. My order came so quick i didnt think it was actuall my ink. They shorted me 2 inks and i was a bit upset. I wrote them about it and 4 days later got the other 2. Over all im impressed with product quality and speed of shipping. I will order from them again.</li>
    <li> a nice virity of colors works well</li>
    <li> Fast service would order again</li>
    <li> great inks, hold well in the skin, esp the red, we love the red. only problem was the packaging, they were just tossed in a box with paper, i would like to have seen them packaged a bit better.</li>
    <li> I have not used the ink yet as they are a birthday gift for my husband. The items arrived very well packaged and in great condition. Very pleased so far.</li>
    <li> great colors and they stay very brite</li>
    <li> Gets really clumpy really fast and it makes it harder to pack in the ink very disappointed</li>
    <li> colors are all beautiful i would  buy starbrite again</li>
