      <li>first, I liked how this felt on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I liked the hydration of that mask, but didn&#x27;t really care for the smell and was undecided about the tingling feeling it created while having it on my skin.  </li>

      <li>It smells beautiful, like a real rose, not an artificial scent.</li>

      <li>I get facials at least 2 times a month and sometimes more and feel like I can recognize a good product.</li>
      <li>This mask seemed intriguing to me because I&#x27;m also regularly using the [[ASIN:B00B5PDIK8 Fresh Rose Floral Toner 250ml/8.4oz]], which I quite like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this to my skin after first sweeping the Fresh Rose Floral Toner across my full face using a cotton round.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s suitable to current weather condition.</li>
      <li>Especially after using, the skin became fine and smooth.</li>
      <li>I think the other Fresh mask is much, much better as are the other masks I&#x27;ve mentioned that I&#x27;ve used before with great results.</li>
      <li>and I liked that it was gentle enough that even though my lips were somewhat chapped, it didn&#x27;t sting them.  </li>

      <li>it is not as good as other people said, may be we expect too much.</li>

      <li>Price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>When I gently washed it off my skin</li>
      <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>However, you would have to exfoliate really well in order to get the product to fully sink into the skin.</li>

    <li> my girl friend is very happy to have it, it has nice effective to make face skin smooth and good elasticity~</li>
    <li> Very good. All of their mask are great. Great for sensitive skins</li>
    <li> This is the second face mask I&#x27;ve tried from Fresh, the first being [[ASIN:B001CB8UE4 Fresh Black Tea Instant Perfecting Mask 3.4 oz]], which came highly recommended to me by a friend.

The cooling feeling was nice and I liked that it was gentle enough that even though my lips were somewhat chapped, it didn&#x27;t sting them.  However, as I kept this on my skin longer I had to resist the urge to itch my skin.  When I gently washed it off my skin I didn&#x27;t care for the effect at all.  It didn&#x27;t feel nearly as hydrating as other masks I&#x27;ve tried before (and loved) like [[ASIN:B00ISEOY20 GLAMGLOW Thirstymud Hydrating Treatment, 1.7 oz.]], [[ASIN:B0083S44LM First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Instant Oatmeal Mask-2 oz.]], or [[ASIN:B000A0ADUW Ole Henriksen Blue Black Berry Enzyme Facial Mask, 3.5 Fluid Ounce]].

    <li> it is not as good as i think of...the taste is not bad.i find rose in it.and also rose thorn which is dangrous to woman.</li>
    <li> Good smell and good to use. I love this brand, as well this mask. It&#x27;s suitable to current weather condition. Moisture but not oil. My skin type is middle to dry.</li>
    <li> I love this mask.it&#x27;s good for my dry and sensitive face skin.I can use it everyday.real rose in the mask,haha...good smell..</li>

    <li> Love it. Its this nice cool, gel. I use it day and night and I think its the best. However, you would have to exfoliate really well in order to get the product to fully sink into the skin. Sometimes I would get really lazy and just put it on and it wouldn&#x27;t do much. This would apply to any product you use anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would sometimes sleep in it and it won&#x27;t break me out. So this is great. Highly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s combination and oily skin. Maybe not so much for dry skin.</li>
    <li> hove bought it many times! still as good as before, love it. but if you reinforce the bag more will be better.</li>

I am a middle aged woman and find that this mask is really really good! This mask is very refreshing. It smells amazing and is cooling to the skin. This mask is gentle and could be used daily. It seems to be very hydrating and the skin looks nice after using it. If you need a quick fix prior to a date etc, I would highly recommend this gentle mask. Leave it on for 20 minutes and rinse off. Did I mention the smell? I have it on now and I can&#x27;t get over how good it smells. I&#x27;ve had it on for way over 20 minutes and it still feels good. This mask is relaxing and seems to melt away stress. I get facials at least 2 times a month and sometimes more and feel like I can recognize a good product. I normally use Dermalogica and love their products, but this mask is a definite keeper!! [[ASIN:B000YTA4QM Fresh Rose Face Mask 3.4 oz]]</li>
    <li> Buy another one from Fresh shop, only 58.00</li>
