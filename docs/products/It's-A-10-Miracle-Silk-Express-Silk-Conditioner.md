<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE!!!  I have thick, wavy hair.  This is the only conditioner I have found that leaves the hair smooth and easy to brush after a shower.</li>
    <li> well worth the $$, it smells good, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, leaves it soft, and best of all its sulfate free</li>
    <li> Thank you. This order was complete and on time. Thank you</li>
    <li> Truly Amazing! I have fine, straight, long, dark hair, and this conditioner makes my hair look amazing and shiny.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of expensive products and this is by far the best and reasonably prices.  Great for reducing frizz and gives a straightening effect when blown dry.</li>
    <li> I like It&#x27;s a 10 products, but this shampoo and condition is just ok.</li>
    <li> To start off with - I&#x27;m an avid fan of the It&#x27;s a 10 products so I&#x27;m rating the Silk Express Miracle line over other It&#x27;s a 10 products. They are still far superior to supermarket or even salon quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Silk Express Miracle Shampoo, Conditioner, and Balm as a total set for the last 6 weeks. Here is my impression of the set as compared to the Miracle with Keratin line of products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shampoo: The Silk Express shampoo is my favorite of the line as it creates much more of a lather than the Miracle Shampoo with Keratin. That&#x27;s a big plus. However if you have dry hair, like me, you will prefer the way your hair feels after shampooing when using then shampoo with keratin. I wish the keratin shampoo lathered better, but I need to use less conditioner with it, and that&#x27;s a big plus considering the cost of these products. 3 stars for the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Conditioner: To me a conditioner is the bread and butter of hair care. So this is the crucial piece for me. I found that when I used the Silk Express conditioner I needed to use much more than when I use the Miracle with Keratin conditioner. It&#x27;s partially because my hair feels less dry after using the shampoo with keratin, and I think it&#x27;s also because without the keratin the Silk Express is just an inferior conditioner. I went through twice as much conditioner in the same amount of time using the Silk Express and my hair didn&#x27;t feel any better whatsoever. 2 stars for the conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Leave-In Balm: The second most crucial part of my hair care regime is the leave-in smoothing balm. Here is where I stray from the It&#x27;s a 10 line. I found that the It&#x27;s a 10 Mircale with Keratin and the It&#x27;s a 10 Silk Express balms performed about the same. They are both solid products and if I am leaving my hair wavy (which is rare) they do a decent job of keeping away the frizz. Not perfect, but decent. However if I am straightening my hair (which is most of the time) the BEST product on the market is Chi Silk Infusion. You can&#x27;t go wrong with it. 3 stars for the balm but 5 stars for Chi Silk Infusion instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I have long, medium thick, color treated, wavy hair that is quite dry.T product on the market is Chi Silk Infusion. You can&#x27;t go wrong with it. 3 stars for the balm but 5 stars for Chi Silk Infusion instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I have long, medium thick, color treated, wavy hair that is quite dry.</li>
    <li> Bottle was smaller than I expected . Yet price was excellent . Way cheaper than Ulta and other online prices .</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels on my hair. My hair is medium n texture.</li>
    <li> I have used the spray bottle and the squeeze tube of It&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner and I have to say I love the squeeze bottle much better. It makes my hair very soft and manageable. Doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling heavy or greasy, and to avoid that feeling avoiding the roots is a must! I love it&#x27;s a 10 and it&#x27;s the best leave in conditioner I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Fast shipment!!</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing !!!! I have really thick hair, and using this products makes the frizzy go down, makes it really soft and smells so&lt;br /&gt;good I also tried the shampoo and conditioner those work just as good! I recommend  all 3 products it&#x27;s awesome!! I also feel a difference in  my hair as well it removes all built product that&#x27;s in your hair as well.... ladies &amp; men  you must try!</li>
    <li> The only problem I have with Its a 10 silk express is that it doesn&#x27;t come in bigger bottles other than that its amazing!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually spend a lot on hair products, thinking that they&#x27;re all pretty much the same. Then, when I had my hair done once, my stylist convinced me to buy a jar of It&#x27;s a 10 Intense repair conditioner. It worked so well that I decided to splurge on It&#x27;s a 10 shampoo and conditioner. Before using their products I would look in the mirror at my hair and wish that It looked better. Now, after using their products just a few times, I look at my hair in the mirror and think, &amp;#34;Wow! I&#x27;ve got great hair!&amp;#34; Before, my hair always looked a little dry, frizzy and like it needed to be brushed. With the It&#x27;s a 10 shampoo and this conditioner, my hair is smooth, shiny, softer, and healthy looking. When I get out of bed in the morning I can run my fingers through my hair a few times and look freshly combed. These products have a lovely, fresh, clean smell that stays in my hair. The best part is how &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34; and bouncy my hair is now. Although I wish these products didn&#x27;t cost as much as they do, I don&#x27;t see myself ever using anything else from now on. I definitely give this conditioner a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Came quickly.  Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Magical product. Once I tried it I never looked back. I use this with the shampoo, mask, and leave in.</li>
    <li> Just OK, original is better</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner that we have found to help our daughter&#x27;s chlorine damaged hair.  Worth every penny....love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders on my fine curly hair - making it feel silky without weight.&lt;br /&gt;  Oh, &amp; the smell is absolutely wonderful!</li>
    <li> This conditioner works magic with my hair. I typically only use products that are natural and organic. This product is far from either of those things, but it is the only thing that will turn my extremely thick, coarsely curly, 3-foot long hair into manageable silky waves. I no longer need to straighten, blow dry, or apply multiple products to my hair to make it manageable. As I work the product into my hair, I run my fingers through my hair to de-tangle, then I rinse. After showering, I towel-dry my hair then twist up half of my hair to allow it to dry slowly, occasionally taking it out. The result for me are lovely, long, wavy curls that shine. After it is dry, it brushes out straight or slightly wavy. The fact that this conditioner smells amazing is only a plus!</li>
    <li> My sister is a hair dresser and she purchased it for me as soon as it came out as I have thick coarse hair. Unless my hair gets tired of it, I will use it forever!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and works even better.  Doesn&#x27;t flatten or make hair limp, holds style and helps with split ends</li>
    <li> Very good conditioner.  Makes my hair feely silky like it says.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of conditioning for curly unruly hair!!!</li>
    <li> Best product I have tried for my hair!!!!!!!  Will continue purchasing for sure!  The shampoo is wonderful, as well!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, I have used it for a long time. I did use Graham Webb conditioner, but the company stopped manufacturing this product. My hairdresser uses It&#x27;s a 10 hair products and recommended this particular conditioner. It does great on my hair, leaves no film and makes my hair shiny!!</li>
    <li> Item was as expected.  Delivery was fast❤️❤️</li>
    <li> This product works really well in my hair - keeps it silky and shiny. Most products don&#x27;t have any effect on my dry hair but this consistently makes my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.. it really is a 10! Makes my hair silky-smooth, shiny, easy to manage.... thanks!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel so silky, smooth and less frizzy...however, the smell is so strong and terrible!  I can&#x27;t continue using this, it&#x27;s that bad.  I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I love It&#x27;s a 10 products! This is a great conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. A little also goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian &amp; have med length (below shoulders), coarse, thick hair that is naturally frizzy and wavy. Love this product - turns my hair into a soft, manageable, silky mane. I use this and the compatible shampoo, the it&#x27;s a 10 keratin leave in, then dry hair, straighten hair, and use large hot rollers (routine takes a while, but worth it to me). This product smells nice and works. I am a product junkie and try any/everything. This is one of the few products I have purchased twice.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair so soft and not too oily</li>
    <li> My hairstylist turned me on to this product and I love it!  It works well keeping your hair healthy and smells nice too!</li>
    <li> My hair loves this product , it helps it be very silky and moisturized</li>
    <li> This smells unbelievably GOOD! It&#x27;s a good product too but I find that the miracle deep conditioner with keratin worked much better (the one in the blue tube)</li>
    <li> It works well however I received a leave in conditioner instead of regular conditioner. I don&#x27;t know if I read wrong or what but it was a little bit of a bummer.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, it has made a huge difference on my hair.  I live in a very arid environment and my hair was looking dry and dull, this conditioner (along with other silk express products) made a drastic improvement and people have even noticed that my hair looks softer and more full</li>
    <li> This conditioner isn&#x27;t bad if you leave it in for a few minutes as suggested.  Is it worth the price?  No, not really.  I have found products for less that do the same.  It leaves my hair moisturized and mostly tangle free.  I just don&#x27;t see it as a good value.  It didn&#x27;t seem to fade my color, which is good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man in his early 20&#x27;s that had rough hair. I used this product hoping that it would make my hair smooth and soft and it did! I did not use this product along side the its a 10 shampoo however, i will consider buying the shampoo next time.</li>
    <li> It take less time to flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is a review for the combo buy- silk shampoo conditioner and straightening ball for $44.  Great price!  Would have paid over $60 at the retail stores (if I could have found them).  My hairdresser uses the products on my hair but forgot to buy from her.  She would have charged me the same (at cost), but she was too far away and with 2-day shipping, it was better to buy here.  Love the products.</li>
    <li> Picked this product after I heard some buzz about it in the salon, I purchased the shampoo, conditioner and the Smoothing Balm. It is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve every used.  It smells wonderful and the scent lasts, my hair is full of volume, smooth, but the best part is the shine! It&#x27;s unbelievable. I&#x27;ve been a stylist for a long time and I&#x27;ve never felt so strongly about a product line. I&#x27;ve used other it&#x27;s a ten products, and I&#x27;ve been a fan for some time, but this stuff is the best product they&#x27;ve come up with. My hair is long and thin, this product didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product! I have used It&#x27;s a 10 products in the past, and this &amp;#34;silk effects&amp;#34; line is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels great, I love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Helps defriz my hair. I love it. I have coarse frizzy ends and. it seems to tame them quite well</li>
    <li> I was only able to use this for 2 days because I&#x27;m allergic to the scent; however, in that 2 days I loved how it tamed my hair and made it more manageable. Since I ride a motorcycle, I like the It&#x27;s a 10 product because it helps with the frizzy ends (I&#x27;ve been using the spray-in condition for several years now). I&#x27;d like to see if they have a shampoo and conditioner with a different scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other It&#x27;s A 10 products and loved them, so I had high expectations for this conditioner.  It works okay, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as other, less expensive conditioners.</li>
    <li> makes your hear really silky!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The best condition I have ever used.All of the 10 products are great.  I especially like the miracle silk conditioner and the conditioner with keratin.  I use the miracle silk conditioner on the top of my head and the conditioner with keratin on the ends.  The keratin is heavier and could weigh your hair down on top more than the silk conditioner.  I use the keratin on the ends because they usually need more conditioning (dead ends).  Works awesome!</li>
    <li> Here we goes again. So sorry it&#x27;s a 10 silk,  but you did not work for me. Had its a 10 miracle before and it was good.  Wanted to try the new silk and boy..I&#x27;m sad. How I wish I could get my money back. I stopped using it, it sits under my bathroom sink, been ignored.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Love what it does for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product</li>
    <li> Purchased this product at a salon.  My hair is heavily processed due to trying to hide the inevitable gray.  This product is truly a miracle!  My hair is silky and shiny and looks healthy.  Very, very, very pleased!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and have been using this for about two weeks.  I have seen a considerable difference in how soft and shiny my hair has become.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily help with humidity but I haven&#x27;t found any miracle cure for that yet.  It also rinses out like a dream with no waxy feeling left behind.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff makes your hair feel soft and clean. Helps with fly away hair keeps it in place but not stiff or sticky</li>
    <li> Product smells great and feels great</li>
    <li> My hair is 3 feet long and naturally silver/white.  It&#x27;s also tired and weak; I assume it&#x27;s from hanging around for so many years.  This stuff works and it smells good.  (It&#x27;s really kind of pathetic that we are surprised when something works like they claim it does but now is not the time for smackin&#x27; it down.)  Bottom line is, it worked for me and my hair is a challenge to tame. It&#x27;s very fine but I used to have lots of it, which would tangle into psychotic-looking knots.  It has taken my husband up to an hour to comb out my hair because sometimes I just refuse to deal with it - that&#x27;s how bad it gets.  That wasn&#x27;t an issue when I used this conditioner.  Really, the biggest problem is that I am a hair product whore, and even when something works really well, I still wiggle away in the dead of night to find something new and exciting - that&#x27;s the kind of trollop I am (only when it comes to hair care - sorry).  If I ever decide to be loyal to a brand, this is currently the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, no, I didn&#x27;t get a free sample - I&#x27;ve never personally known anyone that received free samples in the mail but, then again, I&#x27;ve also never asked.  Besides, seriously, would anyone read my review and determine I&#x27;m a perfect candidate for a freebie.  I think not.</li>
    <li> great conditioner and awesome scent. Leaves my hair straighter but not weighed down. I will definitely buy this conditioner again!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner! I bleach my hair (naturally dark roots) and this baby makes my hair super soft and great to work with. I use it with the spray in blonde it&#x27;s a 10. I can&#x27;t remember my hair feeling this good before. :) Yay!</li>
    <li> very good let&#x27;s used it a little more to get a better rating</li>
    <li> My daughters hair is a night mare to untangle, even when using a bottle of conditioner. I started using Its a 10 leave in conditioner and untangling her hair is a breeze now. I buy it on Amazon where its almost half the price of my salon.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner that I ever used. I love it.</li>
    <li> Soft, shiny hair.  Does as described</li>
    <li> I tried to go back to drugstore brands after using one bottle of this and I missed it!  I have oily roots and dry ends and this does the best job of balancing out my hair, leaving it soft and feeling clean.  Would definitely recommend giving this a try!</li>
    <li> Have used this product now for almost a year.  Wouldn&#x27;t use another.  Originally purchased from my stylist.</li>
    <li> Great product. Was recommended to me. I&#x27;m passing the recommendation on. Does exactly what it says.</li>
    <li> So great my hair feel amazing. I love all there products. They work wonders on my dry ends. I will keep buying.</li>
