<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This wig was the worst purchase that I have ever made. It truly smells! Plus It&lt;br /&gt;took a month for the item to be delivered. The picture is very deceptive. I bought it to wear to a Mardi Gras&lt;br /&gt;Party that took place in March. This wig arrived today. Just in time for me to pitch it in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt; My friends on Facebook will enjoy reading about this mishaps.&lt;br /&gt;  Carolyn</li>
    <li> So thin! Great texture and style, but you can see the whole back of my head. I need to add a whole wig or two to it to make it work and that is just annoying.</li>
    <li> It Gets Tangled Quickly,Also It Came In The Package Tangled,But Other Then That This Wig Is PERFECT!</li>
    <li> I love having play wigs. This wig is so thick and cute. I totally love it. :D</li>
    <li> As always, the photo looks better that the actual product . It&#x27;s ok for the price however I wait a very long time for it to arrive from china</li>
    <li> I love this wig.. it is a great product!!! :)</li>
    <li> This hair is great the only thing is it tangles a lot. Otherwise I love this hair I will keep buying</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE WIG FOR THE MOST PART IT GOT REALLY NAPPY AFTER THE FIRST DAY OF WEARING IT BUT HOWEVER I CUT IT AND MADE IT LOOK BRAND NEW AGAIN. I PAID FOR WHAT I GOT AND I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok been so long can hardly remember the purchase</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig on sep 6, 2013 &amp; I just recieved it on sat dec 28,2013. I&#x27;m guessing that there were issues with the shipping so i did not recieve it within the time that was exspected, so I wrote a review on this company they contacted me requesting that I take the review down and offered me a refund or to reship the item, i really wanted the wig so i wanted them to reship it, so the person that I was working with she said that she will resend it along with a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person that I was working with was very willing to help me out but it took WAYYYYYY TOOOO long to get a very cheap wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So once I finnally recieved the package the wig was brown and it specifically stated that it was black in the listing, and the gift that they sent was a sticker tattoo.</li>
    <li> This wig is so horrible..you will get exactly what you pay for..its nothing like the picture its thin..it sheds terribly you won&#x27;t get one wear out of it ....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s starting to get hard to brush. Loved it at first. Depends on how you wear it and style it.</li>
    <li> This was an interesting wig. It is a good quality for a steal of a price. I had to cut it to a shorter length, it was very manageable as far as wigs go. Quite pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why some customers left comments saying the wig was a diff. color, the wig i received was the color as it appeared here, pure black. pretty good quality and the customer service always reply promptly to my questions. 5 stars</li>
    <li> It sheds a lot, and the bangs are a bit crooked, but the wig is soft and looks somewhat similar to the picture.</li>
    <li> NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED. It was absolutely horrible. Very thin and just bad quality period. Bangs were uneven and parts of the wig was already tied up as soon as I took it out of the hair net. I gave it to my 2 year old daughter to pay for. If you&#x27;re playing dress up....this is the wig to go to.</li>
    <li> I like this wig, but I am not in love with it. It has some really good qualities: silky smooth, lovely color, but the wig iskind of thin. They did give plenty of spare bangs to trim down to correct size. Overall this wig will work perfectly for my cosplay, bu I wouldnt wear it on the street.</li>
    <li> this wig is not worth the money to buy at all&lt;br /&gt;it sheads fast,about time you comb or brush it out you have more hair on the brush or comb</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture. Perfect for occasional going out in. Much better quality than a wig you would get at a party store.</li>
    <li> The shipping time is good but the product itself it bad. Its thin, it tangles extremely easily and looks nothing like the picture. Im glad I only paid seven bucks for it. You can easily see the tracks underneath and it just looks cheap.The first thing I thought when I put it on was \\&quot; this looks just like a cheap costume wig\\&quot;. I would NOT, for any reason, recommend this particular product to anyone unless they want the thin, cheap look. They advertise some asian chick with long, black hair with thick bangs as if the wig will look anything remotely close to that.</li>
    <li> SO FAR I HAVE PUT THIS WIG ON TWICE IT NEEDS A LOT OF BRUSHING A LIL WATER SHEEN AND A FEW BRUSHES LAY IT OWN BUT U WILL DO THIS A COUPLE OF TIMES</li>
    <li> This is actually a really nice wig, good quality, more realistic looking, it really does look like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t arrive in time for what I needed it for, but that was due to my own fault, I should have chosen faster shipping, it took a very long time to get here, but still within the estimate time. The hair is very silky and smooth, nicely made. I&#x27;ll keep it and find something to use it for.</li>
    <li> This wig is really pretty I love how it looks the bangs  are cute as well as the rest if the hair is also pretty I love how long it is too I wish it would be shipped already and sent to my house already I can&#x27;t wait :)</li>
    <li> The first day I had it I couldn&#x27;t even wear it because I was a nappy mess from the moment that I took it out the packet. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money this is one of my worst purchases ever.</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing one of the best I have ever owned. Easy to care for realistic and  vary comfterble</li>
    <li> It was a little longer than I liked so I trimmed it down, but its very sleek and pretty. Its sheds a little too much for my liking but I love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so soft and SO real and easy to take care of! I&#x27;m in love with it so much I may just shave my head and be a wig wearer from this company ;)</li>
    <li> I had order another wig from this seller and had to send it back,got this one and I&#x27;m doing the same.These wigs are jokes.you can wear these only at costume party&#x27;s.Wear these out in public and you will be laugh at .</li>
    <li> I love this wig!!!!!!! It feels like real hair and it looks REALLY goooooood!! I can&#x27;t believe it was so cheap &amp; great quality!!!!!! Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it if this is for cosplay! (Not intended for everyday use)</li>
    <li> The wig is actually surprisingly good considering how much it&#x27;s being sold for.&lt;br /&gt;Pros- Looks like real hair, it&#x27;s comfortable, and it&#x27;s a really good length.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Tangles bad, like really really really bad. Some of the lace sticks out in the back but can be easily covered. The wig is a little bit too thin too but hey it&#x27;s cheap.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an OK wig, really fun to wear, and the only real downside is the tangling. All in all it&#x27;s a cheap wig that&#x27;s actually not that cheap looking.</li>
    <li> IT was the worse wig i ever brought. all the hair was falling out when you comb it.</li>
    <li> This wig started to tangle and shed the moment I tried it on. Save your money and do not buy it.</li>
    <li> It was cheap, so I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much.&lt;br /&gt;It is definately good for halloween or going to one of those teen clubs where they wear weird wigs</li>
    <li> We used this black wig for a Wednesday Addams costume and it was a huge hit. It braided well and stayed put where needed.</li>
    <li> Costume wig ,one night only,so thin ,sheds fast ,takes too long to receive ,if  u are looking  for a one wear this is it!!</li>
    <li> It tangles a lot...otherwise it&#x27;s a great wig I love it</li>
    <li> worse wig I have ever had it tangles really bad I have to wear it in a bun and not down b/c it tangles so bad........</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews, and I thought okay it might only be good for one use but I just need it for Halloween. I bought it because of the length. The picture shows it going down to her elbows! I just tried on the wig that I was sent and it is a bob cut. So not happy. Do not order this if you are looking for a nice asian wig. Find a different one, this is just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This wig had shocked me when it first arrived. It was a great color, silky smooth, and was in great condition. Now for the downsides, I tangles extremely easy. Also the bangs weren&#x27;t cut, so its not a totally bad thing. But all in all, this wig was a lot better than what I was expecting!</li>
    <li> using it for photo-shoot, worked out just fine….</li>
    <li> Very cute and neutral wig to wear anywhere. The bangs are quite long, so i did have to cut them but it is a nice wig. Looks real and i can wear it with any hair accessories.</li>
    <li> If you need it for a costume i guess its okay. I wore it once and it held up was fine, but the more i wore it hair fell out like crazy! You also cant part it in the back because then you will see the cap. I would never wear this without a hat because the top looks so fake! its not that the part was bad at the top, but the hair is really big and round. Did not look real at all. The shipping was decent but it took a little later then thought but it was okay. Overall I would not buy it ever again and just get something better because this was not worth it.</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for .Got to nappy not what it looks like but I did get it early .</li>
    <li> looked like a wig. huge bump on the top that never really flattened properly. bangs were insanely long and so we cut a little and they stuck straight out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so beautiful and neat, it looks like human hair, and nice to go on an outing in which it is  so comfortable.</li>
    <li> horrible! the wig was not what i expected it to be .... never will i buy one like this again</li>
    <li> Sheds a whole lot but i like the look it gives me.</li>
    <li> this wig is so beautiful the length is perfect, the bangs need a bit trimming otherwise you get poked in the eye, only thing is the wig isn&#x27;t black its actually a very dark espresso brown still stunning though!</li>
    <li> I liked it&lt;br /&gt;it was soft and nice&lt;br /&gt;can get tangled like any other long wig, but easy to detangled&lt;br /&gt;brush bottom to top&lt;br /&gt;and it does look exactly like the picture shown&lt;br /&gt;And it came a week earlier, witch made me even more happy! ;)</li>
    <li> Fit ok and didn&#x27;t look too cheap or sparse. Pretty straight forward purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this wig! It arrived in just under 3 weeks from when I orderered it, which was great.&lt;br /&gt;The wig is black, not a dark brown like a lot of &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; wigs. It&#x27;s also really soft and beautiful. It looks so realistic, too. It&#x27;s not overly shiny, and it doesn&#x27;t shed a lot. A few strands came out when I combed it but that&#x27;s to be expected from a wig. It doesn&#x27;t tangle too badly, either, which I&#x27;m super glad for. I have a curly wig that tangled within 10 minutes of wearing it, whereas this was hardly tangled at all when I wore it. The bangs aren&#x27;t cut straight across like in the picture, they&#x27;re more sideswept, which is what I was wanting anyway. The wig is fairly long too, it goes to about the middle of my back (just like in the picture). I got this wig mainly to cosplay Latula Pyrope from Homestuck, but the wig is pretty long for her. I don&#x27;t want to cut this wig because it looks so pretty how it is! It also works for Jade Harley from Homestuck, and I&#x27;m sure many other characters who have long straight black hair.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t what it appeared to be after recieving it but it will still go well with my Anonymous (V for Vendetta) mask.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality but ok. Good thing didn&#x27;t buy this for an adult sized head. My grand daughter and niece both little will enjoy playing with these wigs but an adult would be hard pressed to get it on their head and its just so so quality.</li>
    <li> My wig just came yesterday and its everything they said it would be. Its the right color, its not too thin and not too thick.....and mine does not have any shedding. It came two weeks earlier than expected wich was a bonus too. I LOVE IT!! And i will definitely be ordering from them again!</li>
    <li> This Hair sheds all over!! It&#x27;s a reasonable deal but I would like for it to stay on the wig not on the floor.</li>
    <li> hair was fly away.  good for halloween i guess. Not suitable to wear as alternative to your own hair when going out.</li>
    <li> The bangs are a really short and I didnt like how it was hard to style and tangly. I wanted to wear it at least once for the price j paid however it got tangly easily and the wig cap that came with it, didnt do much of its job either..</li>
    <li> Okay wig, but it was too small for me and did not realy look like the picture or what I expected, so, I contacted the seller to let them know and I got a refund with no problems. So, I will probably purchase fom this company again, but I would not buy or recommend this particular wig.</li>
    <li> This unit is so cute but sheds like crazy. Spray with oil to tame &amp; for less shedding, also I did have to cut the bangs a little more since they covered my eyes</li>
    <li> This wig was worth the wait I love it and will order again</li>
    <li> I love this wig, went through hell though. I bought it to wear to work and it held out for over two months but due to sweat, milk and coffee, its sorta became ratty.&lt;br /&gt;I IMAGINE if this wig was only worn for photo shoots or dressing up, it would work perfectly.</li>
    <li> If you only need to use this a couple times, you&#x27;d be fine, but def not great quality- I buy a lot of wigs and I wouldnt feel comfortable using this one outside of home.</li>
    <li> This is the best wig for the price and i will order from this vendor again and i really like the quality and the length</li>
    <li> I was so worried about the delivery date. I purchased this item for Halloween and the anticipated delivery date was possibly after 10/31. I emailed the company to see if the date could be moved up. It couldn&#x27;t be changed but the other reviews mentioned how early they received theirs. So I was so happy when my item arrived approx 2 weeks later. And the item itself is perfect.</li>
    <li> great buy will buy from here again and loved the color.....was always stopped when I wear this wig....love it...will buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African/latina women so my hair is very thick I was afraid a thin wig wouldn&#x27;t cover my thick long hair but I&#x27;ve always purchased these wigs and they look AMAZING on me! Fits nice looks silky and full for a cheap wig. Normal maintenance is required but that&#x27;s expected. Love these wigs. its a must buy.</li>
    <li> Tangles easily but it looks real.&lt;br /&gt;I get complimented on it.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are to long.</li>
    <li> I like it, nice, soft and silky :)</li>
    <li> This was shipped in the time range it have me before I clicked &amp;#34;place order&amp;#34; and it is also good quality for being synthetic, it lasted longer than any of my other wigs and it looks just like the pictures provided! It&#x27;s just what I asked for!</li>
    <li> I have never seen a wig that get nappy as soon as u put it on. Save your money!</li>
    <li> Really good wig. miner tangling</li>
    <li> This wig wasn&#x27;t the coloe that I was looking for , but it turns our to be a fun wig to wear.  I would call it a surprise wig, because it was nicer than I ever could have imagine.</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected for it to be, but then again I only payed $5 for twig. I thought that you was going to be of better quality, but as soon as I took this wig out of the bag it instantly started to tangle, sorry Amazon not this time,</li>
    <li> Its a ok wig but you gotta cut it down. It sheds alot and knots up but you keep it brush its ok the bangs a little thin and its not for a big head. I make it work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute, but its a bit hard to manage</li>
    <li> I needed a cheap wig to complete my transformation as Kim Kardashian last Halloween. The wig is a little shorter in person (not past my boobs) but I&#x27;m likely half a foot taller than the model. This came with a hair net and stayed on my head the entire night (no awkward slips). The hair is shiny and comes across great in pictures, and obviously as Kim K I took a lot of pictures. I&#x27;m looking forward to finding another excuse to wear it about.</li>
    <li> This wig is very fiber looking.i ordered a black and it came light brown.mabe these sellers are colour blind.luckily I bought it for roleplay in the bedroom and not to go outdoor with.not for everyday use.anyway not all cheap things are good.</li>
    <li> Not good hair dnt even feel like hair looks like carpet and feels like it cldnt won&#x27;t wear it it frizzed when I tried it on very thin also cut it to try to get the frizz out didn&#x27;t work dnt buy it you&#x27;ll b sorry</li>
    <li> Bad the hair comes out a lot when combing the wig...... Don&#x27;t like it.....</li>
    <li> It was too shiny. I put powder and anything to die down hair so it wont look fake. Its in the closet. the style is cute</li>
    <li> great item for a great price.... A little tangle but hey, a great deal</li>
    <li> I love it my buy hair extensions,</li>
    <li> It very small and it tangle but I receive it on time</li>
    <li> For the price it was perfect. It is a costume wig, and yes it sheds a lot. I recommend coming it with a wide tooth comb small sections at a time, to preserve it a bit longer. But I would order it again! I love it!</li>
