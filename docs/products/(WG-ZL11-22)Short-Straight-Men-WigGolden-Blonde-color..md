      <li>Glad to hear others found this review helpful!</li>
      <li>Nice wig.</li>
      <li>The longer I have this wig the more I love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had lots of wigs but this is probably the best one, it&#x27;s comfortable and came already styled and ready to go.</li>
      <li>i love it &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>I love this wig.</li>
      <li>It is great for the price...  Fits very snug.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t exactly style it the way it is on the photo, but it looks good anyway.</li>
      <li>it looks completely real and it&#x27;s reeeally good quality.</li>
      <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to style it like the photo, but happy just the same.</li>
      <li>It comes pre styled, which is usually fine</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s yellower then pictured, but it&#x27;ll work out fine for what I need it for.</li>
      <li>and I still couldn&#x27;t fit it all underneath this wig, even with the included wig cap.</li>
      <li>Its not bad, but about what you would expect.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Product was very full and ready to shape.</li>
      <li>Pretty nice full wig with soft fibers.</li>
      <li>The wig feels comfortable on my head and looks real.</li>
      <li>All for fun</li>
      <li>Quality wig, well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Almost exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>This would be fine for a halloween costume, or a super casual cosplay, but you&#x27;re better off ordering something else if you want a really nice wig (which you can get better quality wigs for the same price, so there&#x27;s really no excuse).</li>
      <li>but the fibers just look stringy, like too much product was used.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not thin at all-</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a wig because people think it&#x27;s real.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this for a last minute Sailor Uranus cosplay on a whim since I was already making an Amazon order.</li>
      <li>well and very comfortable..recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap and the top of the wig is horribly thin</li>
      <li>Used for my granddaughter when she dressed as Ellen DeGeneres - it was a big hit - probably won&#x27;t be worn again but the price was right</li>
      <li>It looks exactly like the picture, just a tiny bit fuller.</li>
      <li>This wig is great..looks completely natural.fits</li>

<li> This wig is great..looks completely natural.fits</li>
<li> Had a hard time parting the hair right, it doesn&#x27;t fall as flat as the picture portrays either</li>
<li> Decent wig, I will be using it for my Hawkeye costume, easy to work with but very short, it does not cover all of the hair at the base of my neck and near my ears &amp;#60;</li>
<li> Here are some pictures from a small photoshoot as Sailor Hawkeye a while back.  </li>
<li> i was afraid it would be too thin in the back (as most cosplay wigs are)</li>
<li> I can hardly wait to use it at the next conveontion</li>
<li> which means less work for me ^_^</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this wig for anybody with hair longer than half an inch.</li>
<li> Way uglier and less styled than the picture shows.</li>
<li> DID NOT FIT MY HEAD WAAAAYYYY TO SMALL</li>
<li> The wig I received did not look like picture shown, and was too small.</li>
<li> I recently had a calling to be Captain Kirk at Spring con, the color was not perfect for the costume</li>
<li> No complaints there though, nothing worse than a thin wig showing your hair underneath.</li>
<li> Bad color, looks like stringy plastic</li>
<li> Bad wig, do not buy for DAVE strider or anyone</li>
<li> The hairline is terrible.</li>

    <li> this wig is literally perfect. it looks completely real and it&#x27;s reeeally good quality. i was afraid it would be too thin in the back (as most cosplay wigs are) but it&#x27;s not thin at all- it&#x27;s perfect and awesome for the price. it even feels like it&#x27;s already ben styled which means less work for me ^_^ i plan to wear it for my Cecil Baldwin cosplay in April. i love it &amp;#60;3</li>

    <li> Used for my granddaughter when she dressed as Ellen DeGeneres - it was a big hit - probably won&#x27;t be worn again but the price was right and it served the purpose.</li>

    <li> Takes a hundred years for shipping be aware&lt;br /&gt;Product was very full and ready to shape.</li>
    <li> Color is slightly different from what the picture shows. Had a hard time parting the hair right, it doesn&#x27;t fall as flat as the picture portrays either</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful wig, perfect for styling. It is a bit lighter than depicted, but a definite steal. I can hardly wait to use it at the next conveontion</li>
    <li> Its alright... Its not bad, but about what you would expect. All for fun</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for a last minute Sailor Uranus cosplay on a whim since I was already making an Amazon order. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this wig for anybody with hair longer than half an inch. I already have really short hair and I still couldn&#x27;t fit it all underneath this wig, even with the included wig cap.
