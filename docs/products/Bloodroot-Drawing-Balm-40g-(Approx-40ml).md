      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>and now it is healing quite nicely.</li>
      <li>Packaged nicely.</li>
      <li>to have this salve on hand for &amp;#34;when and if&amp;#34;, a nice bit of insurance :</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t thank the wonderful people that made this stuff enough!!!</li>
      <li>My husband used this and was pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I have never been happier with a purchase , the mix of this with blood root has helped many people I know.</li>
      <li>The depth and width of the resulting around was about a ¼ inch x 1 ¼ inch but was healthy looking.</li>
      <li>As a lay herbalist I have encountered and used many plant based remedies and I&#x27;ve found this preparation very effective as used topically.</li>
      <li>Thank you for making  this product available as Australia has banned it.</li>
      <li>It is the genuine thing.  </li>
      <li>I am amazed at how well this worked, and even more amazed that I had something so large growing under the surface that I had no idea about.  </li>
      <li>This method is one of the best, I noticed the shipment was slow though .</li>
      <li>I have been putting coconut oil on the wound, as per the instructions along with castro oil and its healing very fast!</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says IF you follow the instructions!</li>
      <li>5 out of 5 success.</li>
      <li>No more problems, worked GREAT.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t very big about the size of a match top.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this one scaly bump for a couple of months, then another appeared about an inch from the first.</li>
      <li>but it is drawing much deeper than I was expecting</li>
      <li>Im so very thankful</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>thanks to God and our prayers</li>
      <li>Great stuff... had a small bump on forearm that was occasionally itchy with peeling skin... sometimes bled.  </li>
      <li>Just a final note, within 8 hours of the second application I experienced pain, redness and slight swelling around the site.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a nurse, and rationally knew that it was causing an inflammatory response, but I was surprised by how rapidly and how intensely it came on.  </li>
      <li>actually she was thinking she had cancerous mole on her right knee but</li>
      <li>The first area fell off (the initial ½ inch) in 10 days, but the area that had started growing was still there with a lot of redness adjacent to it.</li>
      <li>It takes a very tiny amount to apply, in fact, I used a tooth pick to just dab a little exactly on top of the mystery spot.</li>
      <li>salve is difficult to find and may become even more so as time goes by, so get it while you can or learn how to make it yourself, better safe than sorry.</li>
      <li>Did the job in a touchy area near the eye.  </li>
      <li>Product is working as described so far.</li>
      <li>As I am writing this today, the wound has almost completely healed and is looking like it won&#x27;t scar.  </li>
      <li>Slow process but safe for skin.</li>
      <li>One tiny dot of black salve and within an hour I had an intense reaction of redness, warmth, etc.  </li>

<li> I had a golf ball sized cyst that I tried everything on (witch hazel, lugos iodine, castro oil, other drawing salves, apple cider vinegar, epson salt baths, tea tree oil and even burdock root) but this salve was what FINALLY got rid of it!</li>

<li> However, based on all the research I did after I ordered, I&#x27;m extremely hesitant about trying this.</li>
<li> Use on only one small spot at a time.</li>
<li> After reading other reviews I was scared to try it, but I have come to realize if you use it just like instructed it works wonders!</li>
<li> but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be, in fact since it worked over a period of time there was hardly any pain at all, more of a discomfort and burning sensation.</li>
<li> Concerned, I purchased this Black Salve (Natures Scalpel)</li>
<li> I used pain medicine for a few days because it hurt to move the arm</li>
<li> I have used black salve in the past.</li>
<li> I had a small flesh colored &amp;#34;mole&amp;#34; on my nose that I had noticed was growing</li>
<li> The salve wouldn&#x27;t stay where it belonged; If you need a pea size, the salve spreads to about quarter sized, so covering the bumps with a bandage was difficult, especially with the bumps being on my backside :</li>
<li> so its hard to judge the product</li>
<li> A little scary, admittedly, because the redness continued to the elbow and down to the wrist!  </li>
<li> Some people complained it hurts, but lets face it any time something falls off or out and then needs to heal there is going to be some measure of pain</li>
<li> salve is &#x27;runny, goopy, drippy&#x27;, like cooked oatmeal, making it difficult to apply.</li>

    <li> Does exactly what it says IF you follow the instructions! I had a golf ball sized cyst that I tried everything on (witch hazel, lugos iodine, castro oil, other drawing salves, apple cider vinegar, epson salt baths, tea tree oil and even burdock root) but this salve was what FINALLY got rid of it! Im so very thankful, I was about to give up and go get it chopped out!  After reading other reviews I was scared to try it, but I have come to realize if you use it just like instructed it works wonders! Some people complained it hurts, but lets face it any time something falls off or out and then needs to heal there is going to be some measure of pain but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be, in fact since it worked over a period of time there was hardly any pain at all, more of a discomfort and burning sensation. I guarantee if you have a mole burnt or cut off or a cyst dug out it will hurt waaaayyyyy more! I have been putting coconut oil on the wound, as per the instructions along with castro oil and its healing very fast! It also worked well on a funky mole I had.  And a little goes a long way, the 40g will last me a long time, will share some with my family. I can&#x27;t thank the wonderful people that made this stuff enough!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!</li>

    <li> I have never been happier with a purchase , the mix of this with blood root has helped many people I know. This method is one of the best, I noticed the shipment was slow though .</li>
    <li> Received product on time. Packaged nicely. Product is working as described so far. I believe its going to work for me. Thanks</li>
    <li> As a lay herbalist I have encountered and used many plant based remedies and I&#x27;ve found this preparation very effective as used topically. I also use the Bloodroot tincture internally to fight cancers, and as a restorative.</li>
    <li> I got it for my mom ... actually she was thinking she had cancerous mole on her right knee but thanks to God and our prayers it was not....so its hard to judge the product</li>
    <li> My shipping experience was wonderful. Product smells and looks good. However, based on all the research I did after I ordered, I&#x27;m extremely hesitant about trying this.</li>
    <li> I had a spot appear on my arm that itched. It wasn&#x27;t very big about the size of a match top. I put this on and it pulled whatever it was out and now it is healing quite nicely. It takes a very tiny amount to apply, in fact, I used a tooth pick to just dab a little exactly on top of the mystery spot. I posted a video of it on youtube. It is really a great product!</li>
    <li> It is the genuine thing.  My wife put it on a spot on her hand and it cleared it up in just two applications. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had a small flesh colored &amp;#34;mole&amp;#34; on my nose that I had noticed was growing so I ordered this product...I have used black salve in the past. Once I applied it to this spot and a mole on my neck it went to work almost immediately. The spot on my nose is already gone...just a scab now and the one on my neck was obviously a bigger issue than I had thought. I just wanted that mole gone but it is drawing much deeper than I was expecting so I am glad that I got this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Slow process but safe for skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I had a ½ inch flesh colored spot on my arm for about 3 years that had started to enlarge to about 3/4 inch and had become itchy. I applied on 12/3/14. The first area fell off (the initial ½ inch) in 10 days, but the area that had started growing was still there with a lot of redness adjacent to it. For about five days I waited to see if anything else would happen.  I finally found some guidance online and so I reapplied the salve to the reddened area on 12/13/14. The very next day it was working and had created a quarter sized white circle that eventually pulled away and came off. The depth and width of the resulting around was about a ¼ inch x 1 ¼ inch but was healthy looking. That was 12/20/14.  As I am writing this today, the wound has almost completely healed and is looking like it won&#x27;t scar.  I am amazed at how well this worked, and even more amazed that I had something so large growing under the surface that I had no idea about.  Just a final note, within 8 hours of the second application I experienced pain, redness and slight swelling around the site. This lasted about  4 days, but immediately dissipated once the eschar started to separate.  I&#x27;m a nurse, and rationally knew that it was causing an inflammatory response, but I was surprised by how rapidly and how intensely it came on.  Again, this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> Received goods as promised. Salve did not work on me but had a reaction on a friend so I guess I have no cancer and my friend has. Thank you for making  this product available as Australia has banned it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Did the job in a touchy area near the eye.  Shared with a friend:  5 out of 5 success.</li>
    <li> Great stuff... had a small bump on forearm that was occasionally itchy with peeling skin... sometimes bled.  One tiny dot of black salve and within an hour I had an intense reaction of redness, warmth, etc.  A little scary, admittedly, because the redness continued to the elbow and down to the wrist!  I used pain medicine for a few days because it hurt to move the arm and I had to work... kept it covered.  Gradually, the center raised up and after about 8 days, it lifted out completely.  I used combinations of peroxide, aloe vera (pure, raw) and coconut oil to finish the healing and help with scar.  No more problems, worked GREAT.  Use sparingly and be prepared for some pain!  Use on only one small spot at a time.</li>
    <li> My husband used this and was pleased with the results.</li>
