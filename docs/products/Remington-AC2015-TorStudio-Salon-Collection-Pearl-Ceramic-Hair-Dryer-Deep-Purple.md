<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Cons: On the heavy side.  Buttons are placed right where your fingers hold the handle, so I keep accidentally changing the settings.  Fan on the highest setting doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as my previous Conair.  Pros: Seems well built (thus the heavy part).  Hot is hotter than my old dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned and used this dryer daily for the last 12 years. Works well on my wavy average thick hair. Its sturdy and dang near indestructible because its been dropped plenty of times. I&#x27;ve never considered getting a different one until recently, I think the motor is about to give up the ghost because it shoots out sparks (not to worry, I have not started on fire or lost any hair) but I am noticing more frizz than I have in the past. Only complaint is that the filter can not be completely removed to clean it out (has a cover but it doesn&#x27;t really do much, lots of lint still gets in there). We have to use a q-tip and canned air spray to try and remove the lint. I am going to upgrade and see what that gets me. Buying: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SKQFT4I/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 Will let you know how it compares in a week or so.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this hairdryer!! It dries my in half the time my old one did. And it doesn&#x27;t get hot to the touch like my old hairdryer did. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s heavier than I expected but not so heavy that it&#x27;s unmaneuverable.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer!  I have thick hair and it&#x27;s so nice to have a hair dryer that dries my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer!!  It is very quiet and dries my hair quickly.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am replacing my old Remington this year --- I have had my current blow dryer for about 5 years. It still works great, however some of the buttons have fallen off, so I am buying a new one. Despite the minor defects it still blow dries like a dream.</li>
    <li> I am so excited by this dryer. It much quieter than my old one and dries my hair super fast without feeling dried out.</li>
    <li> Great performance but they need work on the product painting, the paint started pilling after a few day&#x27;s using the dryer but in general it&#x27;s a great product for the price</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is so pink.. Im a guy, and thought that the colors were more reddish ceramic.. Not as it seems in the photos</li>
    <li> Very nice hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I like it.  It has great blowing power (much more than my old dryer).  It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as other, but the extra blowing power seems to speed up the drying process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY con is that the cord is unusually short.  I can&#x27;t stand any more than 3-4 feet from my plug/vanity while drying.  That&#x27;s a bit annoying BUT for the price.  It&#x27;s def. worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> The quality of ionized hair-drying you get with this dryer is no less than top of the line salon dryers like CHI. The build quality of this dryer is better than my CHI that died on me. When I opened the CHI to attempt to repair it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how cheaply made it was and I was amazed at what the retail markup must be. It&#x27;s like jewelry, they must be making a fortune...The only reason to buy a CHI over this dryer is if you are a stylist and you have an image to uphold, i.e. pretentious clientele that would look down on you for using a Remington.</li>
    <li> The dryer is stylish and works well but is on the heavy side and takes some getting used to. Overall a good purchase for the cost.</li>
    <li> I am very surprised to be writing a raving review about a hair dryer.  I never really gave much thought to my hair dryer and the potential damage it could do to my hair.  My last dryer (it was either a Clairol or Revlon-I threw it out after it starting throwing sparks) left my hair extremely dry after approximately two years&#x27; use.  I kept switching shampoos and conditioners, thinking that my hair was just changing and I needed to find a new product.  Turns out all I had to do was buy a new hair dryer!  Before purchasing this dryer, I read a few online articles that suggested a lower wattage dryer for fine hair.  That is basically how I ended up with this dryer-it was the lowest wattage dryer (besides a travel dryer) for a reasonable price.  I have only been using it for a few weeks now and the difference in the feel of my hair has been unbelievable - extremely soft!  In addition, the dryer is surprisingly quiet and dries my full head of hair in less time than my prior dryer.  Overall, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So far so good, great deal</li>
    <li> Dries hair quickly. Hot setting is really hot. I use the medium setting with full strength blower. Used to take up to 20 minutes to dry my hair, now takes about 4 - 5.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> My hair is super thick and in the past when I used to blow dry it never came out soft and smooth like after the salon, it was always dry and frizzy. A beautician friend of mine recommended switching to a ceramic iononic conditioning hair dryer and recommended the brand Hot Tools. I had purchased a ridiculously over priced hot tools hair dryer and I figured you have to pay more for results. I no longer had dry frizzy hair after blow drying, it was silky, soft and smooth just like after the salon and I was overjoyed. Several weeks ago my hot tools hair drier broke. I couldn&#x27;t afford to replace it so I looked for a cheaper alternative. I found this dryer for more than 50 dollars cheaper than the one I was trying to replace and it had very similar specifications, so I took a chance and I&#x27;ve never been happier. It does such a better job than the over priced professional hair dryer. My hair dries in nearly half the time. It&#x27;s never been smoother or softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drier is much lighter than my old one and comfortably fits in my hand due to its ergonomic shape. It isn&#x27;t very loud like most driers, instead of a high pitched whiny sound it&#x27;s nice low whooshy sound. I always compared hair driers to sounding like a power drill... well this one doesn&#x27;t sound like a power drill, it sounds like a device that blows air, like it should. The included attachments (concentrator and diffuser) are an added bonus. I&#x27;ve used the concentrator with great success and I haven&#x27;t used the diffuser yet (since I recently cut my hair very short and only use a diffuser for my natural waves when my hair is long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price the blow dryer definitely exceeds expectations. I&#x27;m going to buy the other remington Tstudio styling tools just based on my experience with the dryer.</li>
    <li> After much heavy use by two people daily, my original Remington Ac2015 finally bit the dust.  It lasted a good long time.  I loved it so much I ordered the same one as a replacement.  I didn&#x27;t even see what else was out there, which I never do - I&#x27;m the research queen!  I figured why look for something else when this one has everything.  It&#x27;s quiet, has perfect temperatures and it dries fast.  Leaves my hair silky and shiny. It is a bit heavier than some but you get used to it quickly.  Feels solid and has a nice no slip texture plus an extra long cord.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is awesome! My hair is super soft, shiny, and looks amazing. I don&#x27;t have to use my flat iron anymore. It&#x27;s heavier than most dryers I used, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Also, it&#x27;s super quiet! I would totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Pros:  dries your hair quickly, quiet, nice color (with pink details so if you don&#x27;t want pink skip this one), attachments are helpful (if you like that sort of thing).  Of the Pros I give extra points to QUIET, this is a really nice change from the noise of my old hair dryer and others I have used.  This is a nice surprise, it is reasonable in terms of sound.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  it is NOT light.  I expected this to be lighter than it is and while I am okay with it some might find this a big heavy, especially if you have lots of long hair.</li>
    <li> I think this is a salon quality one. Really great power multiple settings. The high setting gives you enough heat that you can dry your hair swiftly without frying it. If you are serious about the look of your hair and want to style it at home you should get this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the dryer or whatever, but the last few times I have blow dried my hair, it has resisted frizz and worked fast and quietly.  I live in Miami, and boy is it humid!  I have wavy hair, so the humidity does numbers on it.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like it when I hold it, I change the heat setting by mistake because of where that switch is located, but once I adjusted my grip and got used to it, it was fine.  Cool shot button for me is a must since I hear that helps seal the cuticle and whatever.  Also, it&#x27;s very light compared to others I have owned.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t the stronger dryer I have used, but it is very adequate and it is easy to handle. The shipping was quick and perfect. So If your dryer dies This was a great substitute!! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had a Remington dryer before this that lasted 5 years. I have thick, super long hair, so I needed something powerful that wouldn&#x27;t leave my arms sore from an hour&#x27;s worth of styling. My old hair dryer did the job in less than 15 minutes - it was miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new line stinks, period. Instead of staying consistently hot, it cycles through heat settings (including cold). The cord is also much shorter than before - a pain for tall women. The newest development with my dryer is sparks SHOOTING OUT from the dryer INTO my hair. Um, hello?! I&#x27;ve had this for 8 months, and I use it anywhere from 1-3 times a week for 20 minutes or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because it is still fairly powerful, and drying time isn&#x27;t insanely long. I want to love this dryer... I just wish the old version was still available.</li>
    <li> works good in comparision to other dryers</li>
    <li> The hairdryer does what it states. It&#x27;s not too noisy and dries my hair fast. It works very well like a professional hairdryer. At the decent price, it&#x27;s strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> A bit on the heavy side but very well made.  Wide range of heat and blower settings.  Works great!  When was the last time that you bought an electrical appliance for under $30 that had a FOUR YEAR WARRANTY???</li>
    <li> this met my expectations which was pretty basic.....dry my hair. It seems to be pretty sturdy and the options/functions are satisfactory. My hair is short and I have the dry and go type style which does not need the attachments, ie defuser, etc. The higest temp can get pretty hot if left in one postition too long, so you would need to be careful with that. It is a bit heavier than my previous.</li>
    <li> Quick drying, but my hair often gets knotted up when I use it on high.</li>
    <li> This is a nice blow dryer. It works well, is very solidly built (somewhat heavy for its size, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me). It is comfortable to hold and just the right size (medium...not to small or big). The highest heat setting is too hot for me (which is a change from my previous blow dryer, but tells me it has good heating elements), so I keep it on medium. For some reason, I thought it was black when I purchased it, but it is a very pretty dark plum color, with pink accents...very &amp;#34;stylish&amp;#34;! :) Oh, and I love the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; feature!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair and the power in this dryer does the job in great time!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I picked this hairdryer because of the high reviews on Amazon, and I was not disappointed.  My girlfriend loves this hairdryer.  It feels like a quality item when you hold it in your hands.</li>
    <li> Great! Its light, efficient and has a super cute design. Its even easier to use than my mom&#x27;s expensive hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is THE BEST. Powerful, easy to use. Left mine at my dads house, got home and bought another one.</li>
    <li> Dries my (longish) hair in seconds.</li>
    <li> My history is that cheap hair dryers don&#x27;t last or take forever to dry my hair.  This one does dry, and it has been reliable.  I guess you would expect that when it carries a 4-year warranty.  I find it easy to handle and operate.  It is heavy, but not too heavy to me.  It&#x27;s relatively quiet and can give good heat.  It looks good too, much better than its modest price would suggest.  It comes with an airflow diffuser and concentrator.  It has 3 heat settings and 2 air flow settings.  It&#x27;s not the best hair dryer that I own (I like my Rusk Hyperionic better), but it is probably one of the best values for families. (Note the Rusk is a professional model with a nice box and various accessories, but I paid more than $100 for it.)</li>
    <li> Fully trust in the brand and the model powerful and good</li>
    <li> I like that this hair drier is quiet. It has multiple heat settiing with a good high heat setting.  It is comfortable fit for my hand and not heavy which makes blow drying less toil some. Although not heavy it does not lack in quality and durability.  I have owned several dryers and refused to setlle for a poor quality. This is superior in quality performance and durability compared to the typical Conair brands.I have owned for several months now and have no complaints and works as well as the day I purchased  If looking for quite and quality I would recommend Remington.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I was not so sure when this arrived in the mail.  I wanted a really high quality dryer.  I had a Vidal Sassoon of the same wattage (1875).  It was a cheaper purchase a few yrs old.  About a month ago it just died.  Shopping for hair dryers seems very complicated now a days... Much of my experience is in comparison to my now dead hair dryer:  I have long (close to mid-back), caramel blond, fine strand, but high density (lots of strands/area), wavy hair.  I usually blow dry it straight with a flat brush with wide spaced bristles.  I generally wash and dry my hair 3 times/week and it&#x27;s been about a year since my last hair cut (okay... I&#x27;m an extremely low-maintenance mother of 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Ion technology:&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about this feature but my hair seems less frizzy and bushy after drying.  I still have static (since it&#x27;s winter but I think that may also be caused by my brush.)  My ends feel smoother and before buying this I felt I really needed a trim (because of split ends--but they are much less noticeable since using this dryer)&lt;br /&gt;Air Flow/Speed:&lt;br /&gt;My old dryer seemed to blow harder.  This may also be a contributing factor to my hair being less frizzy and crazy now (the old one made the strands tangle a lot more, but the low speed setting took way too long to dry my hair).&lt;br /&gt;*Loudness:&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is much quieter than most of the hair dryers I&#x27;ve used (comparing at the highest setting)  It doesn&#x27;t scream like a jet engine it&#x27;s more like a loud hum.&lt;br /&gt;*Heat:&lt;br /&gt;3 heat settings are a major plus.  My daughter&#x27;s hair dries well at the med. setting and she doesn&#x27;t complain that I&#x27;m burning her head.  Also the hottest setting feels much hotter than my other dryer.  I use it when I start drying my hair and then switch to med. at high air flow to do most of my drying.&lt;br /&gt;*Cool Shot:&lt;br /&gt;This has a cool setting which was like my old dryers cool shot but then the cool shot button on this is noticeably cooler (helps to set the style--keep my strands straight).&lt;br /&gt;Weight:&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is not light weight and is slightly heavier than my old dryer.  Initial uses made my arms tired while I dried.  I am now used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Time it takes to dry:&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty similar length of dry time to my old dryer... it seems longer because my arms can get tired.  Even though it does not blow as hard the hotter heat seems to make up for it.&lt;br /&gt;Price:&lt;br /&gt;This is a good mid-priced dryer which I feel has nice high quality features without costing 20 dollars more (or even higher).  Considering the price I paid for it, I would still return it if I didn&#x27;t feel satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Look/Feel:&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is sturdy and looks higher end (not cheap plastic like the basic models I&#x27;ve purchased before).&lt;br /&gt;Use:&lt;br /&gt;The rocking switches are not my favorite but I got used to them after a few uses and figured out the best way to hold it without accidentally changing the settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:  I really prefer my new hair dryer and it has made a positive difference in the health and appearance of my hair.  With my hair type it is a great choice.  Some of the features I thought were &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; actually seem to be better for my hair.  I looked at several other dryer models and the weight is in the middle range.  Some are twice as heavy (I would not prefer to use those to dry my own hair, but maybe to style someone else&#x27;s hair who is sitting in a chair).  If light-weight is a feature you are set on I would look for something else.  I am happy with my purchase and hope this one lasts a long time.  There are a few things I would change if it didn&#x27;t compromise the drying ability but it&#x27;s not worth it for me to spend $90 on a hair dryer.rands straight).&lt;br /&gt;Weight:&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is not light weight and is slightly heavier than my old dryer.

    <li> It is with a surprisingly great amount of pleasure that I write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old dryer (a 6+ year old Conair 1875) started smoking and making a terrible noise a few days ago. I&#x27;m thinking something got stuck in the motor, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there. All I knew was that I needed a new dryer and didn&#x27;t have time to go anywhere to get one. Luckily, Amazon is the greatest place on earth and I knew I could have one the next day so my co-workers didn&#x27;t start wondering if my water got shut off as my hair got greasier and greasier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally as I was blow drying my hair this morning with this magical piece of equipment I was thinking, &amp;#34;Who are all these nerds who buy into &#x27;ceramic&#x27; and &#x27;tourmaline&#x27; and &#x27;pearl&#x27; and all this other garbage that is marketed to make blow dryers better? That&#x27;s a bunch of malarky.&amp;#34; Then, a couple of minutes later, my hair was dry. And it looked AMAZING! I mean, freaking great! I changed nothing else in my morning routine, same shampoo, same conditioner, same half brush/half hands drying method, and my hair looked like a commercial. It was so smooth, so shiny, so silky - everything this dryer promised and so much more! Y&#x27;all, this was even on a grey, rainy, foggy, HUMID day and I still look like a radiant angel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if you&#x27;ve been using some magically hair dryer for years, your results might not be as miraculous, but going from a $15 Wal-Mart blow dryer, to this amazing piece of modern technology has been life changing. Obviously, I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s longevity, and whether the results will last, yet, but so far it&#x27;s been a life changing experience and I highly recommend that you experience it for yourself.</li>
    <li> To be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m not big into hair care and my own hair is cut quite short.  However, it&#x27;s cut into a particular style that makes blow drying a necessity if I want my hair to look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about this dryer:&lt;br /&gt;--Aesthetically, it&#x27;s gorgeous.  Very professional-looking.&lt;br /&gt;--It&#x27;s easy to adjust.  Two switches control the temperature and intensity, and there is the nice cold blast as well.&lt;br /&gt;--The diffuser is great.&lt;br /&gt;--It&#x27;s relatively quiet.&lt;br /&gt;--Handle is very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like so much:&lt;br /&gt;--It&#x27;s not quite as powerful as I&#x27;m used to.  When I go to the salon, I&#x27;m used to some pretty intense hair dryers, and I suppose if this one is being advertised as salon quality I&#x27;m expecting the same.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful hair dryer that appears to be sturdily made. Large and not exactly lightweight--my arm got a little bit tired using it (but it&#x27;s not like the exercise will hurt me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three temperature settings, three power settings (breezy, windy, hurricane) make this hair dryer suitable for almost any situation. Comes with two accessories--one lets you focus the blow, the other is a diffuser (good for curly hair). Also has a \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; button for setting the curl in place. I found this button to be in an awkward position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plug has a reset button--the dryer will shut off before it blows a fuse or burns up the motor. I had to reset it once during the several uses I&#x27;ve given it. Not quite sure what causes that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s a good quality dryer, much better than my old one, one I intend to use for years. And it&#x27;s a pretty color--chocolate brown with pink trim.</li>
    <li> We were a little skeptical but this hair dryer does what it claims. First, it&#x27;s a lot quieter than any other hair dryer we&#x27;ve used. They&#x27;re all a little noisy but this one is by far the least noisy. It claims to make your hair shinier, too. Maybe, if you use it the right way. We&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now and it&#x27;s hard to tell but we&#x27;re inclined to believe the hype. Overall, a superb product so far.</li>
    <li> My first thought when I pulled it out of the box was that it was very stylish. I love the pink! It is very professional-looking indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the dryer has a nice long cord, as almost every dryer I have ever owned have had short chords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer is  really powerful. I have short hair and the dryer dried my hair rather quickly. The two attachments the dryer comes with were easy to place on and remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three heat and two speed selections. I found the  highest heat setting very hot, but it would be perfect for someone with long thick hair. The medium setting works well for my short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two minor complaints with the dryer: The weight of the dryer is a little heavier than I&#x27;m use to and  my 2nd complaint is with the placement of the controls. It made it kind of hard to hold and dry my hair, as I was trying hard not to accidentally change the settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That will just take some getting use to on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer is a great product and certainly worth the price.</li>
    <li> The best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. I may have to get another one. My wife and daughter are also using this. Very powerful but quiet motor. Many settings. Comes with a four year warranty. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer that I have ever used. It makes my hair soft and smooth, not dry and stiff like my old hair dryer. Only downside is that it does weigh a bit more than any other dryer I have used.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Remington hair dryer for several years now. I think the one I am currently using is my 3rd, and this recent purchase is my backup for when the current one runs its course.  I am particular in wanting a hair dryer with oomph. I like hairdryers with big bursts of hair - basically that are loud and fast.  I grow impatient with many other models.  This one fits the bill just right.  I also like the look and feel.</li>
    <li> Nice hairdryer but somewhat heavy and the buttons are placed right where you grip it so sometimes the buttons are accidentally pressed during use. But overall a very nice hairdryer for a good price.</li>
    <li> I already had one of these as my grown children recommended this great hair dryer.  I just bought two more to have in our condo for vacation rentals.  It is so nice to stay in a place that has a decent hair dryer.  This is the one!</li>
    <li> I would not buy this again.  It works well and does its purpose.  My complaints are it is heavy and loud!</li>
    <li> I received this through the Amazon Prime program and let my friend&#x27;s girlfriend give it a try.  She loved it, said that it was quite powerful and came with a lot of accessories. I do not usually blow dry my hair, but I did try it a couple of times and it is quite powerful. It does have different settings, so it can be adjusted to your preference. Does what it is suppose to do and looks nice. Size is big, so you will need a little extra space compared with regular blowers.</li>
    <li> There was nothing good about this hair dryer. The lowest hat setting was frigid, the middle was too hot, and the highest felt like it would burn my scalp. The cold button completely canceled out any heat. The diffuser portion was terrible and did not properly redirect the air flow. It felt like there was no diffuser on it at all. The attachments are made of shiny plastic and feel extremely cheap. Just when I thought this product couldn&#x27;t get any worse, the air intake managed to suck in my hair. The holes are too big and the opening is too close to the fan, allowing the perfect opportunity to yank some of my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the worst hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. It could do nothing right.</li>
    <li> Context: I am a male, who needs a hair dryer to volumize/texturize/dry as quickly as possible in the mornings.  Pros: Does exactly what I need it to.  - Dries quickly and efficiently.  - Shapes my hair exactly the way I want it.  - Multiple modes that I switch among depending on how wet my hair is (post-shower or a little later).  - Feels nice to hold (I don&#x27;t mind the weight; actually prefer heaviness).  Cons: Very few.  - Size is a bit large and non-compact.</li>
    <li> I love this blowdryer, my first one gave up to me after yrs of use.  I tried replacing it with different models because I couldn&#x27;t find this one but none made my hair look good.  I finally found this one on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be happier, my hair is looking shiny and healthy again like salon done.</li>
    <li> I would have rated this hairdryer higher, perhaps even 5 stars because it works really well and my hair has been healthy and shiny even though I don&#x27;t use styling products on my hair, but.... it has started making a popping sound and shooting out sparks at me!!  I have never had a hair dryer do this.  It seems quite dangerous.  Today I my left index finger feels like it got a slight burn on it after I used the dryer.  It sparked once a few days ago, but today is was much worse and made the popping sound quite a few times.  I will have to go out and buy a new one today and I&#x27;m sure there will be no customer support from Remington, so I&#x27;m not going to bother.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again unfortunately because it did not last nearly long enough before it started to malfunction.</li>
    <li> My mom has this same dryer only a few years older and she loves hers and I liked hers so much I had to get my own. And I love it, it is so much quieter then my old dryer and I love the attachments and the fact I can change the temperature and it has a 4 year warrenty.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and they can&#x27;t say enough great things about this.  Her hair is silky smooth where last dryer left it frizzy.  Came with a bunch of different tips too.  If I needed one I would get one for myself too.</li>
    <li> I work in a barber shop,  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now and it does what I need it to do. The power force of the air flow could be higher, but for the price you pay this is a great buy. How ever, it has a strange smell when on the cool setting, an electrical smell... but I only use the med. to high heat setting at all times, so I really don&#x27;t smell it.</li>
    <li> the photo is different from the product. Some parts are very pink which make it ugly.</li>
    <li> Just got the Remington last week, cant be more happy with it. The three temperatures on it are just right I am excited to say that  there is an actual difference between hot and warm air. Unlike most other hair dryers this one does not damage or overheat  my hair.  After I&#x27;m done using it my hair feels soft and doesn&#x27;t feel tangled.&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about it is the amount if air this little guy pushes out. I can dry my hair on a cool setting withing 5 minutes no problem, and if I use warm air it takes me about 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is pretty light weight so styling my hair easy and takes little time.&lt;br /&gt;Love this model especially with the cost of it. It&#x27;s a GREAT BUY. If you are in the market for a good hair dryer,  and are looking for a reasonable price this is it.  worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love it! Dries hair fast without tangles!</li>
    <li> Good solid unit.  Feels super well constructed.  I am an electrical engineer and appreciate the solid heavy motor.  This likely means it will last.  It moves a bunch of air.  It heats quickly and strongly without odor.  Does a terrific job on hair.  Noise level is quite low for the amount of air its moving.  The surface finish remains excellent after 6 months of heavy use.  My wife loves it.  The buttons are placed such that neither one of us inadvertently changes the settings during use.  Neither of use uses the attachments so no help there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I stress the solid feel of the unit as a good thing, I don&#x27;t feel it is too heavy and neither does my wife.  I guess it depends on your expectations.  It will probably strike some as too heavy.  Not us.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works fast to dry hair. It&#x27;s quiet in operation even on high speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body of the dryer is smooth feeling, kind of soft almost. Not like a hard shiny plastic feels. It&#x27;s a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a removable intake filter allowing a clean fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is long enough to use the dryer comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of power and heat to dry even the longest hair quickly. The added pearl ceramics is supposed to help with prevent hair damage. We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could pay more for a hair dryer, but why?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s styled like a profession hair dryer, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s not as solidly manufactured, especially the buttons. The high heat setting is slightly too hot, and the low airflow setting seems weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fine mid-range dryer and a good value for the price, but you will likely have to pay over $100 for a true professional dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My comparison dryer is the Elchim Professional 2001. That is a real professional dryer.</li>
    <li> Ok, I am not a hair stylist, for that matter in a few years drying my hair will be an act of remembrance.  That being said, my wife, the primary user of this, loves this.  The dual heat and fan controls allows her to get just the right touch.  From my perspective, this is well built.  Heavier that the usual hair dryer and with an easily removable rear grate that will prevent the fan from burning out over prolonged use.  You will get many years out of this great dryer!</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING!  Dries my hair very fast and it&#x27;s so shiny when I&#x27;m done.  The only negative is that it&#x27;s pretty heavy, but I&#x27;ll just chalk that up to an arm workout!  :)</li>
    <li> Before choosing a hair dryer I went to a local store to check them out and decide which one I wanted.  A lot of the dryers there felt light and flimsy or they rattled when I picked them up.  The only two I particularly liked were this one, and another that cost 3x as much.  I ordered this one from Amazon and am very pleased with it.  It is well built, and while others said that it was heavy it is lighter than the hair dryer I owned previously and I don&#x27;t find it heavy at all!  The other great thing about the dryer is that it is pretty quiet compared to others I have owned.  The placement of the buttons aren&#x27;t annoying and when you hold it you don&#x27;t end up changing the settings by accident.  There are two included attachments - a concentrator and diffuser.  I use the concentrator (this attachment is a must for me) but not the diffuser so I can&#x27;t say much about that.  The heat settings are just right, and the hot isn&#x27;t too hot.  Overall this is a very nice product, the dryer itself is solid and has a nice finish and it performs well!</li>
    <li> My old salon quality dryer broke and I had to find a replacement.  My criteria?  It must dry fairly quickly, straighten my thick wavy hair without too much damage, have a longer cord and cost $40 or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began by purchasing the highly rated Revlon RV544.  It worked just \\&quot;OK\\&quot;.  The fatal flaw with that model was the short cord.  It was only about 6 feet long and it wouldn&#x27;t reach across our deep countertop to where I needed to use it.  Not wanting to use an extension cord with this appliance, I tried to plug it into my makeup mirror to overcome the short cord.  The way the plug is designed, it absolutely would not stay plugged into the makeup mirror and fell out multiple times each time I tried to dry my hair.  I only used this dryer for a week, but my hair began to look dull and I wondered what long term use of this dryer would do to it.  Back to the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I bought the Conair 259 Infiniti Pro which came well recommended.  Another disappointment.  It had a short cord, was extremely loud and it barely heated up enough to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last try was the Remington Studion Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer.  After using it for a month, I love it!  My hair dries in a reasonable amount of time, it looks sleek, shiny and to be in excellent condition.  The dryer is not overly loud (although I wouldn&#x27;t call it quiet either), the cord is longer than most standard dryers and it was in my price range.  I really don&#x27;t see how my hair could look better even if I used a $200 dryer.  I would highly recommend this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 1/23/13:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is still working great.  I love it so much I bought another one to keep on hand in case the first one breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased the Remington Pearl Ceramic Paddle brush and the large barrel round brush too.  They work together to make my hair look so glossy and shiny.  They are my favorites of all time - and that&#x27;s saying something.  Stop your research, get the Remington Pearl Ceramic dryer and a Pearl Ceramic brush and I bet you&#x27;ll agree...they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> After having a crappy blow dryer for years, it is nice to have on that actually works!!</li>
    <li> It looks and feels like a $100 product even though it&#x27;s only around $40.  But most importantly, it works like an expensive hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as we received this product, the girls in our home stop using the other dryer that they have been using and that we paid much more.  After a few months of using it, it became the only dryer they would use.  With three ladies using it daily, this dryer has never failed them so far.</li>
    <li> I love my new blow dryer. It was delivered on time. By far the best blow dryer I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this (especially when it arrived super fast -- within 24 hours of ordering).  Sadly, the cord was short, and it was difficult to hold and use without accidentally switching the buttons.  It left my hair feeling like straw.  Time to try another!</li>
    <li> Sweet, works as expected!</li>
    <li> I purchased my previous dryer from my stylist but it was so heavy I quit using it.  The Pearl Ceramic dryer has the same features but is considerably lighter and works wonders with my naturally curly hair.  It dries my hair really quickly and that is what we use them for, especially in southern humidity! Both the diffuser and the air concentrator are useful for various styles.  I use a little wax mousse and presto! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The first impression from the wife on this one was that it looked &#x27;pretty&#x27;. The hair dryer actually is brownish with pink details, contrary to what the pictures on this page may suggest (Black) It has a very &#x27;girlie&#x27; elegant look, so the first impression was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a while you can clearly tell this is designed for heavy duty, my wife owns a Conair hair dryer and this one is definitely quieter then the Conair one and more potent. It is indeed heavier but at the same time slim, basically it is not a big hair dryer but it is heavier than your average ones, not a big deal but worth mentioning. It has two speed settings you can use and three different temperature settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, a very &#x27;professional&#x27; hair dryer, better than the old Conair the wife will no longer use. Additionally an accessory to give volume to the hair is included.</li>
    <li> This dryer crapped out on me in less than a year.  Do not recommend</li>
    <li> After reading all the great reviews I thought this blow dryer would really be something.  But after using it for a few weeks I think it&#x27;s just okay.  I have really thick hair, and I don&#x27;t think it dries my hair any faster than other dryers I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s not a bad dryer, it works fine.  It&#x27;s just not awesome like I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I finally realized just how much my tiny travel hairdryer was damaging my hair so I started searching for a new one. I picked this one, and I am very happy with it so far. I use a small amount of leave-in conditioner and a few drops of a defrizz product and my hair turns out great! The dryer has a nice array of settings; I usually put it on the hottest setting because the others don&#x27;t seem warm enough. The cool setting works well, too. The dryer is fairly quiet, too, even at high settings, which is a huge change from my travel dryer. The one drawback I&#x27;ve found so far is the weight of this dryer. My travel dryer was of course very light and compact so it&#x27;s been an adjustment getting used to the size and weight of this one. My arm gets a little tired as I&#x27;m finishing, but it&#x27;s not a big problem. Definitely a good purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace another Remington that I&#x27;d used for a few years.  So far, I&#x27;ve been really happy with my purchase.  I chose this because of the quality of Remingtons I&#x27;ve had in the past, and this one seems to be just the same as the others.  Quality.  The blow dryer does have a slight rubbery feel.  I&#x27;ve never had one like that.  Can&#x27;t say I care; it&#x27;s just different.  Not better or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did choose this one specifically because of the attached diffuser.  Essential for those of us with curly hair, and it works well.</li>
    <li> This is the only dryer I use. I love the force and power it has. If you want volume this is the way to go</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hairdryer.... Just ordered my second one, I had the first one for years. It is the best hairdryer I have ever used. Tried to get by for the last year with a conair, just didn&#x27;t cut it. This one leaves my bleached fine hair so shiny, soft, and healthy. I will never buy another dryer :)</li>
    <li> OK, beautiful color, stylish, not heavy seems long lasting probably a good dryer for the right person.  Unfortunately I will have to return it.  This dryer takes a very long time to dry the  hair, it is not hot or powerful enough this should be best for fine hair.  it is kind of uncomfortable to hold as well,  I feel sad since I have to return it but it is not right for me, Love the pink color but what can you do?</li>
    <li> I wanted a hairdryer with decent power/air output, that was fairly quiet, at a decent (consumer) price. I was tired of other \\&quot;weak\\&quot; hairdryers that didn&#x27;t have enough air output, and found this one had the power to dry my thick hair. The finish is a nice rubberized maroon color that looked good too! It&#x27;s pretty easy to hold, smaller in size and weight, and has a long cord. The lint screen on the back is easy to access too, which is often what causes a hairdryer to lose its air flow, so that&#x27;s super handy.  I actually purchased a second one of these online (the first one broke, my fault, after I slammed it on the counter oops :S) after Wal-Mart stopped carrying them so I&#x27;m a happy customer reviewer (and I&#x27;m pretty picky)</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is great! I bought it as a gift for my sister and so far it works fine and looks very good. I specially like the material. The whole surface of the dryer is cover with something similar to a rubber material rather than plastic, which is the usual. This material kind of makes easier to hold the dryer, makes it more resistant to falls and provides it with a great appearance! It looks beautiful! The dryer also is smaller than it looks in the picture, which for me was also great. This dryer is just way better than they show in pictures, I&#x27;m planning to buy another one for me.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer, first off, is great because it&#x27;s QUIET. My daughter despises the noise from most hairdryers and this doesn&#x27;t bother her in the least. Also, its ion technology is much gentler on her hair (and mine), which I&#x27;m in favor of as well. One of the best features, however, is that it is lightweight, which makes it terrific for travel, not to mention being easy on my forearms and shoulders (I have pretty thick hair and it takes forever to dry). It&#x27;s a solid piece of equipment and I&#x27;ve already purchased another. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It is very quiet but strong.  It puts out an amazing amount of heat.  The only negative thing I can say is that the buttons are right where my fingers are and sometimes I shut it off.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair quicker than my older one.  A little heavy though</li>
    <li> Would give zero stars if allowed. The day it arrived, took it out of the box, plugged in and nothing. Just a big puff of smoke that smelled awful. Unplugged and it continued to smoke. Very disappointed in this. Thought I have found a trusted manufacturer and decently priced hair dryer. Back it went for return.</li>
    <li> There is no way this dryer is blowing 1875. The reason I bought a new hair dryer is that I was reminded how much power I had lost when I was staying at a hotel and used a new hairdryer that dried my hair quickly and left my hair soft and shiny. I thought, WOW, time to replace my old one, the power is just not what is used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this Remington based on the reviews. I can see no difference in power with my old worn out dryer, my hair took forever to dry and was frizzy and unmanagable. VERY dissapointed.</li>
    <li> A country singer named Mark Wills ([[ASIN:B00006WKV0 Mark Wills - Greatest Hits]]) talks of (now departed) Farrah Fawcett and 8-track tapes and I must admit that is what I thought of when I saw this item become available.  Back in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s when the Farrah Fawcett hair-do&#x27;s were all the rage, blow dryers were a staple of just about everyone&#x27;s grooming materials.  Having a tool that could be used to quickly dry your hair and give it that nice, full-bodied, wind-blown look was something everyone felt the need for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s many years later now (decades, really?!?, holy c---! I must be getting old), and the thinning hair on my head is definitely confirming that I&#x27;m getting older, so I had to ask myself just how useful this device might be in my household.  And that, dear readers (hey, I should stop for a second and say thanks for reading this review, I do appreciate it, as I also appreciate the feedback and comments that people leave on the reviews I write) is where my daughter comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, yes, my daughter, she the big fan of That 70&#x27;s Show ([[ASIN:B0002PYS5G That &#x27;70s Show - Season One]]) If she only knew how much of that show was based on real events in some people&#x27;s lives ;-)  With her long and somewhat thick hair that requires water-heater draining long showers to clean, she is becoming a fan of using a blow dryer to try to speed up the drying process a bit so she doesn&#x27;t have to go to bed with her hair wet even hours after she stepped out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, my daughter does fret a bit over not wanting to over-use the blow dryer as she doesn&#x27;t want to damage her hair from too much heat.  That&#x27;s an area where she found one particular feature of this dryer handy -- it has a mode that lets you run air through the dryer without heating it so you still get the wind blowing through the hair, but don&#x27;t have to worry that you might burn your hair in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own personal use of this item has been more limited, basically coming down to plugging it in, blasting the wet hair and confirming that it dried.  Well, not really that simple, but not that far from it.  I did make use of the non-heated blown air myself and thought it was a neat feature, but again with much less hair that dries in much less time, it wasn&#x27;t a feature that I would expect a male in the family would use as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend the purchase of this item for someone shopping for a (blow) hair dryer?  I would give that a hearty yes.  It works as it should and that&#x27;s really all the more I could ask of it.ing it in, blasting the wet hair and confirming that it dried.

    <li> I gave this dryer to the missus to try, since she uses one everyday and tears through one or two a year. I figured she&#x27;d be the perfect person to rate this against a number of other dryers. Here&#x27;s what she said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;First of all, this hair dryer looks sleek (chocolate brown with powder pink accents) and it doesn&#x27;t look bad or distracting just sitting by the sink or on the dresser. (Some huge salon models that look like they power wind tunnels are much more obtrusive.) This one is rather long and slightly heavier, however, than the Con Air Infinity hair dryer I&#x27;ve been using, so it took a little getting used to the heft. The noise level is average (the same as Con Air), but it dries my hair much faster and seems like it gives more volume to my hair. The speed also allows me to style my hair better and it stays that way longer. While most blow dryers have multiple settings, this Remington really has noticeable differences between the settings, with warm being warm and hot actually being hot instead of \\&quot;a little warmer\\&quot;. The selection switches on this model are also much easier to change to get to those settings, and unlike most slide switch type models, they can be changed on the fly while styling without having to fumble and fret with the dryer. No doubt about it, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this dryer.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So of course, we give it five stars.</li>
    <li> This is a good dryer while it lasts.  Quiet, good heat, not too heavy. But I have owned it less than six months and yesterday it stopped producing heat, just blew cold air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I just called Remington.  They warranty the product for three years and are sending me a new dryer.  No hassle.</li>
    <li> Quiet and quick. My old hairdryer was a screamer and I got this one because I was developing tinnitus and everything I read suggested controlling decibels was important.  The buttons are right where you grip the handle, so it takes a little getting used to placing fingers so you&#x27;re not changing your settings.  My hair is smoother.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is reasonably priced for the quality of the product. The sleek design, quiet operation, and versatile settings were what I was looking for in a replacement hair dryer- and this product delivers. I&#x27;ve only used it twice and am already in love with it.</li>
    <li> This replaces a dryer I&#x27;ve had for years.  I&#x27;ve always blown the circuit in the bathroom or shut down the dryers when I&#x27;ve dried my thick hair, and then had to wait for it to cool down or reset the circuit button.  However, I haven&#x27;t had that problem with this dryer at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice, solid-feeling dryer that doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot on the outside (well, except for the very end).  Most important of all right now, it doesn&#x27;t scare my baby, who doesn&#x27;t like loud noises.  I used it even on the high setting after trying out the others, and she didn&#x27;t care what I was doing.  I rate this a four because of the coating getting scratched up, but if you don&#x27;t care about that, this is probably a five to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;several settings including cool and quiet settings&lt;br /&gt;solid&lt;br /&gt;diffuser attachment&lt;br /&gt;stays cool while drying thick hair&lt;br /&gt;attractive except for con below&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ceramic has a rubbery coating that scratches easily if you&#x27;re concerned about that sort of thing</li>
    <li> This gives an incredible blow job!! I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Enjoy the settings for heat and power. Very sturdy. I have dropped it and the rubbery plastic is unscathed. It is a bit heavier than others, but it seems well-made</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this dryer! I have really thick/coarse hair and have always had to flat iron my hair after drying; but not anymore!!! 15 minutes and I am ready to go!!! No flat iron necessary!!!</li>
    <li> I gave this dryer to my sister, who raved about it and said it was the best hair dryer she&#x27;d ever used. Here is the review she wrote for me:    \\&quot;The Remington Pearl Ceramic hair dryer comes with a full line of useful features...    \\&quot;Among its better aspects, the dryer is attractive, lightweight, and marvellously quiet. It has a cool shot as well as three heat settings which get warm enough to dry hair quickly, without frying it.    \\&quot;The dryer comes with an attached hook from which it can be hung, as well as a diffuser and a concentrator. The result is sleek, straight, or wavy hair -- depending on which attachment you use. I highly recommend this dryer. I can find nothing negative to say about it.\\&quot;    So... there ya go!</li>
    <li> This is a good hair blower for the price.  It is a little heavier than other plastic hair blowers maybe because of the material they used to make them.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Good dryer for curly hair</li>
    <li> My husband and I are both very pleased with this blow dryer.  My hair is very think and long and it dries very quickly.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this blowdryer by a good friend, who was also recommended it by a friend. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it nice and smooth. I had my old dryer for over 4 years, and the change in my hair&#x27;s texture and the amount of time it took to dry my hair was huge. I would recommend this to anyone, and I really like the look and style of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not that impressed. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the time it took to dry my hair. And it&#x27;s heavier than my old dryer. However I did notice that my hair does look smoother.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this product, before I buy ANY product off Amazon, I read the reviews first. I read one that mentioned the air not being strong enough...uhhhhh you sure you had it set on the right button? Because mine was blowing my hair to kingdom come, SERIOUSLY! I had to rush for work yesterday and was afraid I wasn&#x27;t going to make it with my cheap Target Revlon blow drying that took me FOREVER to blow dry my hair and I always had this spot right in the back middle of my hair that took longest to dry. Well, I got this in the mail yesterday morning, rushed to plug it in and it literally took me one min, maybe less to get my entire hair dry (even that spot). I love that it didn&#x27;t even have to be on full heat to do it. My other blow dryer left my hair soooooo dry. The ends looked frizzy and lifeless. So I bought this blow dryer and the sleek hair straighter and let me just say, I am in LOVE with these products and so freaking happy!!! The texture of the blow dryer is very smooth and pretty looking. Because of bother of those products, I was NOT late for work :D. I would recommend the sleek hair straightener and this blow dryer to anyone. I haven&#x27;t tried the other products, but I would not hesitate to if I was interested. 150% satisfied customer!!!</li>
    <li> Oh god my hair was a disaster with my previous hairdryer, my MAIN issues is FRIZZ!! This reduced the frizzyness soo much and the dry time is so fast- also i think it&#x27;s surprisingly quiet. I was going to spend like 200 dollars on a Velecta or  something else but I&#x27;m broke right now so this was an AMAZING economical option. Why this is the best economical choice over hot tools and infinity ect: AC Motor, Ionic Technology and Ceramic. Materials: Titanium, Tourmaline, Ceramic : compared to ALL other dryers its made with ALL the best matericals for your hair to reduce frizz and increase dry time. I picked this over the BabyBliss Pro!    It has everything you should look for in a good dryer for a good price.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my sister&#x27;s hair, and it was solon quality! She has fine/ wavy hair. It made her have so much volume. I have VERY thick hair/curly. It made it very smooth and no frizzies. love it so far. we will see how it goes o;</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is terribly overrated.  Within a year it started blowing sparks onto my hair.  It burns so hot I can&#x27;t use the highest setting and it is so heavy it&#x27;s crazy.  Can&#x27;t believe so many people have rated this dryer as one worth buying.</li>
    <li> Seems slow to blow. Works okay otherwise. Not a lot of power compared to my much less expensive dryer that lasted 6 years. I should have replaced it with the same one but went with reviews I saw on Amazon about this dryer. Live and learn.</li>
    <li> Very good buy is what I was looking for gifts, it is in very good condition and I have no complaints, thanks.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair incredibly quickly. What used to take 20 minutes now takes 5, it makes getting ready in the morning much more pleasant.</li>
    <li> The speed and heat settings being separate are nice. The anti-static seems to work, compared with my 8-year-old dryer my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz up as much.</li>
    <li> My previous Remington dryer (which I loved) died after a few years, so it was time for a new one.  The good reviews seemed legit for this one &amp; I have the matching Remington Pearl Straightener, so I went for it.  BACKROUND:  I have long, thick, wavy, blonde hair that I wash &amp; straighten every 3 days or so.  PROS:  I like the looks of this dryer &amp; it dries my hair.  Other than that, this dryer is horrible!  CONS:  It is the heaviest dryer I have ever owned, the buttons are so awkwardly placed that it is difficult to get a good grip w/out changing a setting, &amp; it takes a long time to dry my hair (much longer than my last few dryers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did so many people rave about this?  I don&#x27;t get it.  I would return this if I could, but I already demolished the box.  Booooo!</li>
    <li> I really love this little dryer.  It is very professional looking and as others have mentioned it is feels soft and velvety to the touch. It dries my hair quickly and is not too loud, all things considered.  I would say for smoothing it is not a miracle worker, but it does much better than your cheapie dryers, and can help an amateur like me control the frizz somewhat.  I think super smoothing requires more proper technique than just a magic hair dryer.  Unfortunately I am not well versed in that technique, but with this dryer my hair doesn&#x27;t look too frazzled and out of control.  My only issue with this dryer is that I have very long hair and sometimes when I am using it the hair gets sucked into the fan on the back end of the dryer.  I think this is because this dryer is smaller than my last dryer so I need to adjust for this better. Overall though, its the best quality for the price I have had in a dryer.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many blow dryers and this one has been my favorite.</li>
    <li> Product is and works as described, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The Cadillac of hair dryers .</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s not too heavy, not loud, the cored about 4ft, gives good heat, and leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> i had a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; hair dryer and it broke, i picked this one based on the reviews and the price and i love it. it takes me 15 min to dry my medium hair and it doesnt cause a lot of frizz.</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer.  I bought it based on reviews.  It is slightly heavier than my old one, but it&#x27;s well balanced and is smaller, which I like.  As far as the placement of the buttons, I find that my thumb goes right between both buttons so when it&#x27;s on, I don&#x27;t move either button during use.  Quite happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is slightly velvety to the touch which feels great, and the heat settings are exactly as I expected. My favourite hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever purchased, hands down.</li>
    <li> Loved the products and very pleased with the quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dryer I have brought it works amazingly on my hair and my daughters hair. I have tried other blowers but they would always leave my hair fizzy and dull. But this blower leaves my hair soft, manageable and frizz free.</li>
    <li> Drying my hair has never required much time since I live in an arid climate, yet this dryer seems to dry my hair more quickly &amp; to increase the volume.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair blower for my daughter-in-law&#x27;s as she liked mine so much.  She  said she really likes it, especially the high power setting.</li>
    <li> I bought this Two days ago as my old dryer (conair 1875 watt) hasn&#x27;t been drying as well lately.  I was impressed immediately with this dryer.  It is beautiful.  It is slightly heavier than my last one,  but it cut drying time considerably so I don&#x27;t think this will be an issue.  It has three speeds.  It has three temperature settings. The highest is hotter than any blow dryer i have ever used.  I just dried my hair with it and my naturally wavy hair is so straight that I don&#x27;t need to break out my flat iron. Yes, I am amazed by this thing! The medium heat setting is equivalent to my last dryers hottest setting.  I have twin daughters that are young and I think the only setting cool enough to dry their hair with is the lowest heat Setting. This dryer is so powerful,  yet a ton quieter than my previous dryer. My husband even commented on how quiet it is. My husband also liked the fact that it is heavier.  Being a mechanic he said it probably has a stronger,  more durable motor. I was reading the booklet that was included, and this dryer has a four year warranty.  That&#x27;s pretty astounding considering the price point.  I love this dryer,  and I&#x27;d buy it again in a heart beat.  I&#x27;m thinking about buying another one to store,  because I seriously love it that much!  Go buy it!</li>
    <li> Can I just say that this is my SECOND hair dryer by Remington? I loved my first one so much that I wore it out! (A one to many drops on the floor after a few years)</li>
    <li> works well so far.  temp not as warm as I would have expected compared to other manufacturers&#x27; products; and the air velocity not as good even with concentrator - but acceptable. 4 not 5 stars.</li>
    <li> it is better than what i expect and gives me more than i want. this hair dryer has three shifts which are perfect for me. it also can swithch to the cold model. loves it. highly recommend</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product, but there are too many problems. I have thick, curly hair and purchased this products to give myself a blowout. First, it is WAY too long/big. My arm hurts and it is nearly impossible to position my hands to give myself a blowout with the size of this things. Second, about 10 minutes into using it, it overheats and blows the fuse in my house. So I have to leave he bathroom and go reset the circuit breaker to finish drying my hIr EVERY SINGLE TIME. Seriously?! Third, it recently started sparking and has now become dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recently staying at a hotel and tried a less powerful, compact ionic hair travel hair dryer and was able to comfortably give myself a blowout in less than half the time. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m requesting a refund for this piece of crap and will be purchasing a tourmaline travel sized hair dryer for the same price hat won&#x27;t make me cuss every morning in the dark, will save my shoulder the pain, and will hopefully not threaten to shock me like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: The power is not always worth the headache of overheating and the uncomfortable size. Plus, ceramic doesn&#x27;t even heat as evenly as tourmaline or ionic, so save yourself the trouble and get a better option.</li>
    <li> Good cheap hair dryer.  Nothing fancy, but works well.  I would love to upgrade to something nicer later, but for when funds are tight this works well.</li>
    <li> Any girl/women will fall in love with the look of this dryer. Its definitely made to impress anyone who is looking for a product that works and looks great too. I bought it for the same reason. I own a Remington Straightener and almost can&#x27;t live without it. This one compliments it perfectly.  The weight of the dryer is perfect. It does not feel heavy and is comfortable to work with. I wash my hair almost daily and this dryer comes in handy every time. It comes with bonus diffuser and concentrator attachments. I have very thin and fine hair and the diffuser seems like its made for a person with thick hair. Its too big for my hair.   The features that I love in this product are:  1. It has a removable air intake screen which make cleanup so easy.   2. Its sleek design and light weight.  3. Long cord and heat settings.  Features I wish were addressed:  1. It makes a lot of noise and my husband always complaints about that.  2. Though the cord is long and convenient for usage, its difficult to store because its not retractable.  Overall its a great buy and I can see myself using it for a very long time.</li>
    <li> This portable hair dryer is much better than I expected. Solid, powerful, and well made. Would definitely buy it again if I had to.</li>
    <li> Simply put, this is absolutly the best blow drier I have ever used. I&#x27;ve used professional driers in the past but this one more than keeps up with ones costing 3 times the price. It&#x27;s perfectly balanced and feels good in your hand. While it dries your hair quickly, it never feels like it&#x27;s burning your hair as lesser uits do. All in all, I can&#x27;t recommend this item strongly enough.</li>
    <li> Great dryer, easy to hold, made really well, drys hair in no time at all</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer so much, I got online to review it...  Of all the dryers I&#x27;ve owned (including a T3) this one dries the fastest and leaves my hair smooth not frizzed.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s going to perform miracles and turn a rat&#x27;s nest into a Pantene commercial; but I use to run my straightening iron through my hair just to smooth it out a bit more, and I don&#x27;t feel the need to do that anymore.</li>
    <li> My wife has had this for almost 2 years and she likes it, still works just fine</li>
    <li> I have had this dryer for 3+ years and it&#x27;s still going strong. I love the &amp;#34;satin&amp;#34; feel of the dryer, the 3 settings (plus the &amp;#34;cool jet&amp;#34; button), and the diffuser and concentrator are perfect. This dryer has been through the ringer- from airports to duffle bags to being dropped, etc- and it still works like the day I bought it. Super easy to clean out the dust in the filter too, the back just screws off. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I just bought this blower twice the second time that I used the head of the cord melted.  This is something very dangerous I could be electrocuted.  I don&#x27;t recommended this blower and also it is very difficult to communitcate with Remington products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used another popular brand of hair dryer for years, but I recently purchased a Remington straightener, and I then decided to update my years-old hair dryer. After doing lots of research, I found that this was the most popular Remington Hair Dryer and had great reviews. I have used it a couple of times since receiving it, and I like it. I think I prefer my previous hair dryer more, as the hair seemed softer, but this one does just fine- and actually dries my hair faster than my older one. I was looking for ionic, and this has that as well. Buy this hair dryer on amazon- i found it was the cheapest price! Try it out for yourself.</li>
    <li> great quality for a great price.  dries my hair pretty quick and leaves it smooth, silky and adds volume to the hair.  I use this with TRESemme Thermal CreationsHeat Tamer Spray on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that takes forever to dry. My boyfriend bought this for me for my birthday and it has taken time off of my morning routine and it also matches my curling wands! I love the pink and black design and it&#x27;s much quieter than my old hair dryer. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this quiet, efficient dryer!!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is advertised as quiet, but it is just as loud as any other. It is way too powerful for me, making me feel like I am in a windtunnel while using. I tried it for about 1 minute, turned it off, and repacked it to return. It is a very nice looking dryer and I wish it worked, but I can&#x27;t style my hair when the air is coming out so strong.</li>
    <li> The dryer does its job well and despite its large size is fairly easy to handle.  Speaking of the handle, it stays cool, as does the rest of the casing.  It is a bit noisier than I thought it would be but it has a deeper sound than our previous dryer... which kind of whined.</li>
    <li> It is pretty quiet, has a textured exterior to prevent sliding, the tools work well, the heat and fan speeds are great.     I think it is faster than my last dryer, but I don&#x27;t know if it make your hair less frizzy.  It definitely does a better job than my old Conair.</li>
    <li> I did really like this hairdryer - I bought it and it worked well, was not too noisy, had some good power. But after less than a month using it 3-4 times per week for 15 minutes, it just suddenly died and no amount of resuscitation would bring it back to life! Fortunately Amazon gave me a full refund including shipping - I don&#x27;t know if it was just a defective one or if it is a common problem with this hair dryer - but that was the end of that. I then went nuts on a $100.00+ salon hair dryer and am quite happy now.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and it worked out amazingly! She loves the product. You would never guess that you could buy such a quality hair dryer at such a cheap price!</li>
    <li> I really loved this hairdryer when I first got it. I liked the button layout and the way it felt holding it was not awkward to switch between temps. However, this hairdryer lasted me less than 6 months. I used it approximately 5 times a week for max of 5 minutes a day. Within 6 months, it started to spark and have a burst of green flame shoot out the end! I&#x27;ve had hairdryers go this way before when they are old, but this was less than 6 months old! Unfortunately I was a bad consumer and did NOT call remington as others did to get it replaced. It got thrown out since it was sparking.</li>
    <li> Good product and durable</li>
    <li> I have long fine, thick hair, that holds water like a sponge. Drying my hair with my old dryer used to take forever, but this dryer has actually made drying my hair tolerable. It has great airflow. I would estimate that this dryer has reduced my hair drying time by at least 30%.</li>
    <li> best hair dryer I have ever had. Works wonderfully and I like the options for air flow and heat. The cooling button also works well</li>
    <li> Before this, my previous hairdryer was about 10 years old and made my hair frizzy. I have thin, fine hair and this hair dryer turned out to be perfect! It&#x27;s affordable, not too heavy and I love that there&#x27;s a low heat option. I&#x27;m very happy with it. Occasionally I find myself turning it off when I don&#x27;t want to, but most buttons are placed on the handle like this one. I gave it a 4/5 because it&#x27;s a bit noisy.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizz out. Appreciate the different heat and blower settings, also.  It is a little heavier then a travel dryer but I&#x27;ve gotten used the weight. Highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> I like how it has a low, medium, and high setting.  (Havent bought a new dryer in a while:)  i just wish the concentrator was a bit thinner since that would cause less frizz.</li>
    <li> It delivers a powerful force of air, but the air doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as previous blow dryers I&#x27;ve had. I would not purchase again. I like my air hot :)    Update 2/2/15: Remington commented they wanted to resolve my issues so I should contact them. I emailed them right away but they never responded. Nice caring customer service lol. I actually want to add that the blow dryer is heavier than my previous dryers, but I guess it&#x27;s a good arm workout. :)</li>
    <li> Dries as it should with aesthetic looks.</li>
    <li> I absoutely love this hair dryer. It even has a &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; setting</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this purchase.  Doesn&#x27;t have much power even at the highest setting.  It gets hot but not much power with the &amp;#34;blowing&amp;#34;!  Also, the cord is much too short and the on/off and heat control button are on the handle, right where you hold the blow dryer.  I&#x27;m constantly changing the settings while drying my hair.</li>
    <li> A little heavy on the hand but works well.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and says its one of the better dryers that she has used..</li>
    <li> Reliable workhorse.  Separate controls for temperature and air speed make this my favorite blow dryer.  Also, sturdy and powerful.  The cool touch button is very useful while styling, allowing immediate control over heat/no heat action.  Only drawback is it is a full size unit, making it a space hog when traveling. Still worth squeezing into the suitcase!  The controls are easy to operate, the cord is a good length. There is a loop to hang the unit which works perfectly with a command hook.  Price point also a great plus!</li>
    <li> Black and pink. I couldn&#x27;t tell from the pictures it was black and pink so I gave it to my wife. She is happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great dryer. It is very powerful and gets my hair dry much faster than my old one.</li>
    <li> One of our daughters had this item on her &amp;#34;wish list&amp;#34;.  She was excited when she opened it.....very proud of her gift.  Appears to be of good quality and looks durable.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do. Could maybe blow air a little stronger but otherwise, a perfectly good hair dryer. Comes with a diffuser and a concentrator (that I will never use...)</li>
    <li> Love this dryer. Drys my hair in half the time and doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp as much. Durable and nice looking.</li>
    <li> The Remington Ac2015 is a good hair dryer with a reasonable price point that will get the job done for which it is intended--drying hair.  The hair dryer itself is very sturdy (and a bit heavier than most) and the controls are easy to use.  But is it possible that a hair dryer can actually have too much power behind the air flow?  If so, this hair dryer would fit the bill.   The Remington is a work horse of a hair dryer that has so much power for air velocity it was almost more than I would have preferred.  It blew my hair in just about every direction imaginable, and it blew papers on the ledge in my bathroom all around the room.  So therein lies what might be a potential issue with the hair dryer.  If you are a person who likes to style your hair with the help of your hair dryer, it might be a challenge to find a setting to do that.  While using the high speed setting on the hair dryer, with a round brush, my hair tended to blow around too much, and made it hard to control the hair in the brush.  The low setting was a better option, however, when I chose to use the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; option to set the hair, it made the hair dryer speed go faster, and blew more air than if you left the button untouched.  I am not sure why the airflow would increase when you hit the cool shot button, but that is what happened every time I pushed it.  It almost seems to be an engineering oversight.  Anyway, after a few days, I gave up on the Remington, for styling specific challenges only, and went back to using my Tourmaline Tools hair dryer, which I like very much.  If ever there is a time I just need a quick blow dry, I would certainly reach for this hair dryer, and it is more than suitable for general every day use.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer! I love the pink and brown color. It has great power and does the job. The only thing that I wish would be different is the weight. It could be a tad lighter in my preference.</li>
    <li> This is really heavy, pretty quiet for the size</li>
    <li> It took me waaay too long to find a hair dryer that I didn&#x27;t think was going to start a fire or ruin my hair. I decided on this despite some bad reviews, and am glad that I did. It&#x27;s pretty (I know this isn&#x27;t important to some people), and it dries really well. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it and love the accessories that came with it.</li>
    <li> I heat style pretty frequently and unfortunately burn out a lot of hair dryers. I haven&#x27;t invested in a more expensive one and I may not need to. This baby is enduring through my blowouts! The ion technology is fantastic - it leaves my hair soft and smooth! With regular cleaning this has lasted longer than any other one I owned and really is keeping my hair in good shape. It&#x27;s a great supplemental dryer as well and the coating is easy to grip along with a nice, light weight.</li>
    <li> The Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic is a wonderful hair dryer.  It is very noticeably quieter than any other hair dryer I have ever had.  Compared to other dryers I have used, it leaves my long straight hair full of body and never adds static electricity.  It is definitley worth the $33.99 I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I definitely think that blow drying my hair is harmful from the heat, but this blow dryer has the power I need for my long thick hair, and I can feel a difference in how much damage it makes compared to other dryers i have used. this dries my hair quickly and does not overly damage my hair. I hope it lasts a long time, and that would make it an even better product. I have had dryers lose power or stop working, or shut off if they get too hot. this one hasn&#x27;t done that yet.</li>
    <li> This is a great hairdryer. Very pleased, even if it is a slight pink.</li>
    <li> Heavy. It was advertised as light weight but its not really. It is not the heaviest blow dryer but still i was a llittle surprised at the weight. Other than that it is excellent my daughter&#x27;s hair is soft wavy and frizzy and long. It takes a lot to straighten it out but this dryer left her hair soft and straight with a wonderful shine to it. I would and have recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> A very nice hair dryer that has a diffuser for those of us with curly hair.  It&#x27;s not really a mini, but it&#x27;s not super huge either.  It lives up to the no frizzie reviews and dries your hair extremely fast.  There are 3 heat settings and 2 speed settings.  It dries fast even at medium heat and low speed.  There is also a cool button that cancels all heat and locks your style, it also cools your head down before you go out in the cold winter air.  It is heavier than most hair dryers.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nicest blowdryer I&#x27;ve ever owned, powerful, quiet, and I like that it has three different temperatures, not just hot and cold. Cold won&#x27;t dry my hair, and I feel like hot just fries my hair and head. The warm is a little slower, but gets the job done without burning my scalp. If anyone cares, this dryer is not black with a little pink. It is a dark, pearly, eggplant color with pink. It&#x27;s a little girly for my taste, but I don&#x27;t care much.</li>
    <li> The most awful hair dryer ever. Very Heavy and the hot almost burnt my hair. Make a light weight product Remington!!!</li>
    <li> one criticism-- the temperature button is located right where you hold the handle to blow dry-- its easy to flip the temp button without realizing it.</li>
    <li> Great deal. Love it except it is a little heavy.</li>
    <li> Love it very very powerful. And gets hot if you need it to. Cord is average wish it was longer as this feels more like a professional blower. Love the feel of the blower too it doesn&#x27;t slide out of your hands and it&#x27;s not very heavy.</li>
    <li> Remington AC2015 T | Studio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer, black Hmmm .... now embraces&#x27;s a little heavy for a very good shop. Relatively, only to forget a very good product.</li>
    <li> This dryer works great!  Very powerful and dries my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> My favorite blowdryer.  I have purchased 4 of these over the years.  Whenever a house guest admires it and needs one, I hand it to them and order myself a new one.</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer there is!! I bought my first one in 2007 and when the broke last year i searched everywhere for it! The second i found it on Amazon and got my card out to buy it! I&#x27;ve recommed this to all my friends and family!</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer to replace my $200 hairdryer that crapped out on me FOUR times. I have only used it twice, but I am very happy with it. I don&#x27;t notice ANY difference between the performance of the two.</li>
    <li> My wife has long, gorgeous, almost-black hair. But she&#x27;s had a problem with &#x27;the frizzies&#x27; after she washes it - inspite of expensive shampoos and conditioners. With this hair dryer the frizzies are a thing of the past. I don&#x27;t quite understand what the &#x27;pearl&#x27; and the &#x27;ceramic&#x27; do, but let me tell you they work! It&#x27;s powerful (really heats and moves the air), well balanced and has little (and stylish) rubber bumpers on each side so it doesn&#x27;t ding the wall.  My only quibble with this unit is that the cord is extra heavy/thick (necessary for the wattage I suppose) and about a 12-18 inches too short.  Other than that, perfect.  Now let&#x27;s see if it lasts as long as the one it replaced (17 years).</li>
    <li> However, it is a little heavier than my other hair dryers.  But it dries hair very quickly the different heat settings work nicely.  Dryer is comfortable to hold and is powerful/hot enough that I can hold it 6-8 inches from my head and it will still dry my hair effectively.  My only problem with the hair dryer is that it is somewhat too powerful to use the diffuser if I want to dry my naturally curly hair into curls.  Even on the low power setting, it blows my hair to hard and the curls go all over the place and don&#x27;t form nicely.  If I want to have curly hair for the day, I use one of my other, less powerful dryers.  Works great for my straight hair days, though!</li>
    <li> Works great, heat settings are good, but it is very heavy and it&#x27;s so long.  I had to stretch my arm way out so the heat wasn&#x27;t too close to my hair.  Definitely not for travel since it is so big.  But it did dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I read numerous reviews on hair dryers and picked this one. It&#x27;s easy to hold because of the rubberized grip. Excellent selection of heat and speed settings which are simple to control on the handle. I have fairly straight hair and it leaves my hair soft and shiny. Hopefully it will last several years.</li>
    <li> Since I purchased this hair dryer my hair has never been in worse shape than now.....It caused the top of my hair to break off in several different places.  The A/C motor does not help!!! I&#x27;m going back to Conair!! Never had a problem with them!!! I am devistated!!! Do NOT buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the best I&#x27;ve owned! Its dries your hair at a high heat but doesn&#x27;t burn your hair/head. The different settings are perfect. I have natural wavy hair and the accessory for curls is amazing. My curls have never looked so great!</li>
    <li> found it to feel heavy,and the buttons change speed and temp easily while drying hair .Does dry hair quickly is it&#x27;s good feature</li>
    <li> This dryer leaves all the shine and body in fine hair without sacrificing drying time. It&#x27;s evident now that the previous expensive, super powerful, tourmaline dryer was blowing the body and shine out of the hairstyle. Many bad hair days blamed on aging/change of life that were actually caused by the too powerful dryer.&lt;br /&gt;With absolutely no changes to hair drying routine or styling products all hair drying sessions have produced good hair days. A most pleasant surprise to recapture more youthful hair.&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is much quieter than the previous one. The brushed finish and brown body/pink accents feel good to the touch and pleasing to the eye.</li>
    <li> Update... It just died but it was great while it lasted lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is awesome. It&#x27;s pretty quiet and dries your hair fast. I have thick somewhat coarse hair and it worked great. I love it!</li>
    <li> My friend let me use hers when I stayed the night and I was immediately impressed. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever owned a nice or expensive hair dryer, so this was an eye-opener. I had to buy one for myself because it worked so well on my long, thick hair. My hair probably reaches the middle of my back and it didn&#x27;t take more than 10 minutes to blow dry it with this product. My other cheap hair dryers probably took 15 or 20 minutes to fully dry my hair. I love the way my hair felt and looked after using this blow dryer. My hair naturally doesn&#x27;t have much going on. It air-dries with little waves, but a lot of frizz and poofy-ness (even with using my old hair dryers) and that&#x27;s why I use a straightener after. Even after just blow drying my hair with this product it LOOKED as if I straightened it.  Once again, I don&#x27;t have complaints about the product or its features. I&#x27;m a big fan, but my only concern is its endurance! And this is why I only gave it 4-stars. I bought one and I could feel it starting to go bad less than a year later. And this is the only thing keeping me from buying another one. Maybe this happened because I  use a hair dryer everyday when getting ready. Or maybe I just got a bad one? I&#x27;m not sure what happened, but, yes, it was awesome while it lasted!</li>
    <li> Does a great job and meets all my expectations for heat and air.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer. The packaging of this product was nicely done and not too wasteful, but adequate enough to get the contents delivered without being broken or damaged. The product was easy to remove from the packaging, and the instructions for use were very straightforward and well written. The temperature controls and blower settings were intuitive, and the balance of heating and air movement seems to be very suitable. Overall, I was very pleased with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> Decent hair dryer. Couldn&#x27;t expect more for the price. I like that it has different speeds and different temperature settings.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair really fast, lightweight, and quiet. My last hair dryer was an expensive brand, but it was heavy and loud and I never understood why I paid so much for it. This is a great hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair and it does a great job without making it to frizzy. Love it, great purchase</li>
    <li> Does the job. Nothing fancy, but easy to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer based on the good customer reviews, but they are all wrong. This dryer is super heavy, too heavy to hold to dry my entire hair. Also I always buy only quiet dryers and other reviewers said this dryer was super quiet. The low speed is pretty quiet, but on high it is super loud. Also the switches are right where you would hold the hair dryer, so it is likely you are going to hit one of them while drying your hair. I would discourage anyone from buying this, there are much better lighter quieter models out there.The only good thing about this dryer is the color.</li>
    <li> It is powerful, quiet and nice looking. My wife asked me to order it after she saw that the lady that makes her hair at the saloon had the same one. I have to confess that I use it more than her!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for a couple of weeks now, and hands down, this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Thanks to the Amazon reviewers for suggesting a great product.  It is a professional hair dryer without the expensive price tag.  It&#x27;s very sturdy, blows hot (not warm) air on the hottest setting, and comes with a 5-year warranty in case anything goes wrong. My hair looks smooth and sleek in half the time it took the flimsy Conair ones to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Very quiet, blows very hot air, pushes a large volume of air, dries hair quickly.  Simple and easy to use.  Seems like it will hold up well, since it has a solid feel.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. It is less noisy that my other hair dryer. Beautiful finish!!!</li>
    <li> I \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to this dryer from my basic Conair dryer and thought I would get something good based on the reviews, but really, it was a waste of money to simply buy another blow dryer. It doesn&#x27;t do anything better than previous ones I&#x27;ve owned, and in fact, seems to make my hair slightly MORE frizzy. Plus, the buttons are placed right where your fingers wrap around, so I had to train myself to hold it differently as the first few weeks I kept switching the buttons in the middle of drying. I&#x27;ve seen other complaints about the motor shorting out, and so far, I haven&#x27;t had any issues like that, just not really impressed with how it dries my hair. And no way is it really quiet. Pfffft.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer.  Has lots or heat and air.  Leaves your&lt;br /&gt;hair soft but with a lot of volume.  Even my daughter commented&lt;br /&gt;how much volume it adds to your hair..  My hair  is  long enough to&lt;br /&gt;come past my collar and I can dry my hair in a very few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;It has multiple heat/cool  and speed settings. Not heavy, not so noisy</li>
    <li> Works great, quiet, fast-drying.  Took away 1 star because it is a little on the heavy side, and the placement of the switches is a little awkward.  Otherwise very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have fine/medium fine hair but a lot of it, color it, and wash and dry every day, often twice a day in the summer.  This hairdryer does a great job of drying my hair fast without over drying or static.  It is heavier due to the AC motor that makes it last longer. The only complaint I had was the control placement, I would really rather they were on the side and roll buttons rather than switches, because I keep switching them off while I&#x27;m drying my hair, I&#x27;m having a hard time getting used to them. But other than that I really appreciate this dryer for helping me get out the door faster in the morning without having my hair look like an electrical storm is swirling around it. As for the woman who said her hair broke and fell out...seriously? Well I can&#x27;t say what that&#x27;s all about but acid rain comes to mind, or more likely, over processing. I love mine.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations while it worked.  I read the reviews about the hair dryer suddenly dying, but gambled that it wouldn&#x27;t happen to me.  Wrong.  Turned it on this morning and nothing happened.  Completely dead.  I will contact Remington but don&#x27;t expect the problem will be remedied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, the search continues.</li>
    <li> works great!  Just a little heavy.</li>
    <li> Perfect! 3 heat settings and 2 speed settings, plus cold burst button.  I like the option of having a cold air setting for those hot summer days. It is a little heavy, but easy to manage.</li>
    <li> I got exactly 1 1/2 years of use out of this.  Granted, it&#x27;s not the most expensive so I&#x27;m ok with replacing it, but seriously! One year?! I&#x27;ve had cheapie $20 Walgreen&#x27;s hair dryers last longer....</li>
    <li> A lot of people complained about a smell, but mine doesn&#x27;t have one.  It&#x27;s quieter (no high pitched scream of normal hair dryers) and isn&#x27;t unbearably hot since it has three  heat settings.  I am relatively sensitive to heat from hairdryers so it was nice to find one that was actually usable and it was a bonus that it was quiet.  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> My previous blow dryer was an Ionic one and it lasted about 10 years. I don&#x27;t remember the brand, but it was really expensive and high end. I think it was somewhere around $175 new. So, the other day the heat finally went out on it and I needed to replace it. This time, no question, anything other than an ionic simply won&#x27;t do. Anyways, I found this one and just used it for the first time with a completely wet head and I am so impressed, I can&#x27;t even believe it!! I&#x27;m not sure if the ion charges on my old dryer had gradually worn out, or if the technology now is just that much better? But I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It took all of 10 minutes to completely dry and style my hair and it looks amazing, with VERY little frizz and enhanced the shine too. My other blow dryer had been taking me more like 15 minutes. This Remington does have greater watts / power too, but even on the lower setting, my hair was getting dry faster and styling perfectly. I should also mention the design is really neat looking too. It does not feel as heavy (quality) as my other one and the precision (extra) part felt like it was made kind of cheap. But, of course! My other one was about four times more expensive. As long as this one doesn&#x27;t break anytime soon, I am sure I will be VERY happy with it! (No need for me to add the benefits of the ionic vs the regular blow dryer, you can find that info just about anywhere on the net). I completely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I would echo what the other 5 star reviewers have mentioned.  Dries my hair quickly and created less frizz.  However, as other reviewers have mentioned, after owning this dryer for about 6 months, it started with a blue/green spark.  I&#x27;ve determined that the unit is overheating and forcing itself to click to a lower heat setting.  Over the week this has been occurring for me, it went from doing this once every few minutes, to once every 30-45 seconds, to every 5 seconds (drastically increasing the time spent blow drying my hair because it was almost all cool air coming out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I emailed the company about the issue, and they responded within a couple hours informing me they would be sending a replacement unit as well as a prepaid shipping label to return the defective one.  I know some other reviewers mentioned that they were unresponsive, but I had the opposite experience.  And I did receive the replacement 5 business days later.  However, because this seems to be a consistent problem across the model, I will probably keep this as a backup to a different unit I purchased. It&#x27;s inexpensive, so if you want to take the chance you get a good unit, go for it.  It did work really great when it worked correctly (although I do agree it was rather heavy).</li>
    <li> So far it is working lovely! It dries my hair very fast though it does not have the changing voltz feature I like it! Is a little heavy but you can see it is of good quality! Hope electric accident won&#x27;t happen.</li>
    <li> Love this! It&#x27;s stronger than most blow dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past 3 years. The look is very professional and the color is a deep purple with soft pink. I should have purchased the hair wand that went with it. Matchy Matchy!</li>
    <li> I had no problems with the blow-dryer itself, it was not loud and seemed to have a decent drying speed, but the diffuser attachment did not work well at all.  It didn&#x27;t enhance curl, and just made my hair poofy and a bit frizzy.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is very stylish! I love the aesthetics of it and it has this super long cord so I can move around and do my make up at the same time without pulling the cord out.   Love the adjustable heat and speed selections. The highest setting is too hot though and burnt my scalp a bit. The dryer is also a bit heavy so makes my arms a bit tired but besides that, no complaints!</li>
    <li> It only worked for 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> A little heavy and doesn&#x27;t blow very hard. It&#x27;s cute and I like the body style but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Strong wind power and high heat that help to blow my hair dry faster. Plus good grip on handle. But the only problem is a little bit heavy that is hard to hold it.</li>
    <li> So this blow dryer has a purple hint of color just an fyi and love it. I used it for the first time because my other blow dryer would cause a lot of split ends, instantly. So I used it for the first time and no split ends, yay!. I also did use another blow out product with this blow dryer which you should try to prevent split ends. I use the RedKen Satinwear Blow dry Lotion before I start blow drying and both combined work wonders. Your hair will look like you just came out of the salon.</li>
    <li> It works great and dries my chin-length hair quickly.There are plenty of heats and speeds for any type hair. I do wish&lt;br /&gt;it was a bit lighter weight.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this dryer. It is quiet, NOT too heavy (unless you&#x27;re just used to lifting pearls to your head or something...) and quick, efficient, and though not noticeably effective in producing shine, unlike more intense dryers, does not produce as many split ends, frizz, etc. LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was PINK!&lt;br /&gt;colored items more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; lol&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s a good machine and should last a Loooooong time.</li>
    <li> As advertised, works great MUCH faster than my precious dryer. The buttons on the handle are a bit awkward but I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
    <li> I have never owned an professional hairdryer. Mine are usually fairly cheap (under $25). That  being said, this is the best I have seen in it&#x27;s price range. The attachments fit without being whipped across the room for no reason like my others and it dries hair twice as fast as my previous. I don&#x27;t have as many split ends either. For durability it has held up fairly well being used at least once daily by a complete klutz who drops things. Never any damage, cracking, or peeling. It is also quite pretty! Some say it is heavy in the reviews. While I was used to a lighter one, I only noticed a weight difference the first few times before it seemed normal to me. The only issue I have had with it is that my long hair will sometimes get sucked in the back. I have learned to keep it held higher. And since it is slightly heavier than my last I guess I get a light work out while doing so, lol. Overall a very good hair dryer and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this in February of 2013, it is now August of 2013 and my spiffy new hair dryer is dying.  It appears to have an electrical problem as it cuts in and out while I&#x27;m using it.  I have to jiggle the cord at the base of the dryer to get it to come back on. I&#x27;m guessing that it doesn&#x27;t have too many more days left to live.  It&#x27;s too bad really. I liked this dryer.  May it rest in peace.</li>
    <li> After about two weeks of purchasing, air leaks from the handle, the switch, and the back of the dryer. I concerned there will be electricity leakage, who knows when.Today I want to return it, but it says the return is only allowed within 30 days. I was too busy to request the return when I first found the problem. The product is of poor quality and dangerous to use, plus the short time warranty. I will never buy it!!!</li>
    <li> It was a great deal, it&#x27;s worth the price, my wife loves it. It is powerful, and until now is not heating in excess.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is made with quality. It is not heavy, not noisy, hot and offered at a good price. Amazon did a great job wtih sending me an expedited replacement order at no cost to me when my original order was lost in delivery.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom for Christmas. Let me tell yah it was a real chore for a man to choose a blow dryer online for a woman, but the price and weight of this item was good. I especially liked that it has a 4 year warranty.</li>
    <li> Magic. Pure magic. Attachments are hard to get off, but I don&#x27;t want them falling on my feet when I&#x27;m drying my hair either. Heat settings in addition to fan speed adjustment are awesome. Cute color and feels great in my hand. Dries my thick mane super quickly!</li>
    <li> Had a previous Remington hair dryer for almost 4 years that worked fine, but my hair dresser told me I should buy a new one. Replaced it with this same model, and the new one stopped blowing out hot air after only 6 months. I dry my hair in halves with a break in between (can&#x27;t stand to do it all at once), and the dryer randomly stopped working between halves for no discernible reason. Very disappointed because I misplaced the receipt, but I will not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> I had one similar to this before and was devastated when it died. I love this one too, and it&#x27;s a little cheaper! Lots of power and year.</li>
    <li> I first bought this hair dryer because of the positive reviews left by other reviewers with thick hair. In the morning, I don&#x27;t want to spend 20 minutes just making sure my hair is dry before I leave. I want some time to style, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer has a professional quality motor (1875 watt AC motor) which translates to stronger air flow, hotter air, and less drying time. That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and that&#x27;s what I got. This hairdryer, with the airflow concentrator attachment, dried my hair in under 7 minutes, which is unheard of for me. It has 3 heat settings, 2 fan speeds, and a cool air shot button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS: This hair dryer is quieter than a lot of others I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s still a hair dryer, so it&#x27;ll make noise, but this one&#x27;s noises are hushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides its speedy drying, it&#x27;s just a really pretty hair dryer. It&#x27;s got an attractive black matte finish that&#x27;s soft to the touch. It also features pretty pink pearlescent buttons and accents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: I recommend this hair dryer to those who are looking for a quiet, yet powerful hair dryer to streamline their morning routine.</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer but the hot setting on it is beyond hot, it&#x27;s brain boiling!  Use with extreme caution!</li>
    <li> It is a nice dryer, with great setting options but holy smokes it&#x27;s HEAVY! I have long thick hair and it sometimes takes a long time to blow dry. Something as heavy as this was just not ideal for me. Returned this and got he RUSK CTC Lite Dryer instead which I like a lot.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy...this was for my sister and he is in love with it. The product arrived on time and in perfect conditions.</li>
    <li> Quiet and strong, nothing more I could ask for.</li>
    <li> Awkward grip on handle, it kinda bugs my finger holding it. Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as other blow dryers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice. Blows cool air too and because of its technology, no harm on hair:)</li>
    <li> Hair dryer is perfect and haven&#x27;t had any problems since purchase!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and it is exactly as described by the seller!</li>
    <li> fast drying time lots of settings easy to use</li>
    <li> Not 5 stars because the power setting should have another lower setting..... just a little strong for styling bangs. Other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer about four years ago and it&#x27;s been great. I&#x27;m really fussy about the air flow, most dryers don&#x27;t seem to push enough air through to satisfy me, but this one is perfect. It drys quickly, and the heat settings are perfect. The only problem I&#x27;ve faced is about 6 months ago the product starts to make high pitched screaming/squealing noises, and they are LOUD. I like to dry my hair upside down, and I can&#x27;t anymore because the dryer is especially noisy (I believe the fan unit has come lose and shakes around in the barrel which leads to the screeching). Besides that, it&#x27;s lasted a long time, and it&#x27;s a great product at a price you can&#x27;t beat. After 4 years my current one is probably unsafe to use, so I am ordering my second one soon.</li>
    <li> A month ago I reviewed this product with the title, \\&quot;A piece of crap\\&quot; (see below review).  After this review I decided to contact the Remington online customer service and sent them a message with my complaint.  Shortly thereafter I received an email from them asking me to return the broken one and they would send a replacement.  They sent the shipping box and the label as well and within 10 days I had a new dryer that I have been using since with no problems.  Granted it has only been a month but I was very impressed with Remington.  I just hope that no one there was injured when testing the dryer (lol)... it really did blow flames.  Obviously there was a short which could happen with any electrical product but it was the way that the company responded that I had to give the rating of 4 stars when previously I only give it 1.  I really do like this dryer and how my hair looks and feels afterwards which is very different from other dryers that are no ionic.  Plus it dries my hair super fast without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PREVIOUS REVIEW:  \\&quot;Bought this dryer 4 months ago even though I read the bad reviews as well as the good ones and was concerned but figured it was a good brand name. i only use a hair dryer at most 2x/wk. Last night I was using the dryer on my wet hair and flames and sparks started shooting out of it!!! Thank God my hair was wet and didn&#x27;t have any flammable product in it. I showed it to my boyfriend who suggested that I contact consumer affairs for Remington, which I just did. Since it has been over 30 days I can no longer return the appliance to Amazon. I have had many hair dryers and most of the time they have just worn out after a year or 2 but this was just scary.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/18/13 - Almost 1 year later... and still working perfectly.  In fact, I bought another dryer in the interim, waiting for the new Remington and paid a pretty penny for the new one.  I used both multiple times, trading off one for the other. I found that I prefer the Remington over the other more expensive name brand dryer. The Remington does not leave my hair fly away and seems to give it a nice sheen (is that possible?). It drys my hair better and more evenly.mington over the other more expensive name brand dryer. The Remington does not leave my hair fly away and seems to give it a nice sheen (is that possible?). It drys my hair better and more evenly.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product. It worked great for about a month, then I noticed it started sparking! Initally I thought it was because I left it on the high heat setting everytime I used it; however, the sparks began occuring more often and I could smell it burning. I still gave it benefit of the doubt and figured there was just a faulty piece in the dryer and I happened to be the \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; person who bought it, so I threw it away and bought the same hair dryer thinking this time it would work. It worked great for about two months and then it started throwing out blue sparks again! I have used the dryer at my house &amp; while on vacation out of state and it still sparks regardless of where I plug it in. I hate to bad mouth any product from Remington because I am a fan of their other products, but I just don&#x27;t see how this can just be a coincidence. When I contact Remington, I can never get through directly to someone. It&#x27;s not really worth trying to get them to send me a new one--I have learned my lesson once and for all. Use at your own risk!</li>
    <li> There is something about this dryer that I love. It&#x27;s lightweight yet it controls the high speed blowing of the dryer so that my hair is perfectly dry in a matter of minutes. This is a great dryer.</li>
    <li> While this dryer does a nice job of keeping frizz away, it takes forever to dry my thick, shoulder-length hair with it.  Even when I&#x27;ve used the highest settings on it, it takes me twice as long to dry my hair with this Remington than it does with my [[ASIN:B003521CA2 Conair 259 Infiniti Pro AC Motor Styling Tool, Orange]].  I have wavy/curly hair, so I usually use a diffuser, but I&#x27;ve tried this both with the diffuser and without it, and each time it&#x27;s taken me awhile to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other pros of this dryer are that it has a nice feel to it (the material that it&#x27;s made out of has a pearlescent, matte finish), isn&#x27;t too heavy (so your arm doesn&#x27;t get too tired while holding it), and comes with some nice attachments.  The diffuser, though, has prongs that are asymmetrical in length, so it takes awhile to get used to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since many of the other reviews are glowing and say that this dryer dries in record time, I&#x27;m wondering if I received a defective unit. As I mentioned, it does cut down on frizz, but I prefer my Conair for a faster drying time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this blow dryer!  It&#x27;s heavy and feels very professional when you are using it.  The soft sueded material feels great in your hand.  It is also very powerful which you can feel when in use.  My only con would be that I wish it had a swivel cord but other than that I am hoping it lasts for years and years.</li>
    <li> I have had several hair dryers but this product has a great value and quality!!&lt;br /&gt;This is totally worth of the money and you will not regret buying this :)</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had! It&#x27;s heavier then my last blow dryer but it drys way better. It drys fast without making it frizzy.</li>
    <li> I bought my first one four months ago and returned it because it was shooting sparks after two months.  I thought it was an anomaly and bought a second one like a ding dong when first one was shot and it caught on F I R E  yesterday...F I R E...really, Revlon?</li>
    <li> Great dryer.  Lightweight and easy to handle.  Great heat and cool features.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t even believe how amazing this blow dryer is! I have very long hair and it really gets the job done quickly. The price is pretty unbelievable for how wonderful of a job it does!</li>
    <li> No more $15 grocery store hair dryers for me.  I love the power this one has.  My hair dries so much faster and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like the inexpensive dryer.  For $40, this is a great deal for what you get.  There are two things I noticed that some people may not like - it is a bit heavier than the cheap dryers (really not that big of a deal but something you would expect from a better product) and the first time I used it, I kept hitting the buttons on the inside of the handle (I don&#x27;t have that trouble anymore).  I highly recommend this hair dryer!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because it works just as intended I actually bought this for my dog to dry him when I shower him and it works. I haven&#x27;t had that spark that some reviewers are saying and I have had this product for like 5 months now.</li>
    <li> I hate most blow dryers.  They&#x27;re either not hot enough or too expensive or they feel like they are blowing a soft spring breeze through my hair.  This one is perfect.  I have naturally wavy hair and blow it straight almost every day.  Either I&#x27;m loosing my mind or else this blow dryer really does make my hair feel softer.  Dries fast, too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer after using my previous one for at least 5 years. I used it for the first time this morning and was SO impressed with it&#x27;s performance! I feel like I got the same results as my hair stylist&#x27;s hair dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the different levels of heat you can choose, as I have a sensitive scalp. I thought I would be fine using the lowest heat setting, but it actually is fairly cool. I ended up using the highest setting, and it was just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power that this dryer has is wonderful too! I used the highest setting, and with my old dryer, it took at least 15-20 minutes to dry my hair (medium thickness, down to my mid-back), and this one got it done in 10 minutes flat. My fiance even noticed that it&#x27;s much quieter than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I had a feeling this morning that I should buy two, just in case something happens to this one and I can&#x27;t find another that&#x27;s just as good! I was not an everyday hair dryer kind of girl because it took too long and the dryer got too hot for my skin. But maybe now that I have this hair dryer, I will be! I only hope this one lasts as long as my old one!</li>
    <li> Just ok,Nice but not as powerful as lead to believe. Average dryer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is ok.  It dried my hair much faster than my old one, yet my hair still got a little &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; afterward and it seemed to weigh a ton.</li>
    <li> Beat blow dryer! My husband purchased one for me at Ukta for $80. It had a short in it and blew up. I purchased this one off Amazon. I have crazy thick hair. It takes me about 15-20 minutes to blow dry. This cuts the time down in half. It is on the heavy side and the buttons are in a horrible place, buy I love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this about a year ago and recently it starting having green sparks inside of it and today it stopped blowing warm air. Very disappointed in the quality. Would not but it again.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer feels smooth in your hands, quickly drys your hair and comes with two attachments for perferred styles.</li>
    <li> This dryer just feels like a quality build. After a week of use, I will say that it performs way beyond what I expected. While I have relatively short hair and this dryer gets the job done in about one-fourth of the time my old dryer did. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I hadn&#x27;t experienced it.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer.  Lots of selections from speed to heat. The cool shot button is awesome for setting curls. Cute look with the pink accents.  It is a bit heavy, but it packs a punch and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Really nice heavy duty</li>
    <li> It gets really hot sometimes and when it was turned up to the second/max level, I felt like it could burn my hair if it got close.</li>
    <li> My wife was looking for a new hair dryer for quite some time.  She has gone through a few with her longer hair and she was sick of them constantly burning out or having issues.  The last one she has dims the lights when she would start it up and the transformer would get ridiculously hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading many reviews of many different products, I chose this one and she absolutely loves it.  Thus far, it is a champ and does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I will say I do like some aspects of this dryer. It&#x27;s nice having the different options for heat and speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have two gripes, though. First, the cord doesn&#x27;t seem very long. I guess I didn&#x27;t realize what a foot less of cord would be like when drying my hair, but it does make a difference. Second, I bought this item specifically for use with the diffuser for my naturally curly hair. I&#x27;m unimpressed with the diffuser. I like to kind of &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34; my hair into the diffuser (all curly haired people know they have their own unique way of drying their curls), and this diffuser is somewhat shallow. Had I known this, I would have purchased a different unit. It does snap in, which was a requirement in my mind, but I just wish there was more to it. That being said, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll eventually get used to it. Had I purchased this in store, I would have returned it, but with shipping costs, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had numerous cheap \\&quot;Walmart\\&quot; quality hairdryers and I was hesitant to spend more for a professional dryer.  This pro cost no more than, and probably less than most of the cheap dryers I&#x27;ve bought.  Quiet operation and extremely fast drying time.  I love the real cold shot button, not a cool shot like most dryers.  And instead of the 30-90 day warranties of most dryers, this one has a 4 year warranty.  It&#x27;s also great looking with a nice matt finish which keeps it from slipping out of my hands.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I should preface this by saying that I had been using a travel sized hair dryer for a couple of years before buying this.  This works well, but is just a little too big and heavy for me.  I just think it&#x27;s a lot to try and hold a brush with one hand and a dryer with another, all while trying to move the brush around to different sections.</li>
    <li> Standard blow dryer. Works fast!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer. My old remington was amazing so i knew i wanted to stick w/ the same brand. Its amazing. Works great and the color is the best part. plus it feels like velvet!!</li>
    <li> great product will reorder</li>
    <li> BROKE 2 DAYS AFTER 30 DAYS SO I CAN&#x27;T RETURN OR EXCHANGE (ON AMAZON) FOR A NEW ONE! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;I did like the dryer while it lasted, LOVED THE COLOR, however to pay money for something to work for less than 30 days, it was shipped so I lost a few days there, is a joke.  This might be the best dryer, per stars and rating on Amazon, but for the money, go to the local CVS or Rite Aid where you can take it back and exchange the product when it breaks.  Oh well, sorry AMAZON PRIME you get &amp;#34;0 STARS&amp;#34; for this one too... sad because I buy almost everything with Prime.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has a a short cord and you have to have it close too a plug. The other other issue is the on and off switch and the temperature level are too close to where you hold the dryer and the buttons switch on and off all the time.  It&#x27;s hard to hold the dryer.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, not heavy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> initially a great product, used four times weekly for 3 1/2 months. then just died. Cannot return to Amazon or manufacturer, now just garbage</li>
    <li> This product is great:)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a berry picky person, and i have to say i really do like it, it works perfectly and is really easy to use. I love it. The price is also great.&lt;br /&gt;I 100% recommend this hairdryer.</li>
    <li> The ends are pink. Not what I expected</li>
    <li> Works great and the rubbery coating on the handle makes it easy to use. It does not get as hot as my previous hair dryer, so it does take a little longer to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer blows hot air, is not too loud and fits my diffuser without it sliding off! Great buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this hair dryer 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t had it or used it long enough to see if there are long term issues. It dries my hair quickly. It is a bit heavy, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: My hair gets caught in the air intake... it hurts!</li>
    <li> Low setting is higher than with other dryers. I have fine, straight hair, cut short. I use a small diameter brush to blow dry.  But even at lowest setting, the airstream keeps blowing the hair up around the brush so I end up with little cowlicks all over my head. Since I&#x27;m 58 and not 17, that spikey look doesn&#x27;t work. The attachments don&#x27;t help the problem. If I hold it at arm&#x27;s length, it works, but it&#x27;s a little heavy for that. Otherwise, it&#x27;s quiet and seems built to last. I might just give it to my friend with steel wool hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick and course hair.  I think this dryer does a great job, especially for the price.  It is heavy as the other reviews state.  I was using a travel hair dryer prior to this, so the weight definitely took some getting used to.  It drys my hair about as quickly as any dryer can.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Light and easy to use</li>
    <li> This is the most quiet and efficient hair dryer, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I have had $200+ hair dryers, and this one matches or beats them in quality and quietness.  My other hair dryer was so loud, I reviewed this review, purchased this hair dryer, and returned the other hair dryer which cost more than this one.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy this one.</li>
    <li> I love my Remington Hair Dryer, the instructions on its use were very good.</li>
    <li> A month after receiving this dryer there was a problem with the switch when operated in the high position.  To make it operate you physically have to hold the switch in the high position. Wife said, she would use it and deal with the problem instead of being without a  hair dryer.  Other wise it performs as a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is the best I have had!!!  It is much better than even my $125 hairdryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer is really fast and does a nice job of making my hair already pretty smooth before having to flatiron it!</li>
    <li> I had no idea how cheap my hair dryer was till I used this one. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and tried it. It worked great! I liked hers so much I bought one for myself.</li>
    <li> This machine is amazing! Works like a charm. I have long, thick hair (down my back). This thing dries my hair in 3 minutes -- I have timed it. It used to take me over 10 minutes to dry my hair with a standard dryer. Sturdy design, and the light pink buttons add a nice touch too.</li>
    <li> It is a very good dryer, my girlfriend loved it! Arrived safely in its box with all parts! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an older version of this hair dryer for several years now, mine is a D 2009 - so I&#x27;m thinking that&#x27;s when I got it. I bought mine at Bed Bath and Beyond. I fell in love with this hair dryer at once, and since then I get incredibly frustrated whenever I&#x27;m at someone else&#x27;s house and don&#x27;t have my own dryer! It&#x27;s so bad that I often tote mine with me, and refuse to travel for a long time without it. I have long hair of medium thickness and people always think it must take me forever to blow dry my hair, but it only takes about 5-10 minutes with this dryer. It still works perfect, but after years of hanging it by the loop on the cord (I hung a hook on my bathroom wall specifically for this purpose) the loop broke, so I&#x27;m debating if I want to buy a new one even though this one still works great - if so it will just mean that now I will have a spare and won&#x27;t have to carry mine to my parent&#x27;s house.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what i need to do. Perfect! It has a nice texture and nice shape. not too heavy or too light.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s most beautiful hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever seen! An it works really good!!!! I love the pink and black! It came really fast!</li>
    <li> Has great power - just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> quite and fast drying.</li>
    <li> I bought another hair dryer before this one, and it kept sucking my hair into the back of the dryer!  I have never had that happen before.  It was painful.  My next attempt at finding a hair dryer, was this Remington.  I had good luck with Remington&#x27;s before, and this is proving to be a good one, too.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and I..... love it ^_^ ! Its does a great job, I always use the cool setting and you know what it stays cool. Unlike other dryers that you have to keep holding a button, this one has a low temp setting that remain moderately temperature. The burst of cool air button gets even cooler. Thats what I really like about this dryer along with the slim design is very cool. Okay enough with the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; XD Its a great product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like it so much, I bought two, for two separate bathroom. It is good for the price you pay.</li>
    <li> i love this its a bit heavy but dries my hair within 3-5 min im in love its a must for every girl</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it only a couple times, i like it. It gets the job done. Had no problems with packaging or delivery, it arrived fast :)</li>
    <li> Very powerful! I love it!</li>
    <li> Read all the write ups and can&#x27;t believe I got such a nice dryer for an inexpensive price.  Real improvement over my&lt;br /&gt;Conair that was also rated high. I am still experimenting with the settings and just got a shorter haircut so makes it a fun way to try new styles with this dryer.  I do not think you will not be disappointed with this dryer.</li>
    <li> Works well....good heat settings and air flow</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only flaw: there&#x27;s no swivel cord, making it resist moving around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, its great! the PERFECT size for my weekend bag and there are plenty of settings.</li>
    <li> Will be good to be used by deaf people.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s noise level does not match it&#x27;s high price.&lt;br /&gt;A web site said this is a quiet hair dryer, the writer must be deaf.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace an ancient hairdryer that just wasn&#x27;t working well anymore.  This is a wonderful hairdryer!  I can dry my hair quickly and it has all the possible settings that I&#x27;ll ever need.  I am totally happy with this!</li>
    <li> I really liked this dryer so much that I bought a second one.  The problem with both dryers is that after about 18 months of use both have started shotting sparks out once they get heated up.  if you have your receipt you can ship back for a refund.  Seems it is a known issue and they should stop selling or fix the issue.</li>
    <li> After reading several great reviews for this dryer, I was excited to try it.  It worked great...the few times I used it.  I prefer to dry my hair naturally, but occasionally I&#x27;ll opt for straighter hair and this dryer did the trick the 15 or so times I used it.  But today, Christmas Day, as I tried to dry my wet hair with this dryer, it only blew cold air.  So, off I went to my family gathering with soaking wet hair!  Thanks a LOT Remington!!!  VERY DISAPPOINTING for a Remington product used less than 20 times in 7 months.  Because I missed the 30 day mark for returns I&#x27;m stuck with a &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34; dryer that only blows cold.  Buyer Beware!!!!</li>
    <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a dude. My other guy housemate and I purchased this based on the small thumbnail which makes the dryer look like it is matte black and white or gray accents for the buttons but we were sadly mistaken. We opened it when it arrived in the worst possible timing when we had lady friends over and were severely and sorely made fun of because it actually is a dark sangria matte finish and buttons were pink. The box itself comes with flower accents all over it.. but honestly, it works very very well. We had a little $10 dryer from Rite Aid before this one and that pooped out after 1 year so we got this and have been very happy to use it. We hide it under the sink so as to not confuse any visitors with our sexuality but it gets the job done and that&#x27;s all that matters!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer has so many great qualities: it&#x27;s quiet, light weight, fast-drying and it looks nice.  I will definitely buy again when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> I am VERY impressed by this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer! Although it&#x27;s a bit heavy on my hands as I&#x27;m using it, it leaves my hair looking shiny and smooth with minimal frizz. It also dries my hair efficiently and quickly. Highly recommend it and it&#x27;s at a great price!!</li>
    <li> It arrive on time I like how it looks and is a good hair dryer for my hair and the price is great</li>
    <li> My last blow dryer was a Remington and it lasted for well over 10 years. That is the reason I purchased this one. I looked at cheaper ones but kept coming back to this when it arrived I was not disappointed. It had all the features I wanted plus it feels sturdy in my hand not fragile like one drop and it&#x27;s over. Also it drys quickly  and isn&#x27;t terribly noisy.  If this one lasts half as long as my last one I will be a very pleased customer. Like I said I love it.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is just so great, it helps in drying up my hair and also my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product is very good, works fine I have no problem with its use, which is recommended for all .</li>
    <li> very nice hair dryer and good price too!</li>
    <li> It has this silky suede feel to it and feels so good to use. Oh and it works like a hair dryer should.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer. It works with both hot and cold air and I enjoy the speeds and other attachments.</li>
    <li> I have bought this dryer for every one of my family and friends in need of a new blow dryer. It works great and is durable. i originally bought it because it has 3 heat, 3 blower settings and a cold shot. Added bonus it comes with a plastic loop on the end so you can hang it for storage.</li>
    <li> THIS HAIR DRYER IS EXTREMELY HEAVY. IT IT ALSO VERY HOT AND PLEASE BE CAREFUL IF YOU DRY YOUR HAIR ON HIGH.  I HAVE ACTUALLY SAW MY HAIR SPARK WHEN DRYING. SO PLEASE USE CAUTION.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dad of two young daughters so I decided to buy a good hair dryer for bath time...which isn&#x27;t easy by the way. Anyway this blow dryer works well and gets hot. My kids have long hair and this gets the job done in about five minutes. I&#x27;ve turned into a beautician</li>
    <li> Only concern is it&#x27;s a little heavy</li>
    <li> Dryer is extremely heavy!  Not as hot or strong as other comparably priced dryers.  Buttons are easy to accidentally press while drying.  Returned it after trying it once.</li>
    <li> Excellent - and great for the money!!!!&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars</li>
    <li> Love the dryer...salon quality...powerful, but easy to handle.  I&#x27;m glad there is also a cool setting to finish off the styling.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, because I always like to have a back up in case my dryer quits working.  This is the same brand I have been using for years and it puts out the heat and air flow that I like for my frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer. It has a nice weight to it and a nice smooth matte finish. I have very long hair and this hair dryer works faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s also surprisingly quiet to use. I&#x27;m just sad I can&#x27;t take it with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a work horse of a blow dryer - this Remington is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is standard shape (not collapsible), with the normal heat options (cool, warm, hot and button for a burst of cold), and comes with two attachements (concentrator and diffuser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be a bit heavier then my old blowdryer, which may be a disadvantage to some with arthritis or who have a lot of hair to dry.  I have fine/thin hair so I probably don&#x27;t need one with this much power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says that it creates: \\&quot;internal electronic ion generator for maximum therapeutic benefit.\\&quot; Say what???  What benefit? Does it do less damage to the hair or help seal in moisture?? It doesn&#x27;t say but I didn&#x27;t notice any \\&quot;therapeutic benefit\\&quot; after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, its a good dryer if you have thick hair or will need to use it a lot (house with teenagers).</li>
    <li> I needed a fast blow dryer that wasn&#x27;t too expensive or really loud. This one did the trick. I&#x27;ve had it for awhile now and it&#x27;s really held up. With me and my three teenage daughters using it, that&#x27;s really saying something.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this hair dryer after reading so many positive reviews.  It&#x27;s still going strong a year later, but she complains her fingers get in the way of the buttons on the handle, turning the hair dryer off while she is trying to dry her hair.</li>
    <li> Its great.  Works as needed,  it does everything that description above says.  Only thing i would improve is package because you spent extra minutes unpacking it and that plastic materials its hsrd to handle</li>
    <li> This is the first hairdryer that I&#x27;ve had in years that has consistently worked for more than a month. It makes hair drying quick and easy (it&#x27;s not heavy, and it is high power). I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer.  I got tired of having to replace my hair dryer every 6 months so got one of these.  It is definitely worth the price.  It dries my hair much faster and it very well made.</li>
    <li> Great high quality hair dryer that works extremely well. Comes with a diffuser and all so it is great for even long, thick curly hair. Dries it quickly and overall it even looks like a very nice product as the handle material is very smooth with a good grip. Great value for purchase, would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> bought this item a while ago and used it for the first time this weekend. First use worked perfectly. Second use, fan wouldn&#x27;t go on and within seconds it started smoking. Amazon now won&#x27;t let me return it. Do not purchase this item. Fire hazard!</li>
    <li> Not thrilled about this one. It&#x27;s cheap and it shows. Heavy to hold and dries the hair on the slower side. It doesn&#x27;t have that hurricane effect as some other cheaper model. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Cut down my drying time into half and leaves it with a shine, no more frizzy fuzzy strands from blow drying anymore. Have the straightener too. I like it better than my chi, although I do have very fine hair.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer throws a lot of air, however the air is not necessarily hot enough to dry your hair fast or smooth. Takes a long time to dry my hair and it does it a little frizzy compared to my previous blower which I had to throw Away because the cable began to get hot. But it&#x27;s a good blower for the price I paid!</li>
    <li> I chose this dryer because of the many positive reviews.  I have thick, coarse, shoulder length hair and it dries it pretty quickly.  I was also looking for a dryer with a round, long nozzle so that it could accept my Solano Diffuser.  This dryer comes with it&#x27;s own diffuser and I must say, it has done a nicer job of texturizing my hair than my Solano.  The Solano does fit so I will keep it in case the prongs on the one that comes with this dryer breaks.  It is also quieter without the the high pitch whine of my old ionic dryer.  The weight isn&#x27;t bad either and not a bother with the short time it takes to dry my hair (about 3 minutes)</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waist your time or money on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This POS is only used for an hour every other week.  My $10.00 Braun one lasted 7 years</li>
    <li> Do not buy- it worked for about two weeks and then broke. I was using the dryer when it started to smell like burning. I turned it off, and noticed the inside was bright red and smoking. I let it cool off, but it will no longer turn on. Amazon won&#x27;t let me return it because it is outside of the return window, even though I was sold defective equipment. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> This product id great. Really dries your hair without frizzing. only complaint is its a little heavy, but all in all great dryer</li>
    <li> I was just looking for a cheap hair dryer to replace one that broke, but read the reviews on this one and decided to buy it.  The thing is really sturdy and quiet for how much air it blows.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The dryer was purchased in September 2013, and used every 1~2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great with all the different speed and temperature to choose from. I am also pleased with its drying speed. In addition, the color is more gorgeous than in the picture. Some of the reviews said that it was a little heavy, but I don&#x27;t find it so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor drawback is that it&#x27;s not as quiet as I had hoped for. I am on the picky side in terms of noises, though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy but I LOVE IT! I have curly, frizzy hair and it has helped control it. The price it GREAT too. I can&#x27;t compare it to a &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; dryer but within this price range it&#x27;s #1.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has had this for 3 days, so obviously comments on longevity can&#x27;t be included. It works well, light, cute colors, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This dryer worked well for the first two months, since then drys inconsistantly and has started to spark when used. I have sent back to the manufacturer as it is now well out of Amazon return but I am not optimistic.  Maybe I just have a lemon, but order at your own risk. Very glad I spent under $30.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this dryer.  As others pointed out, it is a bit heavy, and possibly if I spent more time drying my hair that would bother me.  But it is well-balanced and I have no problems with the weight.  It dries my hair quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy and as a bonus, I love the color.  My only complaint is that I sometimes hit the bottom button and turn it off or lower when shifting the position of my hand while using it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! I&#x27;ve had it about 2 months so far. It&#x27;s main benefit is it dries my hair a lot faster than my old hair dryer. I also seem to have less frizzies. It is a little heavy, but I got used to that really quickly. Several different heat and intensity settings also, which I like alot. It&#x27;s not too loud either.</li>
    <li> love this dryer.  it&#x27;s quiet but powerful, and the &#x27;cold&#x27; button really works without losing power! (unlike the last dryer I had). other reviewers mentioned it&#x27;s weight, and yes it does feel more weighty than some dryers, but it&#x27;s not a problem for me, sorta feels like it&#x27;s more industrial and not cheap.  the outside texture of the dryer is nice too.  overall I think it was a great buy!</li>
    <li> **UPDATE 07/09/17**  This dryer has been getting very hot on the hand piece. It makes a click noise and then gets hot. I recently saw sparks shoot when the clicking occured and am scared to use it. My husband and I looked at it together and he was able to see it spark multiple times while on. I hate that this has occured but feel the need to warn others.&lt;br /&gt;Original review: his almost perfect. I love the finish. Very hot with several great settings. Its a bit heavy. The cord is a bit short. My hair has been sucked into the mesh filter in back several times, knotting it and burning it. I have longer hair and this happens when I flip my head over and the ends touch the back of the dryer while drying roots. I have had to learn to keep space. I would buy it again though.</li>
    <li> I had purchased two of these Hair Dryers for Birthday gifts for 2 of my daughters.  When I received them I decided to plug them in to test them out due to some of the reviews stating sparks etc.  Well sure enough, the first blow dryer smelt like it was burning.  I plugged the second one in, it also had a slight burning smell but not as bad as the first one, so I again plugged in the first one and let it run for a minute because the burning smell was so strong I thought it was going to catch on fire.  I had to return.  The Seller was very considerate and accepted the return with full refund for both Hair Dryers.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and when my dryer died, I was looking for a new one that would work fast.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay $200 for a dryer... This one so far is awesome!  Super hot dryer and doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy.  Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> Perfect and gorgeous design/look</li>
    <li> at first I loved it.  Very QUIET. powerful, quick.  left my hair silky soft.  But then the heat stopped working. I guess you do get what you pay for.  but less than 3 months of use is not really worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent and very durable hairdryer. This is a heavy quality dryer; no cheap light-weight plastic here. Comes with 2 attachments. Would be nice if it came with a retractable cord, but money well spent nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Good quality, drys quickly without frying your hair.  Not as noisy as some dryers.  Light weight, sturdy.  It seems like it will last.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works just as expected . Definitely straightens out my hair .</li>
    <li> Just because a hair dryer is pretty and sturdy does not mean I like it. It&#x27;s very loud and very heavy. Also it&#x27;s very powerful. I have natural curly hair and even with the diffuser it&#x27;s too powerful and makes may hair frizz. I will be trying the Conair Curl Fusion Ionic&lt;br /&gt;Ceramic Styler Hair Dryer because I heard it&#x27;s better for curly hair and not as heavy or loud.</li>
    <li> Really liking this so far! Powerful, but not too noisy. Took off one star because I wish the cord was 6 inches longer, and I wish it was black rather than brown.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed at a good price!</li>
    <li> Worked well so far, can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the product yet, but after used it a few times, it is worthy the money spent on this item.</li>
    <li> I had this for three months when it started making a staccato noise and kept tripping the breaker on the cord. I can&#x27;t return it since it&#x27;s two weeks past the time allowed. Caution.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, nuff said</li>
    <li> Dry hair extremely quick and leave hair in a perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;It needs less about half time than other hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;And the hair is smooth without any damage.&lt;br /&gt;It is an impressive product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons is the weight. It is heavier than other brands.&lt;br /&gt;However I don&#x27;t have to hold it for too long since it dries hair super quick, hence the weight is not too big an issue to me.</li>
    <li> The best dryer I have ever owned. Actually blows hot air and has a substantial air flow. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This dryer is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; I was hoping for something a little more powerful than what I already had. It gets the job done but no quicker than my other blow dryer...in fact I feel like it takes my hair a bit longer to try.  And it is HEAVY. After reading the great reviews, I guess I was hoping for something more than it actually was--which is a regular &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that high pitched whine that comes from some blow dryers. I had to rely on reviews here to feel comfortable enough to make this purchase, so I am returning the favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blow dryer is sturdy, substantial and quieter than any dryer I have owned previously. The price was reasonable and the shipping prompt. Note it doesn&#x27;t fold for travel, but that wasn&#x27;t a factor for me.</li>
    <li> OK for the price.. nothing special. I wish I would have chose something else.. take too long to dry my hair</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not very powerfull but it woks properly</li>
    <li> certainly powerful, and excellent value for money, other that the cord being a bit short, I&#x27;m very satisfied with it</li>
    <li> *update:  My new replacement Remington felt like a workhouse, but something came loose inside and it now smells like metal burning.  I called Remington, and WOW, they have the best customer service.  They are shipping me out a replacement at no cost and no need to send them back the old one.  The other blow dryer company that I tried before this one (Revlon) wanted me to send them back the damaged blow dryer and pay for shipping.  I had this blow dryer for about 8 years. It&#x27;s a bit heavier than the newer ones.  It just died after my two year old dropped it but I believe it would have lasted forever.  It dries really good and I like the heat settings.  Definitely a reliable dryer. After it was dropped, it started to spark.  It&#x27;s also a little loud compared to the Revlon Tourmaline that we just replaced it with and heavier, but it also seems to be hotter.  Hopefully the Revlon works as well.</li>
    <li> My long hairs accidentally got stuck in the dryer and almost caused fire. Thankfully, I saw sparks and turned it off.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer!  I wanted a hair dryer that would last and thrive.  This is it.  The other reviewers helped me make my purchase (about a year and a half ago) and the dryer is still helping me manage my crazy locks!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll ever be able to use a regular blow dryer again.  This one is the best ever.</li>
    <li> • I like the three heat settings, and the cold shot button is much easier to press than other hairdryers I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• I haven&#x27;t really tried the two attachments it comes with much because it&#x27;s a little too heavy to hold it far enough away from my head to accommodate the extra length once the attachment&#x27;s on, but it&#x27;s neat that it comes with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair faster than my other Conair did, and even though it supposedly dries from the inside rather than frying your hair from the outside, my hair&#x27;s dry brittleness didn&#x27;t get any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Ergonomic.  Nice feel/texture.  Dig the color scheme.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about a month ago.  It had good air flow, although I had hoped for more since my travel hair dryer surpasses it in air volume.  However, I thought it was sufficient. Then it just stopped working after about 3 weeks. It was still within the time frame of being returnable, so I did return it and Amazon has refunded me.  I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer. I have had this hairdryer for over two years. I highly recommended this blow dryer. I have wavy and frizzy hair...if you use a round brush it really helps eliminate the frizz, and creates a beautiful look.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer itself is a great dryer for the price. I had owned one for 6 years before it broke. So I bought another one. But this one is a revised model of the original one I bought when these first came out. And they have considerably shortened the length of the cord. Very bad for  salon use or if your outlet is more then two feet away. Other then that I have no complaints about this product.</li>
    <li> I have had many different hair dryers over the years, and this is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  Well-balanced and easy to hold and wield, buttons smartly placed so they are not in the way, and it does an excellent job of drying and taming my obstinate prone-to-frizz hair.  Have had mine for about two years with no problems, and I&#x27;m now buying another one for my gym locker.  I do wish the manufacturers would add the feature of a press-button cord rewind to this and all hair dryers.  It&#x27;s a great feature that I have on a dryer that isn&#x27;t as good as this one by a long shot.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer!! It&#x27;s cooler than most, which is what gives hair its shine and control. Works very well.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer for this price range!! I owned one that died (didn&#x27;t know about the 3 yr warranty, so I tossed it. Bummer!) and bought a Rusk Speed Freak (retail $120) after several of my friends raved about it.  However, after only a week of using that one - I&#x27;ve returned it and ordered another one of these. This is BETTER than teh Speed Freak and only costs a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> This Hair Dryer is great and my really loved it as a gift, I would recommend this to all my friends and family</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve typically stuck with the cheap junky hair dryers but I decided to purchase this one in attempt to have one that lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;This is a daily quiet hair dryer and it is very effective. The high heat is VERY hot, but it has three heat settings so that is adjustable. I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> The blowdryer itself is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO: Super powerful, dries fast, quiet. The colors are pretty if you care about that. It&#x27;s this smooth, matte black finish that sort of feels like velvet. Pink pearlescent details. Not super loud - but a low whir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: But it&#x27;s a little heavy. The worst part is the controls on the handle. They shift easily when you&#x27;re handling it. For example, when I&#x27;m blowdrying my hair if I move my hand, it turns off (bottom button) or switches the heat level (top button). It&#x27;s frustrating when you&#x27;re in a hurry because you have to grip it awkwardly so so it stays on and at the settings you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else would you like to know that would make this review more helpful?</li>
    <li> Drys my hair fast and effectively:)</li>
    <li> I love this dryer! I wanted one that dried my fine hair well but didn&#x27;t sound so whiny and loud. I read the reviews on this dryer and the comments on the deeper sound was what sold me. Now that I have it I have to say that yes, it&#x27;s a sturdy dryer - not overly heavy but you can tell it&#x27;s not a lightweight cheap version. The sound is wonderful! My husband even says that it doesn&#x27;t wake him up like my previous &amp;#34;whiny&amp;#34; hair dryer. Best of all my hair dries in just a few minutes and feels great-not dried out or burnt but soft and silky. I&#x27;ve had it about a week and so far I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> It was really loud, unnecessarily powerful for drying hair, my daughter was petrified of it and then it suddenly glowed red and started smoking!</li>
    <li> Fabulous! 3 &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; options and 3 different temperatures. Strong and comes with 2 plastic nozzles.</li>
    <li> This heavy duty drier really works well!  There must be a special coating on it cause it doesn&#x27;t get hot to the touch like my old drier.  I love it!</li>
    <li> So glad to have a hair dryer that had a good range of temperatures.  And so much less noisy that my old dryer.  But the location of the buttons make it difficult to hold.  And the high speed does not work unless I press down on the top of that button. I will keep it, but am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hairdryer. It has a special grip coating that keeps it from slipping around, and is powerful enough to dry my thick hair quickly without frizzing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hairdryer for 7 months, and today it died.</li>
    <li> After receiving a Conair cordkeeper for Christmas and only using it about 8 times, it died. Lucky I was able to get my money back at Walmart. So I decided to read lots of Amazon reviews on hairdryers in the $20-$30 price range and chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it the first time I used it! It&#x27;s a bit heavier but not bothersome at all, and I even have tennis elbow which prevents me from lifting things a certain way, if they weigh over 3# or so. This is very comfortable in the hands, has enough settings, a cold shot button, and most importantly, a diffuser for when I want to go from stick straight hair to beachy waves. The quality seems great and sturdy, I love the pink on it, and whatever the coating is is also pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;After my Conair experience, I don&#x27;t have much faith in new hairdryers. I was using an old folding travel dryer I have (from 2007) that still works great and I plan on using for traveling, so my intent was to use the Remington for the diffuser. However, I think I will use it everyday, as it dries my hair fast and keeps it shiny and is just fun to use!</li>
    <li> perfect for the price.</li>
    <li> Good hairdryer.  Very powerful.  Bought it for my mom with VERY curly hair.  She likes it, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything special for her.</li>
    <li> Like most reviews I have the same comments.  A little heavy but doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  I wish there was a removable grill/screen on the back to prevent hair from getting in.  I like that it isn&#x27;t too loud.  It is a good hair dryer and a decent price.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised - ok blower but too heavy.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer! It is a little heavy but it works so well, who cares. It has great temperature settings and dries hair fast!</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;ve always been using sub-par hair dryers, this one blows them out of the water (pun very much intended)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to everyone else who posted a great review, this is a great one to buy and I&#x27;m glad I came here to read reviews before I purchased.  It&#x27;s pretty, very powerful, and my only gripe is the buttons are reversed from my last dryer so I&#x27;m constantly making it hotter instead of turning it off :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10</li>
    <li> The motor whines slightly &amp; the &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; on the body is flaking.  I do like the heat it can put out. I like the rubber &amp;#34;bumper&amp;#34; spots they have around. Cord is just long enough for me but I also knew length before ordering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for quite sometime now. No issues.The heat settings and everything has been working perfectly fine till date.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair dryer I have purchased.. I have thick long hair (past my waist) and it dries my hair quickly. Lots of airflow.. for the amount of power I feel it has its a plus that its much smaller then the dryers I&#x27;ve had.. I wouldn&#x27;t say it was quiet but its not very loud.. it kinda hums instead of the high pitch whistling others have..And im in love with beautiful color and texture.. I bought another as a Xmas gift for my mother-in-law I know she will love it... The 4 yr warranty is a very nice bonus!</li>
    <li> As described by vendor. Wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Great powerful not too noisy dryer for about a year, then it loses power.  Even at this price, I expect a blow dryer to last longer than a year of home use by one person.</li>
    <li> It does the job well, but I wasn&#x27;t expected the dryer to weigh so much. It&#x27;s almost twice times the weight as my older T3 dryer (0.8lbs compared to 1.4lbs). That gets annoying trying hold it for long periods of time. Good thing it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a quieter blow dryer. This is definitely quieter than my other dryer, but still not quiet. I also read all kinds of reviews that said this dries your hair so it&#x27;s smooth and silky. The only thing that makes my hair smooth and silky is product!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it! While a little heavy, she says it drys so well and feels so sturdy the weight doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer for your $ !!!! I have coarse thick long hair... And this blow dryer gets my hair dry in no time! Definitely worth it! :)</li>
    <li> Good power and nicely styled.</li>
    <li> works great - the 2 nozzles come on and off fine - much lighter than my previous dryer.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was described is exactly what I needed! Working great!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is great! The hott setting is very hott and drys my hair quickly with the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is my hair sometimes gets sucked into the back of the dryer...&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great buy though.</li>
    <li> Very, very, very hot on the front from using it for just five minutes, I cannot imagine if I use it for more than that. Burns?</li>
    <li> The only bad thing is that the cord is not too long ... the hairdryer is excellent!</li>
    <li> Seriously love this hair dryer. I was using a different inexpensive Walmart bought dryer (Conair, I think?) and couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer. I had recently purchased the curling wand from the same collection as this dryer and loved it so much that I decided to give this a try. Quieter than my old dryer, more powerful, and the concentrator attachment actually screws on so it doesn&#x27;t fall off. Sweet! I will say it is a bit heavier than my last, but certainly nothing that would prohibit anyone from using it. I very muchn recommend this inexpensive hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This has cut my drying time in half! It&#x27;s a bit heavier than I was expecting but still exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> I have long hair so it used to take me over 10 minutes to dry my hair completely. Now i can get it dry in less than 5 minutes! It&#x27;s also useful to know that when you have it on the low/medium speed, it&#x27;s uber quiet. I can blow dry my hair at night without having to worry about waking my family members. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I used this hair dryer four times since purchasing it before it broke. It was great while it lasted but now it doesn&#x27;t want to turn on. It will turn on for about three seconds, kinda sputter around like it&#x27;s struggling then shut back off. If feels like something is loose in it. It hasn&#x27;t been dropped or anything so I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. Maybe mine was just a lemon since there are lots of other great reviews.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever owned!  Puts Conair and Revlon hairdryers to shame.  Time to look at other Remington products.  Finding quality these days is rare.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very short cord, was expecting much longer.</li>
    <li> when my wife got the item and start using it,  unfortunately  when she put on  last level spiral becomes so red and it makes sparks and noise. first two level is ok but 3rd level is very dangerous. I hope is not very dangerous.......</li>
    <li> Exceeded all my expectations!! I love it :) Great for all hair types. The two attachments are a huge plus!</li>
    <li> Pretty light and quiet for the amount of power it has.  Happy with my purchase. Doesn&#x27;t feel like a cheapy hairdryer.  But the price was good too.</li>
    <li> Excellent performance and quality--heavier than many other dryers, but with a solid feel and excellent fan performance.  I like it more than other dryers I have used.</li>
    <li> very well constructed hair dryer.. it&#x27;s one of the heavy duty built that you can get for little price...</li>
    <li> This is a standard hairdryer. I can not say, as some have, that it made my hair look any shiner. It does dry my hair just as quickly as any other blow dryer.... no faster, no slower. The different heat settings are varied. Hot is really hot, so I just use the medium heat setting. I have only had it for a month, so I can not comment on its durability. I would recommend it, but, it is a hairdryer, I can not say it will make your hair look any nicer than any other hairdryer.</li>
    <li> I got this blow dryer on Christmas of 2011. After a good year and two months of use it started making a shrill sound and started squeaking. I ignored it thinking maybe something was what could I do about it? But then after that in the 3rd month of year two (15 months) I started sparking the coils turned bright red and literally shot fire through it at my head. This brand is supposedly a good brand but I disagree. A blow-dryer should last longer than 15 months. Especially one that was used maybe a total of one week a month. I would steer clear here if you don&#x27;t want to light your hair on fire</li>
    <li> Love this dryer. It is powerful, low noise, nonslip, and it looks very spiffy. I love the color. And I feel like it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
    <li> I am on my second one of these, I love them so much..I had the original for five years and it started to make a little noise..didn&#x27;t want to be without one, so I ordered a second,..my best friend is still using it and I have my new one.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve had. My first one lasted about 10 years. I tried a couple but came back to this one and am so glad I found it on Amazon. It&#x27;s great for fine hair.... LOVE this blow dryer !!</li>
    <li> There is definitely potential to overheat.  At least that&#x27;s what it smells like, so I don&#x27;t use the hottest setting, but it is very quiet</li>
    <li> Its surely easy to carry and fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;looks great and does a damn good job !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yet to use the attachments that came along but so far drying is breezy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;motor longevity -to be seen.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the exact same model that I had for over five years. It is good but not as great as the former model which seem to have a tad more power (needed to dry extremely thick hair) and had a free spinning collar for the cord at the base which kept the cord from getting that spiral twist kinks. It was a great dryer, now downsized to good status. The sound is good, no irritating high pitch, which has been reason for me to return several dryers I have purchased in the past. Despite the loss of a star, it is still the best dryer on the market for thick course hair that seems to take forever to dry.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Too well. It&#x27;s now at my girlfriends house and I&#x27;m stuck with her old hair dryer...</li>
    <li> The dryer works well, it&#x27;s just that the buttons are positioned just where you want to hold it, and I find that I&#x27;m constantly, inadvertently pressing a button I don&#x27;t mean to press.  I think this is a poor design.</li>
    <li> I bought Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer almost a years ago (02 August 2014), and it is a great hair dryer - definitely a 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both I and my husband (and occasionally our dog) have been using this hair dryer on a daily basis - we&#x27;re among those people who always dry their hair - and it still works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I am quite picky when it comes to hair dryer: I like them to be powerful enough to dry my hair quickly, but I also want them to be gentle not to kill my hair. The Remington AC2015 does its job nice and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (almost waist length), thick, and very straight hair. I wash them every 2-3 days using natural products (Lush shampoo and conditioner), and also oil them a couple times a week (Jojoba oil + either rosemary or lavender essential oil). I use a wooden brush - but only when they&#x27;re dry. So yes, I really love and care for my hair! But when it comes to drying them, I can&#x27;t imagine to spend a lot of time doing it. My drying routine is simple: 1) I remove most of the water with a towel (gently) and use my fingers to remove tangles; 2) then I blow-dry my hair upside down; 3) finally, I brush them. The whole procedure takes me approx. 15 minutes, using the maximal power (level 3) and heat (again 3) of the hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has way shorted and fewer hair than I do, straight and thin. He uses my same shampoo and conditioner, but won&#x27;t do anything more than that. He wouldn&#x27;t need to use a hair dryer, but love the feeling. It takes him less than a minute to be perfectly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dog is a Scottish Terrier - so she&#x27;s small but has longish and super thick fur. We wash her in the bathtub with natural Castille soap. To dry her fur, we first wrap her in a towel, and remove most of the water, then we use the hair dryer alternating medium heat (level 2) and cold air to avoid burning her skin. When she starts being somewhat dryer, we use her brush to attack the most hidden hair (e.g. armpits). It takes us approx. 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, this hair dryer is durable and high quality - a great bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is by far the best one that I have ever owned! The price was definitely right! I love how quiet it is compared to other hair dryers that I have owned! It has three heat settings and three speed settings along with the cool button that you can press to get a blast of cool air. It dries my hair a lot faster than other hair dryers and it leaves my hair feeling softer than when I dry it with other hair dryers. I would definitely recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> good air pressure, cute color</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. good weight. I have coarse wavy hair that takes a long time to dry. This hair dryer does a better than average job of drying my hair quickly</li>
    <li> Very quiet as advertised, a huge improvement over the last one my wife had that certainly was bad for her hearing.  Also produces good air speed and heat, both of which my wife was nervous about ahead of time.</li>
    <li> Great dryer! I have had this for several years and it still works great! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Great dryer. Dries quickly, love the different temperature settings. It is a little heavier than I expected, but so far, so good!</li>
    <li> Quiet, well made, great temp range and air velocity.  Doesn&#x27;t have that high pitched whine that some dryers do.  Tempted to buy another as these cost upwards of $70 at specialty stores.</li>
    <li> It dried my hair in a reasonable amount of time and it isn&#x27;t too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;i have had issues in the past with dryers shutting off/over heating and this one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It got the job done,</li>
    <li> As described, it has some weight but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s an issue. I like it better this way than if it were too light which to me feels &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;. Strong motor, does a great job. I&#x27;m not a fan of the attachments but I&#x27;ve yet to find ones I feel do any good with any dryer. I agree it takes some getting used to with the switch going the opposite direction of what you normally find, but I&#x27;ll take that any day to get a good hair dryer at a good price. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> it is an OK dryer. Compare with other dryers, it is noisy and it shakes strongly when I use it.....</li>
    <li> Works great!  I like that it is not as loud as the Conair.</li>
    <li> Worked great! And has great functions use it constantly and has not frayed or fried my hair I recommend it!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a pleasure hold this dryer in your hands, powerful yet elegant. I have had many of different dryers, this one is worth more than the price.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer. This is my third one. I have purchased more expensive ones and this one is still better. The air flow is more directed so I get smooth hair without fly-aways like so many new dryers. It has a good temp as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer to cut down on noise &amp; it did the trick. Much less noisy than my previous hair dryer. I like the look of it (darkish brown, with pale pink trim). It is NOT a light weight dryer.  If I had long hair, I think my arm would start to get tired! I like the switch location - near where your fingers go.</li>
    <li> I researched a lot of hair dryers before finally deciding on this one. My priorities for a dryer is to not be too loud, and to dry my hair fast. I have thick long hair, and it can take 10-15 mins to get my hair completely dried. My old Conair dryer was working ok, but it was very loud and was taking a lot time to dry. Aesthetically, this dryer is very cute. It is quite large, but I love the texture and the pink accents. Some people had said it was a bit heavy, it is heavier than my Conair, but not too much where I feel like I have trouble holding it. It comes with 2 attachments, a diffuser and a concentrated air nozzle. I use the concentrated air nozzle every day. It is easy to attach and easy to come off. The best thing about this dryer is that it is not very loud at all! And yes, it does dry my hair a LOT quicker. With the help of the concentrated nozzle and a round brush, I can get my hair dry within 5-10 minutes. This is a huge improvement. It comes in 3 settings with 3 levels of heat, as well as a cold air button. The back of the dryer is easy to twist off for you to clean. Overall, I am very pleased with this dryer. Remington also has a 4 year warranty, which is very comforting.</li>
    <li> I returned it, no questions asked. Not only was it too heavy for me, it also blew too hot for me on low.</li>
    <li> This dryer has been great! Never over heats, has perfect settings, and I love the pink accent colors. The black finish does get extremely beat up and looks completely scratched after a while, but I keep mine under the sink so it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.</li>
    <li> My customers  and my family love it so I love,  I will continue to promote it the best way I can .</li>
    <li> New hair dryer has cut down my drying time by at least ten minutes.  This dryer has a smaller opening than my last but much more powerful blast of air. Great heat and love the settings. I don&#x27;t use the attachments so I can&#x27;t speak to their quality. However removing the back trap is relatively easy though getting the dust off is really difficult.  I wish this came with a retractable cord though.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great seller</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with it yet!! I hope it will last a while or till I die would be great.... Well never know</li>
    <li> I have had many Hair dryers and this one is definitely my favorite. The material does not allow it to slip and slide on the bathroom counter. The heat and speed is perfect. I have had it for about a year and working great. I use it about once per week.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair, and this hair dryer works really well for me. Much better than the expensive one i use to have.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer less than two months ago and it has stopped blowing hot air. I tried cleaning it, adjusting the settings, and pressing the &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34; buttons on the plug. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> ******update, 3 years and goin strong, good product   Original review -   Been over a year, love this thing, has different heat settings and attachments, is yeah and it&#x27;s cute to boot</li>
    <li> Problems using with uk adaptor</li>
    <li> The accent parts are pink..a light &amp;#34;princess&amp;#34; pink...something that is not totally obvious on a mobile screen. Not a big deal, but I would prefer white or black. Hair dryer has a good weight to it and it feels solidly built. Hot/cold function works fine. I would like a bit more volume to the air, something that all newer hair driers seem to lack. I have one from 1991 that is like a tornado on its highest setting.</li>
    <li> Well priced and quiet hair dryer.  I liked the rocker buttons and the levels of heat.  The dryer is not heavy and is sturdy!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the most powerful I&#x27;ve ever used. It actually kicks when you start it, that&#x27;s how much air rushes out of the nozzle. The warm air drying field - because of the dryer&#x27;s unusual strength - is wider and more focused than any other that I&#x27;ve tried. The controls are remarkably easy to use. They require hardly any pressure, seeming to respond instantly when pressed. Ergonomically the Remington Ac2015 is well designed, fitting in my hand quite comfortably. Other hair dryers are often indifferently designed, their weight soon tiring your hands and arms requiring constant switching between left and right hands. This dryer stayed in my right hand without cramping or fatigue, which I really appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three heat settings and two speeds are perfect for the subtle changes your hair undergoes during the drying process. There&#x27;s a big difference between the extremely wet hair you confront when first leaving the shower and the dryer, more responsive hair you have after a couple of minutes of drying. With the different heat settings and two speeds - coupled with the dryer&#x27;s strength - I manage to avoid some of the heat damage that I used to inflict on my hair. Back then, I was forced to crank-up my inferior dryer in order to get better (and quicker) drying. Heat damaged, overly dry (even dessicated) hair is unmanageable and very unsightly. I am thankful those days appear to be gone for good. The attachments are easy to add and use though I never need them, finding the dryer in its native state to be best for my hair. The dryer runs quietly and without sparking, something that can be worrisome when your hands are moist. There&#x27;s a four year warranty which indicates the confidence the manufacturer has in this well-made dryer. The Remington Ac2015 is an excellent professional grade dryer that is easy to recommend.</li>
    <li> This drys my long hair in no time at all. I only use the medium setting because the full blast air actually blows it around so much it gets tangled. Overall it has a very nice design, works really well, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> The fit and finish of this product is excellent, it has a high quality blower fan and the exterior material as commented by a previous reviewer is designed to avoid scratching on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend loves this dryer because it is powerful and she has a lot of hair which is difficult to completely dry and straighten, although she did mention that on the lower heat setting it avoids overheating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer has a 4 year warranty so what else can you say, it is a high quality dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for about three months and am overall really pleased. My previous hair dryer was about five years old and kicked the bucket. This one is much better than that one, though like I said, it was a little older. It dries my hair in about half the time and I use both of the diffusers that came with if often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reason for giving four starts over five is that the placement of the buttons for speed and heat are RIGHT where I want to put my hand while using it. They are pretty big, so if I keep my hands there I often hit them. Readusting my hand solves this problem but since it makes it a slightly less comfortable experience, I think four stars is appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not (yet) had the issue of the outside wearing off, mine still looks new.</li>
    <li> Three levels of heating. Dry my hair smoothly</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer for the price.  I battle frizz a lot, and this dryer does a great job controlling frizz while drying my hair.</li>
    <li> Received what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I just used this dryer for the first time last night and I really like it. I have long thick slightly wavy hair that falls just below my shoulders. It usually takes 20-30 minutes to dry with a regular hair dryer and a paddle brush to keep it straight and tame the frizzies. The Remington Tstudio Pearl cut my drying time in half! My hair did indeed dry faster and came out smoother looking with a silky shine. To top it off, I barely needed to use my paddle brush to straighten it--only a few brush strokes here and there to keep it knot free. My only complaint is the cord could be a little longer. I have to plug my hair dryer up above my head next to the light fixture of our medicine cabinet and the shorter cord makes drying my hair upside down for added volume next to impossible. Other than that, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Great dryer.  Not real heavy but substantial enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairdryer for several months now &amp; it is miles better than my previous standard dryer. It&#x27;s more compact, dries pretty quickly &amp;  has a nice long cord. The buttons are a little bit awkwardly placed on the handle, but are still completely usable. I haven&#x27;t changed anything else in my hair styling routine &amp; even my hairdresser noticed my hair is much shinier. When my previous dryer broke I was just going to buy a similar cheap replacement, but I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra money on a nicer hairdryer this time.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer in October 2013, and it has been a great dryer until recently- when it started throwing out large blue sparks from the nozzle! I chalked it up to static electricity, but it started to alarm me, so I did a search on it. Yeah, this thing could KILL you. Don&#x27;t buy this model, it seems others have this exact problem and it&#x27;s very dangerous. I probably won&#x27;t try to use the warranty in case the next one does actually injure me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. This is no big deal I guess, but all of my hair styling tools are from the Remington Pearl line (curling wands and flat iron, and a brush, which are all fine), and my OCD liked that they matched. Now they won&#x27;t match and I am sad.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for for a few weeks and am impressed.  It replaced a 10 year old dryer and has made a difference in my morning routine.  It seems a bit heavier than my old one but the speed of drying is worth it.</li>
    <li> We had one of these before and like it. This one is basically the same. It does have a funny sound to it that I don&#x27;t think is normal which has me a little worried, but it still works fine I think.</li>
    <li> Fairly quiet as hair dryers go. Like the attachments. LOVE the brown and pink color.</li>
    <li> Powerful, and quiet. It doesn&#x27;t have that high pitched whine. It doesn&#x27;t get super hot and doesn&#x27;t have to because it&#x27;s powerful enough. Other dryers would make my hair hot to the touch or burn my hand. My hair seems to be healthier and smoother after using this for a couple months too!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t a SUPER fast dryer, but it works for the price</li>
    <li> Awesome Power, Just A Little Heavy!!</li>
    <li> I first bought one of these at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond many years ago.  I was dubious about the extra money for the &amp;#34;AC motor&amp;#34;, but I have to say that this hairdryer has outlasted any others that I have purchased.  It&#x27;s a little heavier than cheaper models, but it is the closest thing I could find to a profession dryer without paying over $100.  I have now purchased 4 of this model;  the original one finally gave out a few weeks ago (I believe I have had it for over 5 years.)  Even with the additional weight, I bought one for travel, as I missed my &amp;#34;home dryer&amp;#34; when I was on the road.  I also gave one to my mother, who has used it daily for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Durability aside, I would highly recommend this model because of it&#x27;s dimensions.  The longer &amp;#34;nose&amp;#34; on this dryer is a must for anyone who has longer hair (&amp;#34;snub-nosed&amp;#34; driers frequently will suck my hair into the reverse end, resulting in a painful, tangled mess.)  It also accommodates &amp;#34;universal-sized&amp;#34; attachments (diffusers, straighteners) that can be purchased at any beauty supply store.  I appreciate that Remington did not design this with some odd proprietary size that would force you to only buy their brand of attachments (sounds silly, but I have run into that issue with several other dryers I purchased before finding this one.)</li>
    <li> I bought this after using my daughter&#x27;s dryer. Great size. Powerful! Dries my hair fast and I have very thick hair! Not super loud, either. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I just signed in to find when I ordered this and it was last October. It has worked fine until it began having little sparks in last couple of days internally. Would not recommend this because of that hazard and only getting less than 1 year out of it.</li>
    <li> the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. period. buy it.</li>
    <li> It arrived within 2-3 days and works perfectly. I have thick, frizzy, curly hair and never have been able to blow dry it because it gets so much poofier. However, with the diffuser this blow dryer made my curls shiny and soft, no frizz or poof, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Sleek, elegant, works great but a bit heavy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this hair dryer. I bought it at the end of May and it died by the end of July! While it worked it was great but it didn&#x27;t last. It started making a funny noise then poof nothing. It was never dropped or on for long periods of time. Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great, it&#x27;s just a little heavy.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer has the amazing ability to dry your hair on a very cool setting as well as warm. It seems to take very little air or pressure but suddenly your hair is dry!</li>
    <li> OMG I LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER! It dries my hair way faster than my old Revlon one i had gotten at walmart and my hair is not as frizzy any more. LOVE!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but it&#x27;s incredibly thick and wavy. Because of this it takes FOREVER to dry my hair. I purchased this and was pretty happy with the power behind it. Cut my drying time down for sure. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best hair dryer in the world...but for the price it comes close.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. It is a bit heavier than my previous one but my hair dreys faster so I don&#x27;t mind.  The air blows really hot if you use the highest setting so it took a bit getting used to it, but I love it</li>
    <li> It is a good hair dryer, a little bit heavy, but it dries my hair fairly quickly. The price cant be beat.</li>
    <li> Nice dryer but cord is shorter than my old one and I miss that a lot. It&#x27;s non-skid surface keeps it from sliding off the tops of things. it is easily holdable at the center without burning your hand. The diffuser dries my short, color-treated hair in record time.</li>
    <li> The color is pink and not as in the big picture gray and overall its too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Works well so far but did not like it</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for twelve years and it&#x27;s still going. My son had always remarked how much he loves this hair dryer every time he visits. So I decided to order one for him. I couldn&#x27;t believe that they still make it!! And I found it on Amazon so much cheaper than I did with the original which could only be ordered from the company at the time. This is the quietest dryer I have ever owned. It also has a nice air flow in that it doesn&#x27;t blast it dry but gives me styling time to use a round brush and curl it without needing to use a curling iron after. It saves me a lot of time in the morning.</li>
    <li> I really love everything about this hair dryer.  It is fast, has lots of settings, and black with PINK TRIM.  It is a little heavy, but it works so well I don&#x27;t care.  I am thinking my old, cheaper hairdryers were too light and could not get the job done.  This cost a little more, but I am totally happy with it.  Get one!</li>
    <li> Did research all over the internet and this is the best for your hair, at the best price. Win!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. She loves it!</li>
    <li> I love remington products. I have long, thick hair, and this quickly dries it without causing too much frizz. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer. I like that the middle setting is not too hot. Has a cool and hot setting and a cool shot button.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, and this dries my hair very quickly. With the added temperature control I never worry about frizz, or split ends, or burning. My only wish is that it came with a travel draw-string bag, but really, I don&#x27;t care that it didn&#x27;t. I absolutely love this hair drier. A+</li>
    <li> I used the blow dryer for the first time tonight and I love love love it! For one it is pretty and it has different temperatures you can choose from, and different air speeds. My hair is really frizzy, and the blow dryer helped to de-frizz my hair. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I got this item for my wife a couple of months ago and...wow is it nice!  The outer shell has a soft rubbery-like finish that protects it from scratches and tumbles.  I also like the quiet way it performs, even on highest setting...and boy does it blow air!  Too bad it only comes in the pink trim (for now anyway)...hopefully other color choices follow soon...I can use one for myself when on the road, at the gym, etc.  I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have to admit, as a guy with short hair, I do not use a hair dryer very often.  However, I am all too familiar with the noise they make when my wife is drying her hair in the morning.  To me, her 10 year old hair dryer sounds like a mini jet engine.  I asked her to give this hair dryer a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is that the hair dryer did not wake me up in the morning when my wife was drying her hair.  The hair dryer does not have that high pitch noise that makes it sound like a jet engine.  It makes a noise that I have not heard in a hair dryer before.  I would call it more of a low roar versus the high shriek of the older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife was very impressed with the effectiveness of the dryer.  She said that it dried her hair in about half the time as her old dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer does feel like it was build solid.  The outside casing has a rubbery type feel as opposed to the hard smooth plastic most dryers are made of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is thrilled with how fast it dries her hair.  Personally, I love the fact that it is quiet and doesn&#x27;t wake me up in the morning when she dries her hair (I work the graveyard shift so this is important to me).  So far, this is an excellent product and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of hairdryers in my time (who hasn&#x27;t?), and this is the first one I can ever recall wanting to review.  I had to buy a new dryer because I left my other one at mom&#x27;s.  Knowing I&#x27;d be home to collect that one (which came from a beauty supply store and works well), I grabbed this one (cheaply) at Target. I think I more or less chose it because it was cute, but I&#x27;ve wound up loving it for more practical reasons.  I very much prefer it to the one it replaced.  One reason is tactile; it has a nice almost-soft finish that&#x27;s comfortable to touch or hold.  Ergonomically, it simply \\&quot;feels right\\&quot; in my hand.  It&#x27;s very well balanced.  The cool air option works great; far cooler air (esp for a sustained time) than any other dryer I&#x27;ve owned.  The air opening is a little bit smaller than average, so it provided well directed air.  (There is also a good diffuser included if you need to diffuse rather than direct.)  Provides a good and shiny and smooth blow out.  Quickly.  Even on cool air! The cord is NOT retractible, but is is a good length and doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle easily.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a amazing dryer worth it&#x27;s price with  two speed (low and high) and three heat settings (cool, warm and hot). Dries my hair super fast and i like it. The only thing i don&#x27;t like  about this dryer is it&#x27;s heavy.Would like it more if it was lighter.Overall it&#x27;s a good buy !</li>
    <li> This is an excellent value.  I&#x27;ve owned several Remington products and have rarely been disappointed.  This is no exception.  It works nearly as well as my very expensive Chi hair dryer, but for a lot less money.  It also comes with attachments, which my expensive on did not.  I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say this is \\&quot;salon\\&quot; quality, but for people who don&#x27;t want to pay for salon quality equipment, but want to get salon quality results, this will be an excellent addition to their tool set.</li>
    <li> I had one just like this one that lasted more than 6 years, and I use it every day!  So happy to find another just like it.</li>
    <li> This professional quality hair dryer does an excellent job of blowing one&#x27;s hair dry, while doing it with a minimum of noise and a maximum of power. This hair dryer is well-designed, as it rests comfortably in one&#x27;s hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a ceramic flat iron that I love, so I was intrigued by the fact that this is a ceramic hair deryer. It did not disapoint. The temperature settings are stable and do not fluctuate, while one is drying one&#x27;s hair. The ionic conditioning is definitely a plus, as it leaves oone&#x27;s hair feeling lustrous and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this hair dryer has a choice of three heat settings, as my last one had only two. I also love the fact that it came with two styling tools, affording one a choice of styling options from straight to wavy to curly. All in all, this hairdryer offers something for everyone and, at the price offered, is an excellent value.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer was exactly what I was looking for:  A simple design that blows forcefully.  It works quickly and my hair looks smooth when I am done.  The hottest setting gets a little too hot if you leave the dryer pointed at your scalp for more than a few seconds, but that&#x27;s really a pro because it gets good and hot.  It has three heat settings to adjust for comfort.</li>
    <li> My mother really likes a Conair 225R Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic 1875-Watt Hair Dryer that I got about a year ago, so I decided to let her have it and try a different one. I went with the Remington Ac2015 based on reviews. My hair dryer rating is based on speed and ability to keep my hair sleek and unburned, since I have plenty of hair and live in a humid place year-round. I have to say that while both the Remington and the Conair perform quite well, the Conair wins for me: it&#x27;s noticeably lighter, and its sliding buttons are friendlier than the Remington&#x27;s flipping ones.</li>
    <li> Lighter than most, yet does the job.  The buttons are super easy to operate one-handed.  Cord length (40&amp;#34;) is a little longer than most, which is a big relief.</li>
    <li> I looked at many hair dryers ranging from $15-$200.. There were a few that were very light at both the upper and lower price range but there were also heavy ones there too. I also looked at the air velocity from several and was not impressed with many expect a few that were slightly expensive ($100 +). At that point I was thinking it was stupid to spend a bunch of cash on one of the expensive ones when I came across this particular dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had my criteria - good feel, good air velocity, AC motor, and very reasonably priced. PLUS it has a 3 year warranty. I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been drying 2 heads of hair every day since I got it and it does well. Tiny bit heavier than I expected but overall not bad. Gets very hot and moves a ton air. We&#x27;ll see how it holds up in the long - - But hey, I&#x27;ve got a 3 year warranty so I&#x27;m not too worried.</li>
    <li> I am just not happy with the really loud noise. I bought this based on the product&#x27;s the minimal negative reviews and customers&#x27; reviewing it \\&quot;quiet.\\&quot; Other than the really loud noise of the dryer even at its lowest mode and the odd noise it makes when being held facing up and at the cool and warm modes, the dryer is very solid and a quite heavy. I tried the attached concentrator, the wind would not concentrate when blowing extremely closed with my ceramic round brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extreme fast shipping and fast refund. Still a happy customer after the good service. :)</li>
    <li> This hair dryer worked okay for a while, particularly during the window in which I could return it. It gradually stopped blowing hot air and now couldn&#x27;t blow a leaf off your hand. Even though it still goes on it barely blows any air and takes me three times to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer! I watched the utube video of the woman with naturally curly hair and how she used this particular dryer because I have permed hair and need a diffuser and medium air pressure to dry my hair but still keep the curls. My previous Sassoon hair dryer did a great job of drying as well as maintaining my slowly diminishing &amp;#34;old perm&amp;#34; curls but with a little scrunching with mousse and my old, non ion ceramic dryer, my curls still looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my purchase of the Remington AC2015  &amp;#34;pearl, ionic&amp;#34; dryer additions, I looked forward to the same old but better.....My hair is much more shiny and less frizzy, yes, but I do have to work with scrunching/spray to get those curls that I had when drying with my old non-pearl ceramic, etc. hairdryer. I think the ceramic or pearl or ionic features of this dryer are wonderful but, for someone like me with a loose perm of about 10 months, the dryer makes my hair just &amp;#34;too smooth&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am certain this model would be perfect for all those ladies with gorgeous, thick hair who want the smooth look at a very very good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diffuser is included which did entice me to purchase this hair dryer as I do need to use a diffuser. BTW, reviewers have said dryer could be lighter in weight but it&#x27;s perfectly OK with me. I felt my old dryer was OK regarding weight and feel this one is, as well. Not noisy at all, despite what some have said. I use it on medium airflow and medium heat and I&#x27;m very happy - not loud and I could definitely use the dryer for as long as it took to dry my hair if I had long hair w/o freaking out because of its noise.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re extremely sensitive to sound and are looking for a quiet dryer, this is not for you.  Still had to wear earplugs during use; I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whisper-quiet operation for the price, but this is NOT QUIET. It still woke up someone sleeping in the next room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even using the dryer as far as I could reach from my head, while using a round ceramic brush, this thing managed to tangle and damage my fine hair. I now have tons of split ends that I did not have while using (what I thought was) an inferior dryer.  The $15 cheapo dryer I picked up at a big box store worked better at about the same noise level.</li>
    <li> What a great blow dryer for an even better price! This was recommended to my by my stylist and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t spend the big bucks on a salon brand dryer. This dryer makes such a huge difference in my hair compared to the Revlon I used to use. My hair takes half the time to dry and looks shiny and smooth when finished, just like it looks when leaving the salon. A great blow dryer really does make all the difference. Save your money and get this one, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Seems hot is too hot and  warm is not warm enough</li>
    <li> I like it, it dries my hair quickly. However, I have long, wavy hair, and it gets caught easily in the fan of the dryer (ouch.) I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend this dryer for curly hair, even with the diffuser my hair gets pretty frizzy and falls flat.</li>
    <li> Lived up to my expectations and I really love the look.</li>
    <li> this product did not work at all, it seems to be newand fine but never went on</li>
    <li> Very underpowered dryer.  It has a nice power black finish which is totally spoiled by pink control buttons and end surround ring - it might appeal to teens or tweens, but aesthetically unpleasing to an adult.  I exchanged it the day i received it for a Conair Pro which is much better.</li>
    <li> Better than my old one. This gets the job done faster and a lot quieter.</li>
    <li> LOVE this hair dryer. Its fast, its hot, and its not too big. I have had this about 6 months now and its still as good as day 1.</li>
    <li> So I purchased this hair dryer in March 2013 and I need a new one already.  While it worked it was good but then things went wrong as I dry my hair I see a spark like when you pull a plug out of the wall.  I don&#x27;t know if it is because I use a metal brush but it snaps and then sparks not so great.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this new hair dryer, I would highly recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of great features and makes my hair look GREAT.</li>
    <li> Other than the pink trim [looks silver in photo], excellent dryer. Solid feel and powerful.</li>
    <li> funky color, but I bought a matching vanity</li>
    <li> I have used this blow dryer for about three years now and I love it. My daughter is constantly stealing it from me so I just purchased one for her birthday. Would you believe that was her favorite gift?</li>
    <li> The dryer is fairly quiet and has good power.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> BEST.HAIRDRYER. EVER!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best hairdryers Ive bought. The plum sparkle coloring is spectacular. It is a little heavy but not real noticeable. The only thing that &amp;#34;erks&amp;#34; me is where the buttons are. If you are use to holding it a certain way, you may have to change that. I miss having a rewindable cord too, but thats okay with me. It is great! My hairstylist even thinks so!</li>
    <li> The first version of this hair dryer lasted me several years. It was great. Then it sparked and smelled and it was time for a new one. I bought the same type because it lasted so long. Last Christmas I got a new one and it&#x27;s been less than a year and is already starting to spark :-( not sure what they changed in the make of it, but definitely not as good as it used to be.</li>
    <li> Nice solid feel. The colors are a dark chocolate brown with light pink accents. Very nice. Has a low and high fan setting, plus three temperature sets with an additional button for cool blast.  The two implements included snap on and stay on well. I love the way it works. Probably one of the nicer hairdryers I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> This is worth the money.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap ones, spend a little extra and get one like this that is good for your hair.</li>
    <li> I saw how some people said this gets too hot, I have think hair, it works great, I use the middle setting, so it&#x27;s not super duper hot but hot to do the job. I like it so far, used this for a couple months already, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I ordered this during the holidays, with the knowledge that my current dryer weas gonna go anyday, well it did, and I just opened this and used for two days, it makes a terrible, terrible, humming sound......and I can not return due to that I waited to long to open it and try it now my return date is past.</li>
    <li> It is very convenient tool for girls. My friend purchased it for his girlfriend as a valentne&#x27;s gift this year. She was very happy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer a year ago and it has performed very well. I did go onto Amazon and  order the Babybliss tonight because this dryer has started sparking. When I am drying my hair I hear and see sparks. Crazy so I threw it away and researched reviews on several sites and ordered the Babybliss. I do not want to wait until this dryer burns my hair.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is overall okay, albeit the somewhat heavy weight. After one year of use though, the main switch just broke in half. It&#x27;s quite a shame that such a 1-cent part can break and make the whole product unusable. Grrr.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It works good for me. My last dryer lasted about 8 years and needed one similar to the one I had.</li>
    <li> Love love love it. Best one yet.</li>
    <li> The low speed never worked &amp; it is very heavt. Exchanged it for another brand</li>
    <li> needs an expensive transformer</li>
    <li> Relatively weak blowing power, and it broke after only one year. I thought it would be covered under the warranty, but alas, the warranty is very specific and won&#x27;t cover the damage. Looks like I&#x27;m on the market for a new hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Love these sleek style&lt;br /&gt;Love the color&lt;br /&gt;Love the attachments it came with&lt;br /&gt;HATE where the buttons are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have no control over it but your constantly hitting the buttons on and off by accident because of where they are located.</li>
    <li> It does the job I guess but not good for a lot of hair or a medium size/bigger dog. There just isn&#x27;t enough air flow even on the high setting.</li>
    <li> I just got this last week. I think&#x27;s great. The cord length is perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this for heating Hockey Skates and it works great. It gets mighty hot. I have yet to use it on my head but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great with that too.</li>
    <li> Quiet and fairly light weight. I have very long hair that usually takes 20+ minutes to blow dry. I use the medium temperature setting and it takes me still close to 20 minutes, but my hair is so soft afterwards that I don&#x27;t even mind!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to use this new hair dryer, and upon receiving it, found that it was good quality for the money, nice finish and quiet but powerful. However, it IS heavier than most hair dryers. I thought that wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal, but since I dry my hair every day and have weak wrists, it is not comfortable so I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this blow dryer! My hair went from being dry and brittle to soft and smooth!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this hair dryer.  She gave her original one away because we moved overseas.  The person who got the blow dryer didn&#x27;t want to gave it back after our return because she liked it so much and my wife just had me re-buy it for her.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little heavy, so don&#x27;t buy it if that might bother you.</li>
    <li> Delivered in a timely fashion. Great product very high quality</li>
    <li> Love the design, love the color, love the price, and love what it does. This hair dryer does not give my  hair frizz and my hair gets dried quickly too!</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL!! Unlike every other hair dryer I have ever heard, this one is doesn&#x27;t have that high pitched whining that pierces the ear. Instead it is a low pitched hum that our baby can sleep right through with only the bathroom door closed. My wife says that it dries very well. Absolutely worth it to pay a bit more than the typical hair dryers cost.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Nice weight, high quality product. Great choices of speeds, heat and cooling levels. Dries hair quickly and effortlessly. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase- love it- bought one for my daughter</li>
    <li> As usual most of items here I buy for my wife))) She likes this hair dryer! It has cold, warm and hot regime, concentrator and diffuser that helps her to stylish her hair in different ways. It&#x27;s very comfortable to hand it. We are thinking about Remington flat iron now ;)</li>
    <li> I have long hair, it goes just past my mid back, and I blow dry my hair almost every day. So as you can imagine a good hair dryer is very important to me. Although I only got the hair dryer yesterday after using it this morning I had to post a review. This is the best hair dryer I have had in a long time. It has a lot of power and my hair was completely dry in about 10 mins +/-. Considering how much hair I have this is FAST. The dryer itself is not too heavy and is quieter than most models. My hair was so soft, straight and shiny after using this hair dryer I must say I am instantly in love.</li>
    <li> After nearly a year, it abruptly stopped working at the highest heat setting.  I was left with a full head of wet hair and down right annoyed right before work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it worked, it did dry the hair reasonably fast and had good temperature range.  The unwieldy large size made me feel like my arm was a foot too short and it took a while to get used to.  It didn&#x27;t give my hair any more shine or frizz-free than other dryers I had in the past.  But the previous hair dryers all lasted a lot longer while they were used a lot more frequently than this one.  I&#x27;ve been letting my hair air dry after wash and using dry shampoo to reduce shampooing in the last few months.  I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a hair dryer and this has been great to use. Love the attachments as well.</li>
    <li> This replaced a hairdryer that&#x27;s oh, about 25 years old and still working. Gotta say, it&#x27;s a welcome change. Love the ionic aspect, and it leaves my hair very manageable. Powerful but quiet motor. Other reviewers have commented that it has a funny smell. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed, and there&#x27;s never any reason to blow it in my face, so not a problem. Love the soft feel of the housing, love the little rubber bumper that doesn&#x27;t allow it to slide on the countertop, love the long cord ... maybe I&#x27;ll get 25 years out of this one, too!</li>
    <li> I would buy again...strong hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I was initially really happy with this hair dryer - I have long and thick hair, and this worked really well for me. It&#x27;s fairly high-powered and dries hair quickly. The concentrator attachment helped dry my hair straight, and the diffuser attachment worked to smooth and dry when I wore my hair curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after owning this dryer for about 6 or 7 months, it started sparking periodically when drying my hair. Scary! Big, loud sparks started to shoot out of the end, although thankfully never singed me or my hair. It would start when I&#x27;d been using the dryer for about 10 minutes and increase from there. I contacted Remington and they easily replaced the hair dryer (I had no problems even though I bought it on Amazon and not direct from them), but then about 6-7 months after receiving my replacement dryer... the same thing happened again! Now I&#x27;m giving up and moving on to a different brand.</li>
    <li> this is heavy but the quality of the blowing is great! not cheap-like.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best blow dryer ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly hair and use a diffuser everyday so not to break up my curls... This hairdryer was actually too powerful (even on the lowest setting) for my delicate curls.  If I was going to blow it straight I&#x27;m sure it would have cut my drying time but for my type of loose curls, I needed the diffuser to diffuse more (It felt like the diffuser wasn&#x27;t holding back any of the air) and the air not to be so powerful (on low).  I ended up returning this hairdryer and going back to my original lightweight Revlon.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this dryer to someone with fragile/lightweight curls but I would recommend for everyone else.</li>
    <li> We had one of these that went bad so I ordered this one to replace my husbands.  It is  a good value.</li>
    <li> Three heat settings, three fan settings, a truly cold &amp;#34;cold shot&amp;#34;, and tons of power. As my hair has been getting longer, I&#x27;ve been  cutting it close for work in the morning and realized it&#x27;s the dang hairdryer! It took forever for me to dry my hair. I went through 2 dryers from the box store (both returned) and couldn&#x27;t find &#x27;the one.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t want to spend a gazillion dollars!  So for the price, the Remington Pearl is a miracle. It&#x27;s the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever used and I can get to work on time now!</li>
    <li> It does a good job the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the buttons are in the same spot where you hold it hence changing the settings and or turning it off.</li>
    <li> I like it but the lady of the house would like a smaller one easier to manuver</li>
    <li> My younger sister had this dryer for almost 6 years so when it died I made sure to read the brand so I could buy it online for myself once mine was dead as a door nail. It has 3 settings for heat and two for strength. The high is amazing, My har is pretty long, About 6 or 7 inches past my shoulders and I can dry my hair in 6 minutes flat. No dryer at this price stands up to it.</li>
    <li> Over heated in 2 minute! We had to return it and had to pay bubble rap to sent it back to Amazon. Good luck if you want to order this through online.</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer for the price. I really have no complaints. This is an excellent value.</li>
    <li> It was great while it lasted - 5 months! Just stopped working.</li>
    <li> I like this overall, but my mum used this product once and she absolutely loved it, she actually wants one for herself. She said that she loved that it blew out cool air instead of just heat, and our hair feels so soft afterwords.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer dries my fine straight hair very quickly and is rather quiet for a hair dryer. It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side, so if you have hair that takes a long time to dry, you might want to get a lighter dryer so your arm doesn&#x27;t get tired.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this, and I&#x27;m glad I listened to them. This is a powerful, easy-to-use dryer. It gets the job done, and while I use styling products, it does help make it somewhat silky smooth. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very powerful and quite. The finish is also cool and professional looking. Just a little bit heavy than the one I had.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s so pretty and girly and nice, but just one little issue-&lt;br /&gt;The cold button isn&#x27;t really letting out cold air like other hair dryers, and it only works if you keep pressing it, which can be quite tricky and therefore annoying.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair dryer for nearly a month, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new hair dryer. While it is a bit heavier than the dryer I replaced, I hardly notice, because it dries my hair in half the time! I have medium length, thin/fine hair, and I actually use it on the low setting, so that it does not tangle my hair. The high setting is almost too much for my hair, but I&#x27;m sure it would be perfect for someone with thicker/longer hair. I also appreciate that it is rather quiet considering how powerful it is. The only thing I would change is to make the switches flatter (more of a slide design)...I&#x27;ve occasionally switched it off, or changed the heat setting accidentally, while in use. But overall, this is probably the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
    <li> I found this after searching for a quiet hair dryer.  I have been specifically buying quiet ones for close to 15 years now because of chronic migraines.  My first was a Remington and I was in college so, needless to say, it was quite beat up by the time it died and, it lasted a long time (close to 10 years maybe longer???).  I bought a new &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; dryer in a different brand a few years ago.  I was never extremely happy with it but, I didn&#x27;t want to just throw it out.  It&#x27;s finally at a point where I can say it needs to be replaced so, I thought this time I was going to need to spend a lot of money to get a decent hair dryer.  After combing the number of hair dryers listed under quiet on Amazon, I couldn&#x27;t figure out why this one was there.  I liked the price but, it didn&#x27;t advertise as quiet so, I began reading the reviews and now I&#x27;m adding to them.  This is a QUIET dryer.  Another reviewer mentioned the fact that it has a low hum rather than a high pitched one and they were right.  I haven&#x27;t officially used the dryer yet but, I turned it on to see if it was something I would be able to tolerate.  It is definitely a quieter model hairdryer, more quiet than the one that I bought a few years back that was listed specifically as a quiet!  I&#x27;m not one to decide on a product based on looks but, added to the fact that this is quiet is the fact that it is sleek looking and feeling.  It&#x27;s a deep burgundy color nearing black (I know it looks black in the picture) and the texture is smooth but, not slippery.  It feels solid but, not heavy like many hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion?  If you are looking for a QUIET hair dryer that is worth the money, I highly recommend this one.  I loved my first Remington and this one already shows promise of being just as great!</li>
    <li> this is a goo product.  hair dresser recommended and uses one.  not sure how the pearl effect is supposed to sustain itself from the ceramic but oh well.  it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and I would recommend this to anyone looking for  a quality hair drier.  it was deliverd quickly and was packaged to arrive safely.</li>
    <li> I had my previous Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for a VERY long time.  My own stupidity was actually its undoing. I tried to clean off the grate inside by opening the unit and ended up not putting it back together quite right, burning out the motor. Soooo I had to get another hair dryer.  I decided on this one for the price and ratings for the most part. It is heavier probably because of the ceramic inside. I only use it to quickly dry my short hair after a shower so it works great for that. I probably got more than I need in a hair dryer but it does work for me and it works swell. It is the bees knees! Don&#x27;t know what that means exactly and I am younger than that saying is....but it is kinda fun saying it anyway.</li>
    <li> shipped super quick!! the speeds in the dryer are extremely convenient esp love the cooling button has no heat at all unlike many dryers tht even with the cooling button, the air is still sort of warm</li>
    <li> makes my hair shinier and it maintains the keratin treatment. it is lighter than the one I had before. it is not small, so that&#x27;s a disadvantage if you are traveling. but it is powerful. recommend it</li>
    <li> Lots of air flow, good grip, not too heavy.  Only negative is the air is either lava hot or cold.  No good modulation on the heat control.  Still a good hair drier and works.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer almost four years ago, and I use it for at least 15 minutes every day. After about a year, the bottom switch (high/medium/off) broke off, but I&#x27;m still able to turn it on and off with the thumb easily enough. It is a bit heavier than your average dryer, but it works much faster, and I can tell and definite difference in the smoothness of my hair when I use this compared to the cheap-o ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. I&#x27;m thinking about buying another one just because mine is scuffed up and has the broken switch, but all in all, it works great! (Also, there is a matching straightener which works really well, too! [[ASIN:B003V21WO2 Remington S9520 Salon Collection Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 2 Inch]])</li>
    <li> I love this! I really do, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy and it was more than worth the price, surprisingly it not as loud as other hair dryers I have used in the past. I would definitely recommend this! I did take one star away because I do find it to be kinda heavy.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as i expected</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer. It is powerful and very handy.</li>
    <li> Feels very solid and well made.  Powerful and fairly quiet.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love hair dryer. Wish the cord was longer like the original dryer purchased a few years ago!  Why did they shorten cord??</li>
    <li> A great hair dryer! Very light weight and on the quieter end. I also really like how soft and smooth my hair is after I use it. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> My old hair dryer quit on me.  So this one has been used since the day it arrived.  I love it, and it does a great job of blowing my hair dry.</li>
    <li> Best, most powerful blow dryer ever!</li>
    <li> When the hair dryer I had for more than a decade finally gave up the ghost, I combed through a bewildering number of reviews before deciding on this Remington dryer as a replacement--and hoped for the best. So far I have been very pleased with its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it regularly for more than a year now, and it has produced consistently good results. My hair is smoother than with any dryer I have previously owned and I no longer battle static, even during drier (no pun intended) winter conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three heat settings (low/medium/high) and two air-flow settings (low/high) are adequate; my mid-long hair dries very quickly even using the medium heat setting, which is hot enough to get the job done without making my head feel like it has been popped into an oven and left to bake. The concentrator works well (I haven&#x27;t used the diffuser), and the dryer is relatively quiet. It&#x27;s a little heavier than other models, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be problematic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the placement of the buttons on the handle. It took a little time to adjust my hand so that I wasn&#x27;t accidentally changing the heat setting or turning it off altogether while using it--not crazy contortionist hand-cramping kind of adjustments, just minor tweaks that a slightly improved design might have eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does what a good dryer should do: dries hair quickly without making a frazzled mess of it.</li>
    <li> This is a great, powerful and affordable hair dryer. It really shortened dry time significantly. I purchased one for my daughter, but ended up getting 2 more for me and my mom. We all love it.</li>
    <li> I love the different settings and the drying capability.  I dries very quickly and is great a creating volume.  It is a little heavy, but worth the weight.</li>
    <li> Mine has shorted out as well.  I can only use it on medium.  Never high.  It starts to smell like its burning.</li>
    <li> Dog hates it but it works great plus it&#x27;s cute</li>
    <li> My wife bought this, but I&#x27;ll leave my two cents. This is a very quiet hair dryer. I figured that was something interesting that you should know. The air blows smooth and has a cool air button. The weight is about average and comes with two end pieces that I have no idea what they are for. Its a very nice hair dryer. The quiet factor with our sleeping baby is something I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair really well, but it&#x27;s big and kinda heavy - would have bought a smaller one had I known</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer, I&#x27;ve used it for months now, works like the day I rec&#x27;d it.</li>
    <li> I love love love this hair dryer. Its fast and powerful. Gets the job done within 10 minutes for me.</li>
    <li> My original own died after dropping it several times. Loved this dryer so replaced it. Gets hair dry fast and is not too loud.</li>
    <li> Bought this dryer to help with my dense wavy hair frizzing when I blow dried it. This seem to do the job well. It has lots of options for heat and speed, and gets my hair dry faster than my old &amp;#34;cheapy&amp;#34; dryer. I have noticed less frizzing and my hair is smoother and shiner than before. I would give it good marks for value for money, it appears to do the job as well as more expensive ceramic dryers I looked at.</li>
    <li> Terrific dryer with all the attachments and features one would ever need. Can be used by a professional, has it all. Does not disappoint!</li>
    <li> The hot setting is the right temp. It has three fan settings. The attachments work well. Not the lightest or smallest dryer, but is perfect for what I need and want.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer! It dries my hair quickly and leaves it looking and feeling silky. I have thick, medium length, wavy hair and like it to be straight so I use the concentrator and it does the trick. The heat controls are great because they aren&#x27;t too hot and the temperature settings are noticeably different when you go hotter or colder (which was an issue with my last dryer-it was too hot and fried my hair). I am really happy with this purchase and you will be too!</li>
    <li> Excelent tool, It is usefull..... thank you very much. the packgage sent very good, and the specifications are the same that the description.</li>
    <li> Its good, dryes my hair really fast and its cute too! I got 2 one for me and one for my friend she loves it as well!</li>
    <li> I needed a hairdryer after my old one blew a fuse.  The prices for some hairdryers is insane.  This one seems sturdy. It is a bit heavy but my hair dries quickly so that really isn&#x27;t a problem for me. At first, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working but I realized that I had accidentally hit the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button.  The buttons can be just a bit confusing but they can figured out easily. I like that it came with two attachments. I am styling my hair more than I ever have and I am not seeing any damage and my hair is still soft.</li>
    <li> Love how quiet this dryer is.  It feels good in the hand however it is a bit on the heavy side.  You get used to it after using it for awhile.  Other than the weight issue it is an amazing dryer!</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed my hair took less time to dry with this. It does a great job, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Pretty good hair dryer my dad inlaw sometimes  uses it to dry his clothes if that means anything and it hasn&#x27;t burnt out yet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good thing I really only use the hot and cold, because the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting is like a smidge above the cool. It&#x27;s basically useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concentrator comes/falls off a little too easy, yet slightly difficult to turn (yes, I put it on correctly...even had my husband do it and he&#x27;s the master of putting stuff together), especially when it&#x27;s burning hot. Haven&#x27;t tried the diffuser, so no comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I saw some reviews before puchasing that mentioned it was heavier than what they thought it would be. I agree...I mean, it&#x27;s not crazy heavy, but if you&#x27;re blowdrying your hair in excess of 20min, then you&#x27;re going to have to take mini-breaks and stretch out your biceps/triceps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Bought two of these, one for each bathroom.  I like the controls on the handle and the ability to adjust the temperature and the power while you&#x27;re using it.  My husband, however, doesn&#x27;t particularly like that feature -- I guess with larger hands he finds himself inadvertently changing the settings while he&#x27;s gripping the dryer.  I also like three temperature settings, high, medium, and cool.  Too many dryers I&#x27;ve used before just have high or no heat.  I really like it; husband is just OK with it.</li>
    <li> It is a really nice blow dryer. Make sure to not get hair stuck at the end because one time my hair accidentally was almost going to get stuck.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this hair dryer--and the price was quite fair! I see that many people feel it is too heavy but I disagree. Shipping was also a breeze!</li>
    <li> This product works well. I was bit surprised that the highlited areas are pink. I am a man and would prefer not to have a pink hair dryer at the gym but whatever.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer, it&#x27;s got a great&lt;br /&gt;Motor and blow dries my hair fast! I had this one before for 6 years and it just burnt out, lasted a long time! So I had to get the same one, I just love it!</li>
    <li> This blowdryer is okay. I orignally bought it because i heard it was a reliable brand and I also needed a new blow dryer and this was on sale with a 4 dollar off coupon. The filter that the air goes in through and then gets heated and comes out the other end so the back side it my hair gets stuck in this everytime i use it! it drives me crazy! So everytime i have to stop the bblow dryer and cut my hair out of it and clean the filter! The smell also i a dirffernt smell that comes out i dont know if thats just because my hair that gets stuck is making it smell because it burned or that its just a differnt blow dryer from my preivou one but i think i might just have t get used to it.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer.  It dries my hair, which is very thick in very little time.  High quality, especially compared to the blow dryers you can buy in the local market.</li>
    <li> Very good blow dryer! I usually buy very cheap ones but splurged a little this time. Love it! It is a little heavier than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> The only con is the weight. It&#x27;s pretty heavy but it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Do not buy. It was great while it lasted, but it shorted out after 3 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet and Seemed to be quality...until its very early smoking, stinking death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find another that lasts longer.</li>
    <li> This dryer is nice.  It&#x27;s not too heavy, it&#x27;s really quiet, and it dried my hair.  I noticed a subtle change in the dry time... maybe shortened it by a couple of minutes (and I had a really old cheap dryer).  I don&#x27;t believe all of that ion mumbo jumbo that is supposed to change the texture of your hair.  Mine feels the same.  My real complaint about this dryer is the placement of the switches.  In about 7 minutes I had to stop and fix the settings no less than 10 times because you press them accidentally while you&#x27;re using the dryer.  They&#x27;re right under your fingers.  WHY IN THE WORLD DON&#x27;T DESIGNERS get it?  STOP putting the switches on the handle!!!!  If you&#x27;re tired of cheap old no good dryers, don&#x27;t get this mediocre one, get a nice one for a little more.</li>
    <li> She loved the fact that it came with a defuser and the feel of it ( coated with a rubberish material) and the pearl pink really makes this feminine., but what she loved the most is how it works. She has naturally curly hair and the blow dryer she had was an older version with out the detachable vent for cleaning, and the ceramic and ionic qualities of this hair dryer, while in many newer style dryers, works beautifully on her hair. No fly-a ways, and your hair really does look healthy when your done, no split ends popping out etc.... So,I am going to buy myself one! Yes..I would recommend this dryer to anyone with any type of hair.</li>
    <li> Christmas Present for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;I now know more about Hair dryers than I ever hoped to know, but she loves it and that is all that matters. She says it is the best she has ever owned.</li>
    <li> Pros:  doesn&#x27;t over-dry hair to a crisp. Love the settings and switch options and easy one-handed access when changing modes. My two hair-stylists bought one because they liked mine so much and the great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  My first model broke after 14 months. I only use it 3-4 times a week. The heating element died. My husband is a electrical engineer and took it apart and couldn&#x27;t fix it. It feels like a waste to throw such a nice blow dryer away, but I liked it enough to by another one of the same model. Just hope it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for my girlfriend. She has long thick hair and gets tired of all the maintenance it takes. She has been very happy with this product. It works quickly and doesn&#x27;t damage her hair.</li>
    <li> I had hoped for something a little more professional when I bought it for my wife. I wanted something that would blow her hair off! This isn&#x27;t it but it works well enough we kept it. I guess it&#x27;s what you get for $30.</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer for the price! thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer because my last one finally died after about 5 years. I was looking for something inexpensive and high quality, which often doesn&#x27;t go together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: For the most part, this dryer does exactly what it says it will. It dried my hair slightly faster than my previous dryer, and left it frizz free. I have very fine hair, so it almost always gets poofy. The tapered end made it easier to target the air to the rolling brush, which makes a big difference when compared to a snub nosed dryer (those aren&#x27;t professional beauty terms, just the best words I can think of to describe the product). It&#x27;s a decent size and easy to store. The motor is VERY quiet compared to other hair dryers I&#x27;ve used. My boyfriend gets up an hour later than I do for work, and he definitely appreciates the quiet motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: Just an aesthetic thing, it smells weird. To be fair, it&#x27;s brand new so it&#x27;s probably the smell from the packaging; but it also produces a faint odor when the motor runs that reminds me of like a toy blow dryer. I&#x27;ll update the review if the smell goes away. For it&#x27;s average size, it&#x27;s fairly heavy. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because a larger motor, heavier materials, etc. I was using it for about 10 mins and my arm started to get sore! It&#x27;s not insanely heavy, definitely manageable, but I would give it a higher ranking if it was a lighter and easier to hold. Also, the controls operate opposite any dryer I&#x27;ve ever had. So, instead of sliding the control up to get a faster speed or hotter temp, you slide down. That has definitely taken some getting used to. Finally, the attachments are just OK. They connect to the dryer well, but if you&#x27;re like me, you are kind of a klutz when blow drying your hair. I usually knock the dryer with my brush or my hand at some point during the drying process and the attachments fall off at the slightest bump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - it does what it says it will and does fine for what I paid for it. In hindsight, I wish I would&#x27;ve splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.ight, I wish I would&#x27;ve splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.</li>
    <li> Great- for a whole 6 months...then the sparks started to fly! Loved this hair dryer- its look, feel, multiple settings. But then it began to spark. As Im drying my hair, a loud snap accompanied by a large blue spark shoots out of the barrel. At first it was subtle but as time has gone by it is worse and worse. Now its just down right scary. And since other reviewers have the same problem, I sadly wont be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer!!!!  It is quieter than other dryers that I have owned and dries my hair in half the time.  It is a little heavier, but it is very well balanced so I don&#x27;t notice anymore.</li>
    <li> Its heavy but its okay so far is still working lets see on the future...</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this is the EXACT model I have of this blow dryer, however, I only say that because I have literally had this blow dryer since 2005 and it has always worked very well. Before that, no dryer lasted longer than 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit on the heavier side and a bit on the BLOWIER side (when I first used it, I had to brush out all the snarles along the way) but it&#x27;s held up and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the weight and blowiness. Since I&#x27;ve had it for so long, the nice &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; outer material has unfortunately become coated with something (not sure what since I don&#x27;t use hair spray or very many products) and so now the entire thing is kind of sticky. I&#x27;ve tried cleaning it a number of times to no avail. That is the only bad thing I&#x27;ve found about this dryer, so I just wanted to thank Remington for making such a good product.</li>
    <li> So quiet and drys my thick hair super fast</li>
    <li> it came super fast and exactly as described five stars would buy from them again fer sure</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through so many hair dryers that advertised as &#x27;no frizz&#x27; &#x27;lightweight&#x27; &#x27;fast drying&#x27; and they weren&#x27;t that great. Finally I purchased this one! I was in need of a new one, my hot tools one just wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore one day,  so I bought this one since it was inexpensive and had good reviews, and I&#x27;m in love! It used to take me about 10 to 15 minutes to dry my hair, with this dryer its been only taking me 5 minutes at the most,  I use the small nozzle,  and I get no frizz, and it feels so nice! I used to have to use frizz products with past dryers, but not with this one! I seriously recommend buying this</li>
    <li> I did a search for &amp;#34;quiet dryers&amp;#34; and this came up.  The reviews sounded ok so I went for it.  It&#x27;s considerably heavier than the old one I had and definitely stronger.  Overall, it feels like a solid build and does its job with the only complaint being that it&#x27;s a bit heavier for some (perhaps).  I&#x27;d recommend it but have only been using it for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to replace the same model (my first one broke after it fell off a counter and onto the linoleum).  I love it.  It&#x27;s efficient and has multiple heat/cool/power settings.  I was so happy to find a replacement.</li>
    <li> I have had the Remington blow dryer for 5 years but unfortunately I left it at my daughters home.  I have called a few times to get her to ship it back but she keeps forgetting so I bought another.  Love it just as well as my older one and looks the same except for color.  Found out my daughter loved the blow dryer which is why she kept forgetting to mail it back to me.  We both would recommend this hair blower....especially if you have thick hair like we do.  It works great.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer!! Works great and fast and I like how there&#x27;s an actual cool air setting instead of just the cool air shot button.</li>
    <li> I have only used the diffuser and low speed setting for this but I love that it sends only cool air so I get the right type of drying power. I have been using this every other day for a couple weeks and I haven&#x27;t noticed any damage to my hair. It is also consistently the same temperature so I don&#x27;t get a mix of warm / cold air. The cold blast button I think still works but I&#x27;ll have to read the instructions again on whether you hold it down or just push the button. If it&#x27;s that you just push the button, I don&#x27;t notice it getting any cooler after depressing it. Other than the mysterious button, this has been great. It&#x27;s easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t slip in my hands at all. The cord doesn&#x27;t wrap itself up while I&#x27;m using it, which was an issue with my last blowdryer. It was constantly coiling up when I lifted it. I do not wrap the cord around the body of my tools, so this was especially annoying. This is my first diffusing hairdryer, so I cannot compare it to anything else but I will say that when its last day comes, I am happy enough to buy the same product.</li>
    <li> I like it. It&#x27;s got a few different levels and switches which can be a little frustrating to figure out. It&#x27;s a tad on the heavy side. On the plus side it drys quickly.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about the blow dryer that I use. This is one is wonderful. Read all the other reviews too - that&#x27;s what I based my decision on and I am glad I did. The weight / feel of the dryer is great - well balanced. The air heat levels include a cool, med and hot (not marked that way, my words). Love the cool setting to get a cool breeze (hair drying is a hot!) and it sets curls nice. The air flow is just right. The attachments are helpful as I wear my hair straight and curly. My hair dries quicker without the extreme heat minimizing the frizz even in humid temps.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this. I used this for just 3 or 4 times and now started getting coil burning smell when I turn it on. It should go to trash now.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, she loves it. Can&#x27;t give it a 5 because she doesn&#x27;t believe in them, and I haven&#x27;t used it for myself seeing how my hair is nearly to my scalp haha.</li>
    <li> Love this! GREAT Power, adjustable speeds, works awesome!</li>
    <li> Nothing unique about it. Works like a blow dryer should. It is not very loud. The attachments help dry hair faster.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this hair dryer and bought it when the old model died out on her. The last one was used for over five years. Great product.</li>
    <li> The only other hair dryer I have to compare to is a really outdated one that my mother uses, so I may be biased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s slick, sleek and powerful. It drys my hair well and the pressure is consistent and strong. I also really like the light pink coloring on the buttons and the attachments are very useful as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome dryer.  Best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It is very powerful, but freakishly quiet.  I have very sensitive hearing and have always worn earplugs with hair dryers, but not with this one.  Why isn&#x27;t Remington bragging about the quietness?  &amp;#34;Quiet&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t even on the packaging, but it should be!  Also, I like the slightly &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; texture.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, exceeds expectations</li>
    <li> Really cute size, not to big or small. The color is very feminine, it gives off a playful plastic feel. Oh and the power is great!</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer, just a little more heavy than I expected</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is one of the fastest drying hair dryers I&#x27;ve ever used. It also looks sleek and professional. I like that it comes with multiple attachments to give you the best blow dry you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have a few issues with this particular hair dryer. It blows really hard. Even on the slowest setting, the air blows out very forcefully. If I need precision drying, I have to use the diffuser attachment, otherwise my hair gets blown to smithereens. Another problem is the rocker switch design. When I&#x27;m using this, the rocker switch controls on the handle are very easy to push and I&#x27;m regularly having to reset my settings. After I while this gets very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be lasting me pretty well. I&#x27;ve been using it almost one year and haven&#x27;t had any trouble with its performance. I hope it lasts me a few more years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this hair dryer is usable but might cause some frustration.</li>
    <li> Have had it for about 4 years and thought it did a good enough job.  I use it on  medium heat/blow settings and always clean the air intake screen at the first sign of lint.  However, it has recently been throwing out sparks and some actual flames.  At first it was a high pitched screeching noise, then popping, then sparks, now FLAMES!  It is in the trash and I will be looking for a better dryer.  Funny that my mother has had the same dryer for over 15 years, but this modern &amp;#34;high tech&amp;#34; stuff is just mass produced junk!</li>
    <li> I liked this dryer a lot, and it was a great dryer for the price.  However, a month after the warranty expired it started shooting out green sparks and losing heat.  Probably won&#x27;t bother with this brand again, as I see the same thing has happended to other users.</li>
    <li> This is a great hairdryer for such a cheap price. However, I ended up ordering a much higher end dryer which I use instead. If I were in a pinch or was on a budget, I would definitely use/recommend this dryer, though.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hair dryer.  I have medium-long but thick hair, and my hair dries in literally 1/3 to 1/2 the time of my old hair dryer.  Comes with the two separate attachments (directional and diffuser) and then both work great and attach firmly but easily.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I really liked this, but unfortunately it only lasted a few weeks. It just stopped turning on. There is no way to contact the seller for a refund so I&#x27;m disappointed that I wasted my money on a broken hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I wondered whether it would be worth the money when I purchased this blow dryer a few years ago.  However, it didn&#x27;t take me long to learn how superior this blow dryer is to all of the others I have used.  It dries my hair faster than any other blow dryer.  I&#x27;m not sure how, but my hair looks nicer too.  It doesn&#x27;t make that high pitched engine sound like other driers.  I like the little red rubber tabs on the side.  You put it down and it stays where ever you put it. When I go on a trip and have to use the hotel&#x27;s driers, I am instantly reminded of how much better the Remington is. The only thing that is a little bit of a negative is that it is heavier than other blow dryers.  But, it is hardly worth the mention.  This drier is well worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> i like the color and it&#x27;s worked great...love all the heat and power settings...so far so good with this blowdryer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many hair driers over the years (mine, my sister&#x27;s driers, my mom&#x27;s driers..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has got to be the best so far in many ways. Both sides of the drier have a rubber strip that completely keeps it from sliding off the counter. I&#x27;ve never dropped it off the counter the past year I&#x27;ve had it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has three temperature settings (and a cool shot button). It has two speeds which I would consider \\&quot;High\\&quot; and \\&quot;Crazy High\\&quot; so if you have young children, they might not be too keen to let you dry their hair with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have less frizz with this drier, too, and was able to 100% stop using my Chi hair straightener. Since I have curly hair, I think that is quite a feat!!! Bought a large round brush and I use this drier to give me silky hair with lots of body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not heavy, either. It&#x27;s lightweight and not slippery but rather grippy. There are no issues holding this drier for extended periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cord is a moderate length, shorter than other driers I&#x27;ve had but so far it hasn&#x27;t been an issue. If anything, I am no longer catching cords on the bottom doors of my bathroom counter/cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose is nice and long so I can hang my hair over it while moving my round brush back to my scalp and it does not get caught up in the sucking end of the drier. Shorter, plastic hair driers won&#x27;t work because hair slides off or gets caught. This one isn&#x27;t slippery plastic and is a great length. If you use a round brush you know what I&#x27;m talking about here :)</li>
    <li> I love this dryer. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it at all and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months. I love the diffuser and the concentrator. When my previous ionic dryer died after ten years, I had to use a regular 1875 watt dryer for a few days and IT WAS AWFUL! This dryer is faster and does not cause frizz or flyaway like a regular dryer. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it getting too hot or attachments popping off as mentioned in a few other reviews. I also haven&#x27;t had any issues with the nonslip coating peeling or anything like that but I put the dryer away after each use so it is not out on the counter getting sprayed with perfumes and hairsprays etc. I would definitely purchase this product again and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product runs quieter than I&#x27;d imagined and works absolutely great. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of the frizzies.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer was more annoying that useful.  I purchased this an an emergency dryer and mine gave up on me. What a disappoinment. The buttons kept swiching on there own from hot to cold to warm from medium to high heat. Just because the buttons are accidentally touched doesn&#x27;t mean it should switch that easy. That alone did it for me. Also my hair frizzed up almost immediately after drying my hair. On the other hand my mom used it and although she also complained about the buttons switching easily,  her hair didn&#x27;t frizz up my mine did. It stayed smooth.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair dryers I have ever owned! Don&#x27;t even have to use my straightener anymore because this blow dryer makes my hair straight and smooth!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is amazing and only cost a little more than the moderately priced hair dryers I usually buy. It dried my hair very quickly without leaving it fried. The best thing, though, is that the hottest setting actually gets nice and hot, which is what you need if you&#x27;re styling your hair. Most of the dryers I used in the past didn&#x27;t get hot enough. This heat, coupled with the cold shot, enables me to get a lot of volume in my usually flat hair. It also works great for quickly touching up my hair the next morning after I had slept on it.  The only thing that I would deduct 1/2 a star for if I could would be the control buttons. Sometimes when I&#x27;m holding the handle while drying my hair, my hand would accidentally change the settings. A minor annoyance, but I&#x27;m willing to put up with it given how amazing the rest of the dryer is.   UPDATE: After less than 2 years of use, the hair dryer started making funny noises and shot out sparks. Very sad, because I loved this dryer so much. Changing my rating since based on reading some of the other comments regarding sparks, this seems to be an ongoing problem with the dryer.</li>
    <li> SO far so good for this blow dryer...works well..fairly quiet and has all the features needed for a decent economic price.</li>
    <li> I used this blow dryer about ten times and all ten times it made my hair tangle. But it may only be because my hair is thin to medium. I let my sister try this blow dryer and her hair is allot thicker than mine and she didn&#x27;t complain of tangling in her hair. The highest setting on this blow dryer is pretty powerful or at least too powerful for my hair. i had to go back and purchase a blow dryer that had a less powerful motor. Other than my hair tangling the buttons were easy to use, easy to turn off and on and everything else worked fine.</li>
    <li> I chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price! I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product! Blow dryer is awesome and works very well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powerful and with high efficiency. Just hope that it can continue working well for me for a longer time (at least more than 6 months.)  :D&lt;br /&gt;By the way, delivery is also fast.</li>
    <li> Durability far exceeded expectation and it still going</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever. Super high power. I dunno if it has something to do with the &amp;#34;ionize&amp;#34; part , but it actually thickens up my hair. I&#x27;m 46 and it&#x27;s getting a little thinner up top and man this thing does wonders for bringing a fullness to my hair. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 4 yrs. Best dryer I&#x27;ve  ever owned. Bit heavy but not unbearable. Problem is the finish degrades. It  now disgustingly sticky. If you know nars cosmetics compacts, that  how it gets. I&#x27;m tempted  to buy another one but looking for similar without that rubberized finish.</li>
    <li> Have had this less than a year and it&#x27;s started to take much longer to dry my hair- the air isn&#x27;t coming out as hot or a fast as it used to. And most recently it started throwing out green sparks. I&#x27;m getting a new one but won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve had so far. When my hair was long, I had it dry in under 10 minutes. Regular hair dryers took 10 minutes or longer. Now that my hair&#x27;s short, it takes less than 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this blow dryer and be able to test it out, since I&#x27;ve done allot of research for a good quality inexpensive blow dryer with enough settings . Especially because I have fine hair, a blow dryer that doesn&#x27;t get extremely hot was a priority. I absolutely love it , it&#x27;s everything that i was looking for &amp; i like the way it looks. Only one con is , it&#x27;s pretty heavy. I would recommend this item</li>
    <li> bought it as a christmas gift for my girl but her old dryer sparked and didnt seem too safe anymore so i opened it a little early for her to enjoy! awesome so far she loves it and i must say her hair looks great after she uses it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hairdrier and it works. The true test is how long it will last... and unfortunately, I won&#x27;t likely come back and review it in a few years.</li>
    <li> its good, but for some reason the way the buttons are everytime i grab the dryer to plug it in ive hit the on button and it always is on when plugged in, beyond that its no big deal, and it dries nice and is cute looking, i love the colors!  also i have pretty long hair and this dries pretty quickly which I LOVE!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this hair dryer has a cold setting which helps to keep my curls from being frizzy.  My last hair dryer did not have a cold setting but just a freeze type button.  I actually wore out the button so I needed to purchase a new hair dryer.  I like that this dryer does not have a flimsy, lightweight feel. I also love that it is black with pink accents.  I am very glad I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> The entire body of this dryer is a matte, somewhat grippy plastic. Really smart feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else is fine. Buttons, weight, loudness. No issues at all. It dries hair and doesn&#x27;t blow out eardrums or melt cartilage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t write about the long-term reliability, because I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of weeks. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer!  I have purchased the same one in the past.  The rocker buttons make it easy to change speed and heat settings. It has three heat settings, a cooling button, and three speeds. The ionic dryer keeps my hair from being frizzy. It is very light weight for a regualar size dryer.</li>
    <li> I had an old Conair for about fifteen years and it finally short circuited.  I have very short hair, so I could go a while without one, but it started to get serious after about a month.  So of course I went to Amazon and started looking around.  I also purchased a Remington Flat Iron (same reason) and I have found Remington to be a great product.  This dryer has multiple settings and heat controls and this particular one comes with attachments, which is great for the days I want different styles.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hairdryer. It works really well for my thick, wavy hair. It doesn&#x27;t take too long to blow-dry my hair with it. I am 23 and was living with my mom for awhile when I bought this hair dryer. She also fell in love with it and was very sad when I decided to move out because I took the hair dryer with me, so this is all she wanted for her birthday. :)&lt;br /&gt;Buy this hair dryer! It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> this is a good hair dryer. it is what I expected. it has 3 different level to choose and it drys hair fast. I use it every day and it is really light, so my hand wont be tired. recommend it</li>
    <li> Great product, have had it for about a month now.  Seems well-made, love the soft coating, plenty of power, cool-touch button works well.  Only one slight negative... the placement of the temp. switch is right where my fingers fall on the handle and I always turn it to medium instead of hot heat, but a minor consideration overall. Got this with an on-line coupon which made it an even better value!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy and smells faintly of burning something, but overall it&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s not so bad that i want to return it. I just wish it were lighter, I guess!</li>
    <li> Not such a screaming hair dryer as most other hair dryer&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used. This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Works great! This is my 2nd one because I dropped my 1st too many times.&lt;br /&gt;Has 3 heat settings so you can do super hot if you&#x27;re in a hurry and hot when you aren&#x27;t as much. Air flow is very powerful, but won&#x27;t blow you out of the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I have very long and thick hair, it used to take up to an hour to dry my hair with my old dryer.  This is fast and works great.</li>
    <li> The best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Ever.  I could go on and on about all the great features, how powerful it is, and even how great it looks but the best feature, for me, is the non-slip exterior.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times my old blow dryers went crashing to the floor due to their slippery casings, but the texturized exterior on this dryer allows me to get a good grip r - and keep that grip - throughout the entire drying process.  The best!</li>
    <li> I saw other reviews talk about it being super powerful.  I don&#x27;t find that, but it&#x27;s quite adequate.  It IS heavy and big, but I&#x27;m ok with it, and I&#x27;m tiny.  I don&#x27;t see how a dryer can be not heavy if it has good vibration damping and noise muffling, which this does.  I love the low noise level, as it is right by my ear, I&#x27;ve had enough of the loud flimsy light dryers in the past.  The only annoying thing is the buttons on the handle.  I have to be very careful when I move it around my head, it&#x27;s easy to touch the buttons and change the settings unintentionally.  Also the head is LONG; I have long hair too, and I&#x27;m a tiny person.  Sometimes I grasp the blower part like pros do in salons, thank goodness for its low vibration.  Just that the beautiful silk finish gets oily from my hand that way.  Oh well, still a great dryer overall.  I&#x27;ve had it a year already.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with this hair dryer for about three months ... And then it started shorting out. Seriously? Three months? It&#x27;s now been another ten months and it&#x27;s still working, but very poorly. I didn&#x27;t realize how bad it was until I went to visit my sister recently and forgot the dryer. I had to use her&#x27;s and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference. Her 3-yr-old Babyliss dried my hair in half the time and it looked worlds better, smoother and shinier. Never again, cheap hair dryers, never again.</li>
    <li> I got it on time and immediately had to try it out. It works wonders. I love how my hair feels after using it. And shipping was awesome. Def. recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase for the price.  The hairdryer is powerful and heats up quickly and the concentrator nozzle is just the right size for drying your hair with a barrel brush.  I also like the look and feel of it - the coating on the handle makes it easy to grip.  The only con is a very minor one (and why I rate this as 4 stars) is that it&#x27;s a little heavier than previous hairdryers which I&#x27;ve owned but this wouldn&#x27;t put me off purchasing this model again.</li>
    <li> This is a good dryer.  Quiet, good heat.  It is easy to hold in the hand. and I like it</li>
    <li> Love the multiple heat and speed settings.  After 3 months though, I have noticed that some air leak out from the base of the handle, where it meets the cord.  Maybe the plastic fitting became loose from hanging the hair dryer on a hook.</li>
    <li> A really good hair dryer for the price. I&#x27;m really surprised at how much of a difference a good hair dryer is compared to a bad one.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have had it for years and it still works great. Drys my hair in no time at all.</li>
    <li> i had a remington that i bought in 2000. it lasted me all these years. then i got lazy about cleaning out the back of it and pop bang, it blew up one day. everyone that has every used that old hair dryer really marvelled at how hot it blew, which is important in a hair dryer to get volume in your hair, etc. so when it blew, i tried to find the exact same hairdryer. apparently they stopped making the vortex in 2001 or so. i found a really ancient original web page that was barely interactive from the internet&#x27;s infanthood that had some silly story about a teenage girl, but no hair dryers for sale. darn it. so then i found this current model of remingtons. let me tell you, same heat, same cool shot, same accessories. this one is heavier, but not a deal breaker for me. this one also has extra stuff like pearlized pink grate on the end (some kind of temperature helper or something) and having a kind of velvety rubber texture to keep it from sliding on the counter. but who cares about that. it is very hot, and it can also go very cold, and that is what i was looking for, and it delivered.</li>
    <li> Great dryer for the price!  It&#x27;s solidly built, it gets nice and hot, and has good airflow.  It&#x27;s even cute!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars is because it&#x27;s pretty heavy, which could be difficult for some people.</li>
    <li> i bought this as a gift for my friend and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!  I have never had a blow dryer so powerful that has so many settings.  I like that you can have the same blow power with the cool setting without holding down a button.  Love it!  Great price for great quality!!</li>
    <li> Great price and coality! Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. Cut hair drying time nearly in half. Only issue is the cord is a bit short.</li>
    <li> My Sister got one for Christmas and I borrowed it from her.....fell in love with it! My hair is thick and it dries in less time than my other one.</li>
    <li> super sleek looking.&lt;br /&gt;works great!&lt;br /&gt;cold air gives out cold air n hot gives out hot. if you know what i mean. not like those hair dryers that give warm air when you want cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good investment</li>
    <li> It feels really well made and the heat levels are great. I have really long hair and every now and then, a bit of my hair gets caught in the back of the dryer but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
    <li> After reading TONS of reviews and looking at dozens of different hair dryers, I settled on this one because of the price and the great reviews. I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. My old hair dryer was going on 4 years old and was starting to get really picky about whether or not it wanted to blow hot air (it would take forever to get hot). I decided to replace it but wanted a dryer that would work well with my hair type. I have medium-length curly/wavy hair that gets really dry and frizzy, especially during the winter and during humid summer months. With my old dryer, I would have to blow dry my hair straight and then tackle it with a flat iron, the next day I would often need to touch-up again with the flat iron. With this Remington I can blow dry my hair straight with a large round brush in half the time, no flat iron touch-ups needed, immediately after OR the next day! My only complaint is that the High setting can get brutally hot. The diffuser also leaves a little something to be desired, but I can purchase a separate one if need be.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase and I hope this hair dryer lasts me at least a few years. Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> I like that it feels really powerful and I think my hair dries faster when I use it than it did with my other hair dryer. I don&#x27;t notice the softness in my hair from the crushed pearls though. It&#x27;s still a great hairdryer. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> So far ,so  good. Only used this four times but it worked great. It has many heat seating and a few attachments that are useful .The  price is great too.</li>
    <li> My old hair dryer died a rather spectacular death with sparks and smoke.  I hadn&#x27;t researched hair dryers before, and I only wanted something that would dry my hair.  So I randomly picked a conair from a local store.  I used it a few times and was not happy with the results for the conair.  It turned out to be loud as all get out, and my hair turned out flat.  I felt like I was in a deafening windstorm.  So now I had a criteria for research:  Something that was quiet and didn&#x27;t blow my hair into a limp state.  That&#x27;s what lead me to this Remington.  It shipped and got here quickly.  Yes, it smelled a bit funny as all new hair appliances do when first used, but I was impressed.  It was easy to handle.  I liked that I didn&#x27;t have to keep sliding buttons up and down to change settings like my old hair dryer.  It was relatively quiet as hair dryers go.  The drying process went very quickly.  My hair had plenty of volume with a smooth, soft feeling when all was said and done.  I&#x27;m very happy.  No flat hair and my ears aren&#x27;t ringing.  I highly recommend the Remington hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer is heavier than I thought it would be. The fan doesn&#x27;t blow very hard. I would not recommend this for someone with thick hair as the fan isn&#x27;t strong and it would take forever to -your hair.</li>
    <li> My beloved Parlux ended up with a frayed, damaged cord (my fault) after eight years and instead of dropping another $180 on a hair dryer, I thought I&#x27;d try a cheap one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: The highest heat setting is nice and hot. You get not only the cocentrator  nozzle but a diffuser as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: placement of the speed/heat settings is awful. I am constantly switching things accidentally while drying my hair. The power is also very underwhelming. Takes forever to dry my hair. I guess I&#x27;ve been spoiled by my Parlux all of these years.</li>
    <li> Very affordable hair dryer. Came in on time. Its a very powerful dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the color and its a bit heavy.</li>
    <li> Hardest blowing hair dryer for the price.  This is the second one we bought. Works great!  Can&#x27;t go wrong. x</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It fits well in my hand.  Drys my hair beautifully and quickly.  I have fine hair and this dryer is not &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34;.  It has several speeds and heat options.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> By far better than all other hair dryers I&#x27;ve tried.  I love that it has 3 settings for heat and 3 settings for the speed.  My last hair dryer didn&#x27;t have speed settings and since I have very fine hair it blew it everywhere!  This hairdryer is great and dries my hair super fast!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great. It is very strong! It has plenty of settings too. The finish on it makes it easy to hold and use, very comfortable. Liked it so much I bought the wand from the pearl collection too. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair dryer.  It has great velocity and dries my fine, shoulder length hair in slightly less than 4 minutes.  It&#x27;s a bit heavier than my last hair dryer, but guess I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
    <li> This dryer was recommend to me and works as suggested. Dries fast and is efficient. I like it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> blow dryer works great.  I have curly/wavy looong hair and the attatchments let me blow dry straight, wavy or super curly.  It&#x27;s very powerful and leaves hair pretty shiny... just add some serum to finish. The best part for me is that the cool setting is actually cool.  Works great to set hair at the end of a blow dry.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement blow dryer for my old Remington that died. I love love love it!! It has great drying speed and works great!! Remington is a great brand!</li>
    <li> At this point I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for over a year. I don&#x27;t have any complaints it&#x27; works well. I blow dry my hair about 5 days a week.</li>
    <li> Thie texture on this dryer feels nice, but it&#x27;s much heavier than my last one. It hasn&#x27;t gotten &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; as some have noted, but I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks. It comes with a tiny diffuser, which was good, because my diffuser doesn&#x27;t fit it. I wish I could get a larger one, but I&#x27;ll have to look at an after market one - I&#x27;ll probably have to take the dryer with me to make sure it will stay on. The dryer is pretty quiet and powerful, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I would change is the location of the buttons. I never fail to change the speed or heat when I&#x27;m using it. I use a stronger grip on it due to the weight, so it&#x27;s easier for me to hit a button on accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; recommend it, but I would suggest to keep looking a little bit more.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer the wife is very happy. I went with this one because it had many reviews and seemed popular</li>
    <li> Product was purchased to blow dry my dog&#x27;s hair because his doggy towels don&#x27;t fully dry him thus I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good but could have one option faster, but the rest work great for person how doesn&#x27;t has a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> This dryer has plenty of power and is not too loud. Haven&#x27;t used it alot yet but so far I really like it.</li>
    <li> Works well but both of us frequently turn of the hair dryer by accident because of knob placement..</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she has no idea how much I paid for this item. She raves over how simple and efficient this blow dryer is. Her only wish is if it had a collapsable arm for easy storage.</li>
    <li> Kept looking at different ones and finally decided on this one. I have hair I blow straight everyday so I need something that will last and so far no complaints on this one. Good output and a nice weight.</li>
    <li> I have owned this now for 2 years. Its by far the best hairdryer i have ever had.</li>
    <li> Bought this after my previous hairdryer finally died. I love that you can adjust to 3 heat settings plus the cool shot -- my previous dryer only had 2 settings plus the cool shot button. But this dryer, on the lowest heat setting, it&#x27;s basically blowing room temperature air, which I&#x27;ve been using when my hair is mostly dry and it keeps my (normally frizzy, wavy) hair pretty straight and much less frizzy than before.</li>
    <li> This works well.Very gentle and it makes my hair smooth.Bought it for a few months and works well.</li>
    <li> This hair drier is probably more than I needed - it&#x27;s a bit heavy to hold, and has an attachment I&#x27;ll never need for short hair.  Sorry I didn&#x27;t look more before I purchased it.</li>
    <li> A lot of power.  Heavier than some hair dryers that I have previously owned.  Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like it to, but still styles your hair effectively.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVEEEEEE this hair dryer. It&#x27;s amazing, my hair feels shiny, super soft and gorgeous after drying.&lt;br /&gt;PROs: Doesn&#x27;t damage hair if you use a heat protectant (like tressemme)&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels soft and shiny&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy and well built&lt;br /&gt;3 speed and 3 heat settings are super useful. Cool shot is great for locking the style at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs: Very heavy&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it really cuts drying time&lt;br /&gt;Not dual voltage&lt;br /&gt;Hottest setting is too hot and really useless</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good one for it has a larger wind speed and cooler setting.</li>
    <li> Strong hair dryer, it&#x27;s a little more pink that I expected but hey, I&#x27;m comfortable with myself so why not? Haha!</li>
    <li> What is not immediately discernible from the supplied photos is that the intake bezel and control buttons are all molded in bright pink pearl-colored plastic. That, and the fact that the box is printed in a all-over floral pattern tells me that this item is targeted toward the women&#x27;s market. I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is very heavy and difficult to hold with one hand. I didn&#x27;t notice anything special about the way it dries my hair. Other, cheaper hairdryers work just as well or better.</li>
    <li> Works well, dries my hair fast, and a good deal. A bit heavy, but totally manageable.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the performance and build of this dryer. For that it gets five stars. However I wish I had read beforehand what color it was. From the picture I thought the dryer was black. Instead it&#x27;s a very deep purple with pink power and temperature buttons. The front grill and the rear plastic fitting are also pink as well as the little insignia on the side. So if deep purple and pink are your colors then I recommend you go for it. It does dry your hair in record breaking time which is the biggest plus for a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Broke after one year. Just like my girlfriends heart. She hardly used it. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it so far. Very strong blowing unlike some of the other dryers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality lower priced hairdryer. If you want better than your average conair at Target, this is it. Definitely a step up. However, I have since moved up to the Babyliss dryers in the $50-$60 range, and have to say...huge difference and I will never go back! They are amazing. But if you are limited by this price, it is a great dryer.</li>
    <li> COLOR: from the picture some parts seem &amp;#34;champagne to me, but they are pink. If it&#x27;s for me only it&#x27;s ok, but seeing my husband using this pinky thing, it&#x27;s strange. RUBBER-TOUCH: nowhere says it&#x27;s rubber-touch but it seems so to me. I hope it will be OK, the reason I bought this new hair dryer is becausue after some years my old one (rubber-touch) melts little bit and gets sticky (I&#x27;m in florida).</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my roommate. She likes it. It is quiet, not too heavy, &amp; dries quickly. She stated that it was a bit large, but she was previously using a travel size as her everyday dryer.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife because her cheap hairdryer was extremely loud and woke me up.  This one is awesome.  Super quiet and she loves it.  It is quiet enough that we can actually talk while she drys her hair.  That would never have happened with the old dryer.  She says it takes about 5 minutes longer to dry her hair, but that is because she only uses it on medium heat.  High heat is very hot and she is afraid it will hurt her hair.</li>
    <li> nothing to complain about</li>
    <li> I love the amount of air it produces and the multiple heat and blow settings!</li>
    <li> Everything was great for about 6 month, the it stop working, why they keep selling a product that only last 6 months?, Better to take them from the market entirely and replace it with on that works longer even id it is more expensive.  One thing is certain, I will not buy a Remington drier ever!!</li>
    <li> My husband insisted I search for a new, QUIET hairdryer and I chose this one based on all of the reviews. In comparison to the last few hairdryers I have had it is incredibly quiet and it is also very powerful. I have very thick hair that usually takes around 20 minutes to get dry and this has done it in half the time. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I never realized there was a big difference between blow dryers until I got this one. I love it. I actually blow dry my hair more often now because it&#x27;s pretty quick with this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> It died (no hot air) after less than a month of use.  Cannot find the address as to where to return it either.  Very FRUSTRATING!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite hair dryer ever. It dries my hair very fast since it&#x27;s ceramic. I love the styling options and my hair gets a lot of volume.</li>
    <li> Sadly I lost the added pieces to it, but I still love this hair dryer. It dries my hair quickly and the multiple settings help me make sure I don&#x27;t accidentally burn my scalp, even with the distance I keep a hair dryer from my scalp most would scald my skin.</li>
    <li> Quiet, dries hair quickly</li>
    <li> Great dryer, relatively quite, but heavy.</li>
    <li> Quiet and fairly light. dries nicely without scorching. The pink hue on the buttons and filter housing was a surprise, as it didn&#x27;t really show up in the photo, but , hey, it&#x27;s just a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, who has long, brunette curly hair.  She blow dries her hair every morning with a diffuser.  I bought this to replace her current Conair dryer from Target which is on its way out.  Unfortunately, the diffuser with this blow dryer is very small (just under 4 inches in diameter).  She dried her hair once with the unit and said it had to go back due to the small diffuser and that it took too long to dry her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the positive, she said it was quieter than the Conair unit it was supposed to replace.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th time I&#x27;ve bought this dryer over the course of a several years. It does fail at some point, but at the constant daily use it gets. Still very worth the price, it&#x27;s quite powerful and puts out more heat and airflow than others I&#x27;ve used. Very happy with it overall!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the dryer.  It&#x27;s a little heavier than my last one, but does a great job. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I gave this product five stars because it has three temp settings, cool, medium, and hot, as well as two drying settings, medium and high.  Unlike cheap hair dryers, this one is sturdy.  It is heavier than average because it has a better motor than average, but the positive effect is that it dries hair without drying it out. The end result is soft hair.  I love the cool setting so that you don&#x27;t have to finish with a hot head.  The sound is different too -- more of a loud hum -- It doesn&#x27;t have the loud, shrill sound of a cheaper hair dryer.  I recommend this hair dryer to anyone who cares about taking good care of their hair.</li>
    <li> very disappointed- i have bought this exact product about 5-6 times over the last 8 years- it was awesome- great heat great weight attractive-etc. but the last 2 i ordered from amazon the plug in design changed and it fits to loosely into the wall socket- and sparks- which is scary- i love the hair dyer itself- but the new design of the plug in is faulty- what can be done?????</li>
    <li> Standard hair dryer.  Not the &amp;#34;best I&#x27;ve ever owned&amp;#34; but it gets the job done.  I really like the no slip finish.  It has not fallen on the floor like others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I was on the market for a new blow dryer once I realized how much time I was spending on my hair in the morning - pretty ridiculous.  I have curly hair so I usually blow dry then flat iron with my Chi Turbo EVERY morning.  This takes between 30 - 45 minutes depending on how good of a job I do.  My hair dryer at the time seemed OK, but it&#x27;s like it wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough and wasn&#x27;t strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t looking for a specifc brand, just something good that was under $50.  Read reviews on a bunch of dryers and decided on this one.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and really like it.  It&#x27;s much stronger than my previous blow dryer and I like that there are settings for cool, warm, and hot air.  My old blow dryer (also a remington, by chance) just had a cool shot button which was a pain to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blow dryer dries my hair MUCH faster so, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, this was a good purchase and worth the money.  It&#x27;s also a lot cheaper on Amazon compared to a few other stores that I&#x27;ve seen it at.  It&#x27;s a bit heavier than my old dryer, but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  Hey, anything that works my arms while I dry my hair is great multi-tasking and fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint has to do with the setting buttons.  They&#x27;re not the kind that you slide up and down, but are ones that you click by pushing sooooo for the first week I kept turning the dryer to a lower  setting or turning off or turning on the cool air because I kept clicking the buttons by accident.  I&#x27;ve gotten a little better, but still occasionally hit the buttons.  Definitely a design flar they should work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  I just hope it lasts for a while.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is decent.  It is quieter than my previous hair dryer, but I wish it was a little quieter, especially since being quiet is supposed to be one of it&#x27;s key features.  I love whatever material it is made of.  Whatever it is made from isn&#x27;t a slick plastic, so it doesn&#x27;t slip around in your hands or on the counter, which is nice.  I would say it is right in the middle as far as weight goes, so if you need a light hair dryer, this is not for you, but it&#x27;s not so heavy that I feel like I am getting a workout.  I also do not feel that it dried my hair any faster than my previous hair dryers. So, it&#x27;s not a bad hair dryer, but it&#x27;s also not all that special.  I would recommend it to others if it is on an AWESOME sale, otherwise, try something else.</li>
    <li> The only thing I do not like about this product is the shut off, when you are holding the blow dryer I tend to shut it off.  The position the button is should be readjusted.  Other than that i have no issues and like the way it dries.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! It has more settings than I am used to. I love the adapter pieces. I styled it with the styling tip and it looked like I got my hair done at the salon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer as a Christmas present and she loves it. The dryer warms instantly, looks great (the matte black....although the pink accent isn&#x27;t my color), does a great job, and even has little rubber spots on the side, so that it doesn&#x27;t slip (nice touch). It also has a removable filter that can be cleaned. For the price, I can&#x27;t complain. I would definitely recommend this to others, as it does a great job at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Just as fast drying as promised.  Glad for the force choices.  The high speed seems to tangle my straight bob</li>
    <li> for the price, this is a good product.  i have long, thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry with this one.  my only complaint is that the diffuser is pretty small.  otherwise, it&#x27;s a good dryer.</li>
    <li> I need to go and find the corresponding round barrel brush to use with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lighter and quieter than all previous hairdryers I have ever owned and still works better.  By better I mean both dries faster and leaves my hair less frizzy than previous dryers.  I have very dark, very thick hair and I need to put extra effort into keeping it hydrated and this dryer is a real help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it is one of the few hairdryers that DOES NOT send my pug flying off the bed in terror.  There are multiple fan and temperature settings and I find that I have not needed to use the max of either of those, even with my thick hair.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and IF it dies (other reviewers have said it has lasted them a long time) I will look to buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments that it came with are also sturdy, easy to use, look good with the hairdryer and are helping me to try new things with my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually dry my hair very often but mine broke so I bought this one as an update.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very heavy, works great. Love that it has the 3 different temperature settings. Works very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old worn out hairdryer.  I like the size and feel of the hairdryer.  It has several different settings to get the right amount of heat and airflow.  I have curly hair and hairdryers can make a difference in the frizziness of my curls.  This hairdryer dries my hair very nicely with no frizz.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned. It is fast, not too noisy and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer doesn&#x27;t function well after I used it for a month. It just suddenly became so hot and the wind was not as strong as before. Also it is a little bit heavy.</li>
    <li> It blows.  Hot.  Really well.  Amazing stamina.  Plug it in and it never stops.  Not expensive.</li>
    <li> Just started using this, but so far so good. It is much heavier than my previous hair dryer. Could be a problem for someone who spends a long time drying and styling hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for its price! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great dryer I Rate it up there with the most expensive dryers</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how close to death my old dryer had gotten until this one arrived. It dries my hair much more quickly and although it isn&#x27;t quiet it&#x27;s a much more tolerable noise than the whine my old one had developed. It is a bit heavy, but I like that...makes it feel sturdy and well made. The finish is nice too...kind of velvety. I definitely recommend this dryer!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing hair dryer for this money. Nice design, comfortable handle. It has exceeded my expectations. Love it!</li>
    <li> El producto es excelente, de muy buena calidad, Entregado en perfectas condiciones. Envio rapido y oportuno.  Recomenendado 100 % .</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate, it works perfectly. Very fast.  .  .  .  .  .  .. .. . . . . . .</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is awesome, The price is great and it has serious power on the top settings, you have to be careful not to burn your face, i have short hair and my whole head is dry in under a min on the max settings. Looks good and feels nice in your hands, not to heavy. My girlfriend loves it</li>
    <li> I have used this for a couple of weeks now and am very pleased with this hair dryer.  It was not overly expensive and works very well, quickly drying the hair.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hair dryer. The fan blows very strong, the heat is good, and the item is solid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in this dryer. The heat does not seem to change no matter what setting it&#x27;s on and the high setting blows too hard - the low - too low. It&#x27;s just not what I had hoped it would be</li>
    <li> A top tier home hair dryer.  It has all the features:  More heat, at 1875 watts  ---  Salon quality motor - up to 40% more air flow and three times the service life  ---  Ceramic pearl technology (Ceramics for even heating, and infused with crushed pearls which transfer to hair)  ---  Ionic generator to bathe hair with positive ions  ---  Concentrator and diffuser blower attachments  ---  Three heat settings, two fan speeds, and a cool shot feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use hair dryers.  My wife does, and when she broke her old Remington T/Studio, she would have nothing but another T/Studio as a replacement.  By the way, this dryer has a 4 year warranty, so keep your receipt.  (In our case, the dryer was about 2 years old but we no longer had the receipt, and the breakage was due to her dropping it and the fan speed switch physically broke . . . so I appropriated the old dryer, wired the fan speed to permanent \\&quot;high\\&quot; and the old hair dryer now resides in my workbench to serve as my hot air gun when I need one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not cheap, but a very high end dryer and worth the price for us.  By the way, the Amazon price was by far the best we could find at the time we bought this replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she really likes it, she says it&#x27;s the best hair dryer she has ever used in her life.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other reviews indicating that it would dry my hair faster. They say 40% faster and I suppose that&#x27;s accurate - 40% faster is really not as big of a difference as you would expect. It&#x27;s also incredibly heavy considering there&#x27;s not much difference between this and your usual hairdryer. If you want a good workout every morning though, then definitely get it!</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had! It has lasted me so long and is still so powerful!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I absolutely love the hair straightener in this collection but this hair dryer was not good. Left my hair frizzy and gross. I am waiting for a different hair dryer to come in and as soon as it does I will be returning this one.</li>
    <li> I ordered thursday night I received Friday night. comparing its price, I really suprised from its quality. It is pleasant to touch its surface and it works very well. I am really oversatisfied. touch wood!! I hope I wont have a trouble in coming days.</li>
    <li> Careful, gentlemen.  The picture online and on the box shows it has silver trim, but it&#x27;s actually bright pink trim (switches, filter cover, ect.).  Has a narrow mouth with a penetrating stream that&#x27;s probably better for long thick hair than short hair.  Heavier than expected too.</li>
    <li> I had a previous similar model for many years and needed repl, this one is great! best price on net.</li>
    <li> liked the heat and strength bottons. only &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; is that the dryer is a little heavy, if you are using it for straightning</li>
    <li> This dryer is quiet and fast!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair. It&#x27;s waist length, and thick. I used a plastic Conair Ion Shine 1875 hair dryer prior to buying this one. I could dry my hair with the Conair in maybe 15-20min. With the Remington, I can dry my hair in 5-10min! As for the less frizz the pearl ceramic plate is supposed to deliver, I think my hair is less frizzier... I have no idea if this is because of that, or because this dryer can sustain heat and air flow well enough to straighten my hair better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are a bit off from the product image. The removable cap on the back of the dryer is a darker shade of pink, while the buttons and the ceramic plate are a lighter pink (but the product image&#x27;s pink is a lot lighter). The unit itself is a dark maroon or purple-ish sort of color. It&#x27;s not black. The material is not plastic. It has an interesting finish... smooth but doesn&#x27;t slide around on a marble countertop like plastic does). The entire hairdryer is a bit heavier than I&#x27;m used to, but it&#x27;s not too much of a big deal as long as you keep your hairdryer steady and you don&#x27;t swing it about. Since it dries my hair in just a few minutes, the weight really isn&#x27;t an issue. The cord is a decent length, but I use this at the sink, so I don&#x27;t need a very long cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the extra heat so I always have my heat set to the third level. The second level is probably better for finer hair. My hair is thick, so I like more heat. The first level is only slightly warm. It&#x27;s just slightly warmer than the cold shot setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the air speeds... I also like to use the highest setting. The second highest setting is just as fine, but if I&#x27;m in a rush, I blast the settings to dry my hair quickly. The air flow is very strong, so with finer hair, you&#x27;re probably better off at a lower setting here as well. I noticed that other reviews have said they actually keep the hairdryer about 8in from their head to avoid burns. Just to give you a better understanding of my hair, I use the highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in. So much hair, and I like it long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, hairdryer is heavy, but the heat and the air speed is fantastic for anyone with a lot of hair that&#x27;s thick and long. Saves me time in the morning when getting ready, and my hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy. Bonus points: After placing my order, I received this unit the next morning. I&#x27;m impressed with the Prime shipping speed with this one.highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in.

    <li> Love this hair dryer. For years, I had a terrible old dryer that wouldn&#x27;t die. When it finally did, I was worried that anything new I got would be junky like so many electronics these days. I have had this hair dryer for about a year now and still love it as much as I did the day I got it. It dries really fast without being too hot to damage my hair. It has a satiny finish that feels nice in your hand too.</li>
    <li> I am not very good at styling my hair but I find this dryer seems to be the correct temperature and has the directional stream going in the right direction.  Very easy to use.  I had used the dryer at my daughters and so decided to purchase it.  I would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This hair dryer died roughly 6 months after purchasing it.  I had had this same hair dryer for years.  It was a trooper.  I loved it.  It provided many a good hair day, despite rain and humidity.  When it emitted a sad puff of smoke and blew no more, I decided to buy the same model again, in hopes of similar performance and longevity.  However, it&#x27;s replacement has been a major disappointment.  It died a short 6 months after being welcomed into our family, so I will be switching to a new model in hopes of greater longevity.</li>
    <li> Really good hair dryer. There are two things to watch out for:&lt;br /&gt;1. Hair dryer weight as this isn&#x27;t the lightest hair dryer I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;2. Color - Light pink details are more pink then the picture shows.Don&#x27;t expect &#x27;pearly pink&#x27; finishing it&#x27;s going to be a proper pink.&lt;br /&gt;In overall it&#x27;s a really good hair - dryer. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> My old Remington ProAir Ceramic just died and I purchased this as what I had hoped would be a suitable replacement. Not even close. The airflow is too forceful. Even on low this dryer whips my long straight hair into a tangled mess. The nozzle is too narrow so it further concentrates the airflow. The dryer is on the heavy side for it&#x27;s compact size..The high heat setting gets way too hot. Even low, once it heats up, seems excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> great so far -- It has great power and heat.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this hair dryer. She used to have two conairs and they were just awful. This one heats up instantly and blows hard lol.</li>
    <li> This dryer costs and weighs twice as much as my good old Conair dryer that lasted me 15 years, but works no better. I wish I bought something else. It is bulky, heavy and slow. Not sure why does the maker claim that the hair becomes shiny and silky because of their dryer. Mine did not get better a single bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5 months later: it slowed down substantially after 5 months in service.</li>
    <li> The finish is too slippery and the buttons are too close together. Also, it doesn&#x27;t put out the air I was hoping for. I have fine straight long hair and hate when it takes so long to dry my hair because the air output just isn&#x27;t what it use to be like on the older Remington dryers. I have always had great luck with Remington, but it&#x27;s like this.....if it&#x27;s not broke....don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
    <li> When the low-speed setting on my old hair dryer stopped working recently, I started browsing Amazon for a new dryer. I had my old Andis dryer for 4+ years and it was a good, dependable dryer but very heavy. My new dryer want list included lightweight, quiet, multiple speed and heat settings, AND under $30.00. Since the Remington seemed to have it all, that&#x27;s the one I chose. SO glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Remington for about a week now and I REALLY like it. It dries my hair super fast and leaves it very shiny. My hair is short, fine and dries fairly fast, but this dryer&#x27;s high setting is STRONG! I&#x27;m sure it would dry long, thick hair really fast too. The way the dryer is designed, I can hold it in my right hand and move the settings from hot to warm to cold with my thumb with NO problem and it is so lightweight my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired at all (which wasn&#x27;t the case with the Andis). This is the prettiest dryer I&#x27;ve ever seen. The photo on Amazon doesn&#x27;t do it justice. It has a soft black matt finish with a red pearl shimmer and soft pink trim. Whoever designed this hair dryer gets two-thumbs up for design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will report back in a few months and let you know how the dryer is holding up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It has been nine months now and the Remington dryer is still working great! I have absolutely no complaints about this dryer. Would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer was a good buy. I sent it to my sister and niece. They both have long, thick, curly hair and find the dryer strong enough to do the job comfortably. They tell me it was a good buy and they find it strong and a good performer.</li>
    <li> This dries my hair so much faster than my old hair dryer. It gets hot enough but not to hot and I love that you can change the temp settings on it. The cool blast button also works very good. The cord is long enough and it is not to loud. Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair out and make it frizzy at all either. Would definitely buy again, very pleased.</li>
    <li> I ordered this one because the one in the other bathroom has been a good hair dryer.  Now I have one wherever I need to finish my hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I looked at blow dryers online for months before making this purchase, some costing hundreds of dollars.  On my wish list was a dryer with a salon quality motor for durability, variable heat and speed settings, ceramic, and ionic.  This dryer checks all the boxes.  The reason I give it four stars rather than five is because there is no ionic on-off switch (ionic on for smoothness, off for greater volume).  I was surprised and pleased to learn that this dryer carries a four-year warranty.  Many of the high-priced dryers had only a one or two year warranty.</li>
    <li> Great dryer. Not as heavy as I thought it would be and the diffuser attachment is a plus as well. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is easy to use and has lots of power. The rubberized texture is easy to grip and hold.</li>
    <li> Great dryer.  I use attachment so my hair doesn&#x27;t blow all over place. Dries hair quick! Looks good. Hope it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other hairdryer that I have used before</li>
    <li> My girl ONLY wanted this hair dryer to replace the same one that just died.  Found it here on Amazon FAR cheaper than anywhere else and with Amazon Prime it was delivered to my doorstep in 2 days.  Great price and my girl loves it (she says it dries her thick hair fast and doesn&#x27;t dry her hair out in the process), so that&#x27;s it.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love Remington products!  This hair dryer has performed perfectly for the $20 I got it for on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I replaced my Conair Ion Shine after 7 years.  Regret not doing it sooner!&lt;br /&gt;My hair was frizzing and I thought it was because of my age!  Nope - my Conair was shot!&lt;br /&gt;So since the on/off switch broke on the Conair - I finally decided that was unsafe enough to warrant a new hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt; Plus I never like the switches on that dryer anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I love this Tstudio hair dryer.  It is not too loud - which is great if you suffer from hearing or headache issues.&lt;br /&gt;I love the color.  It is extremely attractive.  It is a dark chocolate brown with a pinky purple accent.  Goes nicely with my bathroom decor.  OH!  AND THE BEST PART!  It does not hurt my hands!  It is ergonomic!  I feels like a dream!  It is a perfect fit in my palm and I don&#x27;t feel the switches are in the way at all.  I found that I naturally held the dryer so the thumb was grasping along the length of the switches which is perfect!  So excited about that part!&lt;br /&gt;Was going to buy the BaBlyss (sp?) but when I checked that out on YouTube, I intensely disliked the noise of it.&lt;br /&gt;So - Remington it is!  I hope that I get at least 3 or 4 years out of it and I will be an extremely happy customer.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Dries my waist-length straight hair faster than any other hair dryer I have used. (Will an expensive hair dryer do better? Probably, but for the price this exceeded my expectations.)&lt;br /&gt;-Multiple heat/speed/cool settings - hot is really hot and cold really cold.&lt;br /&gt;-Comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;-Relatively quiet&lt;br /&gt;-Diffuser and concentrator accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Sometimes I hit the setting buttons accidentally while using it.</li>
    <li> This product arived on time and is a very powerful dryer for the price, all the pieces are very sturdy as well, what I did not like was that in the picture the pieces looked white, which was my main reason for the purchase, but the pieces  obviously pink up close.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what I need it to, it&#x27;s really quiet which is nice, but still does it&#x27;s job. Quick drying process and I have notoriously hard to dry hair, so I&#x27;m please with this purchase. It doesn&#x27;t get too hot like other dryers I haven&#x27;t had any issues with burning myself by staying on one spot too long.</li>
    <li> Good hairdryer for the price. Quieter than others I have used in the past.  Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I mean it works well. I just wish they&#x27;d label this as PINK AND BROWN.</li>
    <li> Quiet, excellent drying, doesn&#x27;t get dangerously hot.</li>
    <li> The fan speed is stable and fast!&lt;br /&gt;3 temperature selection is very useful, neither too cold nor too hot for me with short hair~~&lt;br /&gt;Highly reommend!</li>
    <li> Bought as a replacement for the previous version of this dryer because it finally stopped working after more than 5 years, but I was disappointed when I received it because the power cord is way too short and the power itself is not nearly as strong as the previous model. It&#x27;ll work for now but I would definitely not buy it again.</li>
    <li> work as what it was intended to do. Drys hair!</li>
    <li> Good Hair Dryer.  Nice weight, cord good length.  I just had to get used to the button location, it took a while for me to be able to dry my hair without accidentally hitting the off button accidentally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased far too many hair dryers ranging from the $20 bin at Ross all the way to $200 salon-quality dryers and this one ranks among the very best.  I honestly thought it was just my frizzy hair or me using the wrong products -- but it was the dryers I had been using.  This one, paired with a good brush, leaves your hair looking and feeling silky.  And at the inexpensive price??  It&#x27;s a must-have dryer for anyone.</li>
    <li> Best I have had in a long time</li>
    <li> Great &amp; great color,very string. It&#x27;s my 2nd one. Second because I lost 1st one due to my house burning.</li>
    <li> This dryer dries my hair in almost half the time as my old one did. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works well but very heavy to hold.  I had my old dryer for at least 15 years and it was light so I was not used to holding such a heavy dryer.</li>
    <li> So, I like quiet, powerful hairdriers. My last one broke, and I ordered this one. It does what it needs to.</li>
    <li> My family of four have gone through a few hairdryers in our time. This is our second purchase of this hair dryer.  The last one lived way beyond my expectations.  It&#x27;s definitely durable.  But the high volume of air that it blows is the main reason our family loves this dryer.  We wouldn&#x27;t choose another one now.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is pretty, smooth, and makes my hair incredibly shiny, soft, smooth and frizz free. It dries my hair quicker than other hairdryers and is quieter too. Love it!</li>
    <li> Replacement for old one and still as good. Noise typical for most hair dryers with good air power.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer in 2013 and have used it almost every day since. It is by far the best hair dryer I have ever owned. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this hair dryer 5 stars is that it&#x27;s not as lightweight as I would prefer.  Otherwise, I love the fact that it has a very solid feeling and that there are so many settings to choose from.</li>
    <li> I love my new blowdryer!! I had my old one for about 10 years before it died on me, and I chose this one as my replacement. It is an amazing product!! In the 3 days I&#x27;ve used it, my hair is shinier, smoother, and looks overall much more healthy! It is lightweight, so my wrist doesn&#x27;t hurt while drying my hair, and it dries it very quickly. I have very long hair (almost to my waist) and I can dry my hair in under 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Her old dryer was on its last legs, and I got her  a new one for christmas, and she&#x27;s super happy</li>
    <li> This product is a fake, the dryer is not strong, the air comes out with little force and not enough heat, whatever the temperature my hair takes frizz quickly after using this dryer. Not recommended!!!</li>
    <li> For average to thin hair this is pretty awesome.  It&#x27;s not the hottest I&#x27;ve ever used but because it&#x27;s lighter than most I&#x27;ve had I can hold it longer easily.&lt;br /&gt;The toggle-buttons are awesome to operate with wet or slippery hands as opposed to those stupid sliding switches of other models.</li>
    <li> Dries my long hair in about 10 minutes</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer and it turned out to be a piece of junk.  It quit working after about 3 hair drying. I will&lt;br /&gt;L never buy this brand again. Too bad I don&#x27;t have the box to return it in.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer works great.  It never frizzes my hair and the temperature control settings are really nice! It is not too heavy and I can easily dry my long hair without getting a workout! I also really enjoy the color. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Great product, can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
    <li> Excelent product 100% true! Excelent product 100% true Excelent product 100% true Excelent product 100% true Excelent product 100% true Excelent product 100% true!. good</li>
    <li> When I am too lazy to go out or if I am just being cheap, I need a blow dryer to save me money from going to a salon and paying $60.  I love the 3 heat settings this one has, my last dryer did not have that.  The only bad thing about this dryer is that it is heavier than most.  But that isn&#x27;t really a problem for me.</li>
    <li> It shoots sparks fairly often. Kind of scary.</li>
    <li> i love this blow dryer. it&#x27;s so quiet and it does an outstanding job. :) my friend had lended me hers and i loved it so i went out and purchase one of my own.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an Ionic drier because of how quick it manages my medium length hair. I wasn&#x27;t worried about compact or travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels heavy enough to be quality, but not too heavy to use. The settings are good, although I expected a little more power from the high blower setting - but with the ionic tech it doesn&#x27;t need to blow harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool blast button doesn&#x27;t react as quickly as turning the heat setting to low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For function, it&#x27;s perfectly fine, no complaints with function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like which is a &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34;, is the soft matte finish.  It&#x27;s pretty when it&#x27;s new, but it gets scuffed and smudged with styling products and isn&#x27;t pretty.  I&#x27;m not one to clean my styling appliances so often but this one needs a wipe down more often than not. It&#x27;s not terrible, but I don&#x27;t like it, and it wasn&#x27;t an issue with my former drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many products out there which are comparable, it&#x27;s really hard to decide. I&#x27;m not &#x27;super excited&#x27;, but I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is awesome! Beautiful. The body of the dryer is nice a soft. Nice material used on it. And this dryer works very well. It&#x27;s just so sleek and fun to use. I would give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> This is definitely lighter than my last hair dryer. It is pretty quiet too. I wish the detachable nozzle went on easier &amp; was a little longer. My only complaint is regarding the length of the nozzle. They call it the &amp;#34;concentrator&amp;#34; attachment. When I am styling my bangs or blowing out my hair with a round brush - it makes the dryer too close to my head / hair and it makes styling more difficult.  My last hair dryer&#x27;s attachment was longer with an air flow vent - to keep the air from blasting you in the head. I guess this will take some getting used to. Other than that - seems to be good quality. The plus is that it does dry my hair faster and with less noise.</li>
    <li> Dryer is a bit heavier than I am used to but still manageable for blow outs. Dries thoroughly and has not dried out my hair. I like the difference in blowing strength and the hot air gets really hot, I usually use the medium heat setting. Really sleek looking design. Great replacement dryer. would buy again.</li>
    <li> great hair dryer, not that I have that much experience with them, but the ionic and ceramic features really make a positive difference.&lt;br /&gt;very quick to arrive and much appreciated!</li>
    <li> I had just purchased another hairdryer but need another for my daughter.  I got this because of features and having some pink.  It is fairly quiet, dries hair well but is crazy heavy.  I like my conair better.</li>
    <li> 4 STARS BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT BLOWDRYER, BUT THE ONLY CON IS THAT THE CORD IS KIND OF SHORT. IT IS VERY EFFICIENT AND BLOW DRIES MY HAIR SILKY SMOOTH AND SLEEK, IT COMES WITH SOME ACCESORIES AS WELL WHICH IS A PLUS SUCH AS A DIFUSER. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE FOR THE GREAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> i am completely satisfied, i have a long, strong, thick hair, and it works for me as good as  the proffessional blowers i used to have. I just hope it last. I like it very much. Good price, very light, even the colors of this hair blower are nice and they delivered on time. Thanks.</li>
    <li> To start I have medium length hair, just past my shoulders, and it is incredibly thick. It usually takes me about 30 minutes to dry my hair, even though it&#x27;s not terribly long. Today I used my Remington dryer for the first time and I was very please to find that it cut my hair drying time in half and was so much quieter than my old dryer. I have not tried many &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; dryers but I was very happy with this dryer. Are there better ones out there? Probably but also most likely cost more. I felt that this dryer was worth the price in which I paid for it. It also looks black in the picture but it is almost like a black/purple out of the box which I loved! If you&#x27;re looking for a strong dryer I would recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Within the first month of using this hair dryer, I thought I saw a spark that came out of the nozzle. The next time I used it the following day there were sparks coming out every few seconds and I am no longer able to use this hair dryer. I had this exact same model that I had for 6 years and it still works well but my puppy had chewed the cord which I then repaired with electrical tape and figured it was time to retire it.</li>
    <li> I love this. I have long, thick hair, and for me this did cut down my dry time almost in half. *Almost.* It doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as I would expect it to, but considering the job it does I don&#x27;t mind. I have no issues with either attachments, both have worked for straight and wavy styles for me. I also dig that it is not as loud as my old one.</li>
    <li> This dryer is absolutely awesome. The heat settings are exactly what I needed, and the force and speeds are great for volume and fast drying. Really worth the price.</li>
    <li> Nice hair dryer for the price, but it wasn&#x27;t anything special and seemed quite basic.  I didn&#x27;t feel as though my hair dried any faster or looked any different than the old basic hair dryer I&#x27;ve been using for the past 5 years or so.  I do like the color and the fact that the cord is quite a bit shorter than the cord on my old hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Daughter-in-law loves this!</li>
    <li> really love it , leaves the hair silky . I would buy again , though will see how long it lasts</li>
    <li> Purchased for my severely handicapped son and he is very well pleased with its quality and performance.</li>
    <li> The dryer arrived in good condition due to being carefully wrapped.  It was exactly as described.  The only thing I found that was&lt;br /&gt;a slight  negative is that it is heavier than I expected.</li>
    <li> Do not read the bad reviews about this hairdryer.  My current hairdryer crapped out on me and it was a $130 hairdryer.  It worked great but I currently don&#x27;t have another $130 to spend on a hairdryer so I found one I could buy on a budget with good reviews.  This hairdryer is great, equal to if not better than my expensive one.  Its powerful and dries my hair in no time with smooth results.  So if your on a budget and want a really good hairdryer look no further.  I am a hard one to please and very picky about what I use on my hair and I give this one 5 stars plus.  Get one, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It feels sturdy and works well. The air doesn&#x27;t come out as powerfully as my hairdryer before but it still get the job done pretty well. I like the 3 heat settings. The buttons are in a little bit of a weird place for me, when I hold it up while blowing my hair dry sometimes I accidentally hit the heat setting. There&#x27;s not a lot of open gripping space.</li>
    <li> Super cute to look at. Gets really hot real quick. A little big, so it won&#x27;t fit in a handbag comfortably. But over all hands down the best hair dryer i have owned (and I have owned a lot of them)</li>
    <li> My daughter enjoys using the powerful blower.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer. Exactly what I was looking for - controls for both the temperature and fan speed. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a really great hair dryer for the price. It&#x27;s sturdy and the settings are awesome. I don&#x27;t like to use a ton of heat when blow drying, so the medium/warm setting is perfect. The best part is the low/cool setting is actually cool! Most dryers are just warm. On top of that you can hit the cold button for extra. Love that. The air itself is pretty powerful, and it dries my hair pretty quickly (I have thick hair).    The only reasons I gave it 4 stars and not 5: the cord is a LITTLE short (but fine for in front of the mirror); it is SLIGHTLY heavy (but definitely sturdy), and I am used to hair dryers that can fold up (but I knew it didn&#x27;t before I bought it).    I actually liked it so much that I bought one for a friend, too.</li>
    <li> died on the 3rd day of use</li>
    <li> The hair dryer I received is trimmed in pink.  Sorry, but as a guy, that really doesn&#x27;t suit me.  (For those who like pink, this product may be for you.)  The pics on Amazon should have shown the pink trim more clearly.  In some of the Amazon site pics, the product seems to be trimmed in black.  Upon closer inspection of other Amazon pics, I do see the pink.  I suspect there are some trimmed in pink and some trimmed in at least one other color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try the dryer to see how it worked.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with its power, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those two reasons, I had no choice but to return the dryer.</li>
    <li> Not enough power for me.  It seemed like a great hair dryer and I liked that it was a ceramic one, but there is not enough power.  I have long, thick wavy hair that I blow dry all the time and I need something with more to it.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this blow dryer especially after all the great reviews. And I was happy when I pulled it out of the box. With practical items like these I am not so concerned with appearance (I would rather it work really well than be pretty) but this design is very appealing. It has a quieter, &amp;#34;lower&amp;#34; sound (no high pitch squeal like other blow dryers) and it&#x27;s a good weight, not too heavy but durable and not flimsy. I love the heat and the power settings as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However...the placement of the buttons is SO awkward! I am still trying to figure out how to comfortably hold this dryer so that my fingers aren&#x27;t hitting the control buttons. It&#x27;s not something to make me return this item, because it does work well. But be mindful, it is annoying. It might just be it has a Learning Curve...but it&#x27;s a blow dryer, there shouldn&#x27;t be a learning curve!</li>
    <li> This hair dyer works great and I have seen it for more money at local stores. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Liked the look of this hairdryer, and decided to try it out. I was hoping it would magically dry my hair faster...no luck. A little heavier than my old dryer but blows better. Still took the same amount of time tho.</li>
    <li> love it! heavy and durable hair dryer</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and I like how the top is long enough that my hair (I have mid-length hair) doesn&#x27;t get sucked into the back of it where the fan is. Buttons are easy to work with, better than those you have slide up and down.</li>
    <li> Love this. Giving it 4 stars because it is very heavy! However, everything else about it is great. Just heavy.</li>
    <li> The dryer has several good features, and I especially appreciate the cool setting and how the cool button delivers air with absolutely no heat at all.  Other dryers I&#x27;ve had have produced still slightly warm heat even when the cool button is used.  Not this one!!!!  The downside for this dryer is the diffuser attachment.  It is much too small and does not diffuse well enough to not have my fine 2 b/c wavy hair not blow all over.  Luckily I was able to use a diffuser attachment from my dryer that fried recently (prompting this purchase).  Otherwise I would have had to return this dryer, even as much as I&#x27;m loving the cool air feature.  Hence only a three star rating.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer at Target several years ago, and was SOOO impressed with the power, that I would randomly talk to people about my new hair dryer!!  I had long hair at the time, and it cut drying time down significantly.  Also left my waivy hair perfectly straight and silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think after a few years, the Ion starts to lose effectiveness (on all hair dryers I&#x27;ve ever had).  I had it for at least 4 years, before the back filter broke, and then my hair started getting sucked into the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried several different dryers, even expensive name brand ones like Babyliss, none that I really LOVED like this one.  I recently chopped my hair off, and am using a less powerful dryer.  But after realizing my love for this dryer, I went ahead and bought a second one, and have it put up in my closet, to use again once my hair grows back out, and I need that &#x27;power&#x27; to straighten and dry quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only CON is that is IS a bit heavy... after having no luck with lighter ones, I realize the weight is worth it.</li>
    <li> So heavy I felt like I was lifting weights. This went back the same day.</li>
    <li> After careful review I spent the extra cash to purchase this hair dryer. I&#x27;ve had it for just over a year and it suddenly quite the other day. I doubt Remington will do anything since it&#x27;s just past the one year mark. I feel appliances should last longer than a year. I&#x27;ve yet to see what Remington will or won&#x27;t do. I emailed them today though I&#x27;ve read they have substandard costumer service. I just bought a 16. Conair since I figure it&#x27;s going to break within 2 years anyway why spend the extra cash? It&#x27;s working great so far and is much quieter than the Remington and the air is softer so my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle while I style it. It also doesn&#x27;t get blazing hot. It&#x27;s easier to hold and it seems to be better for my hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> Works great and does dry very quickly.  My only complaint, and it bugs me daily, is that the switches are right where you have your fingers and they&#x27;re easy to flip so I am constantly turning it off/on while drying.  That&#x27;s annoying.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for ... 7? 8? years and it finally died. As in sparks flew out of it!! I ordered a newer version of the same dryer. Very pleased with it. Saw no reason to change.</li>
    <li> After using a $20 drug store pick up hairdryer for 3 years - this hairdryer blew me away! It is so much quicker and easier to dry my hair now and I have seen a huge improvement to frizz using this. It is sleek, feels powerful and has a good weight without being too heavy. I can&#x27;t get over the price and upgrade in quality from my previous dryer.</li>
    <li> to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected. The number of stars not complete because I have not completely exceeds my expectations</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!  It is quieter than my older Conair.  It has nice speed/temperature settings that blow dry quickly without as much damage. I can dry my below shoulder length hair with the medium heat/air setting in less than 10 minutes. My hair is soft and easy to style, plus attachments stay on tight. I will buy Remington from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a ceramic hair dryer before and I&#x27;m amazed at the quality and functionality of this one.  It provides a consistent heat and air flow.  It is heavier than other dryers I&#x27;ve owned and I was told that it is due to the ceramic.  This dryer is also much quieter than others I&#x27;ve used.  The benefits far outweigh a few ounces of extra weight.</li>
    <li> Powerful! A little heavy, but not bad. I can dry my hair in 10 mins, 15 if I want it to look nice. Definitely a great tool.</li>
    <li> Initially I really liked this hair dryer.  It worked well and ran quietly, but it suddenly stopped working.  While it worked fine yesterday, when I plugged it in this morning it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  Because I&#x27;ve owned it less than two months, I&#x27;ve requested a replacement through Amazon to give it another a try.</li>
    <li> I gave it as a Christmas present. It looks pretty nice, but she didn&#x27;t like it and asked me to exchange it for something else. She liked the look of it, confirmed It is less noisy than normal hair dryers, but simply took longer than normal hair dryer for her long hair.</li>
    <li> This dryer was really heavy.&lt;br /&gt;It hurts my arm when I drying my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;So I am using with dryer stand.&lt;br /&gt;The strength is good and sometimes it sparks.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and cute. That&#x27;s it!!</li>
    <li> The hairdryer functions fine .. as any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve met does .. the problem is that after 1week the matte finish on the plastic has started to peel like sunburned skin .. leaving behind a shiny/glossy finish .. which I wouldn&#x27;t mind at all but it looks awful in this molting stage .. I guess I should sit down for 30mins and work to peel it all off.. yeah like anyone has time for that ..</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is much more quiet than my previous hairdryer, which was an adjustable ionic hairdryer.  It has this interesting grippy material around the outside which is very attractive and comfortable to hold.  It is lightweight and has three temperature and three speed settings. I don&#x27;t think it gets super hot, which is good for me since I have fine hair and do not wish to dry it out.  My hair was incredibly soft after using this dryer.</li>
    <li> I had a really old hair dryer.  So this one to me is awesome!!  It&#x27;s not too noisy and it dries my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> Bought this particular item based on positive reviews from Amazon customers.&lt;br /&gt;Gave one to my daughter who thought it was quieter than her old dryer and dried her hair quick.&lt;br /&gt;Gave one to my mother who thought it was noisy and a bit heavy, but dried her hair very quick.&lt;br /&gt;(My mom is the pickiest person on earth....so take it with a grain of salt).&lt;br /&gt;Remington sells matching pink hairbrushes, which makes it really gifty.</li>
    <li> Perfecto estado, excelente producto. De veraz supero mis espectativas. Lo recomiendo a todos, espero la disfruten como yo. Buena opcion de compra.</li>
    <li> I really like this - dries my hair fast and not loud at all.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> soo much better than my last conair hair dryer (loud as hell and the heat was too hot)-this is the best hair dryer for my fine, thin asian hair! its also SO quiet. i will be buying this one again! comes with a diffuser.</li>
    <li> Love the diverse settings! Does a great job of drying my thick hair quicker than other dryers I have tried.</li>
    <li> Unless you want to pay a couple hundred $$$ for the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; hairdryer, this is perfect for everyday use without destroying your hair.</li>
    <li> A little heavy but works as expected. It dries my hair pretty fast. I do not notice it leaves my hair less frizzy or silky. I still have to use my straightener for it to look good. When I use it with a brush it is a different story. Overall I am happy with this hair dryer. I like that the cord is a little longer than usual. It is also of nice quality -does not look like cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> I finally bit the bullet and bought myself a new hairdryer.  I swear the one I had was probably 10 years old.  And it was finally giving out.  I searched Amazon for a well-reviewed dryer and found this one for a great price.  Obviously, after having come from using an old, cheap Conair dryer to using this new, better-brand dryer was a leap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;--Dries hair quickly&lt;br /&gt;--Comes with 2 attachments (a diffuser for curly/frizzy hair and another attachment that concentrates the air-flow coming out to straightening&lt;br /&gt;--You can take off the filter to clean it out when it gets gunked up with lint&lt;br /&gt;--The &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; on the dryer provided a nice grip&lt;br /&gt;--3 speeds and 4 temperature settings&lt;br /&gt;--Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--Wish it had a retractable cord</li>
    <li> This is without question the best hairdryer I have EVER had. I have alot of hair and it takes a LONG time to dry it......until now! This is a powerful hairdryer, great outer texture, lightweight. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Very heavy and bulky.  Does dry pretty quickly, but really can&#x27;t tell a big difference from previous dryer.  Not bad, but just okay.</li>
    <li> I like the hair dryer, it has a few good settings and it really does dry your hair fast.  Unfortunately when I was shopping for this I was looking for a hair dryer that had a nice wide diffuser.  Beware, this hair dryer is incorrectly advertised and the diffuser is actually much smaller with larger holes - not ideal!</li>
    <li> Good quality. Very pretty. Powerful. Only complaint is its kinda heavy so after a while it kinda hurts my hand. But I guess it&#x27;s not really a problem since it dries my hair pretty quick.</li>
    <li> I like it very much, for hair drying, it works very well. The two accessories are not so often used anyway.</li>
    <li> shonnila&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Product at an Excellent Price! The first time I used it my husband said my hair looked like it had a salon finish.....Love it!</li>
    <li> It is good quality for the money. Gets hot and has a fairly strong power. It meets all expectations. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Having used numerous blow dryers in my business, I have to say this has been one of my favorites for so many reasons. It&#x27;s lightweight and I can actually carry on a conversation with my clients without having to lower the speed...love the design! I highly recommend this product and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not as strong/powerful as I was hoping so I returned.</li>
    <li> Maybe we got a Monday ex, but the amount of vibration and noise was incredible, so we returned it. Sorry</li>
    <li> I love it. I like the matte finish and the color, dark purple. It has 3 heat settings, 4 if you count the cold blast button. and 2 strength settings.</li>
    <li> Not the best dryer I&#x27;ve used, it lasted a while &amp; then started to have a burnt smell.</li>
    <li> The electrical plug was unsteady from day one. Now, less than six weeks later the plug won&#x27;t stay in the outlet at all.  It has been a little over 30 days so I cannot return it to Amazon.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good slid dryer for a reasonable price. While not the cheapest it is solid and I&#x27;m confident it will hold up well over the years. What I really like is that it provides a wide range of temperature settings and independent blower speed control. While in use it does not get overly warm to hold.</li>
    <li> I bought this after trying a Remington dryer at a friend&#x27;s house.  I was so impressed with the speed and fluffiness of my hair that I just had to have one.  It was then that I learned that all hair dryers are not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Remington dryer dries my hair twice as fast as my old one and the attachment allows me to concentrate heat where I want it, so I don&#x27;t get the frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the professional version of my friend&#x27;s dryer.  It is noticeably heavier, and probably not necessary for a 2-person household.  On the other hand, it will probably last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s dark brown with light pink buttons, which is aesthetically pleasing, but had no real impact on my choosing this model.</li>
    <li> This item is pink and it is not clearly advertised as such.</li>
    <li> excellent product, works fine. recomended</li>
    <li> I have very long black hair.  The hair dryer driea my hair in minutes!  Now I have the collection of the curling wand, hair dryer, and straightener!</li>
    <li> This one taught me the error of my ways.  Power/ drying much better.  Sturdy construction and really nice texture. too - won&#x27;t slide off the counter.  Very much worth a bit more money to get a quality piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> I like the silky feel this hair dryer gives my hair.  I bought the same kind to replace an old one.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  I have really thick, corse hair and haven&#x27;t generally dried it much in the past because it would take so long.  Then once it was dry I&#x27;d have to straighten it because it would be all frizzy.  Not anymore!!!  This thing dries my hair quickly and also leaves it very smooth.  I LOVE it!  Now I dry my hair almost daily since it doesn&#x27;t take me an hour from start to finish!</li>
    <li> I researched several ionic ceramic hair dryers and ended up with this one and I am in love. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend more because this one gets the job done and you can keep some cash in your pocket. I have thick hair and if I were to let it air dry, it would have this ugly frizzy wave to it. I love that this hair dryer came with a concentrator and diffuser. I use the hair dryer by itself first and just finger through my hair with the setting on high speed and high heat to just get the excess water out and then throw on the concentrator and low dry with my ionic brush. I&#x27;m literally amazed at how fast I can dry my hair with this thing and I&#x27;m kicking myself for not getting one sooner.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  Thought it would have been more powerful.</li>
    <li> I recently upgraded my old dryer of 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;1. This was slightly heavier than I expected, only because my old one was super light weight. However, the weight is not noticeable other than that. The material of the dryer is pleasant to hold.&lt;br /&gt;2. Cute design with two optional add ons is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;3. Dries quickly! I can fully dry my thick shoulder length hair in 3-4 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;4. Much quieter than my old dryer.&lt;br /&gt;5. The only con, is that the buttons sometimes can be pushed when drying the hair because of the way they are positioned on the handle. So, if you do not have a mindful touch while blow drying, you may accidentally switch from high output to low output.</li>
    <li> Does what its suppose to do, like the ability to clean it.</li>
    <li> I love a sturdy and well built feeling product. This one falls into that category. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the on/off switch seems to be in a goofy place to me. If you do much styling and try to hold in one had while positioning your brush with the other (I am right handed so hold in my left while brush is in right) the silly thing shuts off EVERY time. Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer.  My hair is silky smooth using this.  The multiple heat settings are really  helpful and it dries my long fine hair very quickly.  Plus it is a great design.  Super happy!</li>
    <li> This is an OK hair dryer and I will keep it for now because of price, however, in comparison to my most recent Remington hair dryer (T-studio - purchased in a B&amp;M about 5 years ago) it is quite bad.  Normally I can go 2 days without washing my hair but this one, it feels greasy and weighed down by the first evening.  It takes a lot longer to dry as it doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough and it is just doesn&#x27;t have nearly the same power.  Plus it is EXTREMELY loud and heavy.  Not very good.  It dries my hair though and it doesn&#x27;t look completely horrifying.  3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  Returning this.  It is not how it is described. Maybe i got a defective product but it just did not get hot enough on the hottest setting and also did not blow hard enough.  Took too long to dry my hair and it came out frizzy every time.  Sent back and exchanged for a Conair that i like much better.</li>
    <li> It seems to work well, but not as well as other reviewers have indicated.  Very heavy to hold for a while if you have long thick hair.  More annoying sound that most hairdryers.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer sucks my hair into the back end and pulls hair right out of my head. I&#x27;ve had very long, very curly hair for 20 years and have used many hair dryers, and that has never happened before. I don&#x27;t know how other dryers prevent this from happening, but they forgot to add that feature to this design. I&#x27;ve used it twice and am returning it.</li>
    <li> This is so totally different than the hairdryers I&#x27;ve ever owned before. This thing gets hot so fast and it blows so strong love it.</li>
    <li> The socket blow up and got alot of sparkles make me so scary throw it away and didnt use it again ever</li>
    <li> It works well. Love the diffuser attachment. Has a long cord that is convenient. Good hair dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s a great blow dryer with power. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars ,is that buttons are touchy while in use, and can change temps and speed.</li>
    <li> Good air flow. Fairly quiet. Seems like good construction. Location of the buttons makes them easy to switch unintentionally. I think this is a winner at around twenty six bucks delivered.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair so I go through blow dryers like there is no tomorrow!  This one so far has lasted over 6months for me which I think is great!!  It does have a funny way of turning it on, but once you figure that out you are good to go!</li>
    <li> With three teenage girls in the house, the hair dryer gets a lot of use. A LOT OF USE. We&#x27;ve blown through quite a few hairdryers - no pun intended. This one however, seems to be the clear winner. As a stylishly bald man, I can&#x27;t personally vouch for it, but the female testimonials are unanimous... this is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: the dog isn&#x27;t a big fan, but she doesn&#x27;t like baths much either, so can&#x27;r be surprised.</li>
    <li> Good functionality but Too heavy!</li>
    <li> Works great and I like that the sides of it are almost a matte finish so it doesn&#x27;t slide off the bathroom counter. The only negative is that it&#x27;s a little heavy. But definitely powerful and has shaved off time for my morning routine!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer -- I needed to replace my very expensive Conair after years of leal service, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay a ton. This blow dryer has exceeded my expectations in every way. It has plenty of power and multiple settings. Works great for my fine, straight hair. I will buy another one like it once it dies.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love it!</li>
    <li> Works okay, but very heavy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same blow dryer since high school, and recently it caught fire, so that was that. I spent a long time reading reviews and comparing prices trying to find a new blow dryer and I eventually decided on this one after I was able to go to Target and see it outside of the box in person. This dryer is really awesome, it drys my hair fast, doesn&#x27;t seem to cause too much damage to my hair and I love the rubberized feel of it while holding it. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot fancy options or anything, just your generic three heat levels, three blow settings, and a cool button. However, my friend is a hair stylist at a pretty fancy hair salon and when she stayed over one night and used it after showering the next morning, she came out of the bathroom to ask about the blow dryer. She asked how much I paid for it, and after telling her, she indicated that she couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked. She also complained that she had recently had to buy a new blow dryer for work and she couldn&#x27;t see much of a difference between hers and mine expect about $100.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is amazing. It has the perfect temperatures and blow strength. For thick hair that takes long to dry, this is a miracle! And it&#x27;s very sturdy, firm, robust. It seems that a made a very good choice!</li>
    <li> Dries fast. Easy to aim and to keep at right distance so as to not dry hair out. Handles well-- not too small, not unwieldy.</li>
    <li> awesome! dries my hair faster than any other drier i have.. and my hair is thick! i would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this blow dryer as much as I originally thought i would need to. But so far, so good. It does seems to be a little top heavy, but nothing that would discourage me from using it, material quality is great to. I use this mainly on curly, kinky hair, so the diffuser is nice to have.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic hair dryer, it is well made and not too heavy. It emits good power without being too loud. The buttons are simple and easy and it really dries my thick hair quicker than my old dryer. I recommend this brand, it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> In looking for a new hairdryer, I didn&#x27;t want to pay 70.00 but I wanted something that would cut time off my morning routine. I am keeping this because &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  But, if you are looking for power, pay more and get something better.</li>
    <li> Very good quality...like it...</li>
    <li> Excellent, but noisier than I thought.</li>
    <li> Bought this hair dryer for my wife to replace her old one that was starting to physically wear out. This one dried her hair several minutes faster than the old one (even with hair/dust cleaned out of the filter). Highly recommend, the finish is a soft touch / satiny plastic paint / coating that feels good to hold in your hand.</li>
    <li> After using the same blowdryer for probably 8-10years, I decided to upgrade to a new one. I have very thick (*VERY THICK!*) moderately wavy shoulder length hair. Due to my hair thickness, drying times were typically 30-45minutes. I wish I was joking. This dryer dries completely in under 15 minutes (about 10-12minutes more precisely). I am so thrilled with this dryer!! Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it! I like the texture of the dryer itself, love the speed of drying and the cord is long enough to actually be able to use it! SCORE!</li>
    <li> I have always hated blow drying my hair, but this dryer makes it easier due to the handle being so thin. I usually use it on low settings and it works great. I love this hair dyer.</li>
    <li> Have had the older version of this hair dryer for 7 years but one of the switches just broke so I replaced with what I thought was the same model, but although the hair dryer works great the cord is much shorter and now I can&#x27;t stand up to dry my hair. Please bring back the longer cord Remington not all of us have outlets halfway up the wall!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is just alright. I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it, and needed a hair dryer with a diffuser. After looking through reviews I decided to purchase this one over some cheaper models or buying the same Vidal Sassoon model I&#x27;ve owned for many years.&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that I was shocked by how heavy it was, because it&#x27;s ceramic. It can be sort of awkward to use before you get used to it. Secondly, the difference between the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; to the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting is pretty big. The &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; on mine has barely more heat than the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting and the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting is too hot to use for more than a minute or two. The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; also makes my hair super frizzy, but that&#x27;s fixed by blasting it on the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting after the heat. But I do worry that it damages my hair. I would use the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting if it didn&#x27;t take so long.&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is kept at my boyfriend&#x27;s and I only use it to dry the roots of my hair with the diffuser to give them lift, so it doesn&#x27;t see much use. Because I don&#x27;t use it often I can get over the negatives of the dryer and it is alright for me. If I had to use it every day or dried more than the roots of my hair I would return it.</li>
    <li> Great settings - 3 heat settings. Relatively quiet but a bit heavy.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter, she loves it!</li>
    <li> This dryer is perfect and the weight is perfect for balancing.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews and decided to go ahead and buy this hairdryer in July 2013. It is a good, quiet hairdryer that I enjoyed for 16 months. However, just like the other reviews suggested, there is, indeed, a problem with this product as it has started to &amp;#34;spit&amp;#34; sparks as I&#x27;m drying my hair which is clearly dangerous. Although 16 months have passed I find it hard to believe the manufacturer wants a dangerous product out in the marketplace. According to the return policy, I am not able to get a refund or a new product so BUYER BEWARE! This product can be dangerous and their policy doesn&#x27;t seem to address this situation. Amazon, please consider what you might do to help this situation given the product is spitting sparks within inches of your customers&#x27; faces. Perhaps you should discontinue selling it...</li>
    <li> conforme con la venta y recomiendo al vendedor</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I have had this for less than a month. I love it. But after the 2nd time I used it, it started sending BLUE SPARKS out! It is the best hair dryer ever, and I&#x27;m afraid to use it because it might explode or set my hair on fire. I know there is a warranty on it. I have just emailed Remington, but have not heard back yet. I would have given this 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t SPARKING IN MY HAND! Hopefully they will send me new one.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift, but I currently own one, and this was a replacement for the same model that was damaged after being accidentally stepped on.  I use mine every single day.  If my hair isn&#x27;t blown dry, it&#x27;s a guaranteed &amp;#34;bad hair&amp;#34; day.  Interestingly, my dryer was given to me by the person for whom I&#x27;m replacing this for.  It was under a damp towel on the bathroom floor, and someone unknowingly stepped on it cracking and breaking the handle.  So there&#x27;s a real love affair in our family with the Remington Pearl.  What strikes me about this particular model is its power and low noise level.  I&#x27;ve seen salon hair dryers that don&#x27;t perform to the level this one does.  The heat output level combined with the two speeds and the volume of air this until pushes is just great.  Mine is three years old now and run every day.  If the filter screen is regularly cleaned, and occasionally removed and the intake vacuumed of all accumulated dust.  This one will last a long time!  I love mine, so does my wife, and my daughter in-law.</li>
    <li> dries fantastically and leaves my hair shiny</li>
    <li> My dryer died! I bought it just over three years ago for $29. It lived just beyond the warrenty:) will be buying a new one just like it. It worked great while it lasted. Having the temperature settings was helpful with kids.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace an old hair dryer that was on its last legs. It dries quickly and allows you to quickly mold the hair into a shape if needed. It is not extremely noisy, and very hot on the highest setting for quick drying.</li>
    <li> I have only dried my hair twice with it, because I bought it 2 nights ago. I do like it, it feels quality to me. My hair is a lot less frizzy even After letting it dry half way then finishing with the dryer. I actually have very curly hair that is banana curls underneath and waves everywhere else. I did half my hair with the diffuser for the curls andhalf my head straight(no I didn&#x27;t go out in public like this) and I like it for styling both ways. It&#x27;s heavier then my red Revlon dryer and blue contair but it does a better job. I hated my blue dryer b/c I always had frizzy hair afterwards. The red dryer was like a someone blowing on my hair themselves no power at all. So far so good, I purchased mine at target, they have the dryers they sell on display so you can pick them up and feel the weight and shape I would suggest finding a local target that offers that before buying a new dryer. Make sure it&#x27;s right weight for yourself, I was ok with it and I have corporal tunnel ion both my arms.</li>
    <li> I bought this same dryer 8 years ago and absolutely loved it.  When friends would use it, they&#x27;d always wanted to know where I got it but it had been so long that I forgot.  When it blew out (because I dropped the power cord hard on the floor for many&#x27;o years) I knew I had to replace it.  I searched for it on Amazon and sure enough, they had it and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  It&#x27;s quiet and does a great job on long hair.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer gets very hot, but not much air blows out compared to other (I have an older conair that I love) hairdryers. It&#x27;s also very heavy.</li>
    <li> lots of power...works great</li>
    <li> It works great. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer. Love the attachments.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is quiet, powerful and hot. Looks good, easy to handle. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Works great, absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I have natural thick hair and this dried my hair beautifully. I love it.</li>
    <li> A far cry from the Remington hairdryer I have had for 10 years but an acceptable backup.  The diffuser is crap and the fan speed and heat settings are way too slow/low to dry as quickly as my previous dryer.  Another hairdryer to add to the collection bin.</li>
    <li> I noticed less static in my hair after the first time of using! I also notice more body if I use moose. It is a little heavier than a normal hair dryer but I have no problem putting up with that if it makes my hair look better! I also thought the price was great compared to other dryers of its likeness.</li>
    <li> Great look, works perfectly. I don&#x27;t have any problem with the heavy weight as some users would complain about. However the first time I turned it on I did smell something burning, but it only happended once. I use this hair dryer everytime as I wash my hair, about once a day, so far so good and I&#x27;m happy about the purchase. This is not a quiet hair dryer though, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big deal since almost all the dryers are noisy anyway.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer works particularly well for my fine hair in that it does not &amp;#34;overcook&amp;#34; it as there are multiple settings to choose from. You can choose from 3 heat settings as well as 3 force settings, and lastly there is a &amp;#34;cool shot of air&amp;#34; setting. All of these options have allowed my frequently highlighted hair to remain somewhat healthy looking as opposed to the blowdryers that use maximum heat all the time. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer but the cord was a little too short for my liking.</li>
    <li> Did not know that the switches and front and rear grills were pink.  Some photos displayed showed a black rear grill and the buttons did not look obviously pink but they \\&quot;are pink\\&quot; (pink enough to appear like a toy hair dryer).  Even the box itself is misleading since it does not show it that pink. I will try and upload a photo to show the comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought it was going to be fairly quiet dryer but I&#x27;ve had cheaper dryers that are lighter.  In any case, no big deal on the color since buying it for the function but just a heads up if color is going to be an issue.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer. It&#x27;s super cute, sleek and looks professional. It has a lot of functions and it drys my hair fast.</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase of this dryer. The prior one lasted many years and was still working when I replaced it. The only problem with it was the plastic buttons were cracking and falling off so I glued them and kept using it. I like the new one just as we&#x27;ll, it&#x27;s efficient and well made. I do tend to accidentally change the temperature setting when I&#x27;m using it simply because of where the buttons are and how I hold the dryer. I recommend this dryer despite that.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! It comes with two attachments which help keep the heat damage to hair at a minimum. The design is aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. It heats evenly and does a fantastic job. It is high quality for a great price. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for my daughter for Christmas, and after only two months of use, the motor quit working.</li>
    <li> The dryer works fine, but the cord is way too short. My outlet is near the floor and it doesn&#x27;t reach my head if I stand up. I have to sit on the floor to dry my hair now.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is everything I need, great choice for me. Would reccomend to anyone that does not need a professional type hair dryer</li>
    <li> Very nice blow dryer. Bit of an odor the first uses, it needs to burn off before it will fade. Pretty and very happy with the number of speed and heat settings.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Remington Brand Hair Dryers, this one is my favorite. It is super quiet, I had to call the company &amp; ask because my last one was really quiet &amp; they told me this was the quietest decibel wise. I can&#x27;t stand the ones that give off that high pitched sound &amp; this one does not. It dries my hair super fast! I&#x27;m amazed at how much time I save with this new dryer. Simply put I LOVE this dryer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been blow drying my long/thick hair since I was 14 (27 now), and this has to be the best blow dryer I have bought yet. Well worth it, IMO!</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer a couple of years ago and I still love it!! It is quiet and dries my hair so quickly. It is lightweight and comfortable to hold. The only con I have is the placement for the heat settings.</li>
    <li> Works like it should.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer was great for the first year and a half (bought it brand new), but just recently it started to spark every time I used it. At first I thought it may have been a little glitch, but it&#x27;s been sparking every time now. I have stopped using it so my hair and or face doesn&#x27;t catch on fire! Scary!</li>
    <li> The product is definitely living up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took my hair dryer to Italy because I wanted a powerful dryer.  When I went to use it, the fuses blew.&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned: Don&#x27;t bother taking it &amp;#34;over the pond&amp;#34;, just make do with the  European  appliances.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for over a year and it still works great.  Cuts my drying time in half while leaving my hair straight and smooth.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a good drier. It did get a little heavy while I was drying my hair. But I did think my hair looked shinier after. I would not call it professional quality by any means. I would say it is worth it if you&#x27;re just looking for a good cheap hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair quickly, has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds, and a longer-than-most cord, which makes it so much easier to use.. For me, this has to be the best blow dryer that I have ever owned.  My only criticism would be that it is a little on the heavy side.</li>
    <li> My daughter in law recommended this blow dryer, so I purchased it.  It dries my hair in half the time than my other blow dryer.  It&#x27;s light weight and easy to use, yet powerful!</li>
    <li> I Like the dryer. Good quality, but heavy. Can recommend the product. Was delivered faster then expected. USPS delivry guy did not ring the bell. Just drop the dryer next the door</li>
</ol>
