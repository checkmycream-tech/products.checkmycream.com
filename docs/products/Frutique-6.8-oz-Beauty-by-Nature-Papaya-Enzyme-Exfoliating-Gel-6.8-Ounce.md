      <li>so I can achieve the full benefits of my retinols, peptides, hyaluronates, etc.</li>
      <li>but overall it is a good product.</li>
      <li>but this product really makes my skin glow and look healthy.</li>
      <li>I bought this Frutique Papaya Enzyme from a local store, and the girl suggested this to me assured me that she has used it and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Your clean fresh skin beneath will literally glow.</li>
      <li>Great product, takes the dead skin right off!</li>
      <li>My daughter has very fair, delicate skin combined with acne.  </li>
      <li>It is much like peeling off your skin after a light sunburn.</li>
      <li>how much sunscreen I have to use, it&#x27;s important to exfoliate every day, all those lotions build up and clog your pores.</li>
      <li>Second, use warm water.</li>
      <li>Ok, before I give my review I want to describe my situation to give an idea of my skin type: naturally i have oily skin but after 10 years of using retin-a micro, i now have dry/combo skin.</li>
      <li>The bottom line is that this product offers the most aggressive surface exfoliation without any of the sensitizing effects of, well</li>
      <li>but anytime i used cool or hot water</li>
      <li>I also use it right before I get in the shower or while I&#x27;m in the shower</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I thought wow, my face feels so smooth!</li>
      <li>If used in the shower and NOT on dry skin, the effect is even more gentle and rinses off easily.</li>
      <li>There is no ingredient label, so I can only assume it&#x27;s made of magic.</li>
      <li>Therefore, it’s the first thing I do when I get in the shower.</li>
      <li>Using this product leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>it most definitely exfoliates.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I bought it, I tried it as soon as I got home, and it turned out not too good, after used a few times</li>
      <li>This really works and is very gentle.  </li>
      <li>I used both hands to work it gently in large circles.</li>
      <li>Her skin at first would have more residue rubbing off and darker too due to her darker complexion than mine, so</li>
      <li>My super sensitive skin had no adverse reaction, it is extremely gentle for how effectively it just peels off dead skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And after several years of piling on multiple concealers, it is truly amazing.</li>
      <li>Now after using it for a month I don&#x27;t get as much residue rubbing off anymore.  </li>
      <li>I gently worked this into my cheeks -</li>
      <li>Dermalplaning is used in medical spas when layered dead skin must come off for healthy skin to be able to breathe and renew.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this stuff</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and non abrasive.</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t really wear much to begin with).</li>
      <li>really like it.</li>
      <li>I just gently shaved it off.  </li>
      <li>so it makes it much easier to wash off.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So I was skeptical. I looked at the bottle, read &amp;#34;exfoliating gel&#x27; and scoffed. As someone who has bought and made scrubs with everything from baking soda to walnut shell powder, to sugar to plastic... The idea that a GEL was going to do anything a serious scrub couldn&#x27;t seemed ludicrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m a believer. This stuff is no joke. I used it on my face and like everyone else said, was immediately freaked out by the scourge of little while balls that were GLUED to my jaw line and cheeks. Momentarily.&lt;br /&gt;I just used a wash cloth and went in the direction of the hair growth, and they came off eventually. Dry toweling afterwards removed any stragglers.  My face felt like butter, I was very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, because this stuff is so... Potent. I use it on my heels and feet as well to aid in removing dead skin (like after the beach, or walking a lot in sandals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the price point on this is spot on. Effective, very reasonably priced, lasts a long time, and is good for many areas of the body.</li>
    <li> best exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used ! and I have used from medicated prescriptions to every expensive exfoliator out there .Just love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used similar products, $50-100 for approximately 4-6 oz, and this is as good if not better! I&#x27;ll never go back to anything else. I have my entire family using it now and it take years away from your appearance when you slough off the dead skin.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this stuff but it just didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I tried it many times and followed the instructions exactly. The product balls up and collects only on the areas of my face where there is more fine hair (jawline, etc) and then is difficult to rinse off so I use a wet washcloth. I&#x27;m pretty convinced it was only the washcloth that did any exfoliating. In fact, I experimented once where I used Frutique on one side of my face and on the other side I just rubbed it with a wet washcloth as much as I do to rinse the the product off. I asked my husband which side was softer. He picked the washcloth only side. Maybe my skin just doesn&#x27;t react to papaya enzymes. I give up. It&#x27;s going in the trash. :(</li>
    <li> This product is a bit weird because you end  up with tiny balls on your face that you must face off with warm water but you skin ends up feeling very clean and refreshed.  I do like this product.  The cleanser is very good as well.  Would recommend both products.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It works in a matter of seconds! I had no idea how much dead skin I actually had on my face until I tried it. After using this product my face was smooth and cleansed. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This really works and is very gentle.  My daughter has very fair, delicate skin combined with acne.  It works but is not drying or harsh.</li>
    <li> The best exfoliator I have ever used and it is gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> I got a bottle of this at Sallys a while ago after searching online for a good exfoliating gel.  I wanted to get Cure Aqua gel, but opted for this because of the price and it&#x27;s easy to find.  I&#x27;ve had a similar product from a korean brand called Skin 79, but I felt that it didn&#x27;t do much exfoliating or anything at all.  I apply a generous amount on a small area of my face and rub for about 30 secs as instructed and a good amount of product and dead skin came off.  Now after using it for a month I don&#x27;t get as much residue rubbing off anymore.  I love it, I notice my complexion has improved and makeup applies on nicely.  I let my mom try it and she loves it too.  Her skin at first would have more residue rubbing off and darker too due to her darker complexion than mine, so I know it&#x27;s just not the product itself rubbing off.  I have oily skin, so I easily get clogged pores and just alot of build up.  It&#x27;s one of my favorite products, and I hope that it does not get discontinued.  I love that it&#x27;s accessible and sometimes there are sales at Sallys so you can get it for even cheaper. Also use it for other parts besides your face to exfoliate, beats using the rougher scrubs.</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;m probably not in their target market.  I&#x27;m a 47 year young man.  Age and gravity are taking effect and I plan on fighting it every step.  Female friends suggested I exfoliate and after I got over the whole tough guy man thing, I headed to Sally&#x27;s and told them my dilemma.  They were very kind and steered me to this entire line.  WOW! I had no idea how much dead skin was there!  My face felt clean and incredibly smooth.  I also use the Rejuvenate for a daily lotion after using Vaseline Intensive Care for Men for years.  A world of difference.  The scent is very light and not non-manly in any way.  I invent what 47 is supposed to look like, thanks to this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is magic. I am an esthetician and can&#x27;t recommend this product enough. The negative reviews are from those who do not know how to adapt skincare products to meet personal need.  There is more than one way to use this product. First, if you have a lot of dead skin build up you will be shocked when you use it. The first time I used it I also had the dead skin stick to the smallest hair on my face as others have complained. I just gently shaved it off.  With continued use the dead skin build up was less and I never had that issue again.  Shaving it off will have no negative effects, in fact shaving is used as exfoliation too. Dermalplaning is used in medical spas when layered dead skin must come off for healthy skin to be able to breathe and renew.  The bottom line is that this product offers the most aggressive surface exfoliation without any of the sensitizing effects of, well, I think EVERY product I have used.  If used in the shower and NOT on dry skin, the effect is even more gentle and rinses off easily. I use this DAILY in the shower and have looked for other products to replace it but have found nothing even close to comparable.  Use it as YOUR skin needs and don&#x27;t get scared away because of the dead skin rolling off your face. This product can be used as gently as needed and is a godsend for sensitive or sensitized skin that can not tolorate other types of exfoliation.</li>
    <li> The best stuff ever!!!!  It exfoliates well and dosn&#x27;t amage my skin.  I am having trouble finding more however.</li>
    <li> When you use this product the first time you may be astounded to see how slow your dead cell turn-over is. The usage directions are as follows: Gently massage Frutique Papaya Exfoliating Gel onto clean dry skin in a circular motion for 30-60 seconds until dead skin cells appear in flakes. (Mine appeared in balls and clumps) Rinse with warm water. Use 1-2 times a week, at bedtime. Okay, once upon a time in a far away land I could afford to purchase a high-end product very similar to this one. I used it regularly and re-purchased as needed at five times the price of Frutique&#x27;s Papaya Exfoliating Gel. I am so thankful to have found this product. I was able to toss away all those messy, scratchy, abrasive exfoliators I had been using because the fruit enzymes in this gel gently melt away and detach all those dead skin cells that the abrasive exfoliators leave behind. Your clean fresh skin beneath will literally glow. And what&#x27;s equally exciting is that all your other skin care products will actually perform better because they can penetrate your fresh healthy skin versus sitting on top of dull, dry, dead skin cells. I love this product and use it every other day to speed up my cell turn-over so I can achieve the full benefits of my retinols, peptides, hyaluronates, etc. I&#x27;m 49 but many days I don&#x27;t even wear foundation because it makes no sense to cover up a fresh dewy glow. Also, this exfoliator is priced so well, I can afford to use it from head to toe. I highly recommend this simple, fast, effective way to beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this Frutique Papaya Enzyme from a local store, and the girl suggested this to me assured me that she has used it and loved it.  That&#x27;s why I bought it, I tried it as soon as I got home, and it turned out not too good, after used a few times, I have found out this was really not the product for me because it was not only not working, but create tiny little crunch on my face that was impossible to remove simply by water rinsing.  I have to use facial scrub wash my face and use my fingernails to scrape it to remove it .  It seems like the product itself created the dead cells crunches made the users think it was working.</li>
    <li> First, the product arrived opened and the container was very sticky so not sure how much product was lost.  Hasn&#x27;t served its purpose so far which I was told would remove brown spots.  So far not too impressed.</li>
    <li> For those that have very dry skin.....&lt;br /&gt;This is your product! Removes dead skin cells leaving your skin supple and glowy..  exfoliating with this makes my skins imperfections easy to cover with light makeup no dry patches.</li>
    <li> I received this product the other day and was anxious to try it out right away. I had been researching similar products, and was really fascinated with what they claimed to do. I had recently had my first waxing experience, and the waxing center sold their own line of products for post-wax care, including a product very similar to this, called European Wax Center - The Exfoliate. I was not too enthused about paying $38 for 2 oz of product, so I explored my options. I was intrigued when I sampled The Exfoliate, seeing the little balls of supposedly dead skin balling up. I was curious if this product would cause the same reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product to my dry legs, and there was major balling up occuring right away. I used both hands to work it gently in large circles. Immediately I could tell it was working - or at least, it was balling up in chunks as I had expected. I was still curious to see if I could actually tell the difference pre and post treatment. I rinsed my legs off, and though getting some of the now-sticky balls of gooey &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; was not as easy I thought, my legs rinsed smooth. I dried them and the first thing I noticed was how soft my *hands* felt. Since I had used both hands for application, I think they got a lot of exposure to the product. They felt noticeably softer and smoother. My legs felt nice and smooth as well. I can&#x27;t recall when the last time was that I did any exfoliating on them, unfortunately. But now I will be doing so a few times  week with this product, and hoping that it helps remedy some of the ingrown hair situations that were caused by my negligence in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to also try the product out on my face. My skin is sensistive and acne-prone. I am using benzoyl peroxide, which dries my skin out a lot. I avoid doing any exfoliating with washcloths or microbeads because I feel like it still tears my skin a bit and leaves me more prone to the acne spreading. I gently worked this into my cheeks - I don&#x27;t know if the resulting balls are necessarily ALL dead skin - I think they are rather a mixture of the product and dead skin. But it definitely exfoliates, that much I can say. A word of caution - the balls start to adhere to the baby hairs on the face (if you have any, that is) and they do not just wash off with water. I took a clean paper towel, dampened it in warm water and gently wiped them off, washing with running water. My skin definitely felt renewed - I could really feel both my moisturizer and acne treatment getting worked into the new, fresh skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has won me over so far. The price is right and it seems to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because I got this at Sallys for $3.50, but I love this. My skin has never felt so smooth and I feel like all the dead skin is gone!</li>
    <li> Not as expected. Doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> My friend raved about this so I was excited to try it but I can&#x27;t tell that it actually does anything to my skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I feel about this product- I have this nagging feeling that l&#x27;m just rubbing a glue-like substance, and by rubbing the product, l&#x27;m rolling glue-like residue off my face- not my dead skin. Anyone else feel the same way?</li>
    <li> I recently went on a cruise and had a facial.  The estetitian suggested I use an enzyme exfoliator for my acne.  (I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and have a thyroid problem that makes my skin very dry.)  She suggested I stop using my mail order brand of acne medication that&#x27;s a 3 step process.  I didn&#x27;t have money to buy all the expensive stuff she had to sell.  When I got home, I bought this because  the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it. It seems to work best when used with a damp washcloth.  I think when you use it with your bare hands it also takes the skin from your hands, so you have wads of skin coming off, which can be a little scary at first.  LOL.&lt;br /&gt;Using this, then a ph balanced cleanser, then a gentle toner works great.  The container has lasted me a very long time as I only need to use it 2 times a week.  The other days I just use the cleanser and toner.  No more bleached towels and dry skin!</li>
    <li> Ok, before I give my review I want to describe my situation to give an idea of my skin type: naturally i have oily skin but after 10 years of using retin-a micro, i now have dry/combo skin. Due to now having dry skin I couldn&#x27;t use my st. Ives scrub because it would scratch and make it more dry resulting in burning. Began looking for a value-priced gel exfoliator when I found this at Sally&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: I love this exfoliator, it removes the dead skin on my face caused by my medication and smoothes my skin. In response to the complaints I&#x27;ve seen made about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) The little balls of product and skin that stick to your face: Yes, this does happen but I have discovered some solutions. First, the longer you rub it around, the harder it&#x27;ll be to remove. If I remember correctly, the product instructs 30-60 seconds. I try to aim toward 40 seconds. Second, use warm water. It sounds weird but anytime i used cool or hot water it was harder to remove the balls so i suggest trying to find a midpoint. And last, do it in the shower vs the sink. The more water i was able to get on my face the quicker the balls removed.&lt;br /&gt;2.) The little balls are just product and doesn&#x27;t work. I have seen visual results of my dead skin removed. In the winter my dead skin peels and looks like white cracks all over my face and sometimes hangs off. After using the product, my skin is clear and lighter (New skin now visible). The more dry skin i see, the more balls i usually have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i think this is a good product for the price, especially when other gel exfoliators can cost $25+. If it removed more easily i would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great Exfoliating Gel.  Not rough like other Exfoliators.</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliator!  It is a gel which rubs off any dead skins without ripping your face to shreds. You rub it on and it pills up into little rubbery balls which you wash off.  It does not abrade your skin at all but it effectively removes any patches of dead skin.  I have heard of a similar product from Japan which gets rave reviews, it is like $60 per ounce.  This is truly one of the best beauty products I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would be the equivalent to the pricier exfoliating gels you see at Sephora or Ulta.  Unfortunately this isn&#x27;t as good, in my opinion.  It gets stuck on any hair that&#x27;s on my face and it doesn&#x27;t grip onto my loose dead skin as well.  Also, the smell is odd and the gel has a hard time actually spreading on my face.  It eventually gets the job done (after using multiple pumps and applying over and over) but once this is out, I will be springing for the more expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> This has been a part of my skincare regimen for a little over a year. The first time I used it, I thought wow, my face feels so smooth! I find the best way to use this is in the shower. I probably use it twice a week, otherwise I am trading off with my Murad AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser. The instructions say to apply the gel to clean, dry skin. Therefore, it’s the first thing I do when I get in the shower. It still works with damp skin, just not as well. As you are rubbing it into your skin, the gel convinces the dead skin to roll off your face. Sounds weird, but true! The dead skin comes off in flake-like particles. I rub until I feel like I can’t get anymore use out of the gel, then rinse off. Your face is left feeling soft and supple and you actually feel as if you have removed dead skin! Whether or not the flakes are actually dead skin, or just an effect of the gel, I&#x27;m not entirely sure. But I love the way my skin feels after use.</li>
    <li> Great product, takes the dead skin right off! It&#x27;s gentle and non abrasive.</li>
    <li> I love this exfoliating gel!! I a have problem with oily, acne-prone skin and this helps keep my breakouts to a minimum. Using this product leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth. I have been using it longer than 6 months and I started getting really wonderful compliments on my skin after the first 4 weeks. My coworkers keep asking me what I&#x27;m using on my face. They are always surprised to hear me say I&#x27;m using an enzyme peel.&lt;br /&gt;I still suffer from oily skin so this doesn&#x27;t fix that but that is perfectly fine. My skin complexion has also evened out and as a result I wear less make up (I don&#x27;t really wear much to begin with). I just use it twice a week and my skin feels like it can breath!! The directions found on the bottle says it comes off in flakes but the dead skin gathers up into balls and ends up stuck on the fuzz found on my face. As a result I just rub/massage in a single direction along the direction of hair&#x27;s growth and that solves that problem. I also use it right before I get in the shower or while I&#x27;m in the shower so it makes it much easier to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a bargain!! I have bought enzyme peels for about $100 and trust me this just the job just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I think this works great!  I know other reviewers have said that it&#x27;s the product itself that balls up and it&#x27;s not any dead skin. I can attest that yes...it most definitely exfoliates. I had a sunburn on my back and it had started peeling.  I tried different exfoliates and nothing would speed up the process (and I am a product junkie..so I have plenty on hand)!  Well, I tried this and it totally took off ALL the dead skin.  After that, I did my legs, arms..etc.  It was great. Also, the product that balls up will be darker because it is lifting dead skin cells. If you don&#x27;t have any dead skin cells for it to remove...it will stay a clearish white..Will repurchase, but this bottle will last me a long time. Well worth it!</li>
    <li> This product is a joke. It literally makes a fool of whoever buys it! The &amp;#34;white balls&amp;#34; that form are not your skin, it&#x27;s the product. The product does the same with non skin objects. I will never purchase anything from Frutique just based off this product. They must really think they&#x27;re customers are stupid.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible,I ended up with damaged excoriated  skin . It will be going in my bin .I followed the  instructions carefully and while massaging the product over my face opted  lots of  tiny gluey white balls of the product began to form .These glue balls adhered themselves firmly to the fine facial hair /fluff on my lower cheeks and looked awful. .I rinsed my face  and  was horrified they would not wash off !!!  .I used an exfoliater with no result they were stuck firm .I then tried an exfoliating Mitt and rubbed hard ...no good the glue balls stuck firm and were still there .my face became red and sore in the jawline area .When I dried my face it felt rough and you could see the White balls stuck on my jaw/ cheeks .there is no way I could apply foundation as this emphasised the mess even more .Eventually  I had to pluck the glue balls off individually using eyebrow tweezers .It was very painful and took ages .The next day my jawline cheek area was extremely sore and scabby and still there were glue balls on my face .OMG how has this product been passed ?</li>
    <li> I have extremely fair sensitive skin, and a severe sun allergy. The best way to avoid my skin breaking out in hives at the slightest sun exposure is to take good care of it. Which is harder than it sounds. I&#x27;m 22, on the back end of the terrible acne years, and I&#x27;m trying to avoid scarring now, instead of trying to heal it later. This product is just amazing. I heard great things about it from my dermatologist(yes, my doctor recommended this!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I was absolutely disgusted! I rubbed it in to my dry skin, and within seconds these big grey clumps started falling off my face! It was incredible, and gross, but so satisfying at the same time! I used it every day for a week, and eventually the amount of dead skin that was being removed decreased and now I use it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With how much sunscreen I have to use, it&#x27;s important to exfoliate every day, all those lotions build up and clog your pores. This product, along with a good retinol lotion, have completely removed my need for cover up. And after several years of piling on multiple concealers, it is truly amazing. My skin is soft, healthy, and no more red patches or pimples. My super sensitive skin had no adverse reaction, it is extremely gentle for how effectively it just peels off dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part is it is very affordable on a college students limited funds. The bottle lasts, you really don&#x27;t need much. After years of experimenting with dozens of products, this one is the true miracle worker. Try it! You will be so happy you did, and love your skin again!</li>
    <li> good product- works well</li>
    <li> Definitely exfoliates, but leaves weird skin balls on my face. I know that sounds weird. It&#x27;s just the truth. Overall, definitely works.</li>
    <li> This works well except if you use too much then it leaves sticky balls on your skin.  I use hair conditioner to take the sticky balls off but overall it is a good product.</li>
    <li> This product works as well as more expensive brands.  Will definitely keep in stock.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliant! My friend turned me onto this when I was staying at her home. It is much like peeling off your skin after a light sunburn. I always use a washcloth with facial soap to get it all off. You will be surprised the glowing skin you have underneath. I am 55 with middle aged skin that has both wrinkles and break outs at times (lucky me!) but this product really makes my skin glow and look healthy. I use it about every other week. Try it!!</li>
    <li> I used to use an exfoliator that cost $42 for a tiny bottle and it was amazing but so expensive!! I knew I had to find one that worked but was cheaper. This is a really good exfoliator and the price is right. Gets all the dead skin off.  I would have given it 5 stars but I knocked one off because I wish it was thinner, the gel is very thick which makes it harder to apply.</li>
    <li> I just bought this stuff today, and it has already been amazing for my complexion. I have some minor acne scarring on my cheeks, and it has already made a noticeable difference. The redness is gone,  and the pitted texture is shallower and much less noticeable. And I&#x27;ve only used it once! There is no ingredient label, so I can only assume it&#x27;s made of magic.</li>
