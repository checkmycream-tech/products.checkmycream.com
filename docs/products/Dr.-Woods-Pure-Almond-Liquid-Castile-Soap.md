<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The smell is not pleasant. It smells like cherry medicine. I would rather have stuck with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Almond Scented Soap. I would say it is not as potent as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, which I have to water down. I do not have to water down this soap, but the smell is terrible.</li>
    <li> This is my new cleanser for my face and also my new body wash. I love how clean and soft (and not dry and irritated) my skin feels. It is so much better than the chemical-laced stuff I had been using. The scent is light and clean, I am hooked! I have not tried it on laundry yet, or for cleaning.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;d definitely buy this again. Service was also great.</li>
    <li> hands down the best soap ever. Dr. Woods products are all amazing. I use the pure black soap for my face (has eliminated my acne) and i use this pure almond soap for my body. It smells incredible and leaves my skin so smooth</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, and my teenage son does also.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. It&#x27;s versatile, I use it in the shower, for hand soap, and even for laundry soap in combination with baking soda.</li>
    <li> I like Dr. Woods Original Castile Soap Pure Almond with its sweet fragrance, sudsy bubbles and economical 32 ounce bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this soap o make my own body wash and shampoo mixing it with certain oils and coconut milk, and the smell is just delicious!! I use it by itself too!! Makes a great house cleaning detergent as well, natural and ecologically safe!</li>
    <li> Good product. I use it to add to laundry soap that i make at home. Pleasant fragrance, arrived on time....</li>
    <li> This is one of my very favorite cleaning products. I love it because 1) the ingredients are all healthy and natural, 2) it smells AMAZING like the greatest almondy cherry-ish smell, 3) it is SO versatile (hair, body wash, bubble bath (short-lived bubbles, but good for the kids bodies and no harmful chemicals), house cleaner, laundry detergent - does it all naturally!) and 4) it is so much LESS expensive than Dr Bronners. Just remember good natural soap doesn&#x27;t usually \\&quot;bubble\\&quot; like mainstream brands, as its usually unnatural chemicals that make that unnatural process happen.</li>
    <li> I rated this one star because in my opinion it fell well short of the high rankings that tempted me to buy it.  It does not smell like almonds and I was definitely not tempted to eat it as some other reviewers stated.  It definitely did not smell &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; to me. I like liquid soap but not to the point it pours out of the plastic bottle, almost like water.  It is a big bottle but it pours out FAST!  If I bought soap at the grocery store, and I have bought many different kinds, nine out of ten I would rank better than this, maybe ten out of ten?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I write this review for others who depend on reviews when they choose a product.  I have found most Amazon reviews very accurate, maybe I just have different taste from most people in regard to soap ... anyway, I am at least one person who will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> works great, smell can be a bit strong</li>
    <li> I like this gentle soap</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my face, body and my car!!! I also diluted this soap and poured on the poison ivy in my back yard and KILLED that awful plant invasion!  I never thought that was possible!  This is a great product and I as always the Amazon delivery is incredible!</li>
    <li> Love this soap! Pure, fragrant, just right for us.</li>
    <li> This soap is very thin but cleans well.  It has a pretty strong almond smell but it smells wonderful to me.  I use it as a bodywash and hand soap. It does leave a residue on my hair, so I don&#x27;t like it as shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful all purpose cleaner. The almond scent is natural and wonderful.  I put it in a pump bottle for guests to use as hand wash and they rave about it.  I use it for everything, hair, body, housecleaning etc. Great product</li>
    <li> effective product...good all purpose cleaner...i use it to brush teeth...mop the floors with it...i recommend it...not expensive...worth the try...i will buy more</li>
    <li> Non-drying. Smells great. Use it in my hand soap dispensers as well. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be for all types of skin, and mine tends toward the oily, but the sopa left my skin dry, so much so that it made scar tissue from an old injury peel. Maybe I should have kept using it, hoping the scar tissue would be gone for good...just sayin&#x27;</li>
    <li> Love the almond smell of this soap.  Used to get the Tea Tree version, but hubby read something about tea tree oil affecting testosterone so we switched to the Almond for use on the body.  Great price for such a healthy and natural soap, free of bad chemicals!</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a great buy. Below I will discuss some pros and potential cons:    Pros:  * Large quantity at a great price!  * The aroma is pleasing.  * It&#x27;s easy to use as a body wash, face wash, shampoo, etc.  * I do not find this to be watery at all. It is actually thicker than most hand soaps I have used, so perhaps the formula has been changed since several people in the past have complained that it is watery?  * It appears to have helped cleared up a few pimples on my face.    Cons:  * It does lather, but not as well as traditional soaps and shampoos. Still, it gets the job done.  * When I rinse my hair, it also feel like it is oily. However, when I dry my hair, that feeling goes away. My hair does still tangle, but not as much as with traditional shampoos and conditioners.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Love that castile soap is so versatile.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> My whole family loves this stuff, the smell is absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> Great product. Cleans thoroughly with nice fragrance and lots of lather.</li>
    <li> I love Castile soap!!! This smells so good. I wash my clothes with this. I also make a hand soap with it and wet toilet paper.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about ordering an almost Dr Bronner soap, but I like it.  It might be a little thinner but it works fine.</li>
    <li> I like the product but not as good as the other brand...  Love the price!  The smell is great but it does seem to run a little thin.  I&#x27;ve only used it as a body wash and facial cleanser and it works fine.  Not sure how it does in laundry or on your dishes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with all of the Dr. Woods products.  Castile soap is so versatile - body soap, shampoo, household cleaner, etc... almond and lavender are my two favorite scents.  I use the Almond primarily for face wash - it is gentle on my sensitive skin, and doubles as a good handwashing soap.  The price is excellent.  Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I like it but prefer their shea butter black soap even more.  The scent of the black soap is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap for some time now and was going to give this brand a try.  A big mistake.  I had some kind of allergic reaction to it as it left burn streaks on my skin from using it in the shower.  They ranged from an orangey red to just bright red and HOT.  I showered again immediately and they slowly faded.  Don&#x27;t see anything in the ingredient list that would bring on that reaction.....</li>
    <li> I use it for laundry, as a hand and shower soap.  It does not leave a residue and smells great.  I like the idea that I am not bathing with harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is great all-natural soap. Made a very moisturizing body wash. Only downside is it did seem to make my eyes burn slightly when I used it on my face. So, I quit using it on my face. Still highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This bottle is double the size of the ones in the store and just a few dollars more. I love the smell!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  Love the almond scent.  My skin is soft and moist after using.  Such a special treat to use in the shower.  Never want to run out of this product ever.  Pure and simple for bathing.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  The scent is incredible.  I was very pleased by this product. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this several times. I use it as a body wash and shampoo. Love it and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t bubble up as much as, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> We use this for the shower, bathroom sink dispensers, and for dishes.  It is really a multipurpose soap that works and it smells great.  You can&#x27;t go wrong here! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell of almonds!! Good price and very versatile! Will be ordering again! Made foaming soap with it !</li>
    <li> Excellent Product.&lt;br /&gt;This is much more expensive in other brands.&lt;br /&gt;I like to add this to my bath because it leaves y skin soft and clean&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;Also, I received this product rather quickly.</li>
    <li> Very nice soap. Doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry like supermarket soaps. Love all the different scents they offer. Great price!</li>
    <li> I never let myself be without this.  It is gentle, effective and the Almond has a great smell. I prefer it over other brands.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the almond.  It actually smells like plastic.  However the choice of the big bottle vs the smaller one is a bargain for the price and it is effecting when making soap/ shampoo</li>
    <li> AHH, THE WONDERFUL SMELL OF THIS SOAP.  A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. LATHERS GREAT.  ADD A LITTLE TO DOG SHAMPOO AND YOUR POOCH WILL SMELL BETTER THAN A NEW CAR. WELL, MAYBE NOT BETTER, BUT HE WILL SMELL REAL GOOD.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Dr. Wood&#x27;s Black Soap for years.  I use it both on my face and body to keep my dry skin from going crazy.  I only recently tried the Almond Soap when my local store ran out of the Black Soap.  I&#x27;m wondering what took me so long.  This soap is wonderful!  The scent is truly lovely and my skin feels moisturized.</li>
    <li> Great product! I personally would like a little less scent, even though its wonderful, just a little too pungent for my use.</li>
    <li> My who family used it...and I love the results. Just clean, from head to toe... I like how it feels on my hair...</li>
    <li> Amazon shipping came through as expected. No boxes dripping half my purchase. The price I paid was great. I recieved a large amount (seems like more than a quart) of soap that will last for several projects. The soap itself seems very high quality, though I have to disclose that I&#x27;ve never used castille soap before. I would definitely recommend this product and supplier to anyone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to using regular store bought shampoo. This is wonderful! My hair feels so different now that I am not washing out all the natural oil. A great scent too! I even use it on my puppy and he loves it. It doesn&#x27;t dry him out. Will buy more...</li>
    <li> I have used this for my hands, on dishes in the sink, and in the washing machine.  I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Oh man...when I first opened the giant bottle &amp; took a whiff I literally wanted to rub this stuff all over my body.  Good thing that&#x27;s what its made for!!  Smells like heaven, makes a nice rich lather but easily rinses off.  We live in HI and this is one cheap option for something \\&quot;green\\&quot; since a lot of that kind of stuff is super expensive here.  I feel fine using this at the beach or camping or in outdoor shower; I never liked seeing people use sulfate/ chemical laden soaps running straight into the ocean.  I have super dry &amp; sensitive mixed race skin,  I have long thick but fragile curly hair, not coarse, and this stuff works for me from head to toe. Shampoo, face wash, body wash, it really cuts down on time in the shower, good for the earth, my whole family likes it, it smells/feel great, and its cheap.  Do yourself a favor and at least try it.</li>
    <li> It works okay but left my hair feeling sort of weird. Not as soft as I like my hair too feel.</li>
    <li> Before reading this, please be sure to read my additional, edited text at the end!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the ingredients is bitter almond oil, which is different from sweet almond oil and is used primarily for scent (only sweet almond oil is used for hydration). But bitter almond oil is a toxin and is almost purely composed of benzaldehyde, which has been classified as a hazardous substance by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Bitter almond oil also often contains cyanide(!). So it appears that the bitter almond oil is what gives this soap its very strong almond scent (as that is what it&#x27;s primarily used for). But I suggest ordering one of the other castile soaps instead -- one that doesn&#x27;t contain a toxin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I contacted the company that owns this product, and they responded with: \\&quot;As listed on our ingredients \\&quot;Natural almond fragrance\\&quot; comes from the cassia flower.  You are right, bitter almond oil is actually from peach pits, since in order to get it from actual almonds the levels of prussic acid (i.e. cyanide) would be toxic.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still a bit confused; however, because on the bottle that I have, \\&quot;bitter almond oil\\&quot; is clearly listed.</li>
    <li> I prefer Dr. Woods over Dr. Bronners because it doesn&#x27;t dry my hands out.  I dilute and use as handsoap and when I used Dr. Bronners, my hands were so dry.  I also use this to wash my toddlers when they bathe.  The smell makes me want to drink it but I know I can&#x27;t!  I&#x27;m also pleased with the few ingredients and the fact that they aren&#x27;t chemical words I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Smells great and does not break out my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than Bronners, which is good since then I end up wasting the 18-in-1&#x27;s sometimes because of minor spills. Smells SO delicious and lathers up well.</li>
    <li> This soap is okay. I usually buy Dr. Bronner&#x27;s (which is amazing) but I was trying to save money and thought I&#x27;d try this brand. It smells good and seems to be pretty gentle (I have sensitive skin), but I also use it for cleaning and it&#x27;s nowhere near as powerful as Dr Bronner&#x27;s and it doesn&#x27;t foam as well either. Will definitely be going back to Dr Bromners once this bottle is finished.</li>
    <li> great product!  Good price!</li>
    <li> i ordered this brand of  product because my friend HIGHLY recommended the &amp;#34;Dr.woods peppermint castile soap&amp;#34; to clean the house. so i ordered the peppermint and the Pure almond (because i LOVE the smell of almonds.) price was perfect since it was on sale for 32 oz it was around 7 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i got the soap because i really wanted to clean my house, i understand this is mainly used as a body wash/soap but it clearly says it can also be used as a &amp;#34;house cleaner&amp;#34; 1 part product 4 parts water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i clean often and had the idea of almonds scented home after i was done cleaning, sadly No. it doesn&#x27;t hold its smell at all. Once its wiped on and dried, No scent what so ever, i feel like am just cleaning with warm water :( i really wanted this to work, but it doesn&#x27;t. its only getting a  &amp;#34;OKAY&amp;#34; Rating because it is a Good body wash..doesn&#x27;t smell great, its almond scented but not sweet smelling, i will not be ordering this again</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it lathers really good! I will be ordering more soon!!! Highly recommend getting this product!</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and works well. I put a bit in a foaming pumper with some water for my toddler to wash his hands with, and it has made it&#x27;s way into our bath routine and my husbands shaving. Oh man, that smell!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know I was getting Dr. Woods, not Dr. Bronners when I bought this (my own fault) and am therefore, VERY disappointed. It does not lather nearly as well as Dr. Bronners unless you use half the bottle. You get what you pay for. I thought it was such a great deal. Spend the extra on Dr. Bronners.</li>
    <li> Better than that other brand!</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, this is one of my favorite products on Amazon! I bought this bottle MONTHS ago and JUST ran out! I have been using it as an all purpose soap, for everything from floors to hands. It has a gentle natural fragrance that is simply delicious. I feel good about using this eco friendly soap , and will continue to do so  for the rest of my life. Economical, safe, healthy, effective...I can not recommend this product enough to do it justice. It&#x27;s simply good old fashioned soap, without all the expensive useless packaging.</li>
    <li> This is a great castille soap. I use it to clean the baby&#x27;s bottles. It is non toxic and has a very mild almond smell which doesn&#x27;t bother my daughter. Castile soap was recommended by my nurse to clean breast pump parts and I decided to use it to clean baby bottles.</li>
    <li> I have long hair all the way down to my waist. I have been trying to get away from store bought shampoos since the weird ingredients seem to dry out the skin on my scalp and around my hairline. I was super excited when I got this. However, when I used it, there was ABSOLUTELY ZERO SUDS! I used a LOT trying to work up a lather and there was just barely any froth. My hair was left so tangled I had to use EXTRA conditioner to work the knots out with my wide-tooth comb. Normally the comb runs right through detangling with conditioner in the shower. May work for someone with short hair but waste of money for me and added aggravation with long, thick hair.</li>
    <li> wonderful rich almond fragrance!</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Woods&#x27; castile soaps.  I use them for just about everything, and they are so gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Woods castile soap for a few years now. I stated out with the peppermint castile soap, and liked it well enough to keep using it for a multitude of tasks. When I began to run low on the soap, I came back to Amazon to order more. Before doing so, I noticed the high ratings for the almond scented castile soap. Most reviewers loved the scent of the soap, so with that in mind, I ordered several bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap arrived on schedule and was packaged well. I was eager to see how the soap smelled, and my first impression was of how clean and fresh it smelled. To me, it also had a faint, lightly &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34;  scent, too which reminds me of Jergen&#x27;s lotion. While I&#x27;ve yet to use this, it&#x27;s just what I need, and will make an excellent body wash. I like the Dr. Woods brand, and would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Great product. Received quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It&#x27;s so mild.  So far I&#x27;ve only used it as shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  Seems to get out the dirt but leave the oils.  It doesn&#x27;t make suds and is easy to rinse out.</li>
    <li> I love how I can use this for everything. I have severe eczema and ever since I&#x27;ve been using this my skin has become smoother and clearer. It&#x27;s harsh enough to clean dirty surfaces yet gentle enough to sooth sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great soap. Smells heavenly.</li>
    <li> I have bought this a few times before and have been very happy with my purchase. The almond scent is nice.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. It smells amazing, not too flowery. If soaps are too perfumy my husband won&#x27;t use them. It&#x27;s not a harsh soap, which is important to me. I wash my hands a lot during the day, and so my skin ends up getting dry if I use most kinds of hand soap.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The almond smells so good I have no words. Well, almost none. It&#x27;s amazing. I use this for many of my homemade beauty products and I love that its so pure. Great value, too. Much better than that Bronner&#x27;s stuff with the unsolicited religious messages all over the bottle. Geesh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never disagreed with items that have so many 4 and 5 star reviews, but this time I do. That &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell others we&#x27;re talking about? Yep. It&#x27;s there for sure. Although I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s cardboard. Not happy that the seal was broken when it arrived. This is also lesser quality than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, so I&#x27;ll just go back to that. Returning.</li>
    <li> Great soap. It&#x27;s more mild than the black soap, but this one smells nicer.</li>
    <li> Smell is invigorating. As good as it gets for natural soap. Hydrating and refreshing in hair. Doesn&#x27;t lather well but it is natural! Cheaper than the other doctors soap</li>
    <li> Use this as a supplement to my regular shower soap and this prevents me from having severe bouts of dry skin during dry Arizona winters. I&#x27;ve used almond soap from other brands, this is by far a better product and the price is very reasonable. Works good as a facial soap as well, it cleans without drying out your skin and leaves a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Smells bad and leaves the skin itchy!! I am so disappointed, and the price is really not justified compared to Dr Woods or Dr Bronner&#x27;s brands, which make you feel great!</li>
    <li> I have not used this product yet but I have used the peppermint version and i like it very much, so I&#x27;m sure I will enjoy this as well. I ordered this and the peppermint at the same time. I got the almond castile soap a few days ago ( about two days wait ) but I am still waiting for the peppermint. they were sent from two different sellers apparently. I give this seller a four star rating for getting it to me so quick. when i order again I will try to get both products from this seller.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the baking soda I was using to wash my hair. Works great and doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oils from my hair. Nice almond scent. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to make my own liquid laundry detergent. The smell is amazing and it works very well in the laundry. I may pick up several more to have on hand for body wash as well.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  I bought this to go with a do it yourself handsoap pump.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Use this to make my own dish soap.</li>
    <li> great non irritating soap. Large size bottle lasts for a long time. Would definitely recommend for every day use and safe.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing castille soap for years. I love this stuff. For some reason it seems to clean me better than any other product around. And you can also use it to clean your house. Its that good!</li>
    <li> What a great product - cleaning, laundry, body wah</li>
    <li> Stronger smelling (in a nice way) than its main competitor, this soap was also slightly thicker than I expected, making it easier to use! For the price it&#x27;s a great deal. I will be ordering again in the future.</li>
    <li> smells great! works just as well as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s almond castile soap for a better price!</li>
    <li> Love it. Made shower soap with essential oils. Love the smell, skin is soft, not drying. Love it.</li>
    <li> RIPOFF!!!  NOT CASTILE SOAP.  CASTILE SOAP WAS INVENTED IN MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES AND IS VEGETABLE OIL BASED.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is watery URINE.</li>
    <li> This soap is great. I just ordered it AGAIN! The almond oil is just what my delicate skin needs to feel healthy and supple. This is every bit as good as \\&quot;Dr. B\\&quot; and at a MUCH more friendly price. I wish I could give it 6 stars!</li>
    <li> I find that Dr. Bronners lathers easier with less.  The scent is pleasing enough, though.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with various homemade cleaning product recipes and liquid castile soap seems to be a staple.  I like the famous Dr. Bronner&#x27;s stuff, but wasn&#x27;t feeling up to paying for it.  Dr. Woods, however, seems to provide as respectable a soap as one could ask for.  While any real faults in any of my experiments are probably due to the recipe itself, this ingredient has reacted as expected and I got to say I&#x27;ve had some great results.  When using this soap on its own, I&#x27;ve been impressed as well.  The almond aroma is not overwhelming, but clean and natural.  I&#x27;ve seen some reviews complaining this doesn&#x27;t sud well, but I have no complaints there.  It rinses completely as well with no surface residue.  What causes me to most to recommend this soap is the price.  I find this a great buy.</li>
    <li> This soap smells so awesome. I will definitely be buying more of the almond scent. It&#x27;s light and fresh and it works very well.</li>
    <li> To me, this is just as good as that more expensive brand (you know which I&#x27;m talking about), and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper. I make home cleansers and laundry detergent with it, and it&#x27;s good. I LOVE the almond smell. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this soap. The smell is fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> The only soap we use. My son has eczema and this is the only natural soap he can use that won&#x27;t irratate his skin.</li>
    <li> Price and flexibility of use are this product&#x27;s best features.  It is comparable in quality to any other product on the market.</li>
    <li> Great soap and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Feels great. I use this to shampoo my dog. I don&#x27;t like all the weird stuff in &amp;#34;pet shampoos.&amp;#34; I am also looking forward to using up my pantene so I can switch to washing my newly natural hair with this. I am trying to use products with less ingredients in them.</li>
    <li> We use this in all the bathroom handsoap dispensers in our house as well as in the kitchen handsoap dispenser. It has a gentle almond scent and isn&#x27;t nearly as rough on my hands as other handsoaps. The package claims that it can be used for all sorts of purposes, including as a bodywash or shampoo, but I&#x27;ll just keep using it as handsoap. It effectively cleans, though it isn&#x27;t as good as removing cooking grease from your hands (after eating wings, etc.) as using dishsoap.</li>
    <li> First time purchasing Castile soap. Leaves a soft but clean feel after using it in the shower. Love the scent!</li>
    <li> Performs well, smells great and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> This soap is just as nice as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s! I love the smell and I love how just a few tablespoons mixed with water makes a nice hand soap for my dispenser! :)</li>
    <li> Thick, sudsy, smells great, worth the price and lasts long.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very similar to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s. Better price!</li>
    <li> Smells just like I was hoping it would. It arrived a day after I ordered it!! Yahoo!</li>
    <li> This natural almond soap has so many uses.  It can be used as body soap, and equally as well to clean off the counter after you prepared a meat dish.  I would recommend this product.  It smells just like fresh almonds.</li>
    <li> very pleased with product and with support from vendor!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, also love that it is easy to rinse, no residue,  skin soft  but no greasy. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This works well and smells nice, but I do not like it as well as Dr. Bronners.  It left me quite itchy for the first several uses.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice. This has made all my Pinterest DIY beauty/cleaning product dreams come true!</li>
    <li> I make my own body wash and shampoo. I like this better than the big name brand. It is more gentle on my hair.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everybody! We&#x27;ve been using it for everything - as a soap, as a shower gel, as a shampoo, as a dishwasher, as a cleaner, etc. Don&#x27;t need to buy any of those harmful nasty smelling chemicals. It smells wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Love the soap.  These days there are so many additives and fragrances in soaps that I try to avoid them when possible.  I use this for hand soap and to wash dishes.  Nice smell, but not overpowering.  Of you like a lot of suds you may be disappointed.  Also, it may take a little more soap than you are used to to get things clean, but it works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to replace ALL of my cleansers (body wash, face wash, etc) and go more green.  As a body wash, this is great-- and lately I&#x27;ve been combining it with honey and other castile soaps and oils to make a better body wash.  However, it RUINED my face. I had some kind of allergic reaction or just extreme irritation-- my face has never looked worse.  So as a body wash, YES YES use this! It&#x27;s best if combined with an oil to prevent potential dryness.  As a face wash, though, I would NOT advise for sensitive skin AT ALL.</li>
    <li> This would have been a good review had the item not had a cracked lid when received. I found the product to be of decent quality other than the damage. I have been using plastic wrap and a rubber band for the lid.</li>
    <li> Excellent product absolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> nice smell, great in place of bar soap</li>
    <li> I bought this to make homemade shampoo and it is so amazing! I love the softness and scent! It pairs well with jergens lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. It smells amazing, has all natural ingredients, and is cheaper than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s. I use this as hand soap and it doesn&#x27;t strip moisture from my hands like almost all other hand soap, which usually requires that I use lotion after washing my hands.</li>
    <li> This smells so good! I use it diluted with some avocado oil for baby wash and wipe solution. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> The smell is so subtle yet really pleasant</li>
    <li> Love this product because it is safe.  Most products are dangerous.</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect. I&#x27;ve used Dr. Bronner before, but I like this better. It smells sooo good, and leaves my hands feeling very soft. I bought a Bath and Body Works Foaming Soap, and emptied the contents. Then I fill the container about 1/3 of the way with the Castile Soap, the rest with water, and replace top. It works exactly like a foaming hand soap. I just keep refilling the soap dispenser over and over with the Castile Soap &amp; water mix- its much cheaper then buying a BBW soap each time.</li>
    <li> When you first open this bottle, you may find yourself very happy then suddenly sad when you remember it&#x27;s for your skin and not for your tongue.  Other than that, this robust scent is very unique and satisfying among other soaps.  Like the other Woods soaps, the consistency is just right and is very manageable.  For the price and in general, you will be hard-pressed to find anything better in terms of quality.  If the scent isn&#x27;t your cup of tea, you can use it to clean your floors, counter-tops, etc but remember to try out the other ones.  Dispensers also work well with this.  Just be careful pouring it into opaque containers because you can&#x27;t hear it and may end up spilling over like I just did :P</li>
    <li> This is wonderful soap at a very good price. It lathers up nicely and smells of almond.</li>
    <li> Nice clean feeling without over drying, now I have to try the many other things it can be used for!!</li>
    <li> Love the product and the scent is very enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Yuck! Smells awful!!!</li>
    <li> Great smell. Conditioning for skin. I use it for the base in dish soap, hand, body and  face recipes.</li>
    <li> I thought this castile soap would be good because of the added shea butter (so it wouldn&#x27;t be as drying as others), but I don&#x27;t like it. It is still drying but also leaves a weird residue. It smells good in the bottle but once in skin it smells odd and plastic-y. It takes a lot for it to foam up, and it shouldn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s supposed to be concentrated..</li>
    <li> My husband uses this for shampoo.  He loves it.  It is good quality and works well on oily hair. I have used it a few times as well when my girly shampoo ran out and it works well on mine too.  My hair type is very dry.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Received item fast. Would recommend...</li>
    <li> Have really only used this as a shampoo so I don&#x27;t know how well it works in other capacities.  It does an adequate job on hair, but does tend to require more frequent washings and doesn&#x27;t leave much softness.  A little goes a long ways though so it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this castile soap - the almond smell is STRONG! However, if you don&#x27;t want a hemp based soap (personal choice), you may want to steer clear. Otherwise, perfect for homemade body wash, dish soap, etc.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a good lather but it moisturizes the skin really well and has a great scent.</li>
</ol>
