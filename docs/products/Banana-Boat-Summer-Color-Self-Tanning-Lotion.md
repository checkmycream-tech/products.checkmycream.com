<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i like it but it does not cover evenly , I will try another</li>
    <li> I use this mostly on my legs about every other day during dress wearing season. It gives skin a nice bronze with gradual color.  As with all sunless tanner it needs to be applied skillfully and evenly. The lotion must be rubbed in thoroughly and allowed to dry. It easily washes off your hands with soap and water. Don&#x27;t use it and go to bed because it will be all over your sheets. I use a shammy to blot around ankles and knees.  I can&#x27;t really find it in the stores anymore so I order it three at a time through amazon.</li>
    <li> So i bought this thinking i could have a nice dark little tan without going in the sun. I followed all the reviewers instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m half Mexican and half white, so i have a natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve applied this 4 full times and an extra time on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;I see a semi-noticeable tan. that&#x27;s it. so much for deep dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t smell too bad, only when its developing. It didn&#x27;t streak, looks even. it&#x27;s not orange-y.&lt;br /&gt;BUT the guide color was non-existent, maybe cause I&#x27;m dark.&lt;br /&gt;and the color wasn&#x27;t as deep as i was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;For all the effort, i could have stood in the sun for the the amount of time i took to apply and dry, and came out way darker.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, wish it was a little darker. The smell is real nice for a self-tanner and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews for things I buy but I had to for this. I don&#x27;t know how it does it. There&#x27;s no glitter, not sticky, and you can literally choose the shade you want by adding more or less. It alwso moisturizes. The only complaint for me is it says to wash your hands with soap after your done. My arms and rest of body are light gold brown and my hands are pasty. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to get it on my hands. However it&#x27;s an amazing product. 3 bottles for this price is worth it and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to laying in the tanning bed without looking orange or smelling like a hobo. I am very sensitive to the smell of self tanners and I don&#x27;t an odor to it at all. It smells a little when you first squeeze it out of the bottle, but once on, you can&#x27;t even tell. Normally, when I use self tanners after about 3 hours I start smelling the DHA chemical smell that is just awful, but this doesn&#x27;t have that at all.  It&#x27;s great because it applies evenly and doesn&#x27;t streak. I put this on my neck, chest, arms, upper back and legs about 4 times a week and have a light/medium tan. It&#x27;s not over powering or looks fake, goes great with my skin tone. I do not put this on my face, but I know others have, I just prefer to use a face self tanner. As I get older I want to be less and less in the sun. This is great alternative.</li>
    <li> I am as fair skinned as they come, part Irish, part Eskimo I think...everyone was complimenting me on my great tan...so weird, never got that compliment before haha...Don&#x27;t pay any attention to the negative reviews, it was delivered faster than I thought, and worked great, 10 stars!</li>
    <li> I have tried many and this is the best ...Looks great and natural and lasts a long time...Great on the skin....Only one I will use now... Gives a very natural look...keeps you skin from drying out....</li>
    <li> I could go on and on about how great this product is and explain my application method, but all it really comes down to is that this is a MUST HAVE PRODUCT. This stuff I recommend 100%. No streaks. No orange-tint. No strong scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall I&#x27;ve noticed after using this for the past 6 months is that your elbows and fingernails stain if you don&#x27;t scrub them before and after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS PRODUCT!! YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISSAPOINTED :)</li>
    <li> I have tried so many many many self tanning lotions that didn&#x27;t do anything even after putting them on at least daily!  I tried cheap ones and expensive ones and found this finally!!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 3 years and order my supply for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order the dark since you still need to put it on daily but you get a darker tan faster! Just like any self-tanner, you need to rub it in well so you don&#x27;t get any streaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year after a friend complimented me on my tan and I told her it was fake, she couldn&#x27;t believe it.  She said how she could never get tan or just burned also so  then gave her a tube of it and now she swears by it too and orders her supply for the summer as well.  I get 3-5 tubes of it to last well into the fall.</li>
    <li> This is the best fake tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now. I&#x27;m very pale and this provides me with a nice tan color. No streaks. Because it is so dark you just have to be careful applying around the problem areas like hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is that fake tanning smell. It&#x27;s not as bad as a lot of them I have tried, but it is there.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff which is why I purchased the 3 pack on here. Same price on here as at Walmart but no tax and my Walmart didn&#x27;t have any every time I went in. Def a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; smell but I don&#x27;t care. Gives me my most natural and moisturizing tan after showering. I use with a sunless tan mit.</li>
    <li> Super good deal! This stuff works awesome and I have enough for the whole summer! Will purchase again!! Got to love Amazon for this product!</li>
    <li> Used this for years and still like it best.  It works well, without any streaking and turns a good natural colour.  The item arrived on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> My friend start banana boat company back in the years, He lives in Florida,&lt;br /&gt;He has sold banana boat longer ago back in 1999, I had use the product since&lt;br /&gt;age 18, Love it.</li>
    <li> The color is much more than dark, it is kind of orange-ish too.  I would never purchase this product again.  I&#x27;ll stick with my Jergen&#x27;s self-tanning.</li>
    <li> At first it looks great after applying 2-3 days everyday after shower. In 4-5 days though the color starting fading fast and in blotches....especially on my chest and where my bicep joins into my forearm. Not too impressed.  L&#x27;oreal is the best self tanner I have had thus far.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good but it has a orange tone. It stays on for a while and it shows up quick. Does not smell bad. Doesn&#x27;t streak. Good self tanner except for the orange tone.</li>
    <li> Guys you can get this same bottle at Walmart for about 6 bucks. You save yourself money not to mention if you get charged for shipping. Anyways this is more of a natural dark tan. I thought I was going to be brown but im more glowy. Its still good I guess. Just make sure you wash your hands asap when your done. Edit:******* Ok so now im going to have to give this product a lesser feedback. The lotion actually rubbed off my skin while bathing. I actually used my original AXE brand exfoliator and some parts the tan rubbed right off. Also made my facial hair turn brownish color. And it does even tone at all. Tho i do my best to even out the lotion it just does not look that good. Also do not use a white shirt if you think ppl might see your shirt bcuz it will def leave stains tho it is washable. Honestly i give it probably 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I used to love this tan lotion!, but the factory change something and is not strong anymore! Is not giving me the super dark self tan anymore!!!😣😣😣😣.... I&#x27;m not buying this product anymore! Is just not working no more!</li>
    <li> Well, I am a fair skinned girl that never gets tan, no matter what. I always burn, and I hate looking pasty in the summer time. I&#x27;ve never used a self tanner before because I was scared to turn orange. After reading all of the positive reviews, I had to try it. I heard that the fair/medium one does turn you orange. But this one doesn&#x27;t. This tanner is...amazing. I bought got it today, and put it on. Here&#x27;s how I did it.    I took a shower, and exfoliated like crazy. I heard it reacts with dead skin, so I didn&#x27;t want to be orange. Well let me tell you, I am far from orange.    When I got out of the shower, I dried off, making sure I had no water left on me. I took a generous blob, and added a few drops of water. I didn&#x27;t do my face, because I wanted to make sure I didn&#x27;t react. I didn&#x27;t, so that was a plus! I&#x27;ll explain my face at the end. I rubbed it in circular motions on my neck, and onto my shoulders. Make sure to get it really rubbed in well, because it could be streaky. After I did my neck/back of my neck/shoulders/back on my shoulders, and after I washed my hands.     I moved onto my arms, and did the same thing (make sure to add a little water, still), exept I went light on my elbows, because you have a lot of dead skin there, even after exfoliating. They are a bit orange, but it&#x27;s preventable. Also, many reviewers said there was a smell, but there was no odor I could detect. Wash your hands!!    Next, I moved onto my back. I thought this would be difficult, but it really wasn&#x27;t. Make sure you add water! Just rub it in circular motions, and make sure you have a mirror near you to make sure you don&#x27;t streak. The thing I like about this is that it&#x27;s tinted and you can see where you&#x27;re putting it. It&#x27;s easy to fix any flaws. Make sure to wash your hands again!    After, I took a large blob and added water, again. Rub in circular motions, again. DON&#x27;T DO YOUR KNEES! WAIT!! Just do your thighs and the back of your thighs. After that, go on to your calves, and slowly down to your feet. I didn&#x27;t do my toes, because another reviewer said not to. Make sure not to get too much on your ankle bone things (what&#x27;s the name...?) Wash your hands!    Then, get a tinyy bit and do your knees. They will turn orange if you put to much on. Wash your hands.    Now, your face. What I did was I took a dime size amount of my mousturizer (Nivea), and added a penny size of the tanner. I put this all over my face, still rubbing in circular motions. Make sure to get your eyelids-you don&#x27;t want a weird eye tanline. I used mousturizer, because I didn&#x27;t want my face to be ask dark as my body. It worked out nicely. Wash your hands- hand-tans are weird!!!    After all of this, go in front of a fan, and stand there for 7-10 minutes, until you are dry, rotating so that the lotion dries.     The tan will develope in about 2-3 hours, so don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t see imidiate results. All in all, this gives you an amazing caramel tan that looks like you stepped off of a beach. Skin cancer runs in my family, and I do not want to get it. And wrinkles pretty much suck, too.    I love this product, and I will never use anything else. This DOES NOT turn you orange!    I hope this helped!!!</li>
    <li> Because of all the positive reviews on Amazon and Youtube, I guess I can conclude that self tanner looks different on each skin tone. But I assume it&#x27;s because the people who like this, don&#x27;t go outdoors very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pale, not like \\&quot;a sheet of paper pale\\&quot;, but just have very little color.&lt;br /&gt;When I first applied this product, the following morning I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to make of the color.&lt;br /&gt;The result was definitely noticeable already and I was impressed as this was only after only one application.&lt;br /&gt;But I kept thinking \\&quot;Is this what my skin normally looks like when I usually tan in the sun?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the color, but thought it looked reasonable compared to other self-tanners I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;However when I stepped outside I was really disappointed. It definitely looked more &#x27;orange&#x27; than a nice brown tan!&lt;br /&gt;So yeh, I guess this is great if you only plan to be in dimly-lit indoor environments for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;But if you plan to leave the house, skip this product.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to be the party pooper in between all these positive reviews, but I have no vision problems ok, I turned orange!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus points:&lt;br /&gt;- Color was very noticeable after only one application.&lt;br /&gt;- This faded quite well though, little to no patchiness.&lt;br /&gt;- This color lasts quite a few days! Seriously, I started exfoliating two days after my first application, and this stuff really will not come off your skin, so that was impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative points:&lt;br /&gt;- I turned orange. I&#x27;m sorry if you like this product, but seriously, let&#x27;s be real, the result is far from what you would normally look like with a normal sun tan. It also made my skin look kinda dirty, and turned darker around the hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this product gets two stars, because what&#x27;s the point of trying this if the actual color looks orange and fake?&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this, because of it&#x27;s plus points, but I&#x27;m sorry, looking like a tangerine is not hot.</li>
    <li> What a great product!  It goes on with a tan tint right out of the bottle which is helpful to prevent missed spots and streaking!  Then when the color comes in, it&#x27;s very natural looking and not orange at all!   Love it!  Wish I found it last year!</li>
    <li> I ordered Banana Boat Summer Color Deep Dark Color and thats what I got.I ordered a much more expensive tanner at the same time and have to say I prefer the Banana Boat it goes on easier and smoother is more moisturizing and the color is bronzer and deeper.This is a winner for me</li>
    <li> Great self-tanning lotion, streak free!!! Fast shipping, thanks!!!</li>
    <li> No Streak, Natural as the Sun, Applies evenly and</li>
    <li> I have been using sunless tanners for about 7-8 years now. About 3 years ago I picked up this product at my local walmart. It was by far the best sunless tanner I have ever used. Everything I had used before this was streaky and would always turn me orange. This product goes on so smoothly and is rich in color so you can see exactly where you&#x27;re applying it and if you have missed spots or not. It gives me such an even, flawless, and natural-looking tan every time. I&#x27;d be lost without it.</li>
    <li> I read reviews saying this was the perfect deep color...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this product. This stuff barely gave me any color! It was such a waste of money, and now I&#x27;m stuck with 3 tubes. Also, it does smell terribly and if used on the face, the smell is nauseating. I will never use it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different self tanners ; many of them from department stores at a really high price. Living in Florida, it&#x27;s easy to get too much sun in search of a nice tan. With this product, I get a nice even tan and can supplement it with sunbathing for a natural deep color safely !! It hardly has any smell, and the color is tan - NOT ORANGE !! The more you layer it, the deeper and better the color becomes. I have medium skin tone and this color was perfect . I loved this product and would never be without it !</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  I have very light skin that does not tan easily, and this works so well on giving me a great tan.  I put it on at night, using latex gloves to protect my hands.  I apply it with a makeup sponge on my face, top of the feet, and back of the hands to make sure a smooth and light application.  The rest of the body I just lather up.  It will make a mess on your clothes, so I wear things that wash easily.  A quick shower in the morning, and voila... GREAT!  The color is fabulous (much better than any actual tan I have ever had from the sun) and it lasts a good amount of time.  I like this product better than the multitude of others I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and if used properly, you will get great results. My application process works great for me, but this is only advice and is not like what you&#x27;ll find on the product packaging. I&#x27;m a guy with average skin color, I tan easily and dark without burning. But I like the near instant tan this product provides, without the dangers of the sun. I use it at the beginning of the summer so I&#x27;m not embarrassed to go to the beach, be aware it does not provide any protection from the sun, however being responsible with your sun time, it will blend in well with a natural tan. I also use it after the summer season to keep the tan I get from the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, remove all jewelry. Shower and exfoliate with a soft, yet abrasive spungie or similar item to wash off as much dead skin as possible with liquid body wash. If you don&#x27;t, your tan won&#x27;t last as long. Because it works with dead skin, you will have plenty left to make the product work. This will also remove excess dead skin from the areas such as the elbows and knees so that you won&#x27;t over apply on those areas. Pat dry, but not completely and it&#x27;s a good idea to leave some steam in the bathroom, but not so much that you can&#x27;t see yourself in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people wear gloves, but I don&#x27;t. I find being able to feel the product allows me to better apply. I start by using a hand or body lotion on my hands. This important step prevents the tanning lotion to get into those places known for turning dark. Cover heavily until it soaks in. Then reapply body lotion until you see white under your fingernails and where your nails meet your fingers on top of your hands. Use excess to lightly apply to elbows and knees. Now the tanning lotion will not seep into these areas, since they are the first to be exposed..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting with the face, apply small amount on palms with a few drops of water. Dap cheeks and forehead then rub into face, using circular motion. Pull away from eyes and wipe gently under eyes and with eyes closed over eyelids toward ears, lightly covering outside of ears and behind them. Pull tanning lotion toward hairline; not away from it. You want to pull the product from the nose  and center of face area toward the ears to blend it. Pull product from nose area over jaws mouth and chin into neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put more product on hands with a little water and start between neck and shoulder in circular motion to blend with what you did before from the face, working your way behind your neck and back and front of shoulders. Apply more product to hands and apply behind shoulders and blend to front in circular motions. Apply more to hand and rub each arm, dabbing it in places, then finally rubbing it while twisting your hands and arms. You never want to make a straight line. Cover elbows last when most of product has been applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With more rubbed into palms, cover breast area in circular motion. More product onto chest. Now, if you want a tan line, this is the only time you will make a straight line. Rub straight across where you want a tan line, then pull product up toward chest in a swiping motion. You cannot get a crisp tan line, so don&#x27;t try to. Also, don&#x27;t wear briefs or panties thinking you can get this result; you can&#x27;t. It will clog where the fabric meets your skin and make it look unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the back. Apply generously to palm with a couple drops of water. Smear all of the product on the back of one hand, then use back of other hand to cover the back of both hands. Reach back and apply in circular motion to center and as far as you can reach on both sides of back. Then, reverse hands to palms and pull product down to waist. If you want a tan line, again wipe straight across where you want that line to be, just as you did with your front, then again pull product in swiping motion upward. Use your palms and back of hands to smooth out in the area between the back and front of your torso. Put small amounton palms again, wet if needed and reach behind shoulders. Use one had against your elbow and push to give you more leverage to reach further down back and blend in, then work in rest up toward shoulders, which you already did when you did the back of your neck and shoulders previously. Having someone else help you would be good advice here, but you can do it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For legs, apply product to palms with a few drops of water and dab thighs on sides and then calves. Then come back and smooth out in circular motion, leaving knees for last. Rub down to beginning of toes, but never touch them, If you blend properly, it will look natural as though your toes were in the sand at the beach. When you get to your knees, the product will be nearly gone from your palms and will look natural. If you want a tan line, circle your legs all the way around at the tan line point, then pull down in swirls toward your knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this is the trick to an even tan for me. The instructions will not tell you to do this. Do the whole thing again. Yes, apply another coat right over this one. This way, you will cover any areas you missed the first time and by moistening your hands when needed, will blend in the lotion from the previous application. This process must be done as fast as you can, but don&#x27;t let time stop you from being thorough and accurate. After a few sessions, you&#x27;ll get really fast at it. It takes me about 5-6 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately wash your hands with liquid soap up to your wrists, and just a little bit more. Clean well under fingernails and where nails meet fingers and knuckles. Then, wash them again concentrating on palms. Dab dry with towel, but don&#x27;t rub. Then, rub back of hands only and lightly over forearms, top and bottom, rolling your arms to get a very light coating on the back of your hands, without disturbing the product on your arms. Do not include knuckles or fingers. These tan naturally in sunlight anyway. Wash palm again and dab dry, so as not to remove the light coating you just applied to back of hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find later (hours later) that you have applied too much, such on inside your wrists (which is common), you can use Avon&#x27;s Skin So Soft and with a tissue, you can gently lighten these areas. Rub your wrists lightly together so you get a natural blending look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first time, you will see where you made mistakes (if any) and reapply later. As with any artist, you are \\&quot;painting\\&quot; yourself. It takes practice, but after a few times, you&#x27;ll be a pro. This is the best product I have ever used. It helps that it is not clear when applied (it&#x27;s brown), which helps knowing how it is being applied. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the lighter shades, because you&#x27;re wasting your time, money and product trying to get a tan. I use the darkest one available and it looks very natural. I typically use at night, so that the next day I can re-apply for a darker look or to blend any imperfections from the night before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying, be prepared to stay nude for at least 10 minutes. You can use a fan, but I prefer just to walk around for a while, but don&#x27;t do anything that would cause you to perspire, such as housework or sitting on leather. You can tell when it&#x27;s dry enough to put on some loose clothing. After about 30 minutes, you can feel free to put on other clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys who are balding need to do their heads also. This should be done when pulling into hairline. When product is almost gone from palms, rub lightly into balding area; it does not affect the color of your hair (at least not mine), but use sparingly and remember the circular motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to try it?

    <li> I&#x27;m a tanning enthusiast and have worked in tanning salon&#x27;s for over 7 years and have tried almost everything...this banana boat self tanner is my favorite EVER. I swear by this stuff. It&#x27;s tinted so you can see where your putting it on when you apply and it gives the best coverage and color. I am constantly putting it on all the time and layering it and it just gets darker and darker :o)     I recommend this product over EVERYTHING else. I think I would die if it was ever discontinued!</li>
    <li> I give this as a gift to my sister and she loved it, now she uses everytime she has a party in winter and she wants to look tan, works very good, the color is very natural, even though is deep dark it doesn&#x27;t look orange or false, it&#x27;s very natural.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant at first to get this. I tan but with red under tones. So i am fairly fair skinned.  But my friends say it looks good.. no orange color at all. I used it two days in a row for my legs.. and seems fine. Didn&#x27;t turn my ankles darker or discolored. This helps give me a psychological boost when jogging or running races. I look down and see muscle definition in my legs and it pushes me more.. No more laying in the sun for me.. hopefully no more Dr visits to get pre-cancer froze off my skin any longer to.  Banana Boat is the best!</li>
    <li> I really do love this product.  I had purchased this after reading such great reviews because I have had bad experiences with other products in the past.  I&#x27;ve used Tan Towels, Loreal Wipes, Neutrogena, Jergens, Versa Spa spray tans...nothing has given me as nice of a color as this.  Even my boyfriend said how great this one product looked - he was always quick to mention how orange everything else made me look.  If I had not read other reviews, I may have purchased the Light to Medium tint as well thinking the dark would be too much.  However, this was the perfect shade.  I made sure I showered immediately before applying the product, which is something I think everyone should pay close attention to.  In the past, this was something I had not done and I believe this has a lot to do with flawed results.  The oils in your skin will prevent the product from absorbing evenly and thoroughly.  Also, the dead skin you had will only come off the next time you shower, and your tan will not last as long.  I am not a fan of the tint the product has as a guide so you can see where you&#x27;ve applied it.  I find this unnecessary and just messy, however, this is not something that would take away a star in my opinion because the end result is just too great.  I had absolutely no streaks...because I have been busy and working a lot, I have not done another application and the tan is fading evenly, as opposed to other products I have used in the past.  Like all sunless tanners, it has the same smell, however, after you shower the next morning, you shouldn&#x27;t notice this anymore.  After my first application, I stayed up about four hours, and then did a quick rinse and shower before bed so that the product would not over-develop.  I also didn&#x27;t want the guide to get all over my bedsheets, including the smell.  So as a quick guide to my tips:    1)  Shower immediately before use, using an exfoliating body wash.    2)  Apply the product thoroughly and take your time, making sure all areasget rubbed in.      3)  I suggest only taking a wet wash cloth and washing the palms of your hands only.  I had washed the entirety of my hands and found the shade a little light on the tops of my hands.  I suggest just going light on the tops and making sure your palms are free of tanner.      4)  I stayed up for about 4 hours before bed, and just watched tv in a towel so that I wasn&#x27;t wearing tight clothing to rub the lotion in any areas and ruin the evenness of my tan.      5)  Before bed, about 4 hours after application, I did a quick body shower to rinse off the color guide from the application.  The color still did continue to develop a little more while I slept, and then I took another shower in the morning.  I had a great tan after one application.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I am always skeptical of self tanners b/c there&#x27;s always something wrong with the ones I have tried...and I have tried alot!  I will say that I am very statisfied with this product.  It gives you a true tan color and is definitely gradual so you can customize your tan.  I will say the only possible negative thing about this product (which I don&#x27;t mind) is that it does have a \\&quot;thick\\&quot; feeling nn your skin once you put it on that lasts for alittle while.  Overall, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;m naturally olive skinned but do think that I look a lot better with some color, but won&#x27;t fake bake and even feel guilty when I tan on vacations for the health of my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried Jergens Natural Glow and quite a few other drugstore brands, along with more expensive ones like the Tan Towel, and nothing compares to this stuff.  I think the main difference is that it&#x27;s brown, not orange, so it really does look like a natural tan.  Another perk of it is that the lotion itself is colored, so you can see where it&#x27;s going to avoid streaks.  It dries and develops fast, so if you put it on and sit on a towel or wait ~10 minutes, you&#x27;re safe to (carefully) put on clothes without staining them.  Another perk is that once you&#x27;ve built up the color, you only need to put it on 1-2 times a week to maintain it.  My main recommendation is to moisturize well on the days you don&#x27;t use it to keep it looking even and your skin looking healthy.  I honestly don&#x27;t rave about stuff like this but have recommended this to all of my friends (of varying skin tones), who also love it!  Just make sure to get the Deep Dark Color, rather than the other shades.  It&#x27;s great stuff, and it&#x27;s cheap, so try it out and prepare to be amazed!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  I have used some others and they don&#x27;t look natural. This one does!!!</li>
    <li> Am very pleased with Banana Boat Self-Tanner.  It is very easy to apply and it has not streaked like many other self-tanners that I have used.  Like that I can order this product in a pack of three.  Will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Based on the \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; reviews here, I purchased this Banana Boat self-tanner, and used it for the first time last night.  I woke up this morning to a lovely, dark tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I&#x27;ve used Jergens&#x27; gradual tanner and L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Glow, which both left me orange.  Tan Towels have worked great, but they are expensive, which is why I wanted to give this BB one a try. My skin is pretty light (so light that you can see my blue veins peeking through), so I was worried that the color on this would look unnatural or too orange, but it doesn&#x27;t at all.  It&#x27;s a very natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using the tanner, I applied a bit of regular lotion to my wrists, elbows, knees, and ankles, since those areas tend to pick up too much color.  Then I used [[ASIN:B0019R329O Safe-Touch Powder Free Vinyl Exam Gloves, Medium - 100/Box]] gloves to apply the lotion in broad strokes, making sure to use the palms of my hands to rub it in since using your fingers leads to streaking.  (I also used the vinyl gloves since I had read somewhere online recently that latex gloves may react badly with the ingredients in the self-tanner, leading to discoloration.)  To apply to my back, I used the [[ASIN:B001D8ZGAM AquaBella Easy Lotion Applicator]], which made it so easy to spread the lotion all over.  I let it sink in a few minutes since it does feel a bit thick, before putting on my pajamas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t discolor my pajamas or sheets at all, and was so easy to use.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t have that really strong self-tanner smell that other products have.  It has a nice scent going on, and the self-tanner smell is barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 6/29/10:  I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now, and wanted to update my review to say how much I still love it.  I&#x27;ve actually had people compliment me on how nice my \\&quot;tan\\&quot; is, which has never happened to me before.  I&#x27;ve also found that this fades better if you use exfoliating gloves in the shower every two days -- it helps it fade more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 7/10/11:  I&#x27;ve been using the tubes of this that I ordered a year ago since I didn&#x27;t use them all last summer, and they are still fresh in case you&#x27;re worried about getting three-pack. I was recently at Ulta (a cosmetics store), and the saleswoman there mentioned that this was was her favorite self-tanner of all that they carried.  While there, I also picked up two of their self-tanning mitts, and the mitts work better than the gloves I&#x27;ve been using -- and left no streaks!fade more evenly.

    <li> I have tried many self-tanners over the years,some of which are pretty pricey. Non can compare to Banana Boat Summer Color. It is so easy to use and is streak free, oil free, and dries very quickly. It does not have an odd smell like some of the others, and it is the only one I have found that does not make my sensitive skin itch or get a rash. It is very affordable at under $7.00 for a 6 oz. tube. I would be lost without it!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product. It smells nice and provides an even and natural looking color.  It&#x27;s easy to get the right coverage with no streaking because you instantly see the color as it&#x27;s being applied.  I am a strawberry blonde, fair skinned woman, and I&#x27;ve tried everything! Great product.</li>
    <li> I love the brown color of this lotion and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have the typical self tanner smell...buuut...the color migrates. After a day or so the color traveled from my arms to the creases or fold then there was a weirdo looking line. Also, not sweat proof.</li>
    <li> Banana Boat makes the BEST self-tanning lotion on the market - period!  I am a fair-skinned California girl - I can&#x27;t tan, but am obsessed with appearing sun-kissed, and Banana Boat is the ONLY product that always delivers.  Believe me, I have tried them all, including products that cost four times as much as Banana Boat, and none have been able to beat this affordable lotion.  I love it because it is very easy to apply - it goes on with a slight tint, so you can see where you are applying - and it rubs in smoothly, and without streaking.  I use GLOVES - this is key, as a careful application can take a few minutes, and you want to avoid staining the palms of your hands.  This product has a pleasant odor, and a few hours after application, I am left with a beautiful, bronzed glow!  People always compliment my tanned legs after I use Banana Boat - it looks natural but gets me nice and dark!  Love!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Banana Boat for a few months now and I had to get my new supply because this is actually the ONLY sunless tanning lotion that doesnt leave you ORANGE. That was my first criteria and Banana Boat meets the need. Well its relatively streak free if you are not too patient. If you really are careful and patient during the process you shouldnt get streaks. The way it fades away, well, thats like the only con because as the dead skin sheds, the lotion sheds as well so most places got streaks and dark/light spots. All you need to do is wash and scrub the lotion off and reapply. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As as self-tanning product, this product is probably pretty decent, probably worth more than 2 stars if you&#x27;re willing to go through the process. I would like to have a tan without sun exposure, but I guess I&#x27;ve decided that I just don&#x27;t like the process or the products in general enough to do it any more. The process part is slopping this smelly stuff on and then leaving it on and being oily/stinky for 3 hours 2 or 3 times a week. This product, as opposed to the other one that I once tried, doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling much after a good hot shower washing it all off. However, the smell does linger somewhat. The color looked decent, not at all orangish, but I thought that I put on a decent amount and didn&#x27;t get as dark as I&#x27;d have thought. I&#x27;ll try it again using more, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t go through the hassle of multiple applications each time. Also, I&#x27;m a fairly hairy guy but with very short grey hair. So, I had to do my whole head or you&#x27;d see a white scalp, and it used a lot of product to do my hairy arms and legs. I don&#x27;t notice it affecting my grey hair color. Guess I&#x27;ll just go back to being my pasty self though, as the hassle/smell just isn&#x27;t worth it to me. And, it is pretty silly being concerned enough about my color to do something about it.</li>
    <li> I finally gave up tanning beds a few months ago, and since then I&#x27;ve been using this self tanner. It is probably the closest thing you can get to a real tan without the skin cancer, and the cheapest too.     I have a light/medium skin tone. At first I used the medium color, but switched over to the dark color after about a month. I didn&#x27;t really find that the medium color was more orange than the dark as other people have said. I do like the dark color though because it gets you a darker tan faster.     The best thing about this tanner is that you can get a pretty dark tan with just one application. My goal is to use this all the time so I am always tan, but I&#x27;m a slacker and I skip it a lot, especially since it is winter, and let&#x27;s face it, you&#x27;re mostly covered up anyway. But if the temps are suddenly warmer or I want to wear a low-cut top, I just apply this at night before I go to sleep and I&#x27;m good to go the next day. After two applications I consider myself at my \\&quot;goal\\&quot; level of tan.     You do have a tendency to get blotchy/fade unevenly if you use this over and over without letting it fade some in between. What I do is I use an exfoliating body wash the day I&#x27;m going to use the tanner, and then until I use it again I use a moisturizing body wash. I can get by using it about every third day to keep up the color I want. If I don&#x27;t use it at all after about a week the color is about completely gone. (Not bad, I think.)    The way I apply it is like this: I put it on in my bathroom right in front of my sink and have a small clock in front of me. I apply it in five minute intervals, meaning I keep my eye on the clock and after five minutes I wash my hands, scrub them a little with a wet wash cloth, dry them, and then start the next five minutes of applying the tanner working my way from my feet on up, and then do my arms and hands last. After everything but my hands are done, I wash them one more time. Then I use those little cotton pads (the flat ones, not the puffy ones. You can get them at WalMart.) and squirt a little tanner on one and apply it to the back of one hand. Then I use a second cotton pad to do the other hand. I still find that my palms are slightly tanned, even after taking these precautions, but I just deal with it. I usually apply it at night so that way in the morning it will have been several hours and okay to take a shower. I also wear loose, dark clothing to sleep in.    I advise planning out your applications so that you don&#x27;t have the lotion on while exercising or any other vigorous activity. (Even if it&#x27;s been several hours since you applied it, it tends to make you sweatier and it&#x27;s just gross.) The tanner does have that tanner smell to it unfortunately, but it&#x27;s not very noticeable. It is tinted a little bit so you&#x27;re supposed to be able to tell where it&#x27;s applied, but it&#x27;s very hard to tell the difference sometimes. I also wanted to point out that I do not use this on my face. I use the medium/dark Jergens face self-tanner. It is very subtle but if you use it daily or at least every day, it gives a nice tan to the face that is good enough to match the rest of your tan.     For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat this self-tanner.</li>
    <li> This product is tied for the worst self tanner I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;On the skin it looks like smeared poo.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, you will have to stay home for 2 to 3 hours,&lt;br /&gt;walking around the house looking like poo, until you can shower it off.&lt;br /&gt;Meantime, it will stain your clothes and get on your furniture.  Avoid!</li>
    <li> I tried  Self Tanners, that looked ok the first day, redid 2 days later, and each time splotchy or not at all what you would consider &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34;. With a good brown sugar scrubber, then this, I get a nice even color that is not orangey at all. Lasts a full 2-3 days with me, where others failed often within just a day! Also it washes off of hands well with cream of tartar and dish soap, whereas some others stained my hands. Just make sure to do this soon as you cover your body with this. I find it easier to do arms last, and back of hands after using the dish soap and cream of tartar.</li>
    <li> It DOES streak ya&#x27;ll.....</li>
    <li> This tanner creates a brown even looking tan, there is a scent but it is not overpowering like other self tanners.  It is also moisturizing.  I typically apply lightly then wait a few minutes to dry. Once a week is good enough and it doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> This lotion does a great job of giving you a natural medium color tan. It can rub off on the first day you wear it, but it will wash off your clothes. So far this is my favorite tanning cream. I tried L&#x27;Oreal, but it left little glittery sparkles everywhere I sat. I use it on my arms and legs only and it helps to give a sun-kissed look to my pale skin. The package of three was here in two days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fair-skinned individual, the type that burns and then has a slight tan with freckles. I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for an affordable sunless tanner that did not look too fake. After researching a lot of different brands I bought Banana Boat Summer Color. And it fulfilled my expectations! I applied two coats and had a nice glow going, not too orange and not too yellow. It lasted for about 3/4 days without reapplication.  I did go in with low expectations, taking the normal precautions associated with sunless tanners. As other reviewers have mentioned, it can come off on your clothes after first application or if you sweat a lot. Therefore, I wore dark clothing after applying until I could shower. I also took others reviewers advice and lotioned my extremities before applying the tanner. This kept me from having crazy orange feet and hands. Finally, I&#x27;d recommend getting just a little actual color before using the tanner. It was definitely more natural on the parts of my body that had some color already.  Final test still to come... How long will it last on vacation, when I&#x27;m in the water everyday? We&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> It has a good price and does the job; however, it does give off that tanning lotion/tanning bed smell. For as inexpensive as it is, I would say it&#x27;s a good product. If you have not used self-tanning lotions before, it may take you a few times before learning how to apply and not leave marks. Be sure to wash your hands well after use and try to avoid the wrist, knees, and elbows.</li>
    <li> Based on all the positive reviews and price, I decided to try this product. I applied two coats and got barely ANY color. I really do not understand why there are so many positive reviews because this is a terrible product. I wanted to like it, but the truth is you&#x27;re getting what you pay for. The little color I did get looked orange, and my family did not even notice any change. I highly recommend buying a more expenisve product, such as fake bake, in which I achieved wonderful results. I can&#x27;t stress this enough because I had to learn the hard way: PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> For starters I hardly ever write reviews about products unless they are aaamazing or just plain horrible. I used to use Loreals Sublime bronze self tanner when that ran out I bought this product by banana boat. I must say it is by FAR the best. other self tanners give you an orange tint (which no one likes) this product does not. It is dark brown and thick like lotion not all runny like some. I like this product because it doesnt have any glitter in it either. Onces it settles in and the color developes it is a nice tan brown color. When i apply mine i mix with a little but of regular body lotion in my hand rub together and apply in circular motions. The circular motion and added body lotion helps to prevent streaks and lines. This product is the best. I will buy this everytime.</li>
    <li> This product does effectively darken your skin tone. However, it does not completely dry and rubs off on clothing, so I would recommend applying it at night an hour or so before bed. You will need to wait a long time before putting clothing back on. Also, this lotion will make your hands and feet bright orange if you do not apply other lotion to prevent it from soaking in. The tradeoff is having white hands and darker skin, so obviously the tan is fake. After a few uses the tan turns orange, and if you stop applying it breaks up unevenly so that you will be patchy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a self tanner that was tinted before (normally the lotion looks white) so when I squeezed this out for the first time and it was chocolate brown I was worried that this was going to be *really* dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, it does look very dark but that&#x27;s because of the tint.  The bottle says the tint is to help you avoid streaking, as you can see exactly where you have put the lotion.  The problem is, you need to keep the lotion on for several hours at least, and the tint rubs off on everything, so if you put any clothes on they will be brown. After you take a shower the tint comes off and your \\&quot;tan\\&quot; is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the results look pretty good, I put it on two days in a row to get darker and it started to look a little bit unnatural but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After going through two bottles of this I&#x27;m downgrading to three stars. It&#x27;s okay.  It&#x27;s just too messy.  Applying the lotion gets to be a real hassle and it gets on EVERYTHING you touch.  If you&#x27;re very pale, this can be too dark.  The biggest problem is around the hands.  It&#x27;s *very* hard to get the hands to look natural.  If you skip the hands, since the lotion is so dark your hands look very white and unnatural.</li>
    <li> I am 42 yr old woman and i have tried many of the sprays , lotions and even paid for Mystic tans.  If you use this : 1. clean skin well , i exfoliate first time. 2. wear latex gloves to prevent staining of hands. its really bad to stain hands.  If you do not naturally tan. Do not use this. 3. rub in smoothly and evenly. its not hard to do it is colored so you can see whre it has been applied.    But just wanted to tell everyone , if you have tried others, give them one a shot.. i just ordered 3 more bottles to do me through the summer.</li>
    <li> Every bit as good as the L&#x27;Oreal product at a fraction of the price. Buy North American! Down with France.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Filipina and Chinese, with a deeper brown skin tone.  However, I always wear jeans, so my legs are always a few shades lighter than my arms and face.      Most self tanners I&#x27;ve tried in the past just don&#x27;t get dark enough for me.  I want a self tanner that mimics how my legs would look if I actually baked out in the sun for a week.  This stuff is it!  Not organgey at all, very *brown* (which is how a real tan should look).    It&#x27;s a nice creamy consistency too, very easy to blend! :)</li>
    <li> I bought the sunless tanning lotion this week and the results are in. This is truly amazing stuff and works as advertised!    I&#x27;m a naturally very pale guy, as in Casper the friendly ghost. If you&#x27;re like me, don&#x27;t make the mistake of getting the lighter formula, the lighter formulas will always leave you orange. The dark formula will not. If you&#x27;re worried about looking un-natural or too tan, then all you do is apply ONE coat of the dark formula and you&#x27;re good to go with a light natural looking tan. I actually used three coats over two days (night-afternoon-night) and it looks amazing like I&#x27;m from the Mediterranean. It works on you for three hours and then you need to shower to wash away the \\&quot;color guide\\&quot; (orangey residue that supposedly helps you tell where you put cream on).    For people that don&#x27;t know how these latest generations of sunless tanners work, they are NOT dyes. These do NOT color your skin. They have a chemical which causes the dead skin on your body to react and brown. It&#x27;s the same process that happens when you cut up an apple and leave it out (the \\&quot;Maillard reaction\\&quot;). It will brown in the same way your skin will with this lotion. Your live skin cells will not be affected.     As a result of this:    1) it&#x27;s important to moisturize your wrists and elbows before applying the cream because they are full of dead skin.  2) the tan will go away as your dead skin naturally falls off so you need to re-apply often (once or twice a week)  3) your clothes and bed sheets will not stain because this is not a stain or dye, it&#x27;s a cream that reacts with dead skin    Considerations:    I put moisturizer on my wrists but still messed them up with brown splotches on my first coat. Lesson: put LOTS of mosturizer, and rub almost no cream on your wrists. I also messed up my hands because I overlooked putting cream in the webbing and on the sides. That left weird demarcation lines of dark/white that I was able to fix with a pomus stone and adding a second coat tothe white areas (the pomus stone is your friend!!)    I used gloves to apply all over my body, but stupidly I took them off to apply the top of my hands and also used my hands to wipe myself down a bit. As a result, my palms looked really un-natural after the first coat - I will not make this mistake again.    You&#x27;re also not supposed to put this cream in contact with your eyes (irritant), but I had to rub it very close after the first coat because around my eyes were white compared to my cheeks and it looked a little like I fell asleep in the tanning booth with the goggles on.     Also, I would recommend applying it in a cool place or have a fan on you. I was trying to work as fast as possible on a hot June night and as a result I built up a sweat that was a real problem with getting the cream absorbed. I also noticed that I was sweating a lot more with the cream on which made the problem worse.    Conclusion    All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this product. I will likely be buying 3-packs all the time from Amazon because I figure one bottle will last about at least 5-6 applications for a tall guy like me so a three pack is good for about 2 months, which at under 20 bucks is an amazing deal for a lifelong tan. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the \\&quot;color guide\\&quot; does not work. I can&#x27;t tell at all where I applied the cream and I have to remember or risk streaks. The real drawback is the same as all the other lotions, you have to rub this stuff on every week, but that&#x27;s the price to pay for looking good and not getting skin cancer.</li>
    <li> You will not find another self tanning lotion for this price and possible for any price, that does such as good a job as Banana Boat summer color self tanning lotion.......You must use it on a regular basis after bathing......Do not wash it off for several hours......Do not forget to wash your palms and in between your fingers as this product will stain.....Product may stain light clothing so figure out some way to put your tee shirts on with out touching the outside of the garment to your skin ..Fully rub the product in evenly and you&#x27;ll be happy with the results if the above steps are followed regularly...Smell is OK but a tiny bit strong like tanning products are.....No orange color....Get the deep dark color if you want the best results...Shipping was very fast..</li>
    <li> Bought in for my Daughter. She said it was horrible. Took too long to dry and was a bit streaky.</li>
    <li> I love this Banana Boat self-tanner. Stay tan all winter. This product is easy to use just make sure you wear gloves or wash your hands right after applying the lotion. I personally like it, because of the color pigmentation you can see with this lotion (most are white when you apply them) so you can make sure you have rubbed the lotion in without streaking. The self-tanner keeps it&#x27;s color 7 days so you do not have to apply the lotion every day, so stop laying out in the sun for hours when you can get the same result in 30 seconds!!! This product is safer than laying out in the hot sun anyway. I highly recommend the Banana Boat Summer Color Self-tanner.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this self tanner. The price is so great. I use it mostly on my face and sometimes I don&#x27;t even use any make up when my face is clear of acne because I think it makes my face look tan and nice enough. I&#x27;ve used other self tanners and they&#x27;ve made my skin look sparkly and felt sticky. This stuff rarely leaves streaks as long as I rub it in good enough. I mainly love it because of the price so I really hope they keep it at this price.</li>
    <li> This Banana Boat tanning lotion has some added skin coloring to provide a darker tan.  That is in addition to the basic tanning compound</li>
    <li> I do not like the fragrance and my husband LOATHES it. However, when using chemical-laden products such as these, the nasty fragrance comes with it! I like the color I get on my legs after shaving, using lotion, and then this product.</li>
    <li> Best self tanner available at this cost. I have been using it for years, and sometimes not easy to find in local retailers.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried self-tanners for years, after having bad experiences with the older ones that turned me orange. I&#x27;ve been going to tanning beds for years to get an even, golden color, but this year I decided to look into self tanners again in order to stop the damaging, aging effects. That, and I&#x27;m tired of the hassle of trips to the tanning salon, not to mention the expense!    After reading all the great reviews here, I decided to try this product. I was very nervous at first and afraid of turning a scary, orange mess, so I experimented on my legs. I bought some exfoliating gloves and did that before applying the Banana Boat. I was very happy with the results! Very natural, and not orange at all. So, next I moved to my arms and upper chest-neck area and face. I was careful to apply lightly and in a circular motion in order to avoid streaks. After a couple applications over a few days, I have a nice glow!    Some people have mentioned that they don&#x27;t like the smell or feel, but in my case I find the scent subtle and even pleasant. My skin tends to the very dry, so I actually like the slightly \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feel of the lotion after I apply it and find it soothing.    I love this product and plan to buy the 3-pack from Amazon so that I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of self-tanner I use.  Use it sparringly and rub it in well.  Wash your hands afterwards.  I just use it on the bottom half of my legs so I don&#x27;t look so ghostly pale in shorts.</li>
    <li> More is more with this product.  Apply for at least 3 days before desired result is achieved. Exfoliating first help, too.</li>
    <li> Love Banana Boat Products.  This tanner looks natural and does not rub off.  Their sunscreens are great too!  It feels good to have a safe tan for the summer!</li>
    <li> Banana Boat makes some good affordable products.  I had tried the Loreal self tanner, it sucked, sticky, had to dilute with alcohol and the little metal flakes are really annoying.  Banana Boat dilutes with some work for easy and even  application, without the sticky residue.  And tans nice too.</li>
    <li> Before this product, I used Sun Lab&#x27;s Ultra Dark Tanning Lotion. The Sun Lab lotion was good, but I felt like all of the tan washed off in the shower, because it removed the dark color indicator. After drying off, I felt as pale as before I applied! Big waste of time if it can&#x27;t keep me dark for more than 24 hours! Banana Boat&#x27;s Deep Dark Tanning Lotion definitely exceeded my expectations!     It&#x27;s a breeze to apply evenly, as long as you follow the basics steps to sunless tan (The how-to video for applying St. Tropez&#x27;s bronzing lotion gives GREAT tips on getting a natural tan. I don&#x27;t follow all of the instructions step-by-step, but it made me better at applying self tanner! [...] Deep Dark gives you a bronzey-dark tan in one application, without looking unnatural. It&#x27;s easy to blend, lasts for about a week, and the fade is pretty even. The color indicator is helpful without being too dark. The best part is when you get out of the shower the next morning, you are still tan!  :D    A few notations: while the color is developing, make sure you avoid water. Even after the lotion dries, if you accidentally splash some water on yourself, you&#x27;ll notice some splotches the next day. It does smell like sunless tanner after it develops, but it is very faint. Easily covered with body spray, if your rushed in the morning and don&#x27;t have time for a shower. Overall, I love this product and will continue to buy it. Definitely give it a shot!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best I have used since I started self-tanning.  No streaking and it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT, no streaking or orange coloring left on my hands.  This products gives me a natural looking tan!</li>
    <li> Used it for years. Best self tanner and 1/2 the price of &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; brands.</li>
    <li> I have never used sunless tanner so I didn&#x27;t even know where to start, so I read Amazon reviews. This one sounded good so I went to Walmart and got it for about $6 or $7. Im not pale OR super tan, I would say Im somewhere in the middle. I needed something since I have been in the house all winter with no sun and Im going on vacation next week and have to wear a swimming suit. After the first application I couldn&#x27;t really tell if it worked or not, the second day I could, there were no streaks. The third day I noticed I needed more on the backs of my hands, so I stupidly put on 3 layers, Don&#x27;t do that! I then could see the streaks and places I had missed like in between my fingers. Everywhere else looked good after the third day though. Just be careful around dryer areas like knees, elbows, and ankles.  Rub the lotion on other areas of your body first then use the tiny bit left on your hands  after each section and kinda feather it over those areas.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! 90% of my job has me outdoors in shorts and tennis shoes. I am pasty white and it takes me a long time to develop a tan, but this product gives me a healthy glow and helps hide my imperfections (spider veins, scars, etc). I can look tan and still use my 50+ SPF to protect my skin. I apply the product at night and when I wake up...there&#x27;s my tan! My only wish is that it lasted a little longer. I usually have to apply it after each shave which is about every other day. However, I never get the orange look and I&#x27;ve used both the dark and the medium. It&#x27;s easy to apply and drys fairly quickly. I haven&#x27;t found a better product (in the same price range)!</li>
    <li> Streakless NATURAL color without the unpleasant smell. Beautiful color. NOT ORANGE. And did not tranfer on to my clothing. NEW FAVORITE!! I have tried dozens from 50 dollars on down and this one is the best. I can&#x27;t believe how nice it works, for so little money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m confused by all the 5 star reviews because I don&#x27;t like this product at all. It barely gives you any color and what it does is just streaky. I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff ALL the time! It gives you the most natural brown glow. and it doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as most self tanners. I love it! :]</li>
    <li> If you are bright white you will get okay results, not the best but not the worse. If you have a base tan then this product is 5 stars</li>
    <li> I tried this self tanner about a year ago and had a HORRIBLE experience. It turned me orange, was splotchy, dyed every hair follicle--just awful. Read some reviews on Amazon and thought to myself, maybe I applied it wrong, all these people are saying it&#x27;s great color, maybe I got the light one. So I went and bought it in a local pharmacy. The second time, though not as bad as the first (because I only did my legs in fear it&#x27;d be disastrous) left my skin dark orange, dry, and stuck in every hair follicle again. This stuff is awful. I&#x27;ll be returning it today. Sorry that I wasted my time a year later only to have poor results again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great... easy to apply, no streaks, natural looking tan! and as advertised, drys quickly.  Very reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I normally use Jergen&#x27;s tanning lotion on my legs because my legs are dreadfully pale but my upper half is tan (whitewater kayaking). I always thoroughly exfoliate, apply regular lotion to knees, elbows  etc prior to application so t hey don&#x27;t absorb too much. This product was horribly streaky - I applied with ubber gloves, figured that was the reason for streakiness. Added regular lotion to try to improve consistency. It didn&#x27;t work. Despite applying sparingly, I ended up Oompaloompa orange. Spent quite a bit of time using lemon salt scrubs with loofah to remove it. Thus down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of tanners.  This one is awesome.  Low odor and great color.  I use a touch of it each day and I have my summer tan each and every day!</li>
    <li> I tried this after watching alot of great reviews...&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, it was easy to apply...I use latex gloves, with a brush for my hands. The color was great at first after applying...needless to say, the next day and the next day after that...my towel was BROWN also! It was wipeing my tan right OFF...very DISAPPOINTED!! Smell was fine, nothing that someone that has used Sunless tanners before, hasn&#x27;t already smelled! Don&#x27;t jump on this Boat!!!!</li>
    <li> I have pretty fair (pale) skin. I&#x27;ve tried to tan, but my skin only pinks and burns, even when using a tanning lotion. I tried sunless tanners last summer. Sprays didn&#x27;t provide an even enough coverage and were too oily, and most lotions barely tainted my skin. It took more than a dozen applications to achieve even a slight tan. I heard good things about the Banana Boat brand and so I picked some up at Walmart. I picked the \\&quot;Deep Dark Color\\&quot; hoping to achieve a greater tan with fewer applications. This worked pretty well. In about three applications I had a decent tan and was able to maintain it by applying the cream about two times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as this product worked, I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because it doesn&#x27;t have a very nice smell. Not that it smells bad, kind of like paint, but compared to some Hawaiian Tropic creams it could be more pleasant. Also, I think with more expensive and lighter creams that require more applications one&#x27;s tan could look slightly more natural. This Deep Dark Color Banana Boat cream needs to be applied carefully and rubbed into the skin for a natural-looking tan - and it needs to be used VERY sparingly around knees, ankles, and elbows, or it&#x27;ll darken those areas WAY too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, for faired-skinned use, I would highly recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> Great deal! I do a half-half mix of  this and whatever favorite regular lotion for my body (after exfoliating) and a 1 to 3 parts mix of tanner to face moisturizer for face, neck, and chest. Gives a nice subtle warm glow and is gradually build-able.</li>
    <li> Works very good, gave me a natural color, it dries fairly fast, and the smell is not bad. Everything was working really good, except for one thing, I play soccer, this thing goes off with the sweat and it stain my uniform (is white), I was sweating in brown color and my jersey got screwed up.</li>
    <li> Thank you banana boat! I am extremely self cautious and pale as a ghost but I took a risk and tried this and its amazing!! I will never use a tanning bed again... EVER. this lasts like 4 days for me and I shower and shave everyday.. It doesn&#x27;t look orange at all and I am so happy. this is awesome. I will definitely be repurchasing. Thanks for such fast shipping as well. (:</li>
    <li> I like the banana boat sunless tanner the best so far. It gives you a nice looking tan. I usually apply it every few days at night and then shower in the morning. You still have the sunless tanner smell but its not too bad.</li>
    <li> For a drug store product banana boat is amazing!  I have been using it for several months. I never noticed any streaking and the color comes out looking really natural.&lt;br /&gt;I read some bad reviews and have no idea how people ended up with orange streaks when the base color is green.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last too long, but I will try to exfoliate better and see what happens</li>
    <li> I found this at Walgreens at the very begin of the spring season.  I fell in love with this self tanner and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Since....I&#x27;ve not seen it on the shelves in ANY store around here, so I was really happy to find it online.  Banana Boat had a similar product years ago that got discontinued and it was my favorite one then too.  Glad they came out with a newer version.</li>
    <li> If I use this straight up it&#x27;s far too dark on my fair skin, so I cut it with Jergen&#x27;s tinted moisturizer and I get the perfect color.</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for the ultimate self-tanner for years. Recently, I have tried out a slew of products, including the pricey, messy and disappointing St. Tropez, Moroccan Mineral Extended Vacation, and countless others. I ordered this, very skeptical despite the glowing reviews. This product out-performs many of the 30-40 $ products, some of them by a long-shot! It was a relief to have the following in ONE affordable product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Easy application with color guide- but no gloves needed! (Just be sure to wash the hands a couple times during application)&lt;br /&gt;*Moisturizes yets sets in skin quicky- no staining sheets and clothing (FINALLY!!!)&lt;br /&gt;*Virtually streak free&lt;br /&gt;*Realistic, dark color- I reached a deep, dark tan after five consecutive days of single applications, and will maintain it as recommended (1x-2x applications weekly)&lt;br /&gt;*Color develops in only 2-3 hours, therefore can be applied several times in a day if a dark tan is needed quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*A little rich for facial use, and even with repeated&lt;br /&gt;applications never developed much of a tan on my face&lt;br /&gt;*I have had a bit of a tough time making the tan on my feet look natural, compared to other lotions I have tried (I usually apply moisturizer to the tops of my feet before application, then buff my ankles and toes with an old towel to avoid dark spots)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, though, this product is a new favorite- I also love Body Drench Quick Tan, but have found that the two work perfectly together- I just apply the spray tan occasionally to where the body naturally gets more sun (face, shoulders, chest, upper back), which creates a beautful and very realistic tan- one caveat of a lotion, is that it does not enable the \\&quot;sun-kissed\\&quot; effect of the spray which can be used to add a bit richer of a tan to those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: AWESOME product!</li>
    <li> This is the best self-tanning product I&#x27;ve found, especially for the price. It&#x27;s easy to use, provides good coverage, and has a pleasant scent. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and use the dark tanning lotion. After showering, I blend the self-tanning lotion with my favorite scented body cream and extra moisturizing lotion in my hands and apply. I don&#x27;t get a dark tan appearance, but I do get enough color to wear a dress or shorts and my skin is extremely soft and healthy. I never get streaking or uneven tones and the lotion lasts much longer. When I used the self-tanning lotion alone I obtained a darker tan appearance, but I had slight streaking and my knees and ankles looked dirty. I don&#x27;t put it on my face as it makes my face break out. I always wash my hands and scrub my nails with a nail brush after applying the self-tanning lotion because it stains nails, palms, and knuckles. My coworker said Banana Boat is the only self-tanning lotion she and her four teenaged daughters use as well. It provides me with the color I want without fear of damaging my skin. It is a very good product at a great price and I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I used tanning beds for a year or so because I am naturally super pale. I discovered this product when my aunt of all people looked surprisingly tan for someone who lives in cloudy Oregon. It hardly streaks and isn&#x27;t orange at all. Gives you a noticeable glow after only one application. Haven&#x27;t used a tanning bed since</li>
    <li> It works GREAT.  Color looks natural, not too orangey if done properly.  Only 4 stars because it&#x27;s full of parabens.  I should have looked at the ingredients before purchasing.  But it works and works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every way that I can think of to apply this and not have it streak. It&#x27;s more embarrassing to have streaks than no color on my legs for the summer, but I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Banana Boat Summer Color Self-Tanning for years, everyone thinks I have a Florida tan in December but the truth is I have never been to Florida in the winter because I have Banana Boat Summer Color to keep me tan all year round.</li>
    <li> Banana Boat Self Tanning Deep Dark is the best on the market regardless of price, I hope they do not get much higher either, I have used for years. Excellent product! I will continue using this Tanning crème as I have tried all the others and this one is still A-1. Try it you will be very pleased!</li>
    <li> Many self tanning products leave me looking streaky because either I don&#x27;t know how to apply them or they dry too fast for me to accomplish successful blending. This one so far is the best I&#x27;ve found. I am not too happy with parabens in it, but I can put up with it for the time being to look good. Darkening my body also helps with the look of my cellulite. If you know of any self tanner that is all natural, or almost, please let me know.</li>
    <li> Smells great, goes on great, non-greasy. The problem is - it does nothing. I am very pale with slightly dry skin so I should very easily get some color - but this does nothing but leave the guide on which only washes away. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this color! It is the only one that I have found that doesn&#x27;t make you look so orange. It&#x27;s really dark, so I mix it with a little bit of lotion to make it a lot smoother and less streaky.</li>
    <li> I love the ability to have an instant real looking tan anytime.  Even though I live in Arizona, I don&#x27;t go in the sun enough to tan.  This gives me a beautiful tan instantly!!  I buy lots of it, always available, best price out there...a little lotion, a little tan..voila..gorgeous.</li>
    <li> This product is ok.  It smells funny and does not give you a very dark tan like the label leads you to believe.  The one good thing about it was that it&#x27;s cheap, but that&#x27;s no longer the case since they&#x27;ve been raising the prices on this like every month.</li>
    <li> ships fast, smells good, goes on easy.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product the first night I got it, it is easy to tell where you applied it and creates a bold color that is very realistic. I have fairly light skin and after my second application my skin is very dark! I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything out there over the last 10 years and this is the best value and gives the most natural color even when I am starting off pale.  I like to buy a huge bottle of generic cocoa butter lotion and mix it with this when I&#x27;m first starting out for a gradual tan.  I hope they don&#x27;t stop making this!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb!  I am fair skinned and worry about melanoma and wrinkles so I don&#x27;t want to get to much sun.  This tanning lotion does not streak, does not have an unpleasant odor, does not come off on your clothes when you sweat, and lasts for several days!  I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> The Best!!!! All self tanners are kind of yucky, and I have tried all of them and keep going back to this one!!!Can not go wrong with the price and it works great!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m completely in love with this product!    Pros:  Fast drying &amp; doesn&#x27;t smudge  Just about perfect application every time  Golden, not orange, colour  Develops in less than two hours (for me, anyway)  Can use on face (dilute with a drop of water first)  Makes your skin feel super soft &amp; silky for hours  Not greasy or oily at all  Can&#x27;t beat the price!    Cons:  Takes quite a few applications to reach a deep golden colour (about 4-5)  Fades noticeably in two days  Have to be very careful around places like feet &amp; hands      All in all, this is an amazing product. Anyone should be able to use it. After about 4-5 applications, I just add another layer every day and it keeps a golden tan. You could skip a day, but I love how it makes my skin feel. My mother &amp; sister have already taken a bottle from me! It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used.  I apply this to my face every morning after shaving my face. It not only tans but also moisturizers my skin. It also smells good to, better than all other tanners I tried. Everyone asks me if I just came back from Florida.</li>
    <li> this was able to take me from whiter than snow to nice even sun kiss&lt;br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t turn me orange&lt;br /&gt;and was easy to use for even tanning</li>
    <li> This lotion really works well without streaking. The secret is to make sure you smooth it on evenly b4 it Dries. The color is good &amp; helps me look somewhat tan when I go to the  pool or beach.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price for a great looking tan.  Have used this for several years, don&#x27;t really like the smell but it does a good job.</li>
    <li> brilliant stuff! Easy use and long lasting, no streaks! Natural look! Great product I will use this for as long as it stays on the market!</li>
    <li> Banana Boat Summer Colr Self-Tanning Lotion works well.  My skin doctor tells me to stay out of the sun (too many years in open cars and outdoor activities).  This product takes away that pasty pallor.  Just be careful near any grey hair.  Typical of this type of tanner your hair will turn orange.</li>
    <li> It claims to be dark -- turned out to not work at all.</li>
    <li> So, I expected that this would be a typical self-tanner. It stays on for maybe 2 showers, looks a little orange, blotches a little bit, and gets on my clothes, even when dry. This is nothing like those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the deepest color because the middle is apparently more orange, and the lightest one is a little too light for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This self tanner is remarkable, literally. It looks completely real, only started coming off after about 6 showers, and came off completely after about 2 weeks of showering almost every day. It took 10 minutes to dry and didn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes. It is smooth looking and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied three coats (one every night) for 3 nights, and I got very tan. Whenever I applied it, I began to get frustrated because in my room it looks like it didn&#x27;t do anything--it appears very natural. But (since I didn&#x27;t put it on my hands) when I stepped outside the next morning, I would be astounded to see the dramatic difference between the color of my hands and the color of my arms. It made me look a bit like a bear because of the line, so I suggest to try very hard to put it on the back of the hand (because it is hard to keep it on when you have to wash the palms of your hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff lasts forever and looks flawless. Seriously...GET IT!!</li>
    <li> Consistently delivers a beautiful, natural color-bronze, never orange that I am addicted to. I used to fork out a bundle for St. Tropez and while it is an excellent product, too, you cannot beat this price for the same results!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this tanner.  I have bought the 3 pack for a couple of years now on Amazon, and it&#x27;s a great deal.  I use it every few days on my arms and legs and people always think I have a real tan. My tip is putting lotion all around my ankles, knees (front and behind), and then wrists and elbows. I rub it in real good before I put the tanner on.  It doesn&#x27;t help 100% with buildup there, but it does make it better.  These spots are rougher skin, so you will have darker spots here unless very moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this tanner and will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I could not find this in any store in my area here at the end of summer, I use this all year long to keep that summer look, it is easy to apply and does not streak.  Being able to get three tubes for a nice low price was the icing on the cake</li>
    <li> As I do with any product, I read the worst reviews first, and I thought to myself, &amp;#34;there&#x27;s no way this product advertised as DEEP DARK COLOR doesn&#x27;t show any color at all&amp;#34;. Well I was wrong, and to make sure I applied the product twice (with 10 hours in between applications). I am currently in search for the best &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; self-tanner (non-gradual) in the U.S. and so far this has been the worst, yes I am an experienced self tanner. Not to turn the tables, but L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Sublime Bronze Gel seems to work the best so far, and might have won my heart as the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve used in years. Back to Banana Boat, this product does not darken my skin and I am pale, Irish pale. It did at first, but this was just the bronzer that is in the product when it comes out of the bottle, NO LONG LASTING COLOR.</li>
    <li> Ordered as gift. Was well satisfied with the product. Applying is easy and go on smooth. I highly recommend this product...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I&#x27;ll give a quick review of some favorites, and tell you why it just so happens I love one of the cheapest brands the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Loreal Sublime Bronze:  Color: good.  Scent: meh.  Lasting: 4-5 days.  Fade: in patches :(.  Worst of all: TOO PALE.  Had to apply twice.&lt;br /&gt;-  St. Tropez:  Color: amazing.  Scent: yum!.  Lasting: 6-7 days.  Fade: evenly.  Worst of all: TOO PALE.  Had to apply twice.&lt;br /&gt;-  Fake Bake:  Color: good.  Scent: good.  Lasting: 3-4 days.  Fade: evenly.  Worst of all: TOO PALE.  Had to apply twice.  (And it takes HOURS to dry.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See where I&#x27;m going?  Banana Boat Deep Dark Color is actually... drumroll please... Deep and Dark!  It doesn&#x27;t fade as evenly as St. Tropez, but I don&#x27;t have to waste hours on an extra application.  Other tanners say they&#x27;re \\&quot;dark\\&quot; but this gem you can find at any grocery/pharmacy store is the only true dark I&#x27;ve come across.  It&#x27;s a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: dark, realistic.  Scent: Mild, you can barely smell anything.  Lasting 6-7 days.  Fade: in patches :( You must scrub and reapply.  The lotion dries almost instantly so it doesn&#x27;t take a half-day just to fake a bake.  I&#x27;ve used it - lightly - on my face with no bad reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO ACHIEVE THE PERFECT FAKE TAN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: This suggested process seems long, but it is not, it is just very detailed to ensure the process goes quicker.  Once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll be fake tanning in a jiffy.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need:&lt;br /&gt;-  A pair of gloves, POWDER FREE or your tan lotion will turn to globs and streak on your skin.  Try [[ASIN:B001QF7XLM Safetouch Powder Free Latex Exam Gloves, Non-Sterile, Medium]]for example.&lt;br /&gt;-  A sturdy back cleaner to exfoliate.  Note: If you have sensitive skin, it may be best you use sugar or salt scrubs, but my skin is not sensitive, and I&#x27;ve found that a product like [[ASIN:B001D9U07A AquaBella Long Handle Bath Brush (Medium-Soft)Colors may vary]] works MUCH better to exfoliate and smooth your skin for the fake tanning ritual.&lt;br /&gt;-  Tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;-  REGULAR lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1:  SHOWER -  Use the exfoliator of your choice (I suggest the back brush cleaner) and with mild soap, work the exfoliator in CIRCULAR motions around your entire body.  Pay special attention to dry patches, like elbows, knees, ankles, toes, etc.  If you&#x27;re tanning your face, gently exfoliate that too with a wash cloth or face-specific exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2:  DRY -  Step out of the shower, and blot dry your body.  Wait around a few minutes to ensure you dry completely, and open your bathroom door to allow all the moisture in the air to leave.  If you apply tanning lotion in a moist, wet bathroom, you will get streaky results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 3:  PREP -  Take any REGULAR lotion (do not touch your tanning lotion yet!) and use whatever is necessary to moisturize your dry patches: elbows, knees, ankles, toes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A.  Why is this step so important?  Your skin is thicker at your elbows and knees, and therefore absorbs MUCH more tanning lotion.  You apply REGULAR lotion because they will moisturize your thicker skin, and prevent too much tanning lotion from absorbing.  I think every self tanner has made this horrible mistake at least once.  It sucks to be happy with your fake tan.... but you have DARK ORANGE elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- B.  If you are going to use the tanning lotion on your face, moisturize your face as well with your typical face moisturizer, paying special attention to the delicate skin around your eyes.  Your face will also absorb MUCH more tanning lotion, and your regular lotion will help prevent any embarrassing patches or streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 4:  APPLY -  Now that you&#x27;re completely dry, and your rough patches are moisturized, put on your powder-free gloves and get to work.  I like to work from bottom up, with my arms and wrists done very last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A.  Why do your arms last?  Because applying tanning lotion to your body requires you to get in awkward angles.  I&#x27;ve found my yoga classes really paid off when I apply the lotion to my back.  This causes your arms to be occasionally streaked with the lotion because it brushes up against body parts.  Doing your arms last ensures you can rub in the uneven application of tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- B.  Use SMALL amounts of tanning lotion at a time.  For example, take a dime-to-quarter sized amount for ONE calf.  Rub that lotion in the broader areas of your calf BEFORE spreading the leftover lotion to your ankles, feet, and between your toes.  The residue lotion on your gloves is more than enough to cover the tricky small areas.  Now, start on the next calf, then your thigh, then the next thigh, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- C.  Now that you&#x27;ve rubbed in the lotion, you&#x27;re ALMOST done.  What are you going to do about your hands and wrists that have been covered by the gloves?  Grab some paper towels/toilet paper.  Remove and discard the gloves.  Wrap some of the paper around the tanning bottle to ensure you don&#x27;t get any on your finger tips.  Fold the rest of the paper into a sturdy square (or use cotton balls).  Pour the tanning lotion on to the square/cotton ball and rub the lotion into your wrists, the back of your hands, and LIGHTLY in between your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VOIL&amp;Agrave;!  Be sure to romp around your home naked for 15-20 minutes.  If this is too much for your significant other to handle without touching your skin and compromising all your hard work, KICK THEM OUT!  Tell them you&#x27;ll play when you&#x27;re done and dry.  At the end of the 15-20 minutes, you can put on clothes (or not, its your rodeo), and continue your day as normal.  Within 8 hours, a perfectly even tan will emerge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Note:  I recommend doing all this before you go to bed.  If you have white sheets, prepare to wash them, or just buy dark sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY TANNING!ing lotion to your body requires you to get in awkward angles.

    <li> This is the best product yet, I have tried many of the other brands and even the more expensive ones from the cosmetic counters thinking I would get better results, I have one thing to say save your money because this is  the best I have tried and it doesn&#x27;t cost a small fortune. It goes on smooth blends in well and the color is not orangey I would recommend anyone who uses self tanners to buy this one.</li>
    <li> and no sun damage.  I discovered this bronzer a year ago and I put it on daily now.  It moisturizes and keeps my skin a natural looking golden brown.  I never look unnatural or burned but always have a healthy glow.  People think this is my natural skin tone now.  Even makes your teeth look whiter.  And I never have to worry about sun damage or finding time to tan.  One tube for $6 lasts me almost an entire month.</li>
    <li> I just went out to lunch with my sister in law and she said, \\&quot;wow having you been tanning at a salon?\\&quot;.  And the answer is NO!!  I haven&#x27;t even laid out at all this year!  I simply use Banana Boat deep dark color every other day!!!  It gives your skin a beautiful color wtih out making it orange!  During the summer months I do apply more than usual on my legs and arms because I want them to look like I am in the sun every day with out subjecting myself to the harmful rays!  I will not use another product!  And the price is great too!</li>
    <li> This is my best kept secret! As a tanning salon employee, I prefer not to use the UV beds. I use this instead and it fools everyone! I highly recommend. It can be streaky, but rarely. I apply after shower when I am super rushed and rarely have problems!&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the pricing on amazon can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> This lotion has that same stinky smell to it as all the others I have tried over the years. Any slight imperfections on your skin will show up as a brown dot that is noticable. Other than those two things, the tan looks pretty good and lasts about a week. The smell goes away with the first showering and use disposable gloves for best results.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, excellent price.</li>
    <li> With any sunless tanning lotion you will get streaks.  This is very good quality and if you follow the instructions you will get a good coat and look.  I always have issues around my feet and knees despite using lotion and exfoliating, so I never expect miracles.  I mix this with regular lotion by putting a regular lotion on at night after my shower, then in the morning using this.  That seems to really help in preventing streaks or darker spots.  I also like the odor of this.  I used a sunless tanning lotion that I LOVED and never had streaks or issues with aside from the smell.  The smell was enough to deter me.  For the price, I am not sure this is the best buy but it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> Love this. I use this after my shower and it gives such a good color I look like I sat in the sun!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. It&#x27;s the closet thing to a real tan that&#x27;s out there. I get compliments all the time asking where I&#x27;ve been because I&#x27;m so tanned. It&#x27;s easy to apply and no streaking. I get a great looking tan without the worry of sun damage and no tan lines!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference with one application, you definitely have to layer it a few times before you get a really noticeable change in color. It smells horrible when you have it on your skin, but after the shower the scent goes away. All in all it was an okay product.</li>
    <li> If you exfoliate well, as you should with all self-tanners, this one is as good as the expensive brands.  I have tried them all.  Be sure you let your skin dry very well before applying, and disposable gloves work great.  You will have a deep, rich tan in a short time.</li>
    <li> This product barely got me tan. There was no &amp;#34;deep dark color&amp;#34;. Now I have a ton of this lotion that I don&#x27;t know what to do with since it&#x27;s not very comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought this tanner after trying Jergens and Sunlabs. Just going around and changing things up again. I have never been bothered by a smell of a self tanner...and Banana Boat doesnt really seem to have an odor to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a great tanner. I like the color guide. Blends in really smooth as you blend though it seems to turn into a clear color maybe its just me. But like the bottle says I did notice a darker tan in 3 hours and it looked great. I think when it comes to streaks honestly it just depends on how you apply it. So no streaks for this tanner.&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt tan your face as well or as quick as Sunlabs. I think with Banana boat it would work if you just apply it more often.</li>
    <li> This product works best on fair skin tones for a light tinted glow. I bought it for myself, and I have dark olive tone skin (Italian), and I saw no color change. I gave the rest to my mother (Irish) who has fair skin, and she benefited more than I. So, it is not for all skin as it advertises.</li>
    <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was when it faded off it left some blotching on my hands and feet but that is probably my own fault as the hands and feet are the trickiest to cover Other then that, for an over the counter product it was great and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Been using this for many years, rarely streaks, gives me a beautiful Jamaican tan....get lots of tan compliments.</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning cream I have tried.  It goes on easily and is a perfect natural tan color without the Orange look! It is tinted so you can correct mistakes before it&#x27;s too late.</li>
    <li> great tanner.  goes on easy and dries fast.  stays on for days</li>
    <li> I ALWAYS buy this at Walmart for 6.89 a bottle..NO shipping charges, NO waiting on Amazon to get it to me for a MUCH higher price! I love this product! It gives me the dark color I want &amp; lasts for a week! Only issue is it sells SO fast at Walmart, when I see it on the shelf I buy at least 3 bottles &amp; it will last ALL summer for me! A LOT of customers are buying this from Walmart for the price &amp; quality of it as I was told by the Walmart sales lady in charge of the Health &amp; Beauty Aisle! People..GO TO WALMART TO GET THIS!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of tanning products of all costs. This one works really well for me and it doesnt look orange. It&#x27;s easy to put on and it fades naturally, not in patches. I do mix a little bit of regular lotion in to have it a smoother application and I don&#x27;t want too dark of a color at once. To stop it from getting all over your palms when applying, put regular lotion on first and wait a couple of minutes to soak in. Then put on the tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tanner!!! It&#x27;s dark and it lasts a week! Most tanners are still really light. This tanner&#x27;s consistency is really thick and the next day it gets really really dark. I guarantee great results!! High recommend.</li>
    <li> Not streaky and can be used every day. Only thing is the smell lingers even after a shower. I always put this on about 30 minutes before bed and then shower in the morning so the color can develop overnight.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest and cheapest self tanner I&#x27;ve ever tried. I didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon because I randomly picked it up at Target one day. I have used body drench, and sun labs, which I ordered via Amazon. They are great, but surprisingly this is better. I have a medium skin tone year around, and was starting to look a little pale. It took me two applications of this to get to my desired shade. I applied both applications in one day though. This does not have that yucky snell, and didn&#x27;t stain my sheets or clothing. I mix it with some regular body lotion when I put on to help with streaking and even application. It has lasted for 4 days, with showering everyday, which is longer than I guessed it would last. I recommend trying a bottle to see if you like it, and then ordering via Amazon, because you&#x27;re saying a few bucks ordering three bottles at once!</li>
    <li> well it&#x27;s not perfect, but close enough for $8/tube. This gave amazing color overnight. Totally looks gorgeous. It has a light bronze color to start with that helps you tell where you have already put it, but I still managed to miss some spots and got a little streaking. But its not terribly obvious and I have an overall great color. Someone even remarked at work this morning that I am looking tan and asked if I had been going to a tanning bed. I put lotion on my knees, elbows and ankles before applying the lotion and didnt have any problem with them being too dark. Probably needed a bit on the inside of my wrists though. It felt a little dry and hard to spread, so I may lotion up my whole body first next time. This stuff smells amazing going on. It has the same tan smell in the morning as other tanners, but its very subtle and just part of the deal. I also purchased some xen-tan blending balm to help work out any streaks as recommend by another buyer, but I havent received it yet. I will update later if it helps or not. Overall love the color, ease of use, great smell going on and awesome price compared to other brands that dont work as well.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. Everyone thinks I lay out for hours in the sun because my skin has such a nice tan color to it. I apply this 2-3 times a week. The 3 pack was an awesome price and lasts for months. The only downside is the smell. Definitely leaves a tanning lotion smell on the sheets/your clothes..</li>
    <li> No rocket science required!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put hand lotion on before applying and afterwards wash them very well - result is no tinted fingers or palms. After application (several hours later) I found a spot or two I missed and a streak where it was applied too thick but the next day I applied a second time and the it really evened things out well. After applying I use a Q-tip to remove any lotion between my toes and a cotton pad around the edges of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there is &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; smell, but it&#x27;s not strong. My skin is left feeling smooth even without additional moisturizer. I apply in the morning and let it dry well before putting on clothes and I don&#x27;t see where it has rubbed off on clothing or bedding. For my face I mix it with some of my daily moisturizer and also mix just a dab with my eye creme. I used to be a sun queen in my youth and do have a larger spot of dark pigmentation on my face - for this I dab a Q-tip with moisturizer (which leaves a white spot) and avoid that area with the tanning creme. The result is that the spot blends in rather than getting darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not very experienced with using self tanners but this one is not expensive and very easy to use. I&#x27;m using the deep dark color and two applications one day at a time lasts me a week.</li>
    <li> I use this all over, even on my face, and I love the color. It gives a very natural look, not orange at all. Like any self-tanner, you have to be mindful on hands and feet, but if I put a little lotion on my hands and feet before I apply the tanner, it looks great. I haven&#x27;t tried St. Tropez which is supposed to be one of the bests, but for the money, I think this one is great.</li>
    <li> not sure why everyone rates this so high. The tanning part of it seems to work but it has the tanning &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; that a lot of products have and it is hard to breath during the following 6 hours after applying (for me at least). There are other products out there that don&#x27;t do that. If you only care about the tanning side then 5 stars might be right (as long as you dont mind smelling like dirt).</li>
    <li> Great even color! So natural looking that it fooled my plastic surgeon!  He was getting on to me for laying in a tanning bed and was shocked when I told him it was just lotion.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores!!! I was so excited when I found it here. I put it on when I go to the pool and it helps improve my tan to a nice deep brown quickly . A lot of self tanning products give you a orange tint but not this product!! I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> For 3 bottles of this, the price is amazing! Love the color, especially because I am naturally so pale, it doesn&#x27;t make me look orange. The smell is a little strong but is not as awful as most gradual tanners smell. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The Fiance likes it, and if she likes it Im happy. She has had me reorder it a few times as well. No complaints from her.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Using it everyday gives your face a nice skin tone. I&#x27;ve had several people comment on my tan :)  I just keep them guessing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of self-tanners and this one is by far the best! It is very forgiving with how you apply it, and it gives you an amazing, DARK tan. The only problem i&#x27;ve consistently had with this product is that it will sweat and/or rub right off in certain areas, leaving you looking like you&#x27;ve got some sort of strange pigment disease. I&#x27;ve noticed that the sweating occurs mostly in places where you sweat AND have something rubbing against you. Your bra-line and or panty-line for example. And it will also rub off if you wear something like sandals which have straps that go up around the ankles. Or even with sandals that have a thong look. If you sweat in ANY area where you have something rubbing against your faux tan, it will rub right off with this product. I&#x27;d have given it 150 stars if Banana Boat can get around the sweat/rubbing issue.</li>
    <li> there was another banana boat one-size-fits-all lotion in the past that was awesome. i thought this was the same thing in new packaging but this is not a good tanning lotion. if you are fair to medium tone it will turn orange and blotchy after a day and it fades terribly. i will stick with jergens.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased :&lt;br /&gt;Banana Boat Summer Color Self-Tanning Lotion, Deep Dark Color, For All Skin Tones, 6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not a great self tanner, I stand by my comments. I thought maybe it was the first tube but all three have yielded the same result. I find the biggest issue is in how unevenly the product fades. Even with proper moisturizing and exfoliation the color is overall acceptable at best but barely passable--- the best self tanners can be used repeatedly over time. This one really needs to be completely scrubbed off in between applications to avoid the unnatural orange tone that it will cause.</li>
    <li> I think I look better with color and this stuff is great. it doesn&#x27;t streak if you put it on correctly and it turns into a nice brown, NOT orange. i put regular lotion on first then the lotion so it is spread out evenly. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY with this stuff! I bought 3 bottles at once which is a better deal then you&#x27;d get at the store if you bought three, it&#x27;s 1 dollar off (which doesn&#x27;t seem like much, but things add up) and i can see these bottles lasting me for a while. i am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Puts on subtle color gradually, not overly staining.  Probably better if used on body too.  Highly pigmented lotions streak.  This one is more subtle.</li>
    <li> I am Irish with fair complected skin and I burn when I am in the sun or tanning beds, I try to avoid this like the plague and I know that it is much safer to fake and bake with lotion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a few different self tanners throughout the years (the cheap ones and the more high end) and I have been using Banana Boat Summer Color Self-Tanning Lotion, Deep Dark Color, For All Skin Tones for the past year and that is the only stuff that works for me on my very light fair completed sensitive skin... it gives me a tan where I look like I am Brazilian vs. Irish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did venture out because I had heard such great things about the \\&quot;Fake and Bake\\&quot; brand and heck the price was right at $13.30 a bottle regularly $42.74 a bottle (Yikes). At any rate, foolish me.... I tried \\&quot;Fake and Bake\\&quot;  and what a mistake!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it and applied it, I was really disappointed. I did the the proper prep work IE moisturize, moisturize, moisturize a few days prior... Shower, exfoliate, shave, completely dry off, put my hair up and apply with the gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLY HECK that stuff was messy and dark, it actually scared me to the point I had to call my husband in to help me apply it as quick as possible. His exact words were \\&quot;honey this stuff is a nightmare, I sure hope you don&#x27;t wake up disappointed and looking like a train wreck And I think that you need to stick with your Banana Boat\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dry time took Forrreverrrr with \\&quot;Fake and Bake\\&quot; too and when I was finally able to go to bed, I slept a full 8 hours and woke up ready for a shower. When I took my clothes off, my clothes were stained and the color completely came off in the shower. - What a waste of time and money... No one has time for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson well learned.... Stick with what you know works and don&#x27;t try to recreate the wheel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about Banana Boat - Bedtime is the best time to apply...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Banana Boat works well on my face too, pull your hair back andapply a dime size and let dry. I always moisturize on my off days and then I shower, shave, exfoliate, dry off really well and apply (rub in well) and let dry for 10 mins. Once dry get ready for bed and go to sleep, 6-8 hours later... shower off - it takes two-three separate applications to see a really nice Golden tan but you know it is working after the 6 hour mark from 1st application. Keep in mind... Slow and Steady Wins the Race with this stuff, but once you&#x27;re there... You will be VERY happy :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I have a really nice tan -  I use this product faithfully every other night IE. Monday, Wednesday, Friday taking the other nights off to moisturize and exfoliate to avoid build up etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ALWAYS apply it at bed time so it sets in longer and avoid any smell in public. And I always shower, shave and exfoliate BEFORE applying. ALSO.... if you are not going to use gloves... wash hands in-between applying, I always start with the top half of my body (wash hands / dry) and finish with my lower half(wash hands / dry) and apply a small dime size on your wrist and work in putting your two wrist together and gliding it across your top hands etc until dry. - this helps with evening your tan out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really cannot go wrong once you figure out what works best for you and the price cannot be beat considering this self-tanning lotion offers the same quality tan that other high end self-tanners do, but better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of Luck,&lt;br /&gt;~ SkyLee :)</li>
    <li> Today, I decided to try a self-tanning lotion my friend had recommended. I put it on, and decided to take a nap.</li>
    <li> Great self tanner and dries fast. Also a normal color, no orange here! Have purchased several times.</li>
    <li> This product is very good and does work, however I find the smell a little too strong. Worked well on my body but on my face I find the process is very slow. Would however re-order, I also thought the price was very good.</li>
    <li> Ok so I have used self tanners ever since they hit the market and I swear I have tried everything. They all had their problems and I finally gave up a couple of years ago. I got tired of putting in all of the work and getting, at best, so-so results. I resorted to using bronzers only since they dry fast and mistakes are easily corrected but that got expensive. This year I decided to give it another try and almost bought another brand until I looked around at the reviews for this one. I thought it was too good to be true but it was on sale locally for 6 bucks. I figured if it failed like I knew it would, no biggie. This, my friends, is one of those times when too good to be true does not apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color guide is something I require now although I know some ppl hate them. My experience without them is major streaking even after I have a strict routine to follow to cover without over applying (you can really make this a science if you choose to) especially on my shins and feet. This color guide is even better than most as once it dries, you could actually go out into the world if you had to and look like your tan is already developed. So it is kind of a bronzer/self tanner if you need it to be. It won&#x27;t look perfect but it could pass. Anyway, a few hours after I applied it, I noticed some streaking on my feet and shins - and I knew it would happen - so I thought it was a bust for me. Surprise! That was just the color guide. I was shocked and soooo happy when I got in the shower and realized that once that washed away, the tan really was even and the real color did not wash away. I am used to a lot of it going down the drain and leaving behind &amp;#34;tanned&amp;#34; joints and feet. Not this time. I have a great color that is even and brown! I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen myself this tan. That is way cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously - this stuff works and don&#x27;t be afraid of the &amp;#34;deep dark&amp;#34; on the label if you are fair skinned. If it will work on my skin, it hasgot to work on anyone. I can&#x27;t speak to how long one tube will last b/c I just got it and I don&#x27;t know how hard it will be to keep it from building up in areas like ankles and knees (becoming too dark and dirty looking) but will update. In the meantime, I am recommending this to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those guys who takes all summer to tan - basically my legs tan just in time for winter.  I&#x27;ve been using sunless tanners for about 15 years now, and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s as close to natural (ie, not orange) as any tanner I&#x27;ve come across (and without spending a fortune).</li>
    <li> I like to use self-tanners in conjunction with being out in the sun.  I use this product for that.  However, if you want to get some color in your face or other exposed body parts without a trip to the beach, a bit of this every day can do just that.  Of all the self-tanners, I think this is the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid sunless tanner user and I was so excited to try this when I saw all the great reviews. It does provide nice color, but it needs to be reapplied often to keep it dark. It doesn&#x27;t fade evenly, leaving blotchy patches of skin. Won&#x27;t buy again, I should have known, for as cheap as it is...you get what you pay for!!</li>
    <li> The best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I used to tan in tanning beds all the time, and it just wasn&#x27;t worth the skin damage.  So I tried Loreal and that made my skin orange.  So I tried Banana Boat DARK Tanning Lotion and it works so great.  The color is amazing.  It is not orangy at all.  I put it on after my shower and then I let it sit in while I&#x27;m getting ready and then put lotion on top.  I must say that it smells, but other people apply at night and take a shower in the AM and it gets rid of the odor.  Otherwise, you can buy this at Walmart for $6.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> wow, i was skeptical of self tanners. theyre always orange. i am very white. i mean, so pale i only burn. when the package arrived i showered with an exfoliating wash. after drying off i rubbed mosturizing lotion on my knees, elbows, feet and ankles esp around the ankle bone, wrists, hairline and the creases of my nose (these are places ive noticed the color gets a tad darker in and looks &#x27;dirty&#x27;.) putting lotion on first makes a lil less of the color absorb.  i had my fiance rub in my back, u need someone to help if u dont want to mess up. we used latex gloves i found in the cleaning area in stop and shop. much easier then washing ur hands every few minutes to avoid crazy colored hands. i did one area at a time until it was all rubbed in very well. at my ankles i rub onto the tops of my feet and faded it out. at the end i put a dab on the tops of my hands and rubbed together. a little goes a LONG way so this stuff will last! after i was done, i took a washcloth with hot water and wiped around my hairline LIGHTLY and around my feet and hands where the color ended to try to help fade so i had no harsh lines. i stood up for like 15 minutes with the fan on just to be safe. and slept on a towel. i woke up in the morning thinking wow great, after i showered, i thought it was not tan enough, but i put on lotion all over to help my tan last as long as it can. then i walked by my full length mirror...WOW! i had a GREAT medium tan color. my lighting is low in the bathroom. after coming home tonight and looking in my mirrow i cant believe this came from a bottle any darker would be too much for me, its perfect. and if u are olived toned u can build up even darker with another coat a day after the first. i washed my hands and feet again when i came home and it faded it a Slight bit more and looks even better. i went to a store i frequent a lot and the guy asked me &#x27;where did u go off too, ur all nice and tan\\&quot; i told him it was from a bottle and he actually said, \\&quot;no way?! it looks so natural\\&quot; that made it official. this is my new life in a bottle.  my fiance thinks it looks great and he was skeptical. its a nice brownish color, very natural. i got the 3 pack and i cant wait to get more for the winter( this will last a while tho!) i didnt have to wear cover up or anything to keep my face from looking washed out. i love it. i saw 1 or 2 reviews that said it was orange or too much, but i think those ppl probalby were just so pale they were not  used to seeing themselves tan so it looked wierd to them. im not used to being tan but i keep looking at myself and i cant believe how natural it looks. DEF try this one. its the only kind ive ever found to look natural. DONT get the medium/fair one. i think this looks so natural because its the deep dark tone.</li>
    <li> great product- arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> I am an Irish red head and while I actually can get a decent tan, I have to be in the sun for months to acheive anything dark. I use this every other day after exfoliating and each time it leaves me a little bit darker than before. It doesnt get me orange or blotchy so I love it. Smell is you tipical fake bake smell but inly when first applied. I use with bare hands and wash with soap and water when done and never had the colored hands. Perfect.</li>
    <li> good for self tanning</li>
    <li> RATED ONE OF THE BEST SELF TANNERS AND NOW I KNOW WHY!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok to put on a couple times in a row but no more than that or the skin turns orange.  It does come off on my clothes and sheets and yellows them-gross.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunless tanner on the market and it has a great price!!!!!! Forget the skin damage and buy this!</li>
    <li> I have used this from time to time to enhance my light colored areas. I burn easy and have problems with the sun and have to be careful. The only downfall is when you take a shower make sure you don&#x27;t use a white towel to dry off it sill stain it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Target use to carry it, then I found it at Walgreens and now it&#x27;s just easier and less expensive to buy several from Amazon.  Great product for instant, true color, even with only one application.  It has a slight smell, but not bad and it&#x27;s improved over the years.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best self tanner I have ever used! I started using it several years ago while I was pregnant and couldn&#x27;t use a tanning bed. Now that I am seeing the affects of all the tanning I did when I was young I no longer will go anywhere near one! This is the perfect solution and everyone thinks ive been tanning.</li>
    <li> This is the only self tanner I ever use..everytime I see it in a store I have to buy it. Gives great color, the smell isn&#x27;t too great but I think the color it gives is worth the stink :) Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> very good color, not orange, but it does wash off rather easily, jus re-apply after u get wet r u want hav the dark color anymore, great price too</li>
    <li> I was not able to readily find Banana Boat Self Tanner in stores so thought to order from Amazon.  I picked a winner at half the price at stores, got here in a timely manner and works just as well.  Got 6 tubes so that should do me for a very long while.  I only use once a week.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that does what it says it does.  I use it year round to keep a natural glow.</li>
    <li> Great color.  I used it on my legs and it keeps me looking tan year round.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this at the beginning of summer, as my upper legs and upper arms were a different shade than the rest of me. This went on smooth and evenly making my tan lines look flawless. A friend of mine asked if I was going to the tanning salon. You can put more on in a few days if you are looking to have a darker tan. I can tend to get rashes sometimes with various skin products and I had no reaction to this.</li>
    <li> This product is great!i use the light/medium one. I&#x27;ve tried this product a couple times without exflolaiting and moisterizing before application and omg I was orange and blotchy. But I recently tried it and exflolated with a homemade scrub that I made (1/2 cup canola oil and 1/2 sugar) and rubbed it in using a cloth in a circular motions. Then I took a shower and shaved my legs. Once I got out I applied lotion, let it dry, and then applied the tanning lotion. I applied it generously but made sure it was even throughout my whole body. I let it completely dry before I put on my clothes (10-15 mins) then I waited 6 hours, I know the bottle says 3 but just to be on the safe side, I waited 6. Then I took a shower and washed off the tanning lotion and my tan was amazing and even :) my friends couldn&#x27;t believe I used tanning lotion! They thought I just got back from vacation and just didn&#x27;t tell them haha</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful.  I can&#x27;t even comprehend how it got so many good reviews.</li>
    <li> no glitter in this one! and it actually works.</li>
    <li> Leaves a nice tint to the skin and not so much on the hands.  Be sure and put lotion on knees, ankles and elbows and you won&#x27;t get imperfections in the tan finish.</li>
    <li> Good color when first applied but when I showered in the morning, most of the color went down the drain. Hope to find a self tanner that lasts better.</li>
    <li> BROWN not orange!!!!!  Or green, I got this for my daughters wedding and it is really beautiful color! I put it on with I very wide art brush so it wouldn&#x27;t streak. The brush was about able an inch wide, this really helped make it look natural. I tried  l&#x27;oreal sublime bronze but it streaked badly, the color had a greenish tine too oh and it clotted&lt;br /&gt; too. The banana summer color is much better tan!</li>
    <li> Thus lotion is actually one of the best I&#x27;ve tried over the years... Lb</li>
    <li> This product DOES NOT deserve 5 stars ever, they are lucky i gave them 2.  This stained my hands worse than any other product in the world, it was very embarrassing.  The reason i gave it 2 stars was the color on my hands and face were decent and natural.  I however hated the texture of it, very thick and clumped all my arm hair together.  It made me worry that it wasnt on evenly but once its on youre stuck.  You can wash it off and risk a messed up tan or leave it on and risk a messed up tan.  So i left it and it turned out okay on my arms and face but the worst i have ever seen on my hands, no matter how hard you scrub they will be like that for at least a week.  This product reminded me of the stuff my older sister would use in the 90s, the stuff that would dye the collar of your shirt.</li>
    <li> I like many others, feel a little washed out and pale during those months when we&#x27;re not able to be out doors. This product seems to benefit me in three ways. It moisturizes, smells nice and gives a very natural (and not overdone) appearance to my skin. I&#x27;ve tried most of the major brands and after reading a review in Mens Health magazine- years ago- I tried it. I&#x27;m so glad to have found it on line. It seems stores like walmart only carry it during the summer months. The price on amazon was great. Since I only use this product-sparingly- on my face, one bottle lasts over a month.....And needless to say, no one has ever commented negatively on a faky orange appearance. \\&quot;have you been in the sun?\\&quot; is often the question i hear.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the color in my legs with this product and I last for 3 days! The only thing is you have to be very carefully with your white colors.</li>
    <li> love this stuff - smells great and lasts longer than some of the others.  I&#x27;ve avoided the spray-on for fear of the mess and breathing the fumes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. Fantastic price, it always is the same great product!</li>
    <li> Great product. I am a brown skinned woman and this &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; made my skin look natural, healthy and tanned. With daily use, also great for covering up small imperfections.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I put it on my arms, chest, and legs immediately after showering about 3 times a week. It gives a deep color without the &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; that some products include. It eventually fades in a mottled fashion, but another quick application will even it out. I think the Banana Boat Self Tanning lotion is great and super easy to use. I&#x27;ve read a lot of the comments here and I think some folks make this a much more complicated process. I don&#x27;t wear gloves, but I do wash my hands thoroughly immediately after application and I&#x27;ve not had any issues around my knees or elbows with color build-up. I do know however that the color is not the same for everyone, fortunately for me it works well and isn&#x27;t orange. I am glad that I can wear shorts in the summer with &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; legs in a safe fashion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pale and with this lotion using it once brings me to a nice golden tan. No orange look with this one. You do have to be careful not to apply another coat of it for at least 4 to 5 days because it doesn&#x27;t look as even in color sooner than that. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this self tanner. I&#x27;ve used tons of them and I always come back to this one! No streaks, no spotting color, no orange, just a beautiful buildable brown tan. I love this so much :) I always buy in packs of 3 because I use it after every shower!!</li>
    <li> This is a great self-tanning lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t streak,and looks very natural.  The very slight scent is very nice.  I&#x27;ve had many people mention I have a lovely tan.  Well - I can&#x27;t tan anymore, I damaged my skin when I was young from being a sun-worshiper.  So, this is the perfect solution.</li>
    <li> Not for everyone... yielded little or no color, but even after thorough drying, it stained clothes, bedclothes, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them, and this is the best for deep, dark, uniform cover.  I don&#x27;t use it on my face, just my legs, then the excess from my hands goes on my arms.  Wouldn&#x27;t wear shorts without putting this on first. Can never find it in the stores; I just hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
    <li> Not super stoked about this one. But I think the issue is with me and not the product. I am just too pasty for this shade. Medium is better for those of us who are whiter than white.</li>
    <li> I have gone to professional tanning beds, professional spray booths etc, but Banana Boat is better than tanning beds and just as good as spray booths. Banana Boat is  moisturizing, while it tans.   For one thing, the color isn&#x27;t orange or yellow and is quite long-lasting.    The next best thing to the BEACH is Banana Boat.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product.  I like to use it in between uses of my other favorite tanning cream.  Hey - the sun is bad mmmk - so sunless tanning is a nice way to have some color without all the skin damage.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for your face or neck as it can be a bit streaky.</li>
    <li> Love this product and adore the same product in spray...But this is the base tan...do just as Johny says in his fabulously detailed application onstructions...watch the ankles and knees and wash the hands quickly....then maintain and even it off with the summer color spray...THe BEST EVER I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL! Bloomies to HSN to drug store...this is the one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products as I am fair skinned and freckled and this gives me the most natural looking tan yet.  It does have a slight smell the first day you use it but I&#x27;ve found after one application I can go for three days with natural looking sun and people think I&#x27;ve been suntanning.  :)  Exfoliate and lotion on top of it and you will be happy I think.</li>
    <li> This is probably THE BEST sunless tanning product I have ever used. If you want to get dark fast without worry....this is for you. Make sure you rub the product in good though or else you WILL get streaks. This is easy to avoid. Just don&#x27;t leave globs on your face!  Also....I didn&#x27;t buy this off of Amazon. I bought this product from Walmart for $6. The exact same bottle, everything. I&#x27;m shocked that they sell this for nealy $20!!!   Anyway, try it! It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I honestly think it makes my skin look years younger.  And when I don&#x27;t use it for a while I notice more wrinkles.  Is that possible?  Great product.</li>
    <li> It really gives me a fantastic tan.  It is best to use it after my shower or bath when my skin starts to cool down.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this tanning lotion many times, always amazing color (no orange tint what so ever), I love it and will buy it for as long as they continue to sell it.</li>
    <li> This lotion gets on my clothing the least, yet it gives me the most color in the shortest period of time. In the winter my skin is bright white. I use this product for 2 days in a row and I look like I have a nice tan.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only self tanner cream that smells okay and gives a really dark shade and i&#x27;ve tried them all, but fades very fast and stains white clothes. musty exfoliate skin before application.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, really works. Don&#x27;t over do it and you&#x27;ll look healthy.</li>
    <li> Im pretty white and wanted to step it up from the &amp;#34;Fair lotion&amp;#34; banana boat sells.&lt;br /&gt;That was a mistake I looked down right silly too dark and came out orange because it was wrong for my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great tanner but if your fair skinned stick to the &amp;#34;fair skinned&amp;#34; tone banana boat lotion!</li>
    <li> I love the color and it last really worth the buy 3 at a time buy it great product...worth it!</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time last night and I loved it. I have always gone tanning in the winter but decided that at 24 years old it&#x27;s time to smarten up and start protecting my skin. I had used a more expensive sunless tanner over the summer but it was extremely thick, a pain to put on, and the results lasted about 2 days. I decided to try Banana Boat with some reservations after experiencing Oompa Loompa orange results from Loreal and other products on countless occasions.  Banana Boat Summer Color in the Deep Dark Color is excellent. I use latex gloves to put it on in circular motions, and it feels just like a lotion on my skin. I woke up this morning and I have a very natural looking, although subtle tan. I would expect darker results, so I think I will have to reapply and perhaps use more product. The color is very natural, no orange. The lotion does have that typical tanner smell but I have found it to be milder and less offensive than other sunless tanners. I actually can&#x27;t even smell it anymore and I haven&#x27;t showered off the product yet.  In conclusion, a couple of re-applications will undoubtedly give me the color I&#x27;m expecting, but the first application was easy to put on, streak-free, not very smelly, and an EXCELLENT natural looking color. I will continue to use this and recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> Love the Banana Boat Deep Dark Color Self Tanning lotion! No problems at all. Goes on evenly, no streaks, natural color and no problems with it getting on bed sheets or clothing. Super easy and love the natural look of it!</li>
    <li> I really like the color and it goes on without streaking.  Following the directions and buff when it dries.  The color lasts for days and it looks natural.  I have been using it for a few  years and I am very satisfied.  People always tell me how nice my legs look.  I use it to cover imperfections. I have tried others that cost more but this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I get compliments all the time whenever I use this product.  This tanner is the perfect color and looks natural on my skin.  (I am Caucasian with a brown hair and a dark complexion, with some olive undertones.)  The tanner is easy to apply and has never caused a rash.  It is better than any expensive tanner I have tried.  I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
    <li> To dark, made skin look all uneven and spotty. But does work fast......</li>
    <li> Good stuff - works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I use this product every spring and summer.... don&#x27;t have time to lay in the sun.... tanning salons are not safe... so to give my legs a little color.... use this product once a week...  adds just enough color so my legs aren&#x27;t stark white !!!  Doesn&#x27;t make me look orange.... put it on at nite so by morning I am ready to go.... don&#x27;t smell bad either....  :)</li>
    <li> I recently purchased bananna boat sunless tanning cream-i love it. My color is great (not orange) and i didn&#x27;t have to go out into the sun and ruin my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used many that was patchy,streaked,and smelled horrible. I love this stuff. I always prep the skin and put it on. It has a nice dark tent at application in order to see it go on. I never have streaks or patched. When it&#x27;s almost dry, i mix with lotion on the elbows,knees,and ankles so that I can evenly smooth it in. It dose have its light smell when most dry, so I put a sheet on my bed cause if your like me...I sweat, and you&#x27;ll have some tanned bedding if not. All in all, this is no joke, and it only cost $6.00 at walgreens,fred meyers,wal-mart. I would never pay $20 for it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I bought the &#x27;dark&#x27; colour (I&#x27;m not dark!) and it gives me a beautiful tan that lasts about 3-4 days. Reapplication is then great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> It seems good at first but the color comes off as you skin comes off.  As for the color itself, it&#x27;s OK and dark enough for me.</li>
    <li> I APPLY THE SELF TANNING LOTION FROM BANANA BOAT DAILY AND LOVE IT.  THESE TUBES CAME QUICKLY AND ARE FILLED FULLY TO THE TOP.  GOOD DEAL</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a middle of the pack product.  My chief complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold up during physical activity and sweats off discoloring clothing and leaving skin with a blotchy appearance. The problem is that even with the most expensive tan lotions it&#x27;s pretty much the same.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t go out in the sun, so this is a great alternative. Wasn&#x27;t sure about the dark, as I&#x27;m super light - but works great. Just take the time to rub in evenly....and wash hands thoroughly and remember age spots will darken too. Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> I finally resorted to ordering self-tan on the internet when I gave up on searching for a shade darker than \\&quot;medium\\&quot; at the store. The cheap price and \\&quot;deep dark color\\&quot; were literally the only two reasons I bought this- not because it was particularly recommended or raved about. However, this has since come my ultimate favorite self-tanner! It&#x27;s not a flawless product- it smells strongly which lingers on my pajamas(but only smells particularly \\&quot;bad\\&quot; when you wake up in the morning...) and it&#x27;s heavier feeling than any tanner I&#x27;ve used previously (although, the deep absorption definitely lends to how long-lasting it is) but on the plus side, it&#x27;s cheap, it doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, it doesn&#x27;t go patchy as it fades and it&#x27;s tinted to see where you&#x27;ve applied it. Overall, I would definitely recommend to anyone already experienced with self-tan and can deal with the typical drugstore-tan-cons, because it is an undeniably great value!</li>
    <li> Turns you orange. Smells decent at first. Once it dries it&#x27;s awful.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THE COLOR AND IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOUR SKIN.  DOENST LOOK FAKE AND DOESNT STREAK</li>
    <li> I read reviews saying this was the perfect deep color... I&#x27;m super disappointed with this product. I have extremely pale skin as I&#x27;m mostly Irish. This stuff barely gave me any color! It was such a waste of money,  and now I&#x27;m stuck with 3tubes of this crap. Also, it does smell! It&#x27;s not super strong, but you can still smell &amp; it never goes away. I use great smelling body wash,  lotion, and perfume &amp; you can still smell it. I just absolutely don&#x27;t like anything about it &amp; will never use it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works on dead skin cells so it won&#x27;t stain like other tanners. It does require some practice to get the system down but I followed on of the reviewers steps and it works good... mainly adding a little water as I apply. Twice a week and keep a minor tan going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Rector&lt;br /&gt;Author of \\&quot;A Painful Truth - The Entrapment of America&#x27;s Sick\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;(How Being Ill Got Me Arrested)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;HOW I REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;I review items other than books based on what they are meant and built to do rather than what I want them to do.&lt;br /&gt;I NEVER rate because of a fluke shipping problem etc. I only rate the item itself.&lt;br /&gt;I ONLY rate items and books I have used and/or read personally.</li>
    <li> I bought these based on the reviews and was not disappointed. I have pale skin but tan very well and I got this because I don&#x27;t want the harmful effects of the sun/tanning salons. Plus, spray tans are not worth the money.   I first showered and exfoliated (at night), I dryed myself off and starting to put it on. I rubbed in circles covering my whole body and lightly rubbing my knees, elbows, and tops my feet. As for my face, I rubbed it in as face lotion. I then went to bed and woke up dark! Not an orange dark but a nice tan that I would get from a tanning salon after 3-5 sessions. My feet came out a bit spotty but I used a my exfoliating sponge to even it out a bit. And I had one place I had gotten water on it and it was a bit spotty as well. So the morning after, I showered and evened out all the spotty areas I had messed up using my sponge (my feet and the spot on my arm were the places on concentrated on) and put another coat of the lotion before leaving work. And now 3 hours later, my skin is an even tone where I had missed.   What I recommend is just to avoid water after putting it on and also to put it on evenly. Avoiding putting to much on your knees, elbows, and hairline is highly recommended as it will make dark streaks. Also, watch out for putting too much under your wrists as they get very dark. I will skip doing my wrists next time I put it on. Make sure you rub it on your feet very well and blend it lightly as it will look blotchy. To correct any blotchy spots, exfoliate and the put in the lotion in the messed up areas.  As for the overall rating, as long as you follow the direction correctly and avoid any contact with water, this is an exceptional product and give you the tan without the harmful effects.</li>
    <li> I am ADDICTED to being tan! However, the tanning bed is inconvenient, expensive, not to mention damaging. I have been using self-tanning lotions for over 2 years on a bi-daily basis. So I know what I mean when I say this lotion is EXCELLENT. It leaves a very faint/nonthreatening smell, which is unlike a lot of comparable tanning lotions. It is also very light/easily absorbing, so you will not feel greasy all day. It leaves you tan; DHA (which is the ingredient that actually tans you)is listed second in the ingredients, so it is pretty potent, but not in an unnatural way. I highly recommend this product!  For best results:  *Apply after showering/bathing   *When tanning feet, use very sparingly and mix with regular moisturizer for best results. NEVER apply this lotion to the bottoms/soles of your feet. EVER!  *When tanning hands, also mix with regular moisturizer and use a baby wipe to get in between fingers to prevent discoloration  *Apply directly to face at night after washing your face (I have never had a problem with eyebrows discoloring, but avoid contact just in case)  *Use every 2 days  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> there are shelves loaded with tanners, I&#x27;m a yr new to testing out tanning products for myself. I have been to professional tanning spray booths which gave me a very nice orange like glow with noticeable streaks no matter how much I buffed and left my toes and ankles looking like that it had a yrs worth of dirt! I&#x27;ve tried countless self tanners. My issue is i&#x27;m very fair and most of the tanners out there are for olive complexions or darker. this tanner allows you to adjust the shade as you tan. my finished product looked like a nice tan it did leave a little too much around my toes and ankles but was adjusted easily. Great product and the seller shipped it fast.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS.  IT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT GIVES ME A DEEP NATURAL TAN BUT IT DOES STAIN CLOTHES SOME SO DON&#x27;T WEAR WHITE AND IT DID STAIN MY WHITE BATHROOM CABINET WHERE I TOUCH ALL THE TIME.  I JUST BUILT A NEW HOME AND PUT IN DARKER CABINETS SO I WILL NOT HAVE TO WORRY BECAUSE IT IS WORTH IT TO ME.</li>
    <li> Works great--no stinky after smell, no streaks</li>
    <li> The lotion is fantastic! Awesome! I bought 3 because it looks natural and perfect!&lt;br /&gt;All the color covers your skin perfectly. It drys very fast and it maintains the color for 4 days at least.&lt;br /&gt;And of course AMAZON always delivers the products on time! I love to buy with you!</li>
    <li> I have tried about 5 different brands (from drug stores) of tanning lotions. I&#x27;d use them a few times then stop because of the over whelming metallic smell. I tried this one based on reviews. There were several reviews claiming that this one didn&#x27;t smell bad or was less offensive then the rest but I&#x27;ve reached the conclusion that since they all have the same active ingredient, they all have that nasty METALLIC SMELL! The smell is never initial but after a few hours you smell like pennies and other people will notice it also! I had someone tell me they could smell it in my car and the smell really sticks to fabric. But as far as color goes, this one is great. I only used it every other day and it gave my yellowy winter color (I&#x27;m half black but fair) a nice healthy golden glow. There&#x27;s potential to get pretty dark when used everyday but in my opinion that&#x27;s when that fake orange color sets in. I also found that it was gentle enough to use on my face and didn&#x27;t cause break-outs. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again and will try Fake Bake brand next time.</li>
    <li> Over a decade of trying many different brands of different price ranges, and as an Irish girl with super pale pink toned skin, this lotion gives me the darkest results!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I&#x27;ve yet to find a tanner than leaves no smell (even after showering) and/or has an error proof application for leaving streaks once color fully developes.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin--but there&#x27;s almost always at least one spot on my arms that don&#x27;t take color no matter how much or how little or how even I apply the lotion.  This is the brand that gets the best, most even coverage, though.  It should also be understood that since I&#x27;m so pale &amp; attempt a dark color, streaking is more likely than it&#x27;d be on a pale skin person using a light-medium dye/lotion.  And yes--the paler you are, the more likely you are to resemble orange with most sunless tanners.  The brighter the light, the less natural the color IMO.  Also, please use common sunless tanning knowledge and loofah/exfoliate skin, espec areas that are more likey to get dry like hands, elbows, knees, knuckles, ankles.  All major joints basically!  And apply lotion to those areas before application. With that said, exfoliate on at least day two so that the dark color is removed/shed as evenly as possible (if not having a new application keep things even).  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING THIS PRODUCT IN THE STORES AND THE PRICE IS GREAT.  CAME BEFORE MY TRIP SO I HAD TIME TO USE IT!!</li>
    <li> I like this self tanner but it smells a little. No streaks and looks pretty natural. Smell can be hidden with perfume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month, and so far I&#x27;m really enjoying it. I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself a self-tan guru as I&#x27;ve only used 4 different tanning products, but this is a holy grail item. I&#x27;ve previously used Fake Bake self tanner, and while that smelled nice and gave me a nice color, this one gives me a much deeper tan. When I first apply it (use gloves!) it smells nice and citrus-y. Of course, that typical tan scent appears after a while, but it&#x27;s not that bad compared to other products. What I like best about this product is that it&#x27;s fairly waterproof. I wash my hands often and they&#x27;ll keep their color for a couple of days until I need to reapply. I found that Fake Bake and St. Moriz would wipe right off as soon as I touched water. I&#x27;m also enjoying the fact that you don&#x27;t need a mitt! Removing the need of a mitt simplifies the process of tanning, and makes this product so much more travel friendly. This self tanner is wonderful. It just looks like a realistic tan. There&#x27;s no scary patchiness and no obvious scent. I&#x27;ve been very pale my whole life (people would call me Casper in high school) and now strangers will compliment me on my tan.</li>
    <li> i mix this with my regular body lotion, it feels less oily that way and i think it speads easyer.  works fine plain too.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this stuff and she loves t the first day she was a lot darker and this was a lot cheaper than the other stuff she was buying and the other stuff had a dirty look to it but not this stuff this actually looks very natural she is in love with this stuff</li>
    <li> This is soooo nice! I cannot believe it works so well. I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to buy a self- tanning lotion that distributes the tan so evenly!! And I was worried too bc my skin tone immediately makes me look orange from any fake &amp; bake but this truly gave me a more bronzed look and not orange at all.. Would definitely purchase again in the future.Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This is a dark color as the product indicates.  What I like -  Deep color - No smell -  Apply with a glove or mit and no streaks - Good price - Can be used on face -  Is not Orange  It would be better if the tanning cream lasted 4-7 days but this lasts as long as another tanning cream so that is not a problem.</li>
    <li> I am very fair but two applications of this leaves me with national golden glow. It does streak if you aren&#x27;t careful to blend, but otherwise is pretty bulletproof. I enjoy the citrus scent and quick dry time. This is miles better than Jergens Natural Glow.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing. I guess self tanners have come a long way but this one tops the cake! I found a Zest body wash to exfoilate with, and I will be using this stuff all summer long. I&#x27;m naturally a red head and pretty pale, I did go to the tanning bed for about 6 weeks this year but I&#x27;ve since stopped and started using this. On my first applicaton I look the same as if I&#x27;ve gone right back to the tanning bed, with out the cancer! um can you say that is totally AMAZEBALLS or what !!! BUY THIS, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved the Lancome Soleil Deep Colour (orange bottle) for years, but after it was discontinued, I&#x27;m in search of a good self-tanner. Maybe this got good reviews because people just expect less from a low priced self-tanning lotion, but dang...I was totally disappointed in this &amp; will never buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had a nice color, but one coat wasn&#x27;t very dark. It was greasy on my face, so be careful when applying under makeup because even my powder couldn&#x27;t cover the shine. After years of applying self ranger tanners, I&#x27;m pretty good at the procedure (skin brush, loofah, moisturize, apply carefully around areas like the elbows, wrists, knees, ankles, feet, toes) to avoid the dreaded signs of fake tanners. But no matter how well I apply this, it always shows those signs. Plus no matter how long I let it dry, it comes off where my sandals rub it. I noticed it all over my loofah glove (a problem I never had with the Lancome)...so I ended up streaked after getting out of the tub. So whereas my Lancome lasted even after a bath, the Banana Boat failed miserably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted others to know my experience before they consider buying this...cuz I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s got to be better options. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I live in South Florida where it&#x27;s sunny most of the time. I use this product because it definately gives me a dark, olive tan. I love it so much I bought 3 of them online. I compared the price at the drug store and they were the same. I cleaneed out the drug store as well. If you want a nice tan and you have medium color skin this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest if you are fir skinned to get the same brand only in the lighter colors. A winner here.</li>
    <li> I really like this self tanner. It has a good clean but not overpowering scent and also adds moisture to your skin. Since I started to use this daily I use less of my regular body lotion. It does not come off on my clothes or anywhere else, which I have experienced with other self tanners. The only thing that would make it better is if the color was a little darker, after all it does say for a deep dark tan. But other than that I highly recommend this self tanner.</li>
    <li> I have tried all the self tanners out there...Mystic, fake n bake, bliss, St.Tropez, Kate wipes, ect...I was not going to try a grocery store brand because I knew I would turn orange! I was out of the fake n bake which I really do like so I gave this a try. I have to say I really like it. I have my old favorite self-tanner but I find that I keep using this one instead. I&#x27;m not sure if this one last longer or I use it more? Self-tanning use to be a big process therefore I would only do it maybe a couple times a week, but I put this one on every other day. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it at all, and drys really fast. It may be a tad orangey but I certainly can&#x27;t tell much of a difference between this and all the others I mentioned. I do not put tanners on my face...so can&#x27;t speak for that. It&#x27;s cheap and Walmart sells it! Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Tried many - great color.  Must be rubbed in well to avoid streaking (like any tanner).  Natural looking, great on the face daily.  Lasts several days w/o bathing.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!  I wanted a self-tanner that had color in it so I could see where it was being applied and not miss any spots accidentally, and this has that, so &amp;#34;check.&amp;#34;  It dries quickly &amp;#34;CHECK.&amp;#34;  It is fast-acting, &amp;#34;CHECK.&amp;#34;  Used properly, it lasts and looks great/natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to exfoliate thoroughly on the daily both before and while using this product with each shower/bath.  Yes, you must reapply because you will be scraping off part of the tan, but that is the beauty of getting 3 tubes of it, and the exfoliation process is KEY to getting an even tan with a self-tanner.  Go ahead and use your favorite skin moisturizer over top after it has dried for a while.  It really is &amp;#34;deep/dark&amp;#34; and I love that there are no sparkles or anything.  Also be sure and wear tight surgical gloves while applying.  You can then remove the gloves and take what&#x27;s left from your arms and gently stroke the tops of your hands to tan them lightly.  I then hold my palms together lightly and run them under water to remove any tanner that gets on my palms, dry with a towel.</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to use and the color is so natural looking. I&#x27;ve been a tanning bed tanner for years but decided to stop and go a more heathy rout...I&#x27;ve been so dissatisfied with other self tanners, but this one is the ticket! I&#x27;m using it for life!</li>
    <li> This is SO terrible. Do nottttt fall asleep with this on because you will wake up with huge orange patches. Its terrible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and have always loved it. Unfortunately, this last summer it caused a terrible and excruciating rash. I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ve changed the ingredients or what, but I am unable to use it now.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  Compared with other brands, this one goes on more evenly and works quickly.  I don&#x27;t feel that I look like I have a &amp;#34;fake tan.&amp;#34;  And it doesn&#x27;t turn me orange!  One tube lasts a long time, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought most every self-tanner out there, and this is the very best!  I only really wanted it for my lower legs because it always seemed like I was \\&quot;shaving off\\&quot; my tan because my lower legs were always lighter colored than anything else!  This product fixes that, and I like it all over, too!  You do need to be sure you rub it in good because later on you might see a spot that&#x27;s darker (back of ankles, side of elbows), but I keep a sponge/scrubber in my bag and just scrub a LITTLE until it blends in.  I also use the scrubber on my hands after I use it, especially on sides of fingers and palm.  Also, if you get hot and sweaty, the lotion comes off on your clothes, but I find it washes out easily, even in cold water.  Only need to apply every few days - great stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!  I live at the Jersey Shore all summer and since I&#x27;ve had a few bouts with skin cancer, I try not to spend lots of time exposed to the sun. BUT with this product, I had a killer tan all summer.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it&#x27;s not sticky....it actually feels moisturizing!!  And, the amazon price is excellent!!</li>
    <li> Goes on well and stays for two to three days with one application. No funky smell and no streaks. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Not &#x27;the best&#x27; sunless tanner, but I keep coming back. I have found I don&#x27;t get any streaks if I first opt on coconut oil out of the shower, then apply the lotion to moistened skin. I get the darkest and fastest results compared to much pricier sunless tanners.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s extremely greasy, never dries, goes off when you sweat, it&#x27;s very thick and worst of all, it&#x27;s an absolute horror to apply. It&#x27;s too thick which makes it impossible not to look streaky (I&#x27;ve been using self-tanners for years and know how they&#x27;re used). The more you attempt to fix it the more streaky it becomes. The only good thing about this lotion is that it makes you darker than most self-tanners, and also less orange (more of a natural tanned color). I would not buy this again. it&#x27;s also worth to notice that the same lotion costs half the price in the local grocery store :P  And also: do not apply without using latex gloves, or your hands will look orange for days...</li>
    <li> Love this product. It coat evenly and gets the perfect color I was looking for without fading quickly. A must have!</li>
    <li> Produce is for my wife.  She has used other tan products and feels this is the best.  The only draw back is that it only lasts for 2-4 days.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping and item as described...</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best for getting some summer sun color without the sun.  If you apply well, it won&#x27;t be streaky, etc. like some.  Plan to use at least two applications before your first summer viewing.  Apply sparingly in areas like ankles that have wrinkles and work in until dry before going out.  ALWAYS scrub your hands with soap and a brush immediately after application or you will have something really funky going on with your hands.  Wouldn&#x27;t go out in the summer without it.  Oh yes, you need to know most of these products are really STANKY, this one is not.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect if you have lots of orange-colored friends or associates. Low price and poor results sum it up.</li>
    <li> Not sure why there are so many positive reviews for this product.  I have used other more expensive self tanners and they worked quite well.  This made me orange....not flattering.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Almost effortless application and flawless finish. For my body I mix about 2/3 self-tanner with 1/3 body lotion to ensure smooth application. For face I use full strength and am careful to get my jawline and eyebrow area. After I am done applying I wash my hands and then take a towel and rub a bit around my wrists to blend the color so there isn&#x27;t an obvious line. With this easy method my results are almost always perfect. So much safer then a traditional sun tan!</li>
    <li> This makes you look so tan and it is very natural. It can streak so make sure to apply it evenly. Best self-tanner yet.</li>
    <li> I have to be very careful with &amp;#34;fake bake&amp;#34; because I have scars on my leg- I pre-moisturize the scars with moisturizer and have not had any trouble with the Banana Boat being splotchy or streaked. Being very fair-skinned, I tried the light color first and had almost no color change. I used the deep dark color and it looks very nice and natural. No orange!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, gives a excellent color at a great value. A little thick for the face, but great for the body.</li>
    <li> The lotion is brown so it is easy to see where you apply it and rub it in. Banana Boat is my favorite tinted lotion by far! Awesome for legs! I also use it on my face without a problem (usually on top of my foundation). Using it on my legs, I let one coat dry and apply another layer hours later. I use many fake tan products from neutrogena/loreal spray, which both have almost immediate results, but I almost always grab this lotion first. But if you&#x27;re looking for that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; I recommend this. Jergens does nothing for me.</li>
    <li> The color is great and the product is very moisturizing. It is good value for money. BUT - make sure you give it at least ten minutes to dry or else it will come off onto your clothes. I was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t give it enough time to dry and got it all over my shirt. It did come off in the wash - so the product doesn&#x27;t stain long term but of course, I wouldn&#x27;t want to get it on something expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Had to buy it here because 3 of the stores I checked were out of stock.  I get spray tans and this works just as well.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it is the only one what wont turn me orange and its decent price...I will order again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Airbrush version of Summer Color and like it much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very pale skin.  This gives me an orange glow.  And it washes away very quickly and leaves my hair follicles dark, so if you get close to me I look diseased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This definitely does imbue color more quickly than most other tanners.  The airbrush spray version takes 2-3 applications before I can really see it at all, and the can doesn&#x27;t last very long, but the color is brown, not orangey brown like this one, and it seems to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So once I&#x27;m done with this I&#x27;m gonna go back to the airbrush summer color.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of great reviews about this product and I have been dying to look tan, so I decided to try it. I am pale, and burn in the sun, so I was really hoping that this tanning lotion would be able to make me look naturally tan, and it did. At first I looked a bit orange (which many people said this product didn&#x27;t do), but after letting it sit for an hour, the orange went away. I&#x27;ve never had a tan in my life, and this product made me look really good. I got a lot of compliments. At first I thought I looked too dark, but I think it was just because I wasn&#x27;t used to seeing myself tan. After all the compliments, I decided that it probably looked normal. My sister asked where I had gone, that I had gotten such a nice tan. I&#x27;m so happy that I ordered the pack of three. It is a lot of lotion, but it will last a long time. Only thing I noticed, which might be normal, is that I didn&#x27;t look one color. One of my arms was slightly darker than the other, and my legs, albeit darker, were still light. So I needed to put on another layer. The different shades were subtle, and I have noticed that when other people get sun tan&#x27;s they don&#x27;t always look exactly the same color all over either, so I wasn&#x27;t worried. I would highly recommend this product. It is a great price, so that is a big bonus!</li>
    <li> Incredibly believable, streak free color.  I will definitely keep using this.  Very believable color and easy to use.  I put this on after a shower at night and woke up to a golden tan.</li>
    <li> For a package of three great price compared to drug stores and department stores!</li>
    <li> a little streaking, color and smell was great. Color lasts for 4-5 days if you do it right. Did not have the burning smell</li>
    <li> This is such a great alternative to skin cancer.  I use this all summer and sometimes in the winter, too.  Now, I don&#x27;t feel like I need to get a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; tan.  It has a smell and takes a little practice to get used to applying well, but once you do, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Being born and raised in Southern Callifornia tanning is inevitable.  I tanned in a salon ever other day while I was there.  Now that I have moved to the south. the tanning beds here seem circa 1970 so tanning in a salon is not an option.  I needed a product that would give me the look of a tanning salon without the risk.&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy to use and when used as directed does not give you the orange glow of the majority of products out there.  It sprays on smooth and evenly and does not streak.  Best part is it leaves your skin baby soft.</li>
    <li> I have to use this product along with another self tanning lotion to get a rich , dark bronze color.  If I use this product alone I get an artificial orangish-red tint on my face that does not look natural.  However, when applied with the other product the orangish-red color in Banana Boat enhances a very attractive deep bronze color to get that real DARK tan people die for.  I spend most of my time in Chicago but I look like a native from Aruba!</li>
    <li> This product is great when you want an instand tan! just make sure you moisturize your skin first before applying it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this self-tanning lotion. It gives me the golden brown look that I was looking for. I tried different self tanners, including clinique, loreal, and sun labs, and banana boat is my favorite thus far. The price is great!! It is tinted, so you can see exactly where you are blending it. The consistency is very smooth. The only negative thing I can say about it is the strong smell, which is normal with most self-tanners. I love to use this on my face, to get a nice deep golden glow. I usually use it every other day on my face, and once a week on my legs and arms. I always apply it with gloves. I highly recommend buying this! I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> The Banana boat Summer Color is truly effective. Just make sure, you apply moisturizing cream over the drier areas of your body. The product will be darker over drier areas ex. elbows, knees and ankle area - if you don&#x27;t apply moisturizers. The effect of the product, lasts for approximately 4 days.</li>
    <li> For the impatient person who has no time to lie on a beach. I use it daily for about a week before a party or event where I want to look tanned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very lightskin white guy, and I don&#x27;t have the time to go get a tan even when it&#x27;s nice outside. I decided to try this product because of the high reviews, and it is amazing. It spreads out evenly, it never leaves streaks, and its DARK. You don&#x27;t have to worry about it being orange though, because it&#x27;s not a dye or stain, it&#x27;s actually a chemical that causes a melanin reaction in your skin and gives you the closest thing to a natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me a month of traditional tanning to reach this shade, and i can even go darker from here. Incredible product, can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s fake.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on my &#x27;tan&#x27; all the time.  Others can&#x27;t believe its &#x27;fake n bake.&#x27;  I use it mixed with my daily lotion on my legs and arms.  Been using this and only this product for 5 years now. Be sure to use sparingly and soread evenly.</li>
    <li> Years back when I tried a similar product (\\&quot;Man Tan\\&quot; or something like that, as I recall) that turned your skin almost orange.  People would compliment me on what a nice pumpkin shade I had, great for Halloween, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much (and a bit apprehensive) when I ordered Banana Boat.  But chemistry has come a long way.  This is a terrific product that gave me a better looking tan than what I could get burning in the sun. Plus of course without the UV damage and companion pain/discomfort.  The only caution as some have noted in other reviews is to be careful around the hairline, especially if you have gray hair.  No damage but will leave some coloration that will wash out.  Overall, very natural looking and reasonably eash to use.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Lovely color, no bad smell.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great color,no streaks,no smell! Would definitely recommend and would purchase again! Very pleased with this tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought this based off the reviews I saw online.  I took a gamble and purchased the \\&quot;three tube special\\&quot; thinking, if the reviews are this good it&#x27;s worth it.  I was right! I have only used this product twice and already have the same color as if I had sat out on the beach for half a day - MINUS the sunburn and potential of cancer.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say it is SO important to wash WASH WASH you hands and scrub around your nails when you are finished.  If not, you will get that weird orange color happening.  Also, it seems to really dry out the skin around/under my nails but I have NOT noticed this anywhere else on my body (face, elbows, feet and other normal dry areas).&lt;br /&gt;I also want to point out you will need about 10 mins + to dry off before you put clothes on.  I tried to jip the drying time my first time and ended up a sweet underwear band mark on my lower stomach.  It \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; easily with my second application, but just a warning.&lt;br /&gt;Overall - honestly cant&#x27; believe the results I&#x27;m getting based off the price of this product.  Kudos to Banana Boat for creating this lotion that is JUST as good as any expensive tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever purchased (and smells A WHOLE LOT BETTER) than your average self tanner.</li>
    <li> So I didn&#x27;t order this product thru Amazon, but it is amazing. I put a layer on once I get out of the shower after I have lotioned my \\&quot;dry\\&quot; areas (elbows, knees, toes). I have also started using gloves to apply it just because I&#x27;ve never been good with scrubbing off the residue from my hands. Do exactly what it says if you want a darker color. WAIT 3 HOURS! I was very impatient and did the silly thing of putting one layer on my face and then immediately followed it with another layer. This would&#x27;ve more than likely been fine on my legs but you could see where I had stopped putting the lotion as to not get it in my hair! HaHa. A little scrubbing with a face cleanser took some of the \\&quot;orange\\&quot; away. I am a nice golden color though. I love it!!</li>
    <li> has anyone developed morgellons disease after using Banana Boat Self Tanning lotion?</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> I work nights and you can tell it from my lack of any sort of suntan. I use this on my face, as well as my arms, and it products the most natural color of any product I&#x27;ve used. Easy to apply and not really greasy. Just hope they keep making it in the future.</li>
    <li> I had skin cancer removed from my face 10 years ago so I am not allowed in the sun.  This gives me a perfect looking tan.</li>
    <li> So, this tanner worked great after two applications for me. I got compliments on how I was looking naturally tan. The third application though turned me ORANGE. I have very fair to light skin tone and this works, but do not use too much. You will not get to the third darkness dot on the front of the packaging. Too much of this turned me an unpleasant color. It also made my face break out, which lead me to not use it in that area and my face is still pale. I may look for a different tanner. This was OK, but not ideal. I&#x27;ll post a picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it comes off on my clothes and bed sheets. So be careful. I&#x27;d suggest having dark sheets and clothes while using this product. It seems to wash off after 3 showers or so.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, It dries to the touch almost as soon as I&#x27;m done applying it to my body all over. If you wait for another 10 minutes or so, you can put your clothes on that quick. It doesn&#x27;t seem to rub off on clothes like some of the other products I&#x27;ve used. The only hang-up is the smell while applying it but you will get use to it. It doesn&#x27;t smell after applied though. It does give you a great tan as many people have complimented me on it.</li>
    <li> I hate being pale,a dn I&#x27;m as pale as a ghost.  That being said, I love this.  I&#x27;ve tried every kind, every brand, spray tanning salons, everything, and have been using this now for at least 5 years.  Here are my likes &amp; don&#x27;t likes: LIKES: 1) It tans a nice deep, rich, realistic tan, 2) it is very economical, 3) I can apply it in the privacy of my own home without going to a tanning salon, 4) I can apply all over or only touch up certain areas as needed, 5) it&#x27;s tinted so I can see where I&#x27;ve applied it 6) it&#x27;s easy to apply and get even  DON&#x27;T LIKES: 1) It comes off on your sheets or clothing if you don&#x27;t shower before climbing into bed, which you can&#x27;t do if you apply it before bed.  It will come off the same way on your clothing if you don&#x27;t shower before dressing, so that leaves no time of the day to apply it without staining either my sheets or my clothes, so I choose to stain my sheets.  I wash my sheets, but I use white sheets so after awhile, even after bleaching, they are dingy.  (I could just get dark sheets I guess).  2) Likewise, if you sweat a lot and rub a towel on it, it will show up on the towel.  When you go to the doctor, if they take blood and rub your arm with alcohol, it shows.  No biggie for me, just letting you know.  At times, I have sweated it onto the collar of a white blouse, and it can be difficult to remove entirely, depending on the fabric.  The pros outweigh the cons for me, and the color hides a multitude of skin imperfections, such as light acne, uneven skin tone, spider veins, helps cover (not entirely cover) scars, dark under-eye circles, sunburns, freckles, AGE SPOTS, bruises, varicose veins, (and for you younger folks...*hickeys*).  Like I said on the latter items, it might not cover some of them completely, but it does do a lot to conceal.</li>
    <li> This tanner is my favorite ever. Well, was until I started to educate myself about the dangers of parabens in cosmetics and this product especially seeps into every pore on your body. BANANA Boat, if you&#x27;re reading please rework your formula!!!! You use way too many types of parabens.</li>
    <li> I use this in place of the sun as the sun is not good for anyone.  Yet I don&#x27;t want to appear corpse like.  This is a GREAT alternative.  The down side is that it has&lt;br /&gt;an orangy appearance.  Looks great in the shade or at night..</li>
    <li> I do like the tan from this product! Will buy it again! Can be streaky if not careful. I will admit I&#x27;ve not been the most careful putting it on, but I like it and I&#x27;m not orange.</li>
    <li> provides a nice color; easy to see where I have applied it. The color seems to last a few days, too.</li>
    <li> this stuff doesn&#x27;t work it leaves you really orange literally its a big nooooooooo</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; fabulous price.</li>
    <li> The stuff works great if you can use it.  It does not stain your clothes.  That being said I must have an allergy to the stuff because i developed a condition where my eyelids would get all red and puffy,... even without putting it on my face.  At one point I ended up at an ophthalmologist because I developed blocked tear ducts which looks alot like pink-eye.  I know its the lotion because its happened multiple times since I figured out the connection between my condition and the lotion.  That beings said I like everything else about the product.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Nice color&lt;br /&gt;2. Lasts a week or longer&lt;br /&gt;3. Very natural looking color&lt;br /&gt;4. Darkness of tan develops to fit your skin color&lt;br /&gt;5. Not messy&lt;br /&gt;6. Doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Revolting and terrible smell that lingers even after the tan has faded&lt;br /&gt;2. stains extremely easily&lt;br /&gt;3. even if you scrub your hands they still turn orange&lt;br /&gt;4. streaks easily&lt;br /&gt;5. takes a long time to rub in completely&lt;br /&gt;6. takes a long time to dry&lt;br /&gt;7. its very hard to get an even application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you try really hard to get it on right, this tanning lotion is good appearance wise. However, the smell it leaves when you put it on is terrible. I would describe it as old french fries that got left in a hot car. Even if you shower every day the smell will still stick until the tan is completely gone.</li>
    <li> I bought this originally because I am a) on a very tight budget and this is reasonable in price, and b) it had good reviews on every site I went to.  I&#x27;ve used Jergens (and despised it, because the product broke me out and I am NOT acne-prone); BE Faux Tan (overpriced and underwhelming); St. Tropez (which I love but cannot currently afford for the amount I go through during the spring and summer), and a few other products over the years that probably aren&#x27;t even made anymore.  One was from Avon, many moons ago.  I would say overall, this one really is the best.  Even if I had the money to go back to buying St. Tropez, I probably would not do so, although ST gives a bit more brown and natural a tan once the color is well-established.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fair-skinned with a cool undertone (pink/blue), have turquoise-blue eyes, and dark blonde hair.  I don&#x27;t mind my pale skin in the fall and winter, but come spring, this is my go-to product for a faux tan.  I do not use this product to the point where I will look like a Brazilian babe.  It probably COULD get me that dark, but in the past I&#x27;ve found going that dark to be very odd-looking with my natural eye and hair coloring.  This product turns me from wearing the very lightest and cool- or neutral-toned (never warm-toned) foundation sold into a medium-skinned lady, and very quickly at that.  So that you have an example of the skintone difference- Revlon Shade 001 PhotoReady Foundation, typically not available in stores because it is such a light shade that few people wear it, is what I have to buy normally.  If I don&#x27;t allow it to dry an hour or more (and I often don&#x27;t), I may add a drop or two of Revlon SkinLights in Bronze to Revlon&#x27;s PhotoReady Shade 006 Foundation to up the &amp;#34;bronze-y&amp;#34; factor.  If I apply two coats in one day, it will turn me truly &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;, which for me means I&#x27;m wearing Revlon&#x27;s PhotoReady Shade 008 Foundation.  If you are not starting out with &amp;uuml;ber-pale skin like me and/or you are sunning outside regularly, you&#x27;ll probably get quite a bit darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re-applying will depend on how dark you want to stay, how active you are, how dark you are to begin with, how much you bathe and/or sweat, etc.  To stay what is, for me, really tan, daily re-application would be required, twice daily on the face (yes, I&#x27;m that pale).  I&#x27;m fine with staying in the medium range, though, and so the following is what keeps me in that skintone.  I find that I must re-apply this more often on the face, tops of my feet, and my hands.  On my face, I typically apply it once a day, prior to applying my makeup in the a.m.  Because the hands are washed more often, then of course this will fade a bit faster on most people there- for me, it means I re-apply it every two to three days there.  The tops of my feet also fade more, probably because I work out daily and the friction of my workout shoes and socks rubs the product off somewhat.  While on the body I can get away with once a week application, the tops of my feet also need retouching every three days or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought three bottles back in early April.  It is now the end of August, and I&#x27;m using the third bottle that came in April now.  This is with daily use on the face and one to two times a week elsewhere- so I&#x27;d say it lasts awhile!  Considering the cost, that is very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I ADORE about this product is how little it transfers onto clothing, sheets, towels, and other such items once it&#x27;s allowed to dry on the skin.  Most self-tanners I&#x27;ve used leave a terrible amount of bronze coloring on pillowcases and such.  Not this!  Again, for the price that is incredibly nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does have some drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The smell while it&#x27;s drying and for several hours afterwards on the skin.  I don&#x27;t notice any bad smell out of the bottle; only once it&#x27;s sat on the skin for a bit.  If you just use it on the face (which I do almost daily, and it never breaks me outor clogs my pores), the smell is hardly even there.  But put it all over, and you&#x27;ll detect it.  Have the perfume and scented deodorant ready!  It&#x27;s not the worst I&#x27;ve ever used, but it is especially harsh on application day, and can make me a little self-conscious if I put it on the day of a big event or a date.  I do not notice it the days after application, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that said, I&#x27;ve never had any complaints from anyone about the scent of it when they&#x27;re around me, so maybe it&#x27;s not bad.  I do know it is FAR better than Bare Escentuals Faux Tan (which is far more costly and fades much worse than this), which was so bad that the second any water hit my skin (shower, swimming pool, etc.) the fake tan product odor became INSTANTLY apparent!  Talk about nerve-wracking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  The fade can be patchy.  Again, not the worst I&#x27;ve seen, but it&#x27;s not the best.  I&#x27;d say that St. Tropez&#x27;s self-tanner was the best-smelling, had the most natural color, and faded a bit better than this.  However, it is FAR more expensive and doesn&#x27;t get me as dark nearly as fast as this does.  It also doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as Banana Boat&#x27;s, and wears off A LOT more on sheets and clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) If not completely dry yet (as in not already on the skin SEVERAL hours), it will stain your towels and such when you dry your hands after washing.  It does stain my towel a bit at night after I&#x27;ve removed my makeup and washed my face, but then I do apply the Banana Boat tanner daily to my face, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) While I like the look healthy and glowing in this, and everyone else who&#x27;s seen me in it says I look great with it on, I cannot say it is quite the same as a natural tan.  I do not get the, &amp;#34;Where did you go to the beach?&amp;#34;-type comments with this very often.  I try my best between this and my makeup to make it look natural, and I get very close, but I know it&#x27;s not quite like a real suntan.  It is a bit more medium-toned, a tad more orange, and not quite as natural-looking as a real tan on ME as a real tan would be.  (This may not be true for those with a different natural coloring to start with, though.)  The closest to that real suntan look which I&#x27;ve found is to apply St. Tropez&#x27;s self-tanner, with a tad of BE&#x27;s &amp;#34;A Little Sun&amp;#34; sprinkled on the skin for that red-brown touch on the shoulders and other places where the sun hits the heaviest.  However, that look costs a lot more to obtain!  This and my current makeup gives me more of a look like the fitness-buff ladies get in Oxygen magazine.  It can&#x27;t make me look like Christie Brinkley in &amp;#34;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&amp;#34;- I wish it did! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this review will help other fair-skinned souls out there if they want to buy this or not. :)or clogs my pores), the smell is hardly even there.

It can&#x27;t make me look like Christie Brinkley in &amp;#34;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&amp;#34;- I wish it did! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this review will help other fair-skinned souls out there if they want to buy this or not. :)</li>
    <li> Just rate the product middle of the road ..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 years. I use it on my legs and stomach. The color it gives you is awesome! It makes your skin look tan, smooth and healthy and covers up imperfections in the skin. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with streaking. I just use a little in one area and rub it in really good.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, I&#x27;ve  used it for years.</li>
    <li> Amazingly beautiful - I love the colour and it dries fast too!</li>
    <li> I really like this sunless tanner.  I have fair skin and use the deep dark color.  I find it works best when I have a bit of a natural color but I have dark hair and so people always assume I am naturally dark skinned.  The only reason I give it 3 stars is there is a bit of a smell and I have found another dark tanner I like better (Sunlabs- less chemicals, better smell, darker color).  I have tried a lot of different products though and of all the &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; tanners I have found this to be the best.  It also mixes well with lotion if you want build a gradual tan.</li>
    <li> Works very very well. Smells funky, very thick, but dark enough to notice what areas I missed etc. would recommend!</li>
    <li> I have used several self-tanners and this has been my fave for several years now. I love how smooth is makes my skin. I&#x27;m not one to visit the tanning salon, I prefer the safer self-tanning route. I have a sort of olive complexion with dark hair, brown eyes. I&#x27;m not really dark but not pale either, so this works for me. A noticeable tan but nothing too orange or drastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pale redhead, so I was afraid of this at first. I ordered a lighter color by another brand that had sparkles in it, &amp; this one for my husband. (It looks amazing on him.. you can&#x27;t even tell he&#x27;s wearing it.) I can&#x27;t always be a glitter bomb when out in public though! Lol.. I decided to give this a try &amp; use a trick I learned to keep it from streaking- I mix it in my hands with lotion first. I just used a little more lotion than I do with the lighter color. Works great! Not orange at all. I actually like it better than mine!</li>
    <li> I like this self tanner. I have medium dark skin and use it on my legs. But its very dark. It dries fast and gives a good color. It will fade if you shave your legs 12-24 hours later. But that&#x27;s to be expected. Sally Hansen used to make an incredible spray self tanner - unfortunately it appears to be discontinued. This self tanner is a good runner up.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has a very natural color, does not streak, and is reasonably priced.  I use it everywhere except my face, where it is much too dark and does not look natural.</li>
    <li> In this category of self-tanning lotions (comparable to jergens, etc.) I would place this at the top. I&#x27;m not really sure about the super expensive self tanners but if you&#x27;re reading this you probably don&#x27;t want those anyway. This product does exactly what it says and it looks very natural. Definitely put some lotion on your knees, wrists, elbows, and ankles before using there. And obviously wash your palms. I&#x27;ve gotten a few comments on how tan I look when I apply every other day but I&#x27;ve never felt that I looked too dark. Also never had any issues with it coming off on my clothes. Occasionally when I work out the same day as applying the lotion, small amounts will come off on my gym towel. But nothing crazy and still looks fine. Also, for your face, I recommend mixing in equal parts with your usual facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering this or the lighter version (unless you are ghost white) go with this one. It&#x27;s not as crazy dark as you might think. Smell isn&#x27;t even that bad...maybe I&#x27;m weird but I kind of like it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing fake tan!! the price is unbeatable, around $7 at walmart. gets you a DARK tan overnight. I decided to switch to self tanning because of the harmful effects of tanning. I have to admit I was skeptical about it but I prefer this so much more than the tanning bed! What takes a week of tanning bed tanning takes 1 night with this stuff. The first time I used it i only applied 1 coat. The result was there, but not very noticeable. The second time I applied 1 coat, waited 15 minutes for it to dry, and applied a second coat. When I woke up in the morning I was dark as if I had gone to the beach for 4 days straight! I naturally have a medium olive skin tone that tans very dark naturally. For someone lighter i would recommend only doing one coat and then see the next day if you would like to deepen it. For people with my skin tone I definitely recommend two coats. I went to the pool yesterday with this tan on and got so many complements on how dark i was! My boyfriend even said it looked good and i asked him if it was orange and he said no!! When i told people it was a fake tan they were very surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Here is my complete guide for a flawless fake tan:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply at nighttime. sit in a hot bath for 20 minutes to soften all of your dead skin. Exfoliate the sh** out of yourself with a loofah, and make sure to get your feet, ankles, knees, backs of your knees, elbows, wrists, hands and knuckles really well!! These areas tend to grab onto color. Next, shave whatever you need to shave. This isn&#x27;t the time to be lazy!! You want to minimize shaving as much as possible when you have your fake tan on. Once you&#x27;ve shaved everything, get out of the shower, towel dry and wait about 15 minutes until you are bone dry. Water stops the development of self tanners so being 100% dry is very important. Use a water based moisturizer (my favorite is the vaseline kind, in the yellow bottle but any moisturizer that has water as the first ingredient will work) on those areas that you had to exfoliate extra well (feet, ankles, knees, elbows, hands, and wrists). Let the moisturizer sink in. This keeps the tanner from over developing in these areas. Go get yourself a tanning mitt from ulta or sallys for 6 bucks to avoid telltale fake tan orange hands. apply the tanning lotion evenly in circular motions and blend well, starting from the legs up. use only the residual lotion on the mitt for tops of feet and tops of hands, knees, elbows and ankles. You don&#x27;t want to leave them completely untanned but you don&#x27;t want them to be overly dark. Have your boyfriend/roommate/mom get your back, OR cut an old towel into about a 4&amp;#34; wide strip, apply some of the tanning lotion to the middle and apply it to your back as if you were drying your back until all of the lotion is blended.if you have medium to olive skin and you want a dark tan, wait 15 minutes for this stuff to dry and repeat the process (you may not have to use as much product as the first time). This lotion contains vitamin e and aloe which will moisturize your skin-- i love that!  Wait another 15 minutes for it to dry, put a big t-shirt on, and go to bed. In the morning gently wash off the guide color and VOILA-- PERFECT TAN EVERY TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to keep your tan lasting as long as possible, stay hydrated and moisturized. lightly exfoliate on the 3rd day or so to prevent uneven patches when the tan starts to wear off. if you must shave, use hair conditioner as shaving cream and LIGHTLY shave the areas that need it, do not apply any pressure to your skin. just skim off the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to remove the tan, start from the beginning! don&#x27;t forget to wear sunscreen in the sun! Hope this all helps!&lt;br /&gt;Gave it 4 stars because I prefer 2 coats over 1, but again I have a darker skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat this for the price. It is perfect for a base tan before the pool or for a special event. I will never step in a tanning bed again! :)</li>
    <li> I have used it for years but lately is difficult to find it in stores and impossible to get it in my country CR. I have compared it with other similar products and it leaves my skin with a golden color, soft and it last for days. My favorite!</li>
    <li> This is the only self tanner I use as it is affordable and has pretty good results. It is not streak less and it fades in phases so my legs look funny when it&#x27;s coming off but it&#x27;s good enough to continue using.</li>
    <li> Its a little smelly...so i use on my day off or when i know ill be home...</li>
    <li> Happy with the product and will continue to use it for color</li>
    <li> This is the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  If you apply it in sections(lower leg then upper leg, etc) there is no streaking.  Of course, avoid elbows, knees, etc.  This lotion covers smoothly and stays on.  No staining clothing or sheets.  I would recommend avoid getting your skin wet for the first hour after applying.</li>
    <li> i have tried several self tanners... and i have to admit, for price, convenience and effect- this is #1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. all self tanners have a self tanny smell...some are more faint than others and some use more perfumes to mask it than others- this one really is not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;2. i am naturally dark olive (asian skin).  so i tan brown- not gold.  this matches perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;3. i use this after i shower MIXED with a regular body lotion.  i have found that if i dilute the tanner with body lotion- it soaks in better and there are never any blotches or streaks- even on knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;4. best way to look naturally tan, not be that smelly girl with blotchy ankles and fingers, and give melanoma the finger.</li>
    <li> If you want something easy to apply which looks natural then look no further.  I really like how easy this is to apply after a shower, I get asked all the time where I&#x27;ve been getting sun and I tell them Banana Boat:-)  They can&#x27;t believe it.  This does have a slight odor, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  I usually apply at night after shower so it has time to absorb and there is no odor the next day.</li>
    <li> I need to look no further...the best! Natural looking and lasting about 5 days, hate those daily ones, has never ever streaked.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. Quick color and no streaks. I liked that if an area was lighter than I wanted, I could simply reapply in a few hours. Make sure to wash your hands during application. I used a makeup remover cloth to do my hands &amp; it still left color...although not BAD. Overall great product for the price &amp; performance.</li>
    <li> A bit streaky if you&#x27;re not careful..make sure you massage it in well.  Works as advertised.  No chemical smells.  :)</li>
    <li> Have used the deep dark color version of this stuff for probably 20 years.  It&#x27;s thick and smells, but you get a great &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; that isn&#x27;t orange.  The color helps you guide it on so you don&#x27;t get streaks.  If you buff first and don&#x27;t use really hot water in the shower, it lasts a few days.  One application takes the pasty away, and two gets you a good color.</li>
    <li> I cant wait to try this out in the summer! The reviews seem pretty good so I&#x27;m hoping it does wonders to my tan.</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever used. I can slap some of this on right after the shower let it dry and wear white shorts and not get a single stain on them. It distributes evenly and doesn&#x27;t rub off when you sweat. It drys bronze colored not orange, and I&#x27;ve even used it on my face.</li>
    <li> Bought 3 of them as a package....wow, they are awesome for me and my skin. I&#x27;m NOT Irish white with freckles, hehe...I&#x27;m a Southern Euro girl with medium skin (sand beige in my foundation) and this IS the best. I&#x27;ve had more expensive ones before (they were on sale, I dont pay top dollar for stuff like this), but this was Made For Me.&lt;br /&gt;One use, right outta shower......my skin gets visibly darker. Next day, another use....PERFECT TAN!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a pro, so I just smear it on my face and neck and everywhere....and ask hubby to help me with the back. It absorbes into the skin asap and you dont feel greasy ( I HATE the greasy feeling). I can&#x27;t even stand hand creams, no matter how light they can be, I hate greasy on my body, it feels....dirty. Well, this won&#x27;t be greasy at all. Thank you, baby Jesus!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, buy it,try it, and if u dont like it, pls donate it to me...hehehe...I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
    <li> Great color and works pretty well.  You will not want to apply more than once every 2 to 3 days though.  If you don&#x27;t ever want streaking with any self tanning product then make sure you never apply them while your skin is wet or sweaty.  Always make sure your skin is completely dry first.</li>
    <li> love this stuff,works well</li>
    <li> I have used many bronzing products. This one is the best! Have been using this product for over a year.</li>
    <li> I found the very best sunless tanners over 9 years ago, but I love Banana Boat&#x27;s sunscreen, and based on the reviews of this sunless tanner, I decided to try it. It smells bad, colors bad...and you get what you pay for. If you want a really great sunless tan, pay a little more or try samples first. Most of the store products aren&#x27;t very good. But, to each her own! I had no problems with the seller, it was the product itself.</li>
    <li> This product is great at giving natural glow color to the skin I have very light skin. Does not turn you into an orange but use two times a week for a gentle effect</li>
    <li> As a penny pincher who also likes to be tan, I have tried every value brand of self-tanner on the shelf.  This is my favorite and that is not just because it is $2-3 less than most drugstore self-tanners, but it just works.  It leaves a nice, tan color even though my natural skin tone is fair.  It has no bad odor.  It also has no good odor (like Loreal Sublime Bronze which smells good but leaves me too &amp;#34;sparkly.&amp;#34;).  I guess it is odorless.  But anyway, I get comments frequently about why am I so tan in the winter and I always say &amp;#34;Banana Boat Self Tanner.&amp;#34;  I am not afraid to give credit where credit is due.  I also use it in the summer and it is especially good when you have a little bit of a natural base tan.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good self-tanner for it&#x27;s price. I don&#x27;t like the smell as it&#x27;s a bit too perfume-y for me, but it&#x27;s not too strong and does not linger for too long. Turnes out a bit too orange for my taste every time but still all right as a maintenance tanner for more expensive tans.</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- quick tan&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t streak&lt;br /&gt;-lasts long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- the colour!! if you&#x27;re originally really pale and put  this on I feel like it gives you a yellow/orange colour instead of a &#x27;tan&#x27; look (very noticeable in the daytime)  I am a yellow undertone (like not olive skin/ pink undertone) so maybe that&#x27;s why it looks like this for me.&lt;br /&gt;- smells ok at first but I find after a while that fake tan smell comes up, nothing a shower cant fix&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars only because i don&#x27;t like the colour of it, but it does run on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this stuff.  I went out on a limb and bought a three pack after reading a blog that reviewed several different brands of self-tanners and rated this the highest.  I&#x27;ve used several other brands over the years myself, everything from the super cheap the super over-priced.  To date, this is the best result I&#x27;ve had.  The color is as close to natural as I&#x27;ve gotten with any self-tanners.  There are some tricks to not getting streaks or blotches, as with them all, and following them gives great results.  The fragrance could be lightened (note for Banana Boat), but it&#x27;s certainly not unbearable.  I applied this for three consecutive days and then again every three/four days to maintain a nice shade (close to what I&#x27;d have by the end of the summer).  I&#x27;ve taken photos of the progress and the tone is natural - not orangey or gross.</li>
    <li> I was so psyched to try this out after reading all the great reviews. I did all the proper prep like anyone who is a frequent self-tanner &amp; knows how to get the best look possible. I applied it in the afternoon and true enough, a few hours later I looked slightly tanned. The colour was a tad TAD bit orangey though. It went on very well (although rather thick consistency, so I needed alot of it for one application), didn&#x27;t streak, and I liked that it was a bit tinted. Sure enough within the hour the self-tan smell was pretty obvious. Anyhow, the next day I woke up and felt like I had slight colour, but not enough. After my shower, I felt like I had a little less colour, and just wasn&#x27;t feeling it, so I never applied it after that cuz I was afraid of getting orange... and didn&#x27;t want the stench around me all day..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INSTEAD, I applied my &#x27;Malibu Tan HEMP Golden bronzing lotion&#x27; and have been doing so for the past 7days, daily. Check out my review on it if you want to know about a REALLY good self-tanner. That one is the BOMB imho.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use this lotion in the winter time to keep a nice looking base tan.  We love how natural the color looks!</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I normally use that &amp;#34;gradual build&amp;#34; tanners, and they never give me the right color and it takes forever. This product, however, gives a nice deep glow that isn&#x27;t orangey! Its natural! You just have to be careful to apply it evenly and wash your hands really well afterwards. Putting on a layer of moisturizer after application helps it even out, and exfoliate beforehand!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re new to self-tanners, there&#x27;s a word you need to know. DIHYDROXYACETONE.&lt;br /&gt;Some products have this active ingredient listed as low as #7, the rest is &#x27;filler&#x27;. Not so with Banana Boat Summer Color, It&#x27;s the most potent product I&#x27;ve found, and at the $6-$7 price point worth it&#x27;s weight in suntanned gold!</li>
    <li> Best sunless tanning product! Inexpensive, nice color and no strong odor, very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I have Carmel color skin but I wanted to add that sun kissed glow and this product by far has done just that. I use to use true spa self tanners but it made me orange.  This really gives you a bonze glow. The only down side is that even though you put on thick moisturizer your hands still turn orange I wash them right after I apply. Use gloves</li>
</ol>
