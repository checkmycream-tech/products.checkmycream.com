<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;The rough side is perfect for removing nail polish!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use one pad to remove three layered nail polish on most of my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also soft side so good to use with astringent!( or toner)</li>
    <li> beauty is only skin deep says the ugly duck</li>
    <li> Bought these at first from Costco then as usual they didn&#x27;t have them anymore !</li>
    <li> When I opened the first &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; of cotton rounds, I was disappointed to see that the edges were not bound together. This caused them the fall apart automatically without even being wet. Very sad that I had to return these. I thought it was such a good buy.</li>
    <li> Use this on a daily basis to scrub out deep dirt with men&#x27;s Shiseido facial products.</li>
    <li> I actually love these cotton rounds.  My mother bought me this pack a few months ago and I have been using them to wash my face and remove make up ever since.  They have a soft side and a rough side that is similar to using a flannel on your face.  I was running low and wanted to reorder even tough I knew they would be more expensive than your standard cotton ball.  I saw the pic and bought them.  When they arrived I only had three sleeves of rounds!  Instead of the eight pictured!  I double checked my remaining batch.  Each sleeve contains 100 rounds.  I guess I should have read that the order was for 300 rounds not the 800 pictured.  I figured I could rely on Amazon to picture the item I was purchasing.  They should change the picture to show three packs of rounds instead of eight, then I would have given them five stars and the price would have been right.  Not sure I&#x27;ll reorder, even though I like them.</li>
    <li> No cotton leaving taxes on my face. I like the fact that they gave a soft side and a exfoliating side</li>
    <li> best cotton ever cannot leave it</li>
    <li> I thought 8 counts per pack like in the picture but in fact it is only 3. I overlooked the description. So pay attention.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday. So good. Help make the make up removing so easy!</li>
    <li> Good cotton rounds, I use them for make-up remover and nail polish remover and it does both jobs fairly well.  I only gave it four stars because I do not prefer the material as much as regular cotton rounds (a little thin) but that does mean it soaks up less product.</li>
    <li> Shipping was so fast and the product quality is very good. It is better than I expected!</li>
    <li> The product I received looks exactly as pictured, but just 3 tubes instead of 8. The cotton rounds are sealed at the edges and is a little rigid, so accidentally swiping the edge against my skin gets a little irritating. One side is plain cotton, and the other is a dotted texture which is not meant for facial use. The textured side would be great for removing nail polish, while the non-textured side is used for applying skincare products or removing make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints, really. The cotton rounds hold together well, and the non-textured side feels much more solid than your drugstore brands.I imagine 3 tubes will last me for quite a while, so I do consider this a good buy :)</li>
    <li> Judging from the picture, I thought they were eight bags of pads, but as a result, they are three. But the pads themselves are good.</li>
    <li> I always use this one. Excellent.</li>
    <li> Too good to use，I like it very much.</li>
    <li> NOT 800 count!Dont be decieved..you will only get 300,not 800 as in the description.Amazon has refunded my money and I will send back the original package.Not worth the time.I should have read other reviews before ordering.Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Deceiving description, instead of 800 items received only 300. The quality is poor. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The worst cotton rounds ever-they fall apart so easily and when you grab one you can&#x27;t tell if you get getting a whole one or patial round because there are so many layers that aren&#x27;t really connected in anyway other than just laying on top on each other. Plus I ordered the &amp;#34;800 count&amp;#34; rounds and only 3 packs of 100 showed up. Very disappointed-will never buy from this seller or this brand again.</li>
    <li> Love these pads for putting on makeup</li>
    <li> NOT SO GOOD , WILL NOT BUY IT AGAIN .</li>
    <li> Recomend! Fast and good Quality</li>
    <li> These work great- they don&#x27;t shred like some cotton rounds do.</li>
    <li> Very soft, easy to use and don&#x27;t have little pieces of cotton that get stuck to my face when removing makeup. One side is regular and the other side has a bit more texture to it, not enough that I would say its really exfoliating but provides a bit more texture for a better clean. Will definitely repurchase when I run low.</li>
    <li> My fiancee really enjoys using these cotton pads at night. Too bad they are so dang expensive!</li>
    <li> I love the quality of these cotton rounds. I use them to get my very waterproof mascara off and they hold together in this process very well! One side is textured one is smooth.</li>
    <li> Too rough on my skin.</li>
    <li> yep, they are cotton, and they work.</li>
    <li> these are supposed to be good wuality from the looks of all the layers but they are actually really bad.... Horribly made.... The inner layer connecting top and bottom is just a lose layer of cotton that gets tear so easily i cant even finish wiping half of my face without it getting all rolled up</li>
    <li> I use cotton rounds for applying facial toner morning and night. A lot of brands come apart easily when they get wet (they leave pieces of cotton on my face) but I&#x27;ve never had that issue with these.</li>
    <li> The actual DELON product is awesome. However, like many other reviewers, the product that I received was a totally different brand from what is pictured. What I received were cheap in quality and are being returned. Clearly the fact that the same issue of the incorrect product continues to happen to multiple people needs to be addressed by Amazon.</li>
    <li> The rounds are sturdier and thicker that what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> These work great and don&#x27;t leave the same cotton fibers as using cotton balls.</li>
    <li> While I did like the cotton rounds I received, the brand was not &amp;#34;Delon&amp;#34; and there was absolutely no mention of vitamins or aloe on the packaging-- just plain cotton rounds with a soft and slightly abrasive side. I also only received 3 sleeves of rounds containing 100 rounds, not alywhere close to the 800 I was counting on.</li>
    <li> Love the double sided feature. Works great for applying toner. Also good for nail polish remover. My skin feels much softer after using these versus regular cotton pads.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> Simply the best.  :)  Have tried other different brands and they just dont compare to these. Love, love, love these.</li>
    <li> Since I found these I never use any other cosmetic wipe.</li>
    <li> Better quality than drugstore brands. Soft on one side, textured on the other to help exfoliate the skin. Use everyday.</li>
    <li> ordered a box recevied 3 rounds..</li>
    <li> I used to buy the generic brand from Von&#x27;s/Safeway and they&#x27;ve always worked so well for me but I had grown tired of buying them every few months so I decided to get a bulk from Amazon thinking how bad cotton rounds could be. I got these and they were disappointing. Although not completely unusable, the textured side is so scratchy that it hurts. I&#x27;ve never experienced that using the generic ones. Only good thing is that after using it for a while (I had 800 of them after all) I&#x27;ve gotten used to the scratchiness and come to expect it from the rounds and come to not mind it.. My standard of cotton rounds were too high before I guess?? I bought them few years ago and have finally finished using them but not sure if I wanna buy them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and like to use these for toner, etc.  Other cottons rounds catch on my beard (even with just a little stubble) and leave cotton strings all over my face which I then have to pick off -- but these rounds have a gauze-like material on one side that glides over the hairs.  Handy!</li>
    <li> Pleased with product.  The pads are soft. They remind me of a cotton ball that has been flattened.  One side has a slightly textured surface.  The pads  absorb  well.  You can limit the amount if you want to.  But if you are looking for a round that barely uses any product, this may not be the one.  I am very happy with this purchase and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love these, they don&#x27;t fall apart like other similar rounds.  They hold up, seem to be of a professional grade.  I like that!  The only thing I don&#x27;t like, the price.  I purchased these from Costco for $10.99, I wish being a Prime member like I am afforded us such a deep discount like I get at Costco because I LOVE amazon.com but I like better prices even better! :&amp;#34;)  Just my two cents.</li>
    <li> These are the best cotton pads I have ever used in my life.  The End!  Quality and value in one place.  Thank you Amazon.  Finally.  I use these for everything.  They don&#x27;t leave any fuzzies behind and they are super strong.  I gave my mom a sleeve of them; hat way when I go to visit some are there too.</li>
    <li> The description said 800 count cotton pads and I only received 500.</li>
    <li> Consitant product. I can get this cheaper here than from my pro distributors.</li>
    <li> I got these for glycolic acid and TCA peels so I apply with these rounds, wipe the acids off with baking soda mix to stop the action, them use them to apply all the other creams. They are also wonderful for my cats eyes (Persian whose eyes need to be wiped when then run) and they are great for all things cosmetic.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a tad bit rough, which make them perfect for removing nail polish, but a bit much for eye makeup.  They definitely hold up well.</li>
    <li> Discription says 800 count, but comes as 300 count. There is a 300 count product that is much cheaper. Order it instead. Nice quality.</li>
    <li> I used these every night to take off my eye makeup. One side has a scratchy layer that hurts my eyes. I have to take off that little slice layer every night in order to use these. Once I do that, they are fine, but it is a pain to have to do this each night when I am tired and all I want is to get done and go to bed.</li>
    <li> The best cotton rounds I have used; no kidding. They do not shed at all.</li>
    <li> These work great but heed the other reviews - they have VERY sharp edges. I cut my nose on accident using them at the wrong angle. Bummer.</li>
    <li> good price same as costco but some of the pads come apart.</li>
    <li> Delon makes the best cotton rounds. They don&#x27;t shed and the abrasive side does a good job of exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Love these, and have been using them for years and years.  My only word of caution, dear readers, is watch out for those edges (there&#x27;s a bit of a sharp edge, oddly enough, around the perimeter, where the top and bottom sides are joined.  I&#x27;ve made the terrible error of forgetting this, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I scratched the dickens out of my eye.  And OH MAN, did that hurt.  They are very sturdy too!  Pretty sure I&#x27;ve used them to wipe off the faucet / sink before!</li>
    <li> These take all the dirt and makeup off nice and gently...im glad i got them...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.  The store where I was buying it changed brands.  I went to Amazon and sure enough found the Delon Rounds.  Delon doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; cotton.  I use the pads to remove eye makeup and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly, item as promised however these cotton rounds are not very soft.  I will still use them, but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> work well but come part very easily.  get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;work well but come part very easily.  get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The picture is deceiving and makes the amount paid excessive for the quantity. I will be suspicious in the future when ordering from you.</li>
    <li> Very soft and perfect for eye and make-up removal.  However, there are 3 rolls only; not what the photo shows!</li>
    <li> I love these they are now my favorite cotton swabs. I use it with my toner to take off dead skin cells. One side has texture which helps to remove  the dead skin and/or smooth over rough patching on you nose or any part of your face.</li>
    <li> Soft side works great for eye makeup remover and the slightly textured side is wonderful for toner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an electrologist and I use these constantly for preparing skin prior to treatment. I&#x27;ve had good luck with these not shredding and leaving pieces of cotton on my clients, even when doing whisker type hair. My latest lot still isn&#x27;t shredding, but they seem to separate layers easier that previous batches,</li>
    <li> These cotton rounds do work well, but they weren&#x27;t constructed very well. They fall apart during every use. I will not repurchase these.</li>
    <li> Has a tendency to separate. When using with a liquid. On the face or elsewhere</li>
    <li> I searched for these when the store I usually bought them at stopped carrying them.  Now I see why they stopped - these have very little in common with the old cotton rounds that used to come in the same packaging.  These are made of inferior material - it&#x27;s hard to believe they are cotton - , the edges are scratchy and do not stay together.  Plus these fall apart.</li>
    <li> The picture displays 8 packages of cotton and I only received 3 packages. It is exactly what I ordered but thought I was getting that the picture displayed.</li>
    <li> These turned out to be better than I thought, which was a pleasant surprise for me.  I like the feel of them on my face.</li>
    <li> These cotton rounds are top quality. Delon Cotton Rounds are well made and do not leave fibers behind on your face and eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Lately, I&#x27;ve had trouble with cotton balls and cotton rounds leaving their nearly invisible fibers near my eyes when I used them to remove eye makeup and even just to apply toner on my face near my eyes. The fibers would then get in my eyes and would be very irritating and also hard to remove. (I have dryer eyes now than I used to, so it bothers me more now). So I looked high and low for a good quality cotton round and have only found them here on Amazon. -- I&#x27;ve been using these Delon Cotton Rounds for about a year now and the problems with fibers in my eyes immediately ended when I started using them. (And then the probs started again when I ran out of Delon&#x27;s). Next time, I&#x27;ll order long in advance of running out!</li>
    <li> I bought this before and it was perfect but I ordered it again and this time the layers peel off even before you touch them.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t really argue the price of these 800 Delon 100% cotton rounds.  I use them to clean my face with toner and also to remove fingernail polish.  They are of decent quality, but if used aggressively, they can begin to separate.  I do like that one side is softer and one has a more abrasive side, so you really don&#x27;t need to scrub.  (I think that&#x27;s just my bad habit  ! )  I would LOVE then though if they held up just a little better.</li>
    <li> Cotton liner falls apart as you use it</li>
    <li> How is it possible to be so in love with cotton rounds? Well, I am; with these. Slightly textured on one side, smooth and soft on the other. Never fall apart or leave annoying bits of lint on my face. I use two every single day to apply my toner. Best cotton pads ever. This is my second consecutive purchase of the 800-count pack.</li>
    <li> Pic a little misleading, unless you click on the full description and read the last line indicating there are only 2 packs not 8 like it shows in the pic you may think twice about paying over 10 bucks for these!</li>
    <li> They are cheap but can hurt your skin if you have soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this item and would rather purchase a better quality product at a higher price.</li>
    <li> Layers separate very easily. Not a high quality round.</li>
    <li> Good product. Good price. Don&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t not like these they fall apart will not be buying these brand again..</li>
    <li> Please note there are only three bundles of cotton rounds.  This photo is deceiving.</li>
    <li> I wish I ordered larger circles, but these are nice too.  They are your average cotton rounds so sometimes it takes two to get my makeup off.  Next time I will look for the larger cotton rounds but that is just my personal preference.</li>
    <li> I love these, and I thin this is  good deal because I am too lazy to go to the store. I like the two different sides and it can be hard to find the same quality in a regular store for the price. I have ordered this pack a couple times in the last two years.</li>
    <li> I thought with them being enriched with aloe vera they would be softer... but they aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not rough but it&#x27;s definitely not as soft as a typical cotton round pad.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the thing, you really CAN&#x27;T beat this deal: the price, count, and the added benefits of including Aloe Vera &amp; B5 seem perfect. Sadly, the product isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;ll get the job done, so long as it&#x27;s a quick job. I use them for makeup cleanup, applying spot treatments for breakouts, and getting chemical peel gel onto the areas I want.&lt;br /&gt;2. They&#x27;re soft against the skin (big plus since I&#x27;ve used some rough cotton rounds before) because they&#x27;re...plushy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. They fall apart the moment you touch them. Not in the same way that, say...cotton balls split and leave stringy material everywhere (thinking of cleaning glitter polish of my nails here, ladies and gents); but in the fact that they are literally falling apart at the seams.&lt;br /&gt;2. Which leads to compensating to make sure the above (material falling out of the middle and getting everywhere) doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
    <li> These pads fall apart VERY EASILY! They are do not have a quilted pattern on them to hold them in place, so they break apart into layers almost immediately after getting wet. I use them to spray makeup remover on and then rub on my face, and just that dampness of having something spritzed on them is enough to make them fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really regret buying these in bulk, as now I have a bunch of them that I can&#x27;t really use.</li>
    <li> These are nice ones! They are soft yet sturdy. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> These are the best cotton rounds I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> worth will buy it again</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware!!!! This picture is misleading. It shows 8 packs but you only get 3. So 3 packs for this price  &#x3D; overpriced!!!!!!</li>
    <li> First It&#x27;s too thick and absorb too much toner and still not wet enough to use on face. Second the fiber will drop when use. Third I feel a little painful when use it. I think it&#x27;s more suitful for nail polish remove than for face.</li>
    <li> These are okay pads, they do not dissintegrate like other brands and they are on the thicker/fluffier side. The edge of this pad however is another story, you have to be careful not to cut yourself. It is a little bit sharp.</li>
    <li> nice rounds, but i really wanted completely lint-free.  the only thing that makes them kind of lint-free is that one side has an additional mesh layer.</li>
    <li> These pads are horrible! I&#x27;m so disappointed. They are rough and scratchy and even have a sharp edge around the rim.  When I try to rub my skin gently, I feel instead like I&#x27;m snagging and tearing at it. What on earth?  Who created these awful cotton pads??? I wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> Good product with a good price, nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> A little rough, pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> Ever since my favorite cotton rounds became unavailable, I&#x27;ve been trying to find a suitable replacement. After reading the reviews about the Delon brand, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t find them to be any better. The cotton itself doesn&#x27;t shred as bad as many brands do, but one side is textured, the other isn&#x27;t. The textured side peels away during use. Definitely a pain if you&#x27;re using these to remove nail polish or something else you want the textured side for. I also felt these soaked up too much of the product so it took more effort and attempts to get my make up off. I had really high hopes for these, but I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering them again after using them for a few months.</li>
    <li> These are OK. They fall apart. I am an Esthetician and I use them to cover my clients eyes during my skin analysis. If I were to use them for anything else, they would be awful. **ONE side is reallllly ROUGH and the other side is soft. **</li>
    <li> The rounds tend to separate a bit but I like that one side is rougher for exfoliation.</li>
    <li> A substantial cotton pad that holds together while you use it for whatever purpose, even removing nail polish.  One side of each pad has a textured surface that does not degrade into small fibers that tend to stick to your nail surface (can we say annoying?). Also highly structured so that it doesn&#x27;t shrink or shrivel while you swipe it across your face - one pad will last for the entire surface area of your face and then some. Plus they are infused with aloe and panthenol (pro-vitamin B5).  Wouldn&#x27;t think cotton pads could be this excellent but there you have it.</li>
    <li> I went through them very quickly and I loved them. They held together well without leaving random cotton smeared on my face. I used this with toner (Thayers Witch Hazel Rose Toner, an amazing toner) and it was fantastic at cleaning my face and neck. I will probably order again. I also used the more &#x27;abrasive&#x27; side with lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find the &#x27;abrasive&#x27; side too scratchy like some did, but I use scrubs fairly often. Maybe I&#x27;m used to it?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;am trully happy with this purchase this is one Item we always need in the house.products like these I lke to do the 1-click ordering every 2 months!!</li>
    <li> Very good to use for makeup, etc.</li>
    <li> It works well but the two sides easily separates. And seriously what&#x27;s with the price? It has increased every time I go back to look at it</li>
    <li> I also only got a 300 count rather than a 800 count. Which is unfortunate because the product is very good.</li>
    <li> this... is a lot of cotton rounds. I wasn&#x27;t really needing to buy these to stock up until the end of time, but I sure did. great quality, and I will definitely use them all, just may take a while.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!  I ordered and only received 3x 100pack sleeves.  Missing 500.  Not at all as described.  Rip-off.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to say except these little guys do a good job - mainly used for cleaning our dogs&#x27; ears :)</li>
    <li> Never thought cotton pads can have this amazing quality. Impressed. Will not go back to any other cotton pads now.</li>
    <li> These are the best cotton rounds I have ever used. One side is textured and one is smooth. They don&#x27;t ever pill. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and I actually love these they don&#x27;t break apart or leave white fuzz like cotton balls.</li>
    <li> Not impressive. It&#x27;s OK, but I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was a little confused as to why people loved these so much, figured they&#x27;d be like every other cotton round but they really are perfectly textured on one side and smooth on the other. Works very well for applying tonor! I really like them.</li>
    <li> These are soft enough, not the softest. And they do come apart rather easily, as other reviewers mentioned. But that&#x27;s really not a problem because typically I&#x27;m just using them to swipe off my makeup.</li>
    <li> I will never use cotton balls again.......These are GREAT!  They absorb more, so can spread more product. I use them for my astringent, but they would be excellent for any make-up removal or masque removal.</li>
    <li> A little bit thick but quite easy to use</li>
    <li> The best kind of cotton pads for cosmetic purposes.</li>
    <li> I, too, got frustrated with the crappy quality of cotton rounds in the stores!  These are a great alternative!  And it&#x27;s so nice to buy in bulk and not have to purchase them every couple weeks.  I use for eye-makeup removal and nail-polish removal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used similar products for about as long as I can remember, and I&#x27;ve always just bought what was available. Not anymore. After reading other Amazon reviews, I decided the price was good on these and they seemed like good quality. I was blown away. These have a soft side that is actually soft (you know how some look soft, but they&#x27;re really kindof scratchy? Note these...), and they also have a textured side that is also soft but better for exfoliating with a light toner. Will definitely be reordering.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think there was much of a difference when it comes to cotton rounds but I really like this one - silky finish</li>
    <li> Great price for these cotton rounds. I use the everyday for applying astringent. They are strong but very soft and do not leave fuzz.</li>
    <li> I use these to cleanse my face. I love how thick they are and you get so many for the price.</li>
    <li> best cotton rounds I&#x27;ve used! No peeling at all. very reasonably priced as well. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> The textured layer peels off with ease, but I find that rather a positive because it&#x27;s actually textured really strangely</li>
    <li> Amazing price for this quality. This cotton hold liquid perfectly and s great for all my facial. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Look good, but I do not use them now.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t too scratchy, and were a good price</li>
    <li> These are high quality, sturdy cotton rounds. I like that one side has a little more texture for &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; makeup off, and the other side is smoother to finish wiping everything clean. Great price, too. I will definitely be buying these again.</li>
    <li> Slight bit of fuzz otherwise good.</li>
    <li> Got these at Costco and loved the texture as the cotton doesn&#x27;t get &#x27;fuzzy&#x27;.  Amazon was the only place we can find them and the price is fantastic as they are about the same price as those that are not as good of quality.  Love these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these before and they worked so well (sturdy, absorbent, soft) that I ordered them again. However, this time around, the three-layered cotton rounds separate immediately upon use. They are essentially non-functional after 15 seconds of use. Maybe I got 800 lemons? Or maybe they changed the way they made them. Either way, I&#x27;ll be looking for an alternative as soon as these are gone.</li>
    <li> When the package came it was only 600 rounds. I was shorted 200 rounds</li>
    <li> Says 800 count, arrived as 300.</li>
    <li> Great Quality. So glad I stocked this up instead of crappy drugstore brands.</li>
    <li> It is just okay... Because the cotton rounds is pretty thick, so I have to pour more makeup remover to remove my makeup... And I don&#x27;t want to waste my remover, so I gave it three stars.</li>
    <li> I use these with a toner to clean and moisturize during the day. They&#x27;re thick and absorbent to hold enough toner to clean thoroughly, one side is a little bit scrubby to help remove dead skin and dirt, and they don&#x27;t fall apart or leave my face covered with cotton fuzz (even if I have a little stubble). I typically only need to use one (scrubby side first, then smooth), but I&#x27;m also not using them to remove make-up, just to refresh a little. They&#x27;re also quite inexpensive, especially when compared to single use face wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if this review was helpful</li>
    <li> Product as described. Nice to not have to worry about tracking down cotton pads for awhile!</li>
