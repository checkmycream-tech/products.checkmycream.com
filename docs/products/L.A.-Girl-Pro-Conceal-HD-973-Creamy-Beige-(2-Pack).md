<li> I look like I have black eyes year round, and this product is the only one that has helped get rid of my dark circles..</li>
<li> so i use it under to cancel dark circles.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t compare it with any other product but it works wonders!</li>
<li> Hard to squeeze product out of tube</li>
<li> No More Purple under eyes for me!!!  </li>
<li> The quality isn&#x27;t bad for the price.</li>
<li> Horrible has flakes/small chunks in it</li>
