      <li>beautiful blueish color really nice consistency</li>
      <li>I was expecting a nice summer color, (and it is) but it is mega bright.</li>
      <li>i have never received so many compliments on a nail polish as this!</li>
      <li>I am really getting excellent use out of this nail polish.</li>
      <li>it still looks kind of aqua</li>
      <li>Pretty color and great polish</li>
      <li>...ORDER TWO MORE...</li>
      <li>Essie is 1 of my 3 top nail lacquer lines I like to use.</li>
      <li>Essie is one of my 3 favorite polishes.  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT</li>
      <li>Ordered two bottles of this polish and should have ordered more.</li>
      <li>okay quality.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice unique, sea foamy color.</li>
      <li>Kindly amazon allow me to rate the product by rating by stars and only optional to write my review because writing is taking too much time but any way this product is excellent</li>
      <li>stays on great, is different without being tacky.</li>
      <li>Mint candy apple is a great spring/summer color especially on your toes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice pastel green - great for the spring or summer.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for something a bit more white but still love the color!  </li>
      <li>I recommend this to everybody looking for a good creme, minty blue.</li>
      <li>The color is gorgeous- more blue tones than green ones, but still gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely fell in love with this color when I first saw it!</li>
      <li>The color was perfect and definitely set off the entire outfit.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well, i was actually searching for a perfect shade of aqua/turquoise blue when i found this....</li>
      <li>It dries quickly (in my opinion)</li>
      <li>The colors are endless, they have been around a long time and the coverage is impeccable with a good 4 step polish manicure.</li>
      <li>It is so fun on your toes.</li>
      <li>I think that if your trying to find a nice \\&quot;mint and chocolate chip ice cream\\&quot; type of green this will be a perfect green for you~ ^^  </li>
      <li>In some lights (say, the mall where I first tried this), it looks pretty but in most lights (say natural and indoor house lights), it just doesnt look right.  </li>
      <li>i really like pastel colours (am a child of the 80&#x27;s), so i was really excited when i first saw this on the magazine.  </li>
      <li>I usually love Essie, but the particular one I received was not the normal formula.</li>
      <li>,it was solid in two coats and if you put a good top coat every other day it will not chip.</li>
      <li>After finally purchasing, I am pleased.</li>
      <li>And even one coat was enough for me. :)</li>
      <li>painting my nails this first time</li>
      <li>on top of it (on the ring fingers only).</li>
      <li>It is my least favorite Essie, I have another turquoise and a teal by Essie, they are among my favorite polishes.</li>
      <li>Color is a cremey light pastel green that has more cool blue tones to it.</li>
      <li>Mint green is my absolute favorite color!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s really satisfactory for me</li>
      <li>Also what I like about it is that it looks really pastel and \\&quot;milky\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Very streaky.  </li>
      <li>However, the application can be very tricky.</li>
      <li>Ladies stop using your nails as tools and please wear gloves when your cleaning you will be able to maintain them just by being careful with them.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>But it is all pigment, hard to apply, does not flow easily, and really neon.  </li>
      <li>It might have just been old or something, but it&#x27;s off.</li>
      <li>The color is not as green irl and there&#x27;s definitely some strong baby blue undertones going on.</li>
      <li>Anyway, application is a bit streaky (typical Essie watery polish) at first</li>
      <li>at first i thought it was just \\&quot;mint\\&quot; green...</li>

<li> at first i thought it was just \\&quot;mint\\&quot; green...</li>
<li> it makes my hands look &#x27;dirty&#x27; or makes me feel &#x27;cheap&#x27; though i do think the color is very classy.  </li>
<li> For the color, I am willing to put up with wonky application.</li>
<li> You need 3 (thin) coats to get the full color.  </li>
<li> though so i only spent like 15-20 min.</li>
<li> but it was greener than i expected....</li>
<li> I do find that it goes on kind of streaky, but a base coat and applying two coats takes care of that.</li>
<li> It looks slightly brighter than on picture or maybe it&#x27;s the color contrast on my tan skin tone.</li>
<li> Mint Candy Apple is a little misleading.  </li>
<li> This is a pale turquoise.</li>
<li> cuz usually i smear it before it dries</li>
<li> I cant quite pinpoint what is wrong with it:  </li>
<li> Unfortunately with my NC30-35 skintone, it is not so flattering on me  </li>

    <li> Ordered two bottles of this polish and should have ordered more. Perfect color for spring/summer. My daughters and I have matching toes. Can&#x27;t find it in stores!</li>
    <li> i really like pastel colours (am a child of the 80&#x27;s), so i was really excited when i first saw this on the magazine.  Unfortunately with my NC30-35 skintone, it is not so flattering on me  (and i thought us tanned ladies can wear almost anything).  In some lights (say, the mall where I first tried this), it looks pretty but in most lights (say natural and indoor house lights), it just doesnt look right.  I cant quite pinpoint what is wrong with it:  it makes my hands look &#x27;dirty&#x27; or makes me feel &#x27;cheap&#x27; though i do think the color is very classy.  Anyway, application is a bit streaky (typical Essie watery polish) at first but subsequent applications are easier to deal with though.  I use 2-3 coats to get opacity.  Color is a cremey light pastel green that has more cool blue tones to it.</li>
    <li> i have never received so many compliments on a nail polish as this! i looovvveee it! stays on great, is different without being tacky. buy it!</li>
    <li> I am really getting excellent use out of this nail polish. Essie makes a great product in my opinion. Mint candy apple is a great spring/summer color especially on your toes. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely fell in love with this color when I first saw it! Mint Candy Apple is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; color, especially with Nova (China Glaze) on top of it (on the ring fingers only). I recommend this to everybody looking for a good creme, minty blue. I do find that it goes on kind of streaky, but a base coat and applying two coats takes care of that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always always wanted to try this product.  After finally purchasing, I am pleased. The color is gorgeous- more blue tones than green ones, but still gorgeous.  However, the application can be very tricky. I do about 3 coats to get best effect and even then, I must deal with streaks.  For the color, I am willing to put up with wonky application.</li>
    <li> Great color - I always get compliments when I wear it.  It&#x27;s a nice pastel green - great for the spring or summer.</li>
    <li> Well, i was actually searching for a perfect shade of aqua/turquoise blue when i found this.... at first i thought it was just \\&quot;mint\\&quot; green... but i googled the product and found that it was actually \\&quot;bluer\\&quot; than that. so i bought it. it turned out that it was kinda blue... but it was greener than i expected.... it still looks kind of aqua so it&#x27;s really satisfactory for me and it looks different under different lighting. Also what I like about it is that it looks really pastel and \\&quot;milky\\&quot; so on my not-so-tan-but-still-kinda-tan skin it looks like the color is popping out. I think that if your trying to find a nice \\&quot;mint and chocolate chip ice cream\\&quot; type of green this will be a perfect green for you~ ^^  Although i have to say that this is kinda streaky (there for losing a star). I had to put on 2 layers and its just barely enough. It dries quickly (in my opinion) though so i only spent like 15-20 min. painting my nails this first time so i was really happy cuz usually i smear it before it dries and i have to repaint it. ^^;;</li>
    <li> I usually love Essie, but the particular one I received was not the normal formula. It might have just been old or something, but it&#x27;s off.</li>
    <li> Great color, okay quality.  Very streaky.  You need 3 (thin) coats to get the full color.  It lasts about a week, but may chip depending on the rigidness of your nails.  I would recommend this for Spring and Summer.</li>
    <li> beautiful blueish color really nice consistency,it was solid in two coats and if you put a good top coat every other day it will not chip.Ladies stop using your nails as tools and please wear gloves when your cleaning you will be able to maintain them just by being careful with them.</li>
    <li> The color is not as green irl and there&#x27;s definitely some strong baby blue undertones going on. Depending on the lighting, the color looks blue/green. I was hoping for something a bit more white but still love the color!  And even one coat was enough for me. :)</li>
    <li> I needed nail polish this color to match my outfit for my niece&#x27;s wedding.  The color was perfect and definitely set off the entire outfit.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Essie is one of my 3 favorite polishes.  This is a pale turquoise. But it is all pigment, hard to apply, does not flow easily, and really neon.  It is my least favorite Essie, I have another turquoise and a teal by Essie, they are among my favorite polishes.</li>
    <li> This is a great color. It is so fun on your toes. I would definitely order from y&#x27;all again. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Essie is 1 of my 3 top nail lacquer lines I like to use. The colors are endless, they have been around a long time and the coverage is impeccable with a good 4 step polish manicure.</li>
    <li> Mint Candy Apple is a little misleading.  The color is actually a Tiffany Blue.  Pretty color and great polish if that&#x27;s the color you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Kindly amazon allow me to rate the product by rating by stars and only optional to write my review because writing is taking too much time but any way this product is excellent</li>
    <li> I AM RECEIVING COMPLIMENTS WHERE EVER I GO IN THIS COLOR....LOVE IT SO MUCH...ORDER TWO MORE...JUST IN CASE IT IS NO LONGER MADE......</li>
    <li> Mint green is my absolute favorite color! I wore this during Easter weekend and it worked perfectly. It&#x27;s also a great look for summer as well. It looks slightly brighter than on picture or maybe it&#x27;s the color contrast on my tan skin tone. Either way, I recommend this nail product!</li>
    <li> This is a nice unique, sea foamy color. Consistency is good and the color is creamy and applies very nicely.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a nice summer color, (and it is) but it is mega bright. It was a pleasant surprise! If you&#x27;re looking for an eye-catching color to wear, this is it.</li>
