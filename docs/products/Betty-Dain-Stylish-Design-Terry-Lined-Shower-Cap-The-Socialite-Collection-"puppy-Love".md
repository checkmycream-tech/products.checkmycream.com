      <li>I like this shower cap, but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>

      <li>I love this because it does not caused sweating to my hair while showering.  </li>
      <li>B00385WMHI Betty Dain Stylish Design Terry Lined Shower Cap, The Socialite Collection, \\&quot;puppy Love\\&quot;]]&lt;br /&gt;dm</li>
      <li>Perfect for long hair.</li>
      <li>It is wonderful to be able to shower, then go out, without the hair on the edges being wet.</li>
      <li>I believe there are better shower caps available.</li>
      <li>the dog print color clashes with the pink fabric, but it works wonderfully!!!!</li>
      <li>I liked this shower cap a lot at first, but after about six months the elastic broke.</li>
      <li>She really liked it (&amp;#34;its cute&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>For the price, I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>This is a finely made cap.  </li>
      <li>and I could fit all of it under the cap.  </li>
      <li>Overall I am happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Comfortable.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic shower cap.  </li>
      <li>The shower cap is comfortable and keeps the water out.</li>
      <li>I loved this shower cap when it arrived in early April.  </li>
      <li>Excellent quality, terry lined, large for holding in long hair.  </li>
      <li>design is unique.</li>
      <li>The lining is great at keeping your hair dry.  </li>
      <li>It is also a great quality, minus the leakage.</li>
      <li>Comfortable and pretty too.</li>
      <li>Looked for a long time for a good one.</li>
      <li>My long hair fit nicely into a medium size cap.  </li>
      <li>This cap is snug but not tight and very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>The cap is great because it&#x27;s large enough to fit long hair</li>
      <li>I love the terry lining, it makes the cap have a little more structure</li>
      <li>Easy to put on and completely water proof.</li>
      <li>The one big thing that I don&#x27;t love is that the elastic leaves a mark on my forehead.  </li>
      <li>Pretty color.  </li>
      <li>The pink micro-terry lining is a nice touch.  </li>
      <li>first ever shower cap....</li>
      <li>This one keeps my hair straight or curly, whichever way I am wearing at the time of the shower!</li>
      <li>It is good for people with larger heads, people with big hairdos or people using very large rollers.  </li>
      <li>On the other hand, it is nice size.</li>
      <li>I have since cut my hair to shoulder length and it is easy enough to just tuck it under the elastic.  </li>
      <li>It is a good size for people with short or long hair.  </li>
      <li>I do have a rather large head.  </li>
      <li>On the plus side, this shower cap is large.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s plenty big enough and has kept out all the water--no more frizz from showering!  </li>
      <li>The hotel shower caps are just tiny and do little more than to perch on top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know what the smell was, but it was very off putting.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend~!</li>
      <li>The problem with that however, is that it compromises how waterproof the cap is in the very front.  </li>
      <li>Have used this several times and my hair comes out as frizz free after the shower as it did going in.</li>
      <li>It is very roomy</li>
      <li>have a friend who has a dog looks like it and wants to keep hair from frizzing.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s far better than anything I had found in the local stores.</li>
      <li>but I was pleased to find that it fit my small head and average length hair just fine.</li>
      <li>This cap doesn&#x27;t do any better than your average, $2.00 Wal-Mart shower cap in terms of protecting your hair from water leaking in.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is not a subtle smell either.</li>
      <li>What I have done to combat this is to fold the top back so only the terry cloth touches my forehead.  </li>
      <li>This is a great shower hat and really roomy for all of my long thick hair.</li>
      <li>The cap is snug but comfortable, and my hair does not come loose, even when using all of the jets in my tub.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this shower cap.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really cute hat, with little dogs on it.  </li>
      <li>the neon pink design and the huge pouf.  </li>
      <li>This item was listed as a new item.</li>
      <li>It went to the dumpster Saturday when the new shower helmet came in.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, after a year of being careful it</li>
      <li>I used the shower cap about once or twice a week, and expected it to last more than seven months.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair, so the normal unlined shower caps did not keep the humidity from messing up my hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first, from reading reviews on different shower caps.  Fear of the color running.  The only issue is the line it creates on my forehead if I wear it too long.  That is what I get from taking a long shower I suppose.  But, I have taken shorter showers and no deep line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really cute hat, with little dogs on it.  When you get out of the shower, just hang it on the back of the door knob to dry.  Nice terry cloth lined.  I highly recommend~!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, substantial shower cap featuring the terry cloth lining I had been looking for.  My only complaint is that I wish it was a little larger to fit over very long hair.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s far better than anything I had found in the local stores.</li>
    <li> The shower cap is comfortable and keeps the water out. Before purchasing, I was a little concerned that it would be too big since the description said it was \\&quot;oversized\\&quot; but I was pleased to find that it fit my small head and average length hair just fine. There is some extra room for longer hair, but can be used with shorter hair with no problems.</li>
    <li> I loved this shower cap when it arrived in early April.  The lining is great at keeping your hair dry.  However, it is now early October and the elastic has broken.  I used the shower cap about once or twice a week, and expected it to last more than seven months.  Am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I liked this shower cap a lot at first, but after about six months the elastic broke. Now the cap won&#x27;t fit and is worthless. This is, unfortunately, a poor quality product and I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> This is a finely made cap.  It is terry lined, waterproof and snug.  It is good for people with larger heads, people with big hairdos or people using very large rollers.  The cap is pink with pink and red pups all over it.  I highly recommend this shower cap.</li>
    <li> Looked for a long time for a good one. This is it. Although my five year old steals it regularly, it fits great with my long thick hair.</li>
    <li> This showercap really does what others say it does--it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I have naturally curly hair, and showercaps that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past sometimes let a little water in or weren&#x27;t secure.  This cap is snug but not tight and very comfortable.  It&#x27;s plenty big enough and has kept out all the water--no more frizz from showering!  I just wish cap designs could be a little less goofy and a little prettier.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shower cap.  It is very roomy and I haven&#x27;t had a problem getting my thick head of hair under it-even when it&#x27;s long.  The elastic around the head and face is strong enough to stay in place without being tight.  And what I think is really nice is that the inside of the cap is lined with terry cloth which seems to help keep any moisture inside the cap from getting into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is super thick and naturally wavy/curly and hates humidity or steam.  That terry makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> This is a good shower cap.  The size is good the terry cloth is a good quality.  It fits well and protects as it should. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good fit....  I have waist long hair.&lt;br /&gt;My first ever shower cap.... but.. .I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, terry lined, large for holding in long hair.  Comfortable. Delivery and shipping without any issues.  Pretty color.  Might order another. Really happy with this shower cap</li>
    <li> cute cap with doggies on it. have a friend who has a dog looks like it and wants to keep hair from frizzing. stores just carry boring ones, online has all kinds. great value, great product.</li>
    <li> My mom was looking for a replacement shower cap and was complaining that there weren&#x27;t any good ones in the stores anymore.  I got her a couple of these and she says that she loves them.  Not much more to say.  When your mom approves of something you bought her it&#x27;s a good day :)</li>
    <li> My long hair fit nicely into a medium size cap.  The decoration is not too loud.  The cap is snug but comfortable, and my hair does not come loose, even when using all of the jets in my tub.</li>
    <li> This is a durable and roomy shower cap. Perfect for long hair. Easy to put on and completely water proof. The adorable design makes it even better. So glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> I have long hair, which I wear up on my head. All of my other shower caps were too small and all of the hair around my hairline would be wet after a shower. With this cap, I can leave my hair up, with a big hair clasp or comb n the top of my head, and the cap STILL covers every bit of my hair. I am impressed! The cap is of good quality, and a great deal for a low price. I am very satisfied with this cap and have ordered another one for travel. The hotel shower caps are just tiny and do little more than to perch on top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also ordered 2 of these as gifts for other family members. I have experienced mo problems with this type of cap. It is wonderful to be able to shower, then go out, without the hair on the edges being wet.</li>
    <li> This is a high-quality, sturdy, well-made shower cap with an adorable design.  The pink micro-terry lining is a nice touch.  I got one for myself, but it would be a great gift.</li>
    <li> Beware! The shower cap has a foul order.  I washed it in Tide with Bleach and the odor remained.  It was disappointing.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a large shower cap that would actually protect my hair from getting wet in the shower. Well, I suppose one out of two isn&#x27;t bad. This cap doesn&#x27;t do any better than your average, $2.00 Wal-Mart shower cap in terms of protecting your hair from water leaking in. On the other hand, it is nice size. It is also a great quality, minus the leakage. Overall, I don&#x27;t think I would recommend for the price paid. I will be going to Wal-Mart next time.</li>
    <li> This shower cap started out good but it was not very long before the elastic stretched out. I believe there are better shower caps available.</li>
    <li> This is my third shower cap from  Betty Dain.  The cap is great because it&#x27;s large enough to fit long hair and I love the terry lining.</li>
    <li> Love the print, hate the smell.</li>
    <li> These are the greatest shower caps ever.</li>
    <li> This item was listed as a new item. The box and contents had a disgusting odor. The odor matches my disposition, disgusted. [[ASIN:B00385WMHI Betty Dain Stylish Design Terry Lined Shower Cap, The Socialite Collection, \\&quot;puppy Love\\&quot;]]&lt;br /&gt;dm</li>
    <li> I like this shower cap, but I don&#x27;t love it.  I like the terry cloth lining, so that I don&#x27;t get all sweaty when I shower. I like that my hair doesn&#x27;t get wet, even if I put my head right under the shower.  The one big thing that I don&#x27;t love is that the elastic leaves a mark on my forehead.  I really don&#x27;t have that big of a head, and the shower cap doesn&#x27;t feel too tight or anything- just for some reason it leaves big indent marks on my forehead.  What I have done to combat this is to fold the top back so only the terry cloth touches my forehead.  The problem with that however, is that it compromises how waterproof the cap is in the very front.  Not a deal-breaker, but not a 5 star cap either.</li>
    <li> For the price, I think it&#x27;s fine. Just a bit too expensive to love it I suppose. Plus, out of the package it smelled horrible. I had to wash it twice and the scent wasn&#x27;t totally gone until I put it in the dryer. Don&#x27;t know what the smell was, but it was very off putting.</li>
    <li> Worked as promised.  I love this because it does not caused sweating to my hair while showering.  I take this on all trips.</li>
    <li> Roomy cute I found it to be waterproof and does not give your hair static cling&lt;br /&gt;Second time I ordered this cap</li>
    <li> This shower cap smells so bad even after washing it a few times. I had to throw it away it was so gross</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. She really liked it (&amp;#34;its cute&amp;#34;). The other reviews that I read prior to purchase said that the elastic would break. Sure enough, after a year of being careful it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought another one. Overall I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have very little hair and this cap got my hair wet in the back.  The cap is enormous, the band tight but it does not keep your hair dry.  It is much more bouffant than shown in the picture.  It&#x27;s rather ridiculous looking btw the neon pink design and the huge pouf.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a terry lined cap for some time. Having wavy hair, the standard caps just seem to contribute to the frizz problem. Have used this several times and my hair comes out as frizz free after the shower as it did going in.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ruined my 1st one, bought this as a replacement after the nice one from the drugstore couldn&#x27;t compare to this. It fits well, covers my head even if I have a hair clip in. Best shower cap I&#x27;ve used, highly recommend. I love the terry lining!</li>
    <li> While this cap may keep the hair dry, it smells SO bad you want to wash your hair afterwards! I&#x27;ve tried airing it out and washing it, but nothing helps. Unfortunately, it looks like I&#x27;ll be looking for a different solution to skipping a hair wash.</li>
    <li> My sincerest apologies, I can only give this 3 * &#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please folks, this has nothing to do with the seller that sold me this. They did everything they could do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, we have / had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read over several of the reviews mentioning a particular smell that emits from the shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a subtle smell either. This is strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have laundered the cap once already, I checked it today after it was dry, and while it took away about 60% of the smell, I think about 40% is still hanging around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you or someone that you might be considering gifting this item to has either allergies or gets migraines / headaches, you might want to check around for another cap that does not have this scent / odor to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is awful &amp; I could see easily where someone with a sensitivity to this kind of item would want to avoid this cap altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let me put out some positives. I have some serious thick &amp; long hair.&lt;br /&gt;This shower cap did get it all covered up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned seeing an imprint of the elastic on their forehead after use, this is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not take it long to form when you wear the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find any leaky areas. (I cannot say that about my DryBar helmet I bought. I might as well have put a colander on my head as use that DryBar helmet. Additionally I ponied up $15 + Tax &amp; shipping for that thing. Never again. It went to the dumpster Saturday when the new shower helmet came in. Wonder why I kept that thing for so long anyway??????)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is unique. I wish someone would make one in a different colour. I have a plan actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make it in a different colour &amp; add in both cats &amp; dogs on the helmet. It would be cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have the cats &amp; dogs on the helmet with \\&quot;raining cats &amp; dogs\\&quot; or something on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;........OK stop laughing at me. I just had the thought &amp; it seemed interesting to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do not let me out of my cell often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my plan is to give the little cap / helmet another washing &amp; see if I can fix it.  I have not given up yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: if you like bright pink &amp; red colours &amp; you are not bothered by odd smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or you have a lot of hair, this is an affordable option &amp; it seems to work beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No issues with seller at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS cannot attest to whether this will keep curly hair from frizzing. My hair was already bushed out from humidity when I tested it so&lt;br /&gt;I cannot be sure. I will update this ASAP with the results just as soon as I do my next test.sting to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do not let me out of my cell often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my plan is to give the little cap / helmet another washing &amp; see if I can fix it.

    <li> Love this item.  Whimsical.  And practical for keeping the hair dry when showering or bathing.  I do have a rather large head.  And found the elastic a bit tight. But not unworkable. Expect it to stretch a bit with time.  Happy with price.  And would buy again.</li>
    <li> Yeah it&#x27;s ugly- the dog print color clashes with the pink fabric, but it works wonderfully!!!! I use a headband to keep my bangs back and the short hairs at my neck up, and this and don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everytime I shower. It&#x27;s impossible to shower in our bathroom without getting water on the top of my head- this cap has been a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> This is a great shower hat and really roomy for all of my long thick hair. Comfortable and pretty too.</li>
    <li> My mother loved them!!</li>
    <li> On the plus side, this shower cap is large. It is terry lined. But the edging is rough and very uncomfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> This shower cap is adorable and I love that I can use it over and over again. However, sometimes when I use it my hair still gets wet and the terrycloth lining gets soaked. It doesn&#x27;t always happen, but I&#x27;m very careful about how I wear it and I&#x27;m not sure how the water gets through.</li>
    <li> This does have a little bit of a chemical smell like some other people have posted, but it aired out within a day.  It seems like it will last a while.  It is a good size for people with short or long hair.  I know this because I had super long hair, almost down to my rear and I could fit all of it under the cap.  I have since cut my hair to shoulder length and it is easy enough to just tuck it under the elastic.  The elastic is tight enough that my hair stays dry, but not so tight that it is uncomfortable. I love the terry lining, it makes the cap have a little more structure and it is nice and comfy.</li>
    <li> Too tight on my head!  I can&#x27;t wait to get it off, so my showers are quite short.  It does the job though.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, so the normal unlined shower caps did not keep the humidity from messing up my hair.  This one keeps my hair straight or curly, whichever way I am wearing at the time of the shower!</li>
