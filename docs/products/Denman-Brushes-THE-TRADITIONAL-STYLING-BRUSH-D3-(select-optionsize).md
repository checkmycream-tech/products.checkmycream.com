<li> I&#x27;ve been using Denman hair brushes since the early 1970s.  </li>
<li> Hairbrush works fine, will likely hold up, but it&#x27;s really sharp on my scalp.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the same hairbrush at home for ages and hadn&#x27;t shopped for a new one in who knows how long.  </li>
<li> I use modest hair goo from Supercuts to make my hair stay in place and give it a little volume.  </li>
<li> Back then, you could only buy them in the hair salons and they were very expensive; BUT, worth it!  </li>
<li> It performs as I expected of a Denman, but the handle issue is what&#x27;s causing me to give 3 stars.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t get slippery when wet or when hair products are on the handle.  </li>
<li> Be careful, as it has quite sharp tips.</li>
<li> This is a standard sized brush, but even still, the handle feels small in my hand.  </li>
<li> I have 4b/c hair which is thick and coarse.</li>
<li> /&gt;I have short-ish hair and it&#x27;s slightly thinning in the front.  </li>
<li> The tips are honed in a manner that leaves them rather sharp and the weight of the solid rubber base to which they are attached seems to press those tips too deeply into my scalp.  </li>
<li> it detangles my hair with very little breakage/pull-out.  </li>
<li> After all the glowing comments, I was very surprised to learn that this brush was painful for me to use.  </li>
<li> But seriously - would it be a crime to give folks a longer handle?  </li>
<li> This a VERY poor quality brush.  </li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed in that aspect of the brush, after I&#x27;ve heard all the rave reviews about the functionality of Denman brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Denman is always the best</li>
    <li> Great brush. DON NOT USE WITH BLOW DRYER. I melted mine a bit</li>
    <li> I ride a motorcycle in the morning and show up to work with hideous helmet-hair.  I&#x27;ve been using the same hairbrush at home for ages and hadn&#x27;t shopped for a new one in who knows how long.  I needed one for my desk at work though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is perfect.  I&#x27;m tempted to swap it with my brush at home, except that five days a week I have to use this one to make myself look decent at work.  This one will stay where it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short-ish hair and it&#x27;s slightly thinning in the front.  I use modest hair goo from Supercuts to make my hair stay in place and give it a little volume.  This brush is perfect for getting my hair where I want it and making me look as good as I&#x27;m going to look.</li>
    <li> Works well, however the part with the bristles slides a lot.</li>
    <li> I like it. it gets through my very curly kinky hair</li>
    <li> Really good quality! They don&#x27;t have these in stores any longer, so I ordered from here. I don&#x27;t regret it. The brush is great!</li>
    <li> Second time ordering!! love this brush! Excellent for detangling and smoothing thick coarse hair as well as baby fine textured hair. love it, love it!</li>
    <li> Great quality, nice feel</li>
    <li> Great, as  I would expect from Denman. Good brush for gripping hair to lift while blow drying.</li>
    <li> After all the glowing comments, I was very surprised to learn that this brush was painful for me to use.  The tips are honed in a manner that leaves them rather sharp and the weight of the solid rubber base to which they are attached seems to press those tips too deeply into my scalp.  I decided to give it a week to see if it was just because I am spoiled from having used a brush with tiny balls on each bristle for several years.  On the plus side, the brush did not generate any static electricity in my baby fine hair.  Even so, I gave up after a couple of days &amp; I am no longer using it.  I will try another a Denman because they have such a great reputation for quality hairbrushes.</li>
    <li> This a VERY poor quality brush.  It&#x27;s already coming apart, and I&#x27;ve only had it a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Denman hair brushes since the early 1970s.  Back then, you could only buy them in the hair salons and they were very expensive; BUT, worth it!  Eventually, some of the better department stores started started selling them, but they were still expensive.  How nice to be able to buy this quality hai brush at such a reasonable price.  Now, you can have two or three!!  A Loyal Fan.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  I wanted a brush you could easily wash (without the little plastic beads at the end of the bristles) and was comfy to use... seems high quality and that it will last a very long time : )</li>
    <li> I love it. . Awesome for detangling and defining natural curls!</li>
    <li> Works well on my hair.</li>
    <li> love this product!!! it breaks all your tangles!! it is so lightweight and very easy to hold!!! shipping was excellent i got it days before!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Was looking for a Denman Brush and was told by my friend to get this one. It&#x27;s a great detangle brush and works great with my natural hair! I recommend this highly!</li>
    <li> Love this brush and it was delivered promptly!!!!</li>
    <li> Hairbrush works fine, will likely hold up, but it&#x27;s really sharp on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I like this brush because it&#x27;s sturdy and - you know - it&#x27;s a Denman.  But seriously - would it be a crime to give folks a longer handle?  This is a standard sized brush, but even still, the handle feels small in my hand.  And I have average-sized women&#x27;s hands - definitely not Man-Hands.  I&#x27;m disappointed in that aspect of the brush, after I&#x27;ve heard all the rave reviews about the functionality of Denman brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I like the brush itself - it detangles my hair with very little breakage/pull-out.  It doesn&#x27;t get slippery when wet or when hair products are on the handle.  It performs as I expected of a Denman, but the handle issue is what&#x27;s causing me to give 3 stars.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever! It never feels like it breaks my hair. It is soothing to my scalp and makes my curls happy!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I have 4b/c hair which is thick and coarse. This brush doesn&#x27;t pull out any of my hair and the fact that it&#x27;s nylon bristles (I think) seems to make a huge difference versus other brushes.</li>
    <li> Be careful, as it has quite sharp tips. I had to return it</li>
