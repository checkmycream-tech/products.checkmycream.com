      <li>This item, the Panasonic ES8101S is a fantastic alternative to razor blades, offering a smooth, non-irritating close shave and the option of going \\&quot;wet\\&quot; with lather as an option.</li>

      <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very close, comparable to a blade, very smooth and comfortable</li>
      <li>I was pretty pleased with my Braun because it has a self clean system.  </li>
      <li>: use a toothbrush to clean the foil and blades.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean and didn&#x27;t \\&quot;irritate\\&quot; my skin.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion, if you like a close, comfortable wet shave this Panasonic is a great choice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it wet and dry and have had my best results using it with Crew Shave oil and a bit of warm water.  </li>

      <li>It gets the long hairs pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many electric shavers, one of which was the near top-of-the-line (when it came out)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Panasonic model for about a week and I&#x27;m getting a terrific shave.  It&#x27;s very close, comparable to a blade, very smooth and comfortable and it&#x27;s fast.  I had great success with an older Panasonic Vortex model and this newer  Panasonic delivers a slightly closer shave and is slightly more comfortable, probably because there&#x27;s more flex in the shaving head.  And cleanup is easy, just a little liquid soap and water.  The ergonomic design of the shaver is also a nice feature.  In my opinion, if you like a close, comfortable wet shave this Panasonic is a great choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to keep this simple since there are a lot of good reviews already on this shaver.    I have been using this shaver for a few months. I use shaving cream so I mainly use this as a wet shaver. It is hands down the best electric shaver I have used. (I have used mainly Norelco) The closet thing to using a blade. It&#x27;s pretty easy to clean up. You just pump some hand soap directly on the foil put it in cleaning mode by holding the power button for 5 seconds and let it run it&#x27;s course (about 20 sec). After it shuts off take the screen off and rinse both the screen and razor under cold water for 20 seconds.    The only negative so far is that I have to go over some areas a couple of times. But it doesn&#x27;t leave my face irritated at all.    Lastly the shaver is definately worth the list price but if you wait amazon routinely has coupons or extra discount for this shaver.</li>
    <li> I Have been Very Pleased with this razor. Have never been able to shave with an Electric before, It always made my face Breakout. Once your beard gets use to the change from a Blade it is even better for closness and smoothness. The razor is easy to use and to clean. I determined that after the first year I will save about half of the cost of shaving with a Blade.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES8101S Pro-Curve Linear Wet/Dry shaver works very well. gives a close shave wet or dry. Works great for on the fly shaving and inxpensive the best of both worlds. Good deal.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000VKXAKG Panasonic ES8101S Pro-Curve Linear Wet/Dry shaver with Nano Technology Blades, Silver]. I did not need thirty days to trial this shaver.  It took about three minutes to discover the best shave I ever got from an electric shaver.I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver is exactly like the higher end model but without the base.  I don&#x27;t see the point to buy the base.  The only complaint is that it won&#x27;t function while it is charging.</li>
    <li> After another few years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tired of the shavers when you see all these new ones.  Problem is this one never breaks!  I&#x27;m stuck with it.  I guess I&#x27;m being sarcastic.  This shaver is very well build and the battery still last up to 2 weeks after a full charge.  Wet dry shave still works well.  Trimmer works fine.  I think by now, this model probably doesn&#x27;t exist, but it still worth a try with the new model of this shaver.  Great value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 1/2 years:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve used it daily for almost 2 years.  I am still quite pleased with this shavers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It does shaves better than other brand I used before.  It&#x27;s clean and didn&#x27;t \\&quot;irritate\\&quot; my skin.  My Braun would shaved my skins too and made it itchy.  This shaver doesn&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You can not tell very well if the battery is dying.  By the time I see the signal light it&#x27;s kinda late.  Also, you can not shave while plug in.  Once you plugged in, the safety measure will kick in and you couldn&#x27;t shave anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Braun most of my life and I&#x27;m over 40.  My dad has been using Remington which was tempting when I first looking for a replacement on my Braun self cleaning shaver.  I was pretty pleased with my Braun because it has a self clean system.  But both my $100+ Braun has problem with foil cracked and broke; charging system on the cleaning module broke.  But it didn&#x27;t deter me to get another one.  While I was looking for deals and I bumped into this Panasonic shaver, it says wet/dry... I was like what the heck is wet/dry?  Then I did some research and understanding that wet shave is to gel up or cream up your face and shave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of today, I have been using the Pannie shaver (it&#x27;s now my buddy, I called it Pannie) for dry shave only.  I found a shaving cream that sounds really good that I want to get so I haven&#x27;t done any wet shaves yet.  But the dry shave is awesome.  Compared to Braun which I never thought anything could be better, it gives a very close shaves... probably better. I can also wash it with putting liquid soap on it which I&#x27;m quite happy.  No more pimples!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, the dry shave is very good, it&#x27;s close and it doesn&#x27;t shave my skin off (I used to use Mach 3 and some advance shaver and I always got cut due to rugged face shape).  It&#x27;s easy to clean, very fast charge.  The soft,fixed position doesn&#x27;t really make a difference so it&#x27;s kinda dumb feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything to complaint about it will be the noise... it&#x27;s loud, I think it has very fast vibrating speed which is probably why the shave is so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the money.  It cost $130 to get the Braun, I paid $50 for the Panasonic with Amazon discount.  I figure my Braun last me couple years and foil breaks, and charger/cleaner broke (both times in about 2 yrs.) thus, I might as well get a new one every 2 years and still come out ahead.  Even if my Panny breaks every year, I&#x27;m still ahead.Braun which I never thought anything could be better, it gives a very close shaves... probably better.

    <li> Nothing really to compare it to since I usually use a blade. Not as close as a blade but that should be obvious with all electric shavers. Still it is nice though. Alot of people claim to get the best shave in the shower, I prefer it with a little lectric shave lotion or shaving cream, does a real nice job then. All in all great for under $100</li>
    <li> This shaver holds a charge for a long time and is very efficient.  I especially like the very high cutting speed of the blades.  It&#x27;s the highest out there today.  No issues so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many electric shavers, one of which was the near top-of-the-line (when it came out) Braun 8585, and this Panasonic shaver is the best I&#x27;ve had.  It shaves more closely and comfortably than all the others.  Rinsing it is a bonus too.  It&#x27;s fantastic!  The only gripe I have is that it doesn&#x27;t shave while charging (or plugged in).  Otherwise, everything is perfect, from the comfortable grip to the comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 Norelco shavers for over 10 years; then more than 5 years with 2 Braun shavers. I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews on Panasonic shavers, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $80 - $120 for a shaver.    When this one was on sale for $60.xx (buying 2 with $30 off promotion, made it $45.xx/each), I finally got it. The very first time I used it (dry), I felt the difference right away. It shaves faster and closer than all the shavers I&#x27;ve used before. Had I known it works this well, I would have spent $100+ for a Panasonic one a few years ago.    After 2 weeks of dry shave, I tried wet shave. Wow! It&#x27;s even better: closer than dry shave, and makes my skin feel more comfortable.     I used to shave everyday. Now I&#x27;m thinking maybe I only have to do it once every 2 days. This is really a great shaver!</li>
    <li> I had an older model Panasonic Linear shaver so I was familiar with the product.  This new model is even faster and more comfortable than the old one.  The previous model lasted for over ten years and was still serviceable but the batteries gave out and replacements were not available.  I also use a Norelco Quadra Action and greatly prefer this new model Panasonic.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great.  The nanotech blades make a HUGE difference.  I never thought a shaver could cut as close as traditional blades but this one proved me wrong.  However, this shaver can&#x27;t cut thick beards and should be used regularly (everyday or two days) on your stubble as it emerges.  All in all though I was impressed.  I got it for 59.99 too which was an awesome price!</li>
    <li> Got this shaver to replace a 4 year old Braun 7266. I realized what I have been missing the moment I started using this gem. Much quieter, much much closer when used wet, but only a bit closer when used dry.  The value was incredible at $55, could not tell how long it is gonna to last, but expect a few years.</li>
    <li> Blows away my $140.00 Braun for sure. I found the best combo is to shave wet with a little Aveno gel first. The key is to get the gel to leave a very slick \\&quot;teflon\\&quot; feel on your skin then begin shaving. As the razor picks up the gel use your free hand to smear the remainder around again. The razor will glide around with zero friction. Shaving is very fast and thorough. I can even move the razor in circles without discomfort. The cleanup with liquid soap and running it on the hi-speed cleaning mode is quick and simple. No messy alcohol tanks. Try shaving with the razor inverted (handle up with the on/off button away from your face) for a different angle. Do not use it dry, you are missing the best mode. I didn&#x27;t like it in the shower either.</li>
    <li> This item, the Panasonic ES8101S is a fantastic alternative to razor blades, offering a smooth, non-irritating close shave and the option of going \\&quot;wet\\&quot; with lather as an option. Simply fantastic! And, the BEST pricing available on this item was right here at Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> I like it. It feels a little light, but that seems to be the cause  with every battery shaver nowadays. The charger is connected with a plug. A wireless docking station would be better.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well dry or wet.  I have sensitive skin, so when I use it wet, it tends to leave more cuts on my face.  But the fact it&#x27;s a wet shaver means it clean up really easy.  You can just pop off the guard and run the shaver under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dry shave is good.  I used to have a Braun that cut a little closer but always left little bleeding cuts on my neck.  This shaver seems to be a good balance between a close shave but not too close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only huge downside is the fact you cannot use the shaver when you&#x27;re charging it.  You wouldn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a huge deal, but when you&#x27;re getting ready for work and the shaver cuts off halfway through your shave, you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s a big problem.  It has a light that tells you the charge is getting low, but it&#x27;s highly inaccurate.  You can sometimes use the shaver for a week with the light one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m still sticking with this shaver until I find something better.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this electric during the time it was $55 and you got an instant $30 from Panasonic if you spent over $99 (so I bought 2). The reviews on this one and the ES8109S (the only difference is the cleaning station) were very positive when compared to many of the other expensive electrics on the market, so I decided to bite. As a previous owner of a Norelco Advantage (with the goo), I have a preconceived notion of electrics because that one would always leave me with some sort of rash after any perspiration. For an electric, I was very pleased with the closeness and comfort I got with the Panasonic--both wet and dry but preferably wet, but I found that it would miss several places around my neck even with my going against the grain in that area. On my face it didn&#x27;t miss anything, but sadly it seemed to fall short around the neck area and I found myself having to go over and over that area before I felt satisfied. I even tried shaving after showering (while still in the shower) like people always say you should, but I still found that the Mach3 beats it by requiring fewer strokes to get very close and not miss any spots. In comparison to the only other electric I have tried, the Panasonic is good for not causing any discomfort during or after use, but if you like a wet shave (shaving cream) and value efficiency, comfort, and closeness, then perhaps you should stick to your manual razor.    UPDATE: After more shaving, I have realized that when compared to the M3, I actually prefer this Panasonic in terms of comfort, closeness, and it&#x27;s comparable in terms of overall efficiency (strokes/shave). I was comparing the M3 AGAINST THE GRAIN to this razor, and in that case, the M3 wins in closeness \\&quot;by a hair.\\&quot; But for me, I always seem to nick or cut myself when going against the grain, especially on my neck, so I end up going WITH the grain with the M3 and thus not getting a very close shave. With this electric, I can now get the closeness of the M3 against the grain (ALMOST!), without worry that I will cut my face/neck in any way. It just took practice learning how to move the electric in different directions (not just up and down) in order to hit the \\&quot;stubborn\\&quot; hairs that it seemed to miss during my first few shaves with it. Thus, ignore my above review, as I have changed my mind and won&#x27;t be going back to manual blades any time soon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a combination of a norelco rotary shaver and a triple blade razor for over a decade.  When my norelco quadra XL died (battery would no longer charge), I decided to try a foil razor.  I chose the panasonic given its wet-dry capability and good reviews.  It does give the closest shave I&#x27;ve had from an electric and the pop-up trimmer works well.  I&#x27;ve used it wet and dry and have had my best results using it with Crew Shave oil and a bit of warm water.  No razor burn or irritation at all. It rinses clean easily with warm water.  I was wary of the cleaning stations - I hate having clutter on my bathroom sink and I was glad that I went with the razor alone.</li>
    <li> Good price. very good technology. excellent shave, especially wet. Very easy to clean. New screen [Nano tech] impoves shave from my previous Panasonic. Good all around deal.</li>
    <li> Simple shaver, yet delivers a very smooth shave. I bought this shaver untried, based on reviews and my ownership of a previous Panasonic shaver (ES8152) that was no longer working well. It didn&#x27;t seem worth $50 for a new foil and blades, compared with around $80 for a brand-new shaver. I am not disappointed. The ES8101S shaves even closer, and is easier to use (much lighter) and clean. A tip: use a toothbrush to clean the foil and blades. Not a used one (smells!) but rather a new, cheap one with stiff bristles, like the kind airlines give away (or at least used to).    Update (2014 Dec 08): I see this is being \\&quot;offered\\&quot; today for $122! It&#x27;s certainly not worth that much, compared with the following: [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Arc3 Electric Razor Wet/Dry with Flexible Pivoting Head for Men]]</li>
    <li> Shaver is smaller than the previous Panny model I own, it shaves fine but feels like its made to shave a womans legs due to the small size. Cleaning brush(was in previous model I own) is not include, only comes with plug in charger and bag.</li>
    <li> Have had the shaver for less than a month and performance seems to be improving. Easy to clean and easy on the skin. However, the LED for the battery state only comes on when recharge is needed - it does not give you an indication of how much charge is left. I have a Norelco with a LCD display that shows charge state all of the time and when it should be cleaned. The Panasonic is a quick charger (about an hour) and is compact. So far, a good overall package that does what it is suppose to.</li>
    <li> Works best dry on me.  Holds charge well.  Can take on a weeks trip without charger.  Shaves quickly and evenly.  A bit loud but you get used to it. Battery light only flashes when running out.</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic wet/dry shaver. I bought an ES7017S in 2002. It was due for an overhaul so I decided to splurge and see what a new model could do. I am very impressed with the improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My major complaint with the first shaver was that the off/on switch, which you pushed up or down, was awkward and sometimes impossible to use when my hands were wet and soapy in the shower. The switch on this takes an effortless push with my thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recharging stand has been eliminated making packing for trips much easier plus this model seems to go for at least a week on a charge. The old one lasted a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is much, much closer. The old one could not handle my beard if I skipped shaving over the weekend. This one can. I just shaved after not shaving for a couple of days, and my cheeks and neck are very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the old one, I did learn that shaving in the shower can be difficult and awkward. I often worried I might drop it. I found it more suited to shaving following my shower. I use a dab of hand soap to lubricate my wet face. Once the shave is finished you can rinse the shaver under the faucet. This new one works great that way.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers my entire life and lately have become less pleased with them.  The SmartTouch was awful and while the Arcitec is much better I still feel they are trading too much shaving ability for comfort.  The CoolSkin models are still pretty good at delivering a close shave but I feel they are prone to missing spots especially above the lip.  Often times I have found myself shaving in the shower with the CoolSkin and then afterwards having to touch up with the Arcitec on the spots it missed.  Due to this I had decided it was time to try something new.    Almost 4 years ago I had tried a previous Panasonic high end shaver and it was terrible.  It seemed to do a better job cutting my skin then my facial hair.  I returned it in less then a week.  Given that I was not eager to try Panasonic again but a friend had bought the previous generation convex shaver and raved about it so I figured with this model on sale it was worth a shot and I am glad I did.  The dry shave was just okay and would probably continue to use the Arcitec for that but for wet shaving it is fantastic.  Basically it shaves as close as the Coolskin without missing any spots!  Cleaning is a breeze as well as you can just run it under water using the turbo cleaning mode.  I have always felt cleaning stations make no sense on shavers that can be washed under water and am glad Panasonic makes at least one of their high end models without one as I am sure I would never use it.    Overall if you are willing to use it for a wet shave you will be very happy with this shaver however if your plan is to shave dry only you will probably be much happier with something like the Noreclo Arcitec.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have progressed from Remington to Braun and now to Panasonic.  My last three electric razors have been Braun.  They did a good job; far better than the old Remingtons (I don&#x27;t know about the current Remingtons).  The Brauns are expensive and they just don&#x27;t last long.  I paid between $150 and $250 for each of them and none of them lasted over two years and the last two craped out at about 1 year.  So I was willing to try something different and gave Panasonic a try.  Great razor.  On my face (fairly light beard) I really do get almost a blade razor shave; at least the closest of any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used including the Brauns.       Some people have complained about the noise.  Compared to the Brauns the Panasonic is quiet.  A constant not unpleasent not too loud buzz.      Two small downsides.  The razor will not work while recharging...the Brauns would so you cold use them as a corded razor.  The second is that I cannot find replacement foils and blades locally so it looks like I will have to order them ahead of time.       Bottom line.  Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  Really does give almost a blade razor shave.</li>
    <li> This product has a \\&quot;turbo mode\\&quot; for cleaning.  You cannot shave in turbo mode.  Within 6 months, mine went into turbo mode whenever it was turned on.  I returned it, and it was either repaired or replaced.  The replacement lasted about 3 months before developing the same problem.  They don&#x27;t pay, of course, for shipping costs of returning defective units.</li>
    <li> Every 5 years or so I trick myself into thinking an electric shaver will be as good as my razer...but they still are not.  This one does better than my last one, but still requires multiple passes.</li>
    <li> I always had a rash on my face after shaving, and now I finally found a shaver that doesn&#x27;t do that.    Recommended to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use it in the shower with soap instead of shaving cream, and it works surprisingly well. Holds a charge for at least a week. Owned it since Father&#x27;s day and so far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> This shaver outperforms my old Braun by far. You can expect the charge to last for at least 2 weeks, more if you shave quickly. I use it in the shower and it is a s close as a razor (almost). I can even skip a day sometimes. Be aware that you have about 4 shaves after the low battery light starts blinking, but when the shaver stops, it stops dead! No warning from the motor slowing down. That&#x27;s the liner motor difference between the liner models and the standard ones.    the handle is a little to thin for me, especially when your hands are wet and the shaver tends to irritate your skin the first couple of times you use it, but after it is broken in you will never go to another razor. Like I said, I am a Braun man. My last one lasted for more than 5 years but it never shaved as close as this one, even when it was new.    You can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor. Great shave, great price. I was really surprised.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver.  After using this shaver off and on for over two years, I am writing this review.  I get a good close shave, but I do have to make three passes.      The shaver can get soaking wet without causing any damage which I find very convenient;   Especially when cleaning the shaver.  The shaver washes under the water facet instead of a cleaning machine with costly solution.  I do not clean the  shaver right after shaving.  I let the shaver (motor) cool down.  Thinking the shaver will last longer.    I get 8 good close shaves and 4 cleanings&#x27; on one charge.  The shaver can operate more, but I notice the shave is not as close.  Note:  The 8 shaves and 4 cleanings is over a 2 to 4 week period.  Not back to back days.</li>
    <li> Ive been shaving with various blade razors for over 40 years, the latest being the mach 3 turbo, with which I have been very satisfied. I have tried a few electrics in the past and have found them to be irritating, both to my skin and in the results.     This 8101s was a real surprise. After reading the reviews I decided to give it a chance since it seemed like every few months the price of the mach 3 and other blades would go up, so the cost of a couple of months of blades would pay for the shaver. The first time I used it I was really impressed with quality of the shave. Yes, I had to go over my beard a few times but I was liberated from the sink. Yes it did irritate my skin, but again a surprise, only after the first shave and then nothing. I tried it with lather and soap and water but found that dry shaving was best for me. No discomfort and a smooth shave. I must warn that I do not have what would be considered a rough or heavy beard, but for me this shaver is great. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
    <li> this is my second linear.   they are good.  this one is better bec. the head moves with your movement.  no need to get the fancier  model , this one has a sp.set. for self cleaning. no solution nec.  wish replacem.blades were cheaper.</li>
    <li> 13,000 RPM What good is it if you cannot get a close shave? Are they saying that use for a month and after the close shaves will begin?  I&#x27;m sorry but I went back to my Norelco with dullest of blades (since replaced) for a closer shave.</li>
    <li> Good, easy to clean electric razor. Downside is that to get a close shave you&#x27;ll have to push fairly hard against your skin. Also, it is difficult to get at the area under your nose. Any reviewer that mentions that they were dissapointed that the electric didn&#x27;t do as well as a regular razor is a shaving rookie and should know better than to compare the two types of shaving.</li>
    <li> Overall I like this shaver.  It gets the long hairs pretty good.  It provides a close shave and it has a decent battery life.  It is waterproof so that I can rinse it under running water every few days.  It doesn&#x27;t &#x27;leak&#x27; hair particles that bad either.  I would buy this again.    Weaknesses include surprise dead batteries.  The shaver will make a funny noise and then die.  If you are in the middle of a shave, too bad.  You need to look at the unit periodically to notice the red indicator for a dead battery.  To add insult, it won&#x27;t work when plugged in.  When the battery gets weak, I will have to replace the unit instead of just plugging it in and using it.  Still, it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
