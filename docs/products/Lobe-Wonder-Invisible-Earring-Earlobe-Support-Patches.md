<li> After dealing with a slightly torn ear piercing, I am finally able to wear earrings and not have one hang lower than the other.</li>
<li> Comfortable and eases the drag on the ear lobe when earrings are heavy.</li>
<li> my wife says that these keep earring secure so that they are not dropping down and pulling on her skin; her ear lobes do not look stretched at all even though she wears heavy earrings</li>
<li> so they don&#x27;t get all stretched out.</li>
<li> Reading reviews I thought it was just for earlobes that are already stretched-</li>
<li> always - I have never worn heavy earrings because I remembered women that had their lobes stretched and did not want that for myself especially from the phone always dragging on my ear.</li>
<li> I decided to try these support patches, but was not very hopeful.  </li>
<li> does not whole the earring like it saids</li>
<li> These are nothing but sticky, tacky stickers that don&#x27;t help keep earrings from weighing down my stretched earring holes.</li>
<li> neat little product if a little lobe support is needed when wearing heavier earrings.</li>
<li> These little patches hold your heaviest earrings up and your lobes do not droop.  </li>
<li> That was my money wasted.</li>
<li> I use them with heavy Kendra Scott earrings and they make the earrings feel weightless with no stretch on my earlobes.  </li>
<li> I can wear my heavy earrings again.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, from the years - it happened to my left ear - one day</li>
<li> it shows small earrings.tried two</li>
<li> They also leave an annoying tacky residue that gets stuck in my hair.</li>

    <li> Work great!!  These keep earrings in place perfectly</li>
    <li> Has saved me from having to find a surgeon to repair holes in lobes.&lt;br /&gt;A fantastic item which lasts for days.</li>
    <li> They work great and they&#x27;re affordable.</li>
    <li> These are nothing but sticky, tacky stickers that don&#x27;t help keep earrings from weighing down my stretched earring holes. They also leave an annoying tacky residue that gets stuck in my hair.</li>
    <li> my wife says that these keep earring secure so that they are not dropping down and pulling on her skin; her ear lobes do not look stretched at all even though she wears heavy earrings</li>
    <li> I think the size could be smaller for it&#x27;s not invisible if you are wearing your hair back.  I was very self - conscious when wearing them. I&#x27;ll try to cut them to a smaller size.</li>
    <li> I love these!  I use them with heavy Kendra Scott earrings and they make the earrings feel weightless with no stretch on my earlobes.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> These little patches hold your heaviest earrings up and your lobes do not droop.  The patches stay in place until you remove.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product because it did not work .It does not whole the earring like it saids ,i am very dissatisfied. That was my money wasted. I would not recommend it to anyone.If i could get my money i would.</li>
    <li> After dealing with a slightly torn ear piercing, I am finally able to wear earrings and not have one hang lower than the other. Love these!</li>
    <li> I have a split. Earlobe surgical repair is too. Costly so these. Patches are next best thing.  I can wear. Earrings again.</li>
    <li> Best product for protecting your ears as well as your expensive/heavier jewelry...I am deaf in one ear and have to put the phone to my left ear - always - I have never worn heavy earrings because I remembered women that had their lobes stretched and did not want that for myself especially from the phone always dragging on my ear. Unfortunately, from the years - it happened to my left ear - one day one of my best earrings had fallen out with the back still attached - I got &amp;#34;Lobe Wonder&amp;#34; and the earing I almost lost fits PERFECTLY and without fear of loosing it. My suggestion is to buy the &amp;#34;Lobe Wonder&amp;#34; to help keep your ears safe and protected.&lt;br /&gt;PAJ</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without them.  been using these for many years. Try these out if you are thinking about using them.  Never lost an earring fine jewerly or costume</li>
    <li> I have bought these before. They arrived on time and work great. I can wear my heavy earrings again.</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use and provide support to my earlobes so they don&#x27;t get all stretched out. Reading reviews I thought it was just for earlobes that are already stretched- but it wasn&#x27;t. They&#x27;re great to prevent the stretching as well.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and eases the drag on the ear lobe when earrings are heavy.</li>
    <li> GREAT! Thought I was going to have to have surgery. But these work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> One of my ear-lobes had torn all the way through and I wanted to continue to wear my pierced earrings.  I decided to try these support patches, but was not very hopeful.  I was greatly surprised when they were so easy to use and when they worked!  I gave 5 stars because of their ease to use and the fact that they work.  I would have no problem recommending this product.  If anyone has a problem with torn ear-lobes this is your answer.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t really seem to work. I still have droopy lobes when I wear them. But then I am almost 80 years old so maybe there is no help for my droopy lobes.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t as sturdy as I thought, they move as the day goes by and cause my extended hole to show. My light studs they work fine, but my heavier ones they stink.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought they would.</li>
    <li> It actually works ... My ears didn&#x27;t hurt with heavy earrings, and I wore them all day long, great product</li>
    <li> neat little product if a little lobe support is needed when wearing heavier earrings.</li>
    <li> I really like these, they are easy to put on and do take some of the weight off.  I use them for my heavier Kendra Scott earrings.  I normally put the earring on the put on the lobe wonder, that works best for me.  The stay on all day no issue and also seem to hold the earring in better.  I do put safety backs on them just to be safe however.  On a side not I do not have streched out ears I just use these as preventative</li>
    <li> smoothe transaction.A+++all the way</li>
    <li> I can wear fish hook earrings again. These are amazing. I use them almost everyday if you lived through the 80&#x27;s like me these will be your best friend :)</li>
    <li> Would recommend these to any one that has a torn earlobe, they make the dangling earrings look so nice and very perky.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to order them and give them to everyone!</li>
