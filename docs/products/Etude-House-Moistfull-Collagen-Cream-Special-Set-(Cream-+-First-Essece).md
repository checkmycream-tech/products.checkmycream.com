      <li>I have never found a cream I was able to use and not break out until I switched to Korean skincare.  </li>

      <li>you just need a bit amount of it to make its magic work.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for more than a month now</li>
      <li>Try this product, I&#x27;m sure you will love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
      <li>and I love this cream.  </li>

      <li>I love love this cream.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I really love this Moistfull Collagen cream.</li>
      <li>I have received so many compliments on my skin since incorporating this product into my skin care regime.</li>
      <li>I use this at night mostly, it is part of my skin care routine.</li>
      <li>I love the cream and how moisturizing it is.</li>
      <li>and it is very light but absorbs easily.  </li>
      <li>My pores have reduced significantly and  I feel like it has more elasticity.</li>
      <li>, it smells great, it makes my face soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Those who break out easily (like myself) should use this product BEFORE BED &amp; wash it off in the morning to prevent pimples.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin that tends to clog easily</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have strong smell too .</li>
      <li>The product is fine with me, but I just didn&#x27;t get what I was supposed to get.</li>
      <li>Its super moisturizing and although it says cream, it has more of a gel consistency.</li>
      <li>The amount sent looks like testers or freebies shops give away for free.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling light and refreshed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, creamy, and smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>it spreads out so nicely so you don&#x27;t have to use much to get it all over your face.</li>
      <li>There is a light scent, nothing overpowering</li>
      <li>I like this product and it was smooth on the skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cream smells good like an orange and leaves my skin soft and light feeling.</li>
      <li>Instead, it&#x27;s a lightweight, refreshing cream that I can apply both morning and night without it becoming too much.</li>
      <li>I originally received one in my memebox and this is a product I plan on repurchasing and adding to my skincare routine.  </li>
      <li>I clean my face with soap</li>
      <li>I can confirm container was completely full and unopened upon arrival.</li>
      <li>I love this cream so much.</li>
      <li>but then I remembered what the product is for so I happily washed my face and applied the the cream and followed with the small bottle and it gave my skin a healthy glow and made my skin soft and it feels nice ^.^</li>
      <li>I wash my face with a face wash that gives that squeaky clean feeling so I need a good moisturizer; this lotion has so much moisture that when I wake up in the morning after wearing it all night my face is perfectly soft and moisturized</li>
      <li>it smells really nice and the best part is a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>My skin feels super hydrated and supple after using.</li>
      <li>Super hydrating and smoothing.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, this isn&#x27;t a super-heavy, cakey cream that clogs my pores.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the cream, if you can find it by itself. :]</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a short time, however, I am very satisfied  with the results.</li>
      <li>I got Etude House Moistfull Collagen Cream Special Set (Cream + First Essece)</li>
      <li>The entire line is awesome if you are pale and looking for something to keep your skin light and pretty!</li>
      <li>I bought this set for the Moistfull Collagen Cream but after trying the First Essence, will be buying a full size bottle.</li>
      <li>As a 19 year old with fair, sensitive skin, this is everything I need.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been leaving my skin thirsty for moisture and if I use my hands to warm up the product before applying it, I wake up the next day with the driest hands ever!</li>
      <li>Smaller than expected, however, still a wonderful purchase!</li>
      <li>After buying this &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; set close to a year ago, I STILL use the collagen cream and ended up using up the First Essence and bought a full size jar.</li>
      <li>May not be ideal for sensitive skin due to the fragrance.</li>
      <li>What I am supposed to get are the moisturizer and first essence but instead of the essence, I got a Moistfull Super Collagen ampoule essence.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You need to clean your face very well to take advantage of this product.</li>
      <li>This is my second sample of the essence and although it&#x27;s ok, I don&#x27;t think it is extraordinary</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin that dries out really easily</li>
      <li>Use daily as a facial Moisturizer and it does a great job without drying out my skin</li>
      <li>this is good for normal to oily skin, but not for dry skin.</li>
      <li>Just okay... not a big fan of Korean Skin Care product.</li>
      <li>first essence.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>I actually like this more.  </li>
      <li>With just the first use I could already see my skin glowing.</li>
      <li>Not only is it priced better, I feel like my skin is healthier.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> DOnt waste money it make my skin dry.</li>
    <li> First of all, even though it comes in a small size (travel size-like) you just need a bit amount of it to make its magic work. It also smells good, it&#x27;s light and you can put on make up after your skin absorbs it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to clean your face very well to take advantage of this product. I clean my face with soap and then I use a toner (to eliminate all the dirt clogged in my pores also because I live in the Caribbean and thus I tend to sweat a lot). After that, I apply the essence, leave it on in my skin for several seconds for my skin to absorb it and then put on the cream. I do it in circular movements and put some around my eyes, neck and upper-chest part. If I feel like I applied too much cream on my face, I just rub it on my hands and done. I use this product twice a day (morning and night) and it makes my skin feel very soft and moisturized for days! I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 3 weeks now and I still have cream and essence for days! My pores have reduced significantly and  I feel like it has more elasticity. To wrap this up, I went on a trip and forgot to take this product with me but my skin still felt like a baby&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Great cream, leaves skin feeling smooth and smells good too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. It&#x27;s OK but I&#x27;m sensitive to scents. Not sure if it&#x27;s working as much as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I ordered this moisturizer.  I live in the desert and finally only need to use this one product to moisturize my face completely.  I use to have to put 2 different products  on my face.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, however, still a wonderful purchase!</li>
    <li> The cream was an average size, however the essence is very small.&lt;br /&gt;I feel as if the essence is the sample essence.&lt;br /&gt;It should be bigger.</li>
    <li> This moisture cream is great! A friend recommended this product to me because her and her mom loved it, and I have to agree - it smells great too! At first when I received it I was a little disappointed because the bottle was so small, but I&#x27;ve come to realize that a little bit of the lotion goes a long way, and I&#x27;m barely a third of the way in and I&#x27;ve had this for months. I wash my face with a face wash that gives that squeaky clean feeling so I need a good moisturizer; this lotion has so much moisture that when I wake up in the morning after wearing it all night my face is perfectly soft and moisturized - it&#x27;s great! I haven&#x27;t tried any other etude house collagen creams to compare it to, but I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne prone skin yet this doesn&#x27;t break me out. Its super moisturizing and although it says cream, it has more of a gel consistency. I really like how this feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> I like how the essence and collagen cream absorbs into my skin, and it&#x27;s a quality product. Definitely would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The essence is so small I don&#x27;t see the point of them advertising it as cream + first essence.&lt;br /&gt;But the box was sealed for this one thank god.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle. I have been using it for 2 years may be. It moisturizes well on my skin I use it as both day cream before foundation and night cream before sleeping. It&#x27;s not oily and gives me smooth and soft facial aft applying it. It doesn&#x27;t have strong smell too . That&#x27;s why I like it. Oh it comes with small applicator :)</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and the cream plus the collagen essence moisturized my skin. The cream smells good like an orange and leaves my skin soft and light feeling. It comes with a small spatula to scoop cream from the container. I just hope that the cream and collagen essence comes in bigger container, but I still give it a 5 Star due to the good effect on my skin. I will purchase this again before I ran out of this product.</li>
    <li> As was expected of shipping from Korea it took about 3 weeks to arrive. When it came there was some spilling from the small serum bottle and the cream seemed to have been opened, though I might be mistaken. I dont know if thats how it is or if I unintentionally bought a used product. theyre good products but I dislike thinking they were used before me.</li>
    <li> There was a tiny spill on the outside of the packaging but it didn&#x27;t seem to come from the products themselves.&lt;br /&gt;They were in perfect condition besides that.&lt;br /&gt;I really love the way this smells and feel!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Type: Acne prone, Combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;Caused me no breakouts and I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful, my face feels smoother and more refreshed. However the image is really deceiving. The amount sent looks like testers or freebies shops give away for free.</li>
    <li> The product is good but I expected a larger size essence for the price. This reminds me of an old Avon product and it was much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Super hydrating and smoothing.  I bought this set for the Moistfull Collagen Cream but after trying the First Essence, will be buying a full size bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a birthday present for my mum and she LOVED it. it smells really nice and the best part is a little goes a long way. it spreads out so nicely so you don&#x27;t have to use much to get it all over your face. it makes your skin really soft too. ill be buying more of this not only for my mum but for myself as well!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good product, good seller. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great price, lovely products. I use morning and night and my skin is glowing. The entire line is awesome if you are pale and looking for something to keep your skin light and pretty!</li>
    <li> I really love this Moistfull Collagen cream. I don&#x27;t however, care too much for the essence. (I&#x27;ve tried to find the cream by itself but I haven&#x27;t had any luck.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the cream in my daily skincare routine and it always leaves my face very soft, smooth, and hydrated. I highly recommend the cream, if you can find it by itself. :]</li>
    <li> Absorbs easily, very smooth, not greasy. I can confirm container was completely full and unopened upon arrival.</li>
    <li> I use this at night mostly, it is part of my skin care routine. More especially the last step. I use it before going to sleep because when i wake up it gives my skin a soft glow and i really like it. I also sometimes use it during the day, when i feel i need it. I&#x27;m just 20 and i think its a good start for collagen creams. Since my family and i always take care of our skin, my sister (who&#x27;s 24 turning 25) and i don&#x27;t show the same signs of aging like our friends. We are forever 15 haha. Its never too early to start taking care of your skin!</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a serum/cream similar to Estee Lauder&#x27;s night repair serum and daywear cream.  I actually like this more.  Not only is it priced better, I feel like my skin is healthier.  It absorbs into the skin easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave it with a residue of any kind. A small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> After buying this &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; set close to a year ago, I STILL use the collagen cream and ended up using up the First Essence and bought a full size jar. REALLY good product for the price, even if it takes a little longer to ship (I mean it IS coming from overseas...)&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin that dries out really easily and this product is gentle enough to use often. I don&#x27;t use the Cream every day, and I use the Essence almost every day. Perfect product for someone who wants low-maintanence skin care, with products that last, make your skin feel fresh, aren&#x27;t super greasy or thick, and don&#x27;t have a heavy or perfumey smell!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definately recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this product and it was smooth on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Not much in it though. And when I got it, it already leaked out of the case/bottle..</li>
    <li> I love this cream so much. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months and never had a problem. It&#x27;s moisturizing very well, and I don&#x27;t feel greasy. Also, I like this seller&#x27;s price, since it&#x27;s most affordable among many sellers. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> With just the first use I could already see my skin glowing. This product is great and works perfectly with my skin type.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a short time, however, I am very satisfied  with the results. My skin is much softer.</li>
    <li> What I am supposed to get are the moisturizer and first essence but instead of the essence, I got a Moistfull Super Collagen ampoule essence. It has a thicker consistency than the first essence (I&#x27;ve bought them before). The moisturizer is still the same. The product is fine with me, but I just didn&#x27;t get what I was supposed to get. Hope this doesn&#x27;t happen to other customers.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Just okay... not a big fan of Korean Skin Care product. 1st impression was WOW I like it... but not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t keep my skin hydrate, feel sticky, moist then dry out so quickly</li>
    <li> Good product like it.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this cream really did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Just ok! But got what you paid for!!</li>
    <li> this works really well i wish  the products were a little bigger for the price but they can last for about 4 months if u use them about twice a week and dont overuse them</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face product!  It leaves my face feeling incredibly smooth and supple, and the smell is divine! I look forward to using it every morning.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this so badly! It&#x27;s been leaving my skin thirsty for moisture and if I use my hands to warm up the product before applying it, I wake up the next day with the driest hands ever! Weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d go with an amore pacific treatment instead.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin do not buy this stuff. Maiby  this is good for normal to oily skin, but not for dry skin. I hate the feeling of my skin after 30 minutes, like sahara desert, super dry...</li>
    <li> This cream is absolutely marvelous. As a 19 year old with fair, sensitive skin, this is everything I need. It&#x27;s light, creamy, and smells fantastic. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and does exactly as promised. This product helped me kick my dry skin to the curb, and it also helps me manage the over-production of oil on my face throughout the day. Luckily, this isn&#x27;t a super-heavy, cakey cream that clogs my pores. Instead, it&#x27;s a lightweight, refreshing cream that I can apply both morning and night without it becoming too much. It also doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of my skin. It truly revitalizes it with each application, and it&#x27;s also helped make my skin become smoother. I&#x27;m a definite fan!</li>
    <li> Feels great right after you put it on and has a lovely scent.  I have yet to see results as I have only used it twice so far.</li>
    <li> I plan on using this for a long, long time. I have normal to dry skin and this keeps my face feeling baby soft, I&#x27;ve never tried anything like it before. I adore this line and recommend it to all my friends. However, if you have oily skin then this is definitely a product I would try to avoid because I&#x27;m willing to be it will cause you to break out. Even if I use it too excessively it will give me one or two bad spots. With this, especially if you&#x27;re using the whole line, less is definitely more. And if you&#x27;re still thinking about buying it, just do it, I doubt you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! It&#x27;s not thick like typical creams, but it makes your face feel so fresh after application! Smells great, too!</li>
    <li> I got Etude House Moistfull Collagen Cream Special Set (Cream + First Essece) today when I opened the package I was happy it came then was a lil sad to see how both the products fit nicely in a small neat lil box the pic it slightly miss leading. but then I remembered what the product is for so I happily washed my face and applied the the cream and followed with the small bottle and it gave my skin a healthy glow and made my skin soft and it feels nice ^.^ then I was happy I don&#x27;t mind that it comes in a small amount it honestly doesn&#x27;t take bunch to cover your face and only takes a few drops of the essece to do the job I really like it. I&#x27;m going to use this every day when the jar and bottle are empty I will write another review as to how well this worked for me, and will possibly order more. how ever my boyfriend commented on how it gave me a healthy glow he&#x27;s not one to complement much so... it did do something 1st use so I am highly optimistic ^.^</li>
    <li> This product comes with a collagen &amp;#34;essence&amp;#34; that you could add directly to your skin, or add a few extra drops of extra collagen to the cream &amp; mix it together using the spatula provided. Those who break out easily (like myself) should use this product BEFORE BED &amp; wash it off in the morning to prevent pimples. I found that using it as an all day moisturizer resulted in a couple of tiny white heads on my chin that would heal up within a few hours after washing my face. However, using it as a night cream gave me all the benefits of the collagen cream without any of the break outs! This cream feels very light &amp; airy &amp; smells great! And WOW, my skin felt soft and supple all day long! It does wonders for the tops of hands &amp; feet, too! Great for combination skin! May not be ideal for sensitive skin due to the fragrance. (P.S. directions are in Korean)</li>
    <li> I am not super crazy about the essence, as I don&#x27;t feel it does much to boost hydration or improve my skin. However, the cream is AMAZING! I love it, it smells great, it makes my face soft and smooth. My skin feels super hydrated and supple after using. I have received so many compliments on my skin since incorporating this product into my skin care regime.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and it&#x27;s really nice on my skin. It leaves my skin feeling light and refreshed. I would buy again!</li>
    <li> Second time ordering thus, love it the way it feels on my skin. Use daily as a facial Moisturizer and it does a great job without drying out my skin</li>
    <li> Etude House you are my new obsession. Everything this company makes works wonders. My skin has become so clear and so smooth thanks to this. I was worried it would not work  because I am dark skinned and this is made for Asians, but I realized that skin is skin. It worked really well for me. I am going to buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love love this cream.  I originally received one in my memebox and this is a product I plan on repurchasing and adding to my skincare routine.  I have oily skin that tends to clog easily but this provides great moisture and no breakouts.  I have been using it for more than a month now and my skin loves it.  My review is mostly on the cream.  This is my second sample of the essence and although it&#x27;s ok, I don&#x27;t think it is extraordinary and I would not repurchase the serum.  There is a light scent, nothing overpowering and it is very light but absorbs easily.  Even oily skin needs moisture and I love this cream.  Korean skincare products focus on prevention and taking care of your skin instead of using makeup to hide flaws.  I have never found a cream I was able to use and not break out until I switched to Korean skincare.  There is a reason they are years ahead of us and this product is a great place to start.</li>
    <li> I sent this to my 73 year old sister, and it is a total new concept to her, but she seems to like it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last too long and I had to wait quite awhile for it to arrive. I think I will keep searching or go back to Mary Kay skincare. I don&#x27;t care for Mary Kay makeup, it&#x27;s not very high quality but their skincare is hard to beat. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference with this stuff like I have on other products.</li>
    <li> What is this supposed to do, exactly? I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t seem younger or anything but I like using it in the winter. I feel i moistens my face and neck nicely.  I won&#x27;t buy it again, though. I discovered that Vitamin C is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the container are a lot smaller than pictured but that didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Love this product set. I love the cream and how moisturizing it is. I feel very lucky to be able to get these kind of products on Amazon prime rather than having to order it from Korea myself. Try this product, I&#x27;m sure you will love it.</li>
