### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Beautiful Barrette!</li>
      <li>Perfect for my hair.</li>
      <li>The color is wonderful, it blends in nicely with blonde-brown hair and will go with everything from a blouse and slacks to jeans and a t-shirt.</li>
      <li>I have owned two of these barrettes before - lost both of them and was sooo happy to see them on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Excellent quality, nice look.</li>
      <li>This barrette is really great.  </li>
      <li>It looks good too.  </li>
      <li>This is cute, and sooooort of works!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m buying 3 more!</li>
      <li>It was a very cheap plastic faux tortoiseshell barette.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light weight and</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s attractive and holds a fairly thick pony tail perfectly.</li>
      <li>Not a pice of junk that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair clip.</li>
      <li>Most places just have the clips, and even the largest ones don&#x27;t hold my hair securely.  </li>
      <li>All of the Caravan barrettes in this size work very well and hold a good amount of hair</li>
      <li>Wanted to like this one - a nice barrette and more reasonably priced than those from France Luxe.</li>
      <li>The clasp is strong and holds up no matter WHAT you are doing.</li>
      <li>( I have fine hair but a lot of it).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this simple yet elegant product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, and I&#x27;ve had many compliments on it, but I&#x27;m tired of having my hair yanked out be the roots.</li>
      <li>This is the ONLY one that was able to easily hold up all my hair.  </li>
      <li>I used to have a cheap Goody barrette that I got years ago that really did the job.  </li>
      <li>It looks okay but feels very cheap with sharp edges.</li>
      <li>This barrette works great to hold my thick hair and doesn&#x27;t slip.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hot and humid almost all the time.  </li>
      <li>Love the quality and price, but the product is not made for someone who actually has a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>Tortoise is a good choice for everyday b/c</li>
      <li>They barrettes don&#x27;t slip out and the clasp is a much better quality than your cheap, typical drugstore brand.</li>
      <li>very disapointed.</li>
      <li>Hold your hair in very well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I am always looking for attractive barrettes that hold my long thick hair.</li>
      <li>This clip is very well made, it seems very sturdy and has no rough edges or burrs.</li>
      <li>I rarely find the big barrettes that hold it all.</li>
      <li>I live in Florida.  </li>
      <li>It is attractive, and it holds my long thick hair!</li>
      <li>it really really holds my hair without popping open.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, but a ton of it, this barrette does not come anywhere close to holding all of my very thick hip length hair(I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 2&amp;#34; for reference).</li>
      <li>I have seen better but it has stood up to my thick coarse hair.  </li>
      <li>But I wish it were a little bigger and held my hair a little better!</li>
      <li>Definitely made in France quality so far.</li>
      <li>Very well made but not exactly right for my hair.</li>

<li> Very well made but not exactly right for my hair.</li>
<li> I have very long thick blonde wavy hair and live in a humid climate.</li>
<li> The only time I would say that this barrette is a bit small is when I&#x27;m wearing a french knot in the back.</li>
<li> really only slightly curved.&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s larger than a regular barrette, but not for someone with truly thick, long hair.</li>
<li> I have looked at all the local stores for something that would work as well, but hardly any place even carries barrettes anymore.  </li>
<li> Ladies with a ton of hair that is very thick and or long should look elsewhere for a larger barrette if the goal is to put all of it</li>
<li> This was purchased to hold my hair twisted up onto the back of my head, but it only manages a half up half down style with no twist.</li>
<li> I bought the black rippled one to go with black outfits and the brown for white/lighter outfits.</li>
<li> I have long thick curly hair</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s a tight squeeze.  </li>
<li> my hair is heavy</li>
<li> Very heavy duty barrettee for long and thick hair like mine.</li>
<li> Unfortunately this barrette arrived with chipped enamel, so I sent it back.</li>
<li> Very difficult to open</li>
<li> I have very thick hair.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I lost it, and it seems they no longer make it.  </li>
<li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this barrett.  </li>

    <li> This is my favorite hair clip. It&#x27;s attractive and holds a fairly thick pony tail perfectly.</li>
    <li> Wanted to like this one - a nice barrette and more reasonably priced than those from France Luxe. Unfortunately this barrette arrived with chipped enamel, so I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for attractive barrettes that hold my long thick hair. I&#x27;m very pleased with this simple yet elegant product.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this barrett.  I have seen better but it has stood up to my thick coarse hair.  It resembles the picture too.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my hair. I looked for this size in stores and couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, and I&#x27;ve had many compliments on it, but I&#x27;m tired of having my hair yanked out be the roots. It&#x27;s trash bound.</li>
    <li> Very heavy duty barrettee for long and thick hair like mine. I would order another one like just like it in a different color if i could.</li>
    <li> I have very long thick blonde wavy hair and live in a humid climate. The clasp is strong and holds up no matter WHAT you are doing. Tortoise is a good choice for everyday b/c it blends well w/ all clothing, skin tone, hair color etc. I have about 60 barettes in total but this has now become my standby.</li>
    <li> I live in Florida.  It&#x27;s hot and humid almost all the time.  I have long thick curly hair and I like to twist it up and put it off my neck.  I used to have a cheap Goody barrette that I got years ago that really did the job.  Unfortunately, I lost it, and it seems they no longer make it.  I have looked at all the local stores for something that would work as well, but hardly any place even carries barrettes anymore.  Most places just have the clips, and even the largest ones don&#x27;t hold my hair securely.  When I found this barrette on Amazon, I ordered it, and some others that looked similar.  This is the ONLY one that was able to easily hold up all my hair.  I&#x27;m buying 3 more!</li>
    <li> All of the Caravan barrettes in this size work very well and hold a good amount of hair ( I have fine hair but a lot of it). They barrettes don&#x27;t slip out and the clasp is a much better quality than your cheap, typical drugstore brand. The only time I would say that this barrette is a bit small is when I&#x27;m wearing a french knot in the back. I can still get all my hair in but it&#x27;s a tight squeeze.  I have owned two of these barrettes before - lost both of them and was sooo happy to see them on Amazon.  Highly recommend. I bought the black rippled one to go with black outfits and the brown for white/lighter outfits.</li>
    <li> I payed $15.00 for an item that was dollar store quality. very disapointed.</li>
    <li> it really really holds my hair without popping open. my hair is heavy and i&#x27;ve always had problems with finding a barrette that stays pu. this one did that. love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, nice look. I have very thick hair. I rarely find the big barrettes that hold it all. This one does. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This barrette works great to hold my thick hair and doesn&#x27;t slip.  It looks good too.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very well made but not exactly right for my hair.</li>
    <li> This clip is very well made, it seems very sturdy and has no rough edges or burrs. Definitely made in France quality so far. I expect to get a lot of use out of it and have it hold up. The color is wonderful, it blends in nicely with blonde-brown hair and will go with everything from a blouse and slacks to jeans and a t-shirt. It&#x27;s very light weight and really only slightly curved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER marketing this product as a volume barrette is a bit misleading. It&#x27;s larger than a regular barrette, but not for someone with truly thick, long hair. I have very fine hair, but a ton of it, this barrette does not come anywhere close to holding all of my very thick hip length hair(I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 2&amp;#34; for reference). This was purchased to hold my hair twisted up onto the back of my head, but it only manages a half up half down style with no twist. If people think you have used a sock or hair doughnut to make your bun larger when in fact it is just your hair this is not the barrette to hold it all up. Ladies with a ton of hair that is very thick and or long should look elsewhere for a larger barrette if the goal is to put all of it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this came in an extra-super-mega volume size I would purchase it in a heartbeat. Love the quality and price, but the product is not made for someone who actually has a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> It is attractive, and it holds my long thick hair!</li>
    <li> This is cute, and sooooort of works! But I wish it were a little bigger and held my hair a little better!</li>
    <li> Beautiful Barrette! Hold your hair in very well.It  has well made clip on it  too. Not a pice of junk that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to open</li>
    <li> It was a very cheap plastic faux tortoiseshell barette. It looks okay but feels very cheap with sharp edges.</li>
    <li> This barrette is really great.  It works to hold my hair in place and is big enough to hold an entire pony tail.  It doesn&#x27;t slip, either.</li>
