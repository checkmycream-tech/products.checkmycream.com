      <li>This truly is a portable professional case.</li>
      <li>I wish pockets were more deep as it does not fit any taller items.</li>

    <li> Bought this for my cosmetologist daughter she loved it uses it all the time. Bulbs get hot thought. But great makeup stand.</li>
    <li> This makeup case is sooooooo heavy, that my husband has to carry it and set it up for me.  When they say heavy duty, boy do they mean heavy duty!  I was going to use this for face painting, but I can&#x27;t lift it.  Also, it is very difficult to set up and you have to tip it upside down in order to put the legs down, so everything gets disorganized :(</li>
    <li> The case itself its beautiful and has plenty of space for all your makeup.  Unfortunately the lightbulbs that it comes with are not very bright.  Any makeup artist will tell you white lights are the best. About 2 weeks after using the case the light sockets started smoking finally making the on and off switch stop working.  I had my husband take off the left lightbulb case to make sure that nothing was on fire and we noticed that the reason of the smoke was because there was glue holding the cables and it was melting due to the heat from the bulbs,  the melted glue is what caused the on and off switch to stop working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted SHANY Cosmetics and i am still waiting for a call back.</li>
    <li> I brought this product and I was a little nervous about the quality and when I received it I realized that is was TOP NOTCH. This product is WORTH EVERY PENNY. You get what you pay for and with this product, you get even more. It looks very professional and top notch. BUY IT! You will LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed with this purchase. I purchased it on sale for 350.00. I used it about 6 - 8 times over the course of about a month. I was at a brides house doing a consultation for her when all of a sudden it started to smoke from where the light bulbs are screwed in! I quickly disconnected it and waited for the light bulbs to cool down and removed them as well. It smelled like burnt plastic and was something awful. I am going to have my husband see if he can somehow &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; it, although I doubt i will ever use it again. So disappointed, I was planning on purchasing more items from Shany Cosmetics, that&#x27;s so not happening anymore!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I love my Shany Cosmetics case.  Just as described!  It provides room for all my products and very convenient for on the go projects!</li>
    <li> Got this as gift. I was amazed at how big it was and how tall it goes up to. This truly is a portable professional case. It is made in good quality and I love the plug for hair tools. Legs extend so I was able to put at the perfect height for my chair. Mirror is a really good size and lights do provide enough light to work with. Came with lock key and it is easy set up. Only downfall is this is heavy. Would not make it a carryon luggage as it is just as big as a medium/large luggage bag.  I wanted it for flying, but do not trust to check it in as luggage due to fear of breaking it by airport personnel as it must be handled carefully. Now, I use this in my dorm and love the convenience of just packing it every semester and rolling it out of my room. I wish pockets were more deep as it does not fit any taller items. I can only pack any lip color, eye/lip/brow pencil, concealer, blush, mascara or pallets or eye shadows. My Chanel Universelle Libre loose powder does not fit as it is too tall. My Mac brush holder is way to big for the storage space even when I lay it on it&#x27;s side. So I carry a separate bag for items like that. Order arrived in safe packaging that was surrounded by foam. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> kept catching fire, sent back for another one and it did same thing</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it, everything look good, except the light are not bright enough. Hope it wont overheat! Also a little heavy for me.[[ASIN:B009M1GSW2 SHANY Cosmetics Mini Studio Togo Makeup Case]]</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  The bulbs that come with the product should be brighter.  Also i didn&#x27;t receive the other items of nail polish that was on my order.  I wrote the vendor and never heard back from them</li>
    <li> Perfect and nice I like it too much&lt;br /&gt;I would like to receive any updates concerning the this company. i like it</li>
    <li> Love it!! Works perfect at home or on the go for clients and for photo shoots! Recommend to every one!</li>
    <li> Love the case! lights work well although finding a suitable dimable white light is proving hard from retail stores. I can fit everything well and the holder provided for the pullout handle is a cool extra, handy for hair supplies to hang in. Loved it for locations where I had not much space to set up and no table for feature.    The down side... now this is a very big negative. the legs all got stuck and I had to keep it very low whilst on a feature film. one leg kept siding down and case wa tipping over. Will be contacting for replacement and will update with results.    overall loved it so handy but very heavy.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive &amp;#34;Shany Cosmetic&amp;#34; case, it was another brand called &amp;#34;Sunrise&amp;#34;.. I don&#x27;t know that was on purpose or by mistake! although the item is the same as &amp;#34;Shany&amp;#34;.. I am keeping it though! but I hope that doesn&#x27;t happen next time!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great makeup case but it is very heavy. If it wasn&#x27;t so heavy I would give it 4 stars. The vanity lights get very hot very quick.</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality. Nothing was broken upon opening. I use it for home only and it&#x27;s perfect. Fits all my makeup. Easy to manuever when you want to. Lights were bright but gets real hot quite quickly. Shipping to Australia was within 3days.</li>
    <li> The product was in good condition when it arrived.  Its very convenient because you can store your makeup, and have a station set up complete with lighting where ever you go.  I think its great for any type of beauty professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case seems very sturdy and great quality and holds a lot of products considering the size.  Its also a great space saver!</li>
    <li> My wife loved this gift BUT the light is not so good. You have to get additional brighter lighting to make it work.</li>
    <li> love it plan on using it for my daughter when she goes off to college</li>
    <li> Beautiful ant helpful</li>
