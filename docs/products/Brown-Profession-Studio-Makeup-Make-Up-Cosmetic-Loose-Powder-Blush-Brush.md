<li> The brush it self is very small and is very weak.</li>
<li> Company insisted that I go to the post office and get a written statement saying that they delivered it to the wrong address.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry to say I tossed this brush in the garbage.</li>
<li> When I opened it I was disappointed to see that it was a mini brush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27; ok.It much smaller than I thought.But it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
    <li> the description does not say mini brush at all i was expecting a larger brush.&lt;br /&gt;i did not like it.&lt;br /&gt;i would return it but it costs more for shipping then what i originally payed its not worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this brush works. I use it to put over my cream to powder foundation under my eyes instead of using concealer and it works amazing. It&#x27;s soft and never smears off my make up. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great brush, super soft with great all-over coverage fantastic deal for the price though it is kinda small I love it.</li>
    <li> Its a great brush! I use it for my bronzer, and the reason I give this product four stars is because I wish the brush itself was bigger. I feel the photo makes it look lot bigger. Its very soft and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart on me. On the plus side its absolutely wonderful for traveling or just keeping in your purse or wristlet for a touch up during the day!</li>
    <li> Threw out after a week. This product got moldy after 5 uses. It was washed after 2 uses with make up soap and still got moldy.</li>
    <li> Great Item, I love it, Well definitely recommend to anyone who loves make up as i do . Will shop again</li>
    <li> Great brush.  Applies smooth. Nice and compact. I would recommend it to everyone. Great buy. Just what I wanted and was looking for.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this item is amazing because well its just a brush. But I can say its great I Read some of the reviews and I was a bit nervous because I heard how the hairs fall off or its smaller than they thought. But for me it was perfect I have had this item for about two months now and its still working like new. Its incredibly soft my sister keeps trying to take it Haha.</li>
    <li> I love thisbrush so much i actually gave to my sis. but one downer is that once I cleaned it it went oily</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like.. i was expecting some thing a bit more bigger than what i got its very small i know its not worth it cuz of the shipping and i try to return it but they don&#x27;t give clear directions on how to!!</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be bigger, it is about 2 inch long. It is small. I was hoping to use it for taking the dust of nails after filing acrylic nail, but it is so soft. I guess I should have read the  description.</li>
    <li> I got this to make sure I was correctly getting my shades tinted in mineral foundation. It cleans easily without loosing too many bristles. I do not use this for nor would I recommend this daily use in applying make-up, it is too small. Perfect size for sampling, though</li>
    <li> This product arrived before it&#x27;s scheduled arrival date. When I got the package out if my mail box it felt extremely small I thought I might have been something else I had ordered. When I opened it I was disappointed to see that it was a mini brush. It did not say in the description that it was mini. The brush it self is very small and is very weak. It picks up powders okay but the bristles spread out when you try to put it on your face. Over all it is an okay brush and for .99 cents. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping ! Love the Product already and haven&#x27;t even used it yet.. Will buy from again!&lt;br /&gt;I mainly brought this brush as a dust brush for when im applying acrylic nails</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small but not too small to use for cover up powder or blush it&#x27;s perfect for blush! It gives that perfect shade of pink not too muh not too little&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous brush and it&#x27;s really, really soft.  I love it!  I&#x27;m going to use it for my overall foundation powder/shine-free matte powder.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is metal and even though I bought this really cheap, it isn&#x27;t of cheap quality.</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES make-up and loves experimenting with all different kinds of brushes. Since brushes are so expensive at very high-end stores (up wards of $50 per brush) this was a great purchase and fit the need.</li>
    <li> This brush was very sufficient for its price, although I assumed it was a tad bit larger but it&#x27;s fine aside from that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say I tossed this brush in the garbage. Brush is very small. And hair were falling out the first time I used it. It was a very cheap price so that should have gotten my attention.</li>
    <li> it came early . it so soft face brush . i just love it . it is small to powder all of my face .</li>
    <li> Why the hell is this s*** so dam small and it&#x27;s not sturdy enough guess I can use it for a dust brush instead boo</li>
    <li> It feels so wonderful on your face like the saying softer then a baby&#x27;s buttom I use it a lot and its very smooth</li>
    <li> Before you buy this make sure you know it will be SMALL! I ordered this and it was here a week before shipping date so that was nice! The bristles are VERY soft! This bush was just as soft as a lot of my higher end brushes! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for powder because it is very small (Smaller then the palm of  your hand) but I do use it for blush and it work amazingly! I have washed it twice already and haven&#x27;t experienced much fall out. Overall it was a great buy and I&#x27;m interested in ordering more!</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews before I purchased this brush so I kind of knew what to expect.  The brush/ handle is pretty small but the actual brush works great.  It is soft, hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles, and does exactly what I want it to do.  I use it for more translucent powder.  Great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> my daughter loved this and ask me to order her more of these brushes my husband even couldn&#x27;t believe how soft this brush was</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft and good quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;But too small for applying loose powder.&lt;br /&gt;I use as a cheek brush.</li>
    <li> Best brush I have. I use it for everything: foundation, powder, blush, bronzer; everything.</li>
    <li> Company insisted that I go to the post office and get a written statement saying that they delivered it to the wrong address. News flash: of course the post office isn&#x27;t going to admit that they made a mistake, or else they wouldn&#x27;t have made it in the first place! Definitely not worth my gas money and the post office&#x27;s time to deal with this hassle. Is eating the $0.99 and sending me a new one really that difficult?</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I bought six of them. they fit everywhere and you cannot beat the price! The brush itself is really soft and great quality.</li>
    <li> When i first got this product, I noticed it looked a little more slimmer than I originally thought. The bristles themselves are very very very softt&amp;#60;3 I am so excited to use this brush!</li>
