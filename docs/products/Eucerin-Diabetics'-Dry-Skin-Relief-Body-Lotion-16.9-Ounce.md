      <li>I ordered a tube of this through Vine and really loved it.  </li>
      <li>Really good hydration.</li>
      <li>The recipient loved it.  </li>
      <li>I have no idea why my urine would smell bitter/strong from this lotion or what the implications of that could be, but I feel that it can&#x27;t be a good thing.</li>
      <li>Eucerin is just a darn good product, period.</li>
      <li>It was not sticky No fragrance is good for some of us Diabetics.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s that good.</li>
      <li>Feels amazing, like Teflon on your hands.</li>
      <li>but once I was in a warm bed I stayed.</li>
      <li>WONDERFUL CREAM, MAKES YOUR WHOLE BODY FEEL LIKE A BABY.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have diabetes, but liked the idea of an exfoliating ingredient in my body lotion.</li>
      <li>To meet it kind of smells like crayons but that could just be me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;Older&amp;#34; product felt really nice to use just as a hand lotion as well as for my feet.  </li>
      <li>but it ended up being my own urine.</li>
      <li>Really liked this lotion.</li>
      <li>Curel Ultra Healing works just as well, is cheaper and has a nice orange hint to it</li>
      <li>it was my own urine-I thought it was something in our bathroom, maybe the dog peed on the rug or something...</li>
      <li>like the pump bottle on this lotion, it&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This lotion surprisingly performs very well and still keeps your skin feeling good even if you miss a day or two of applying after shower.</li>
      <li>This lotion is very light</li>
      <li>This one does seem to absorb better.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>in the bag not the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe this issue isn&#x27;t addressed by the manufacturer with better packaging.  </li>
      <li>company always makes a quality product and this is one of their better ones.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling overwhelmingly greasy, but I have noticed that it does leave a noticeable, body-cream feel for about an hour after use.  </li>
      <li>BUT check on line to be sure before ordering--</li>
      <li>make sure there is some fastener around the pump or carton to prevent &amp;#34;pumping&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I received the skin lotion and am looking forward to using it more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She was satisfied with how it works on her skin.</li>
      <li>is a lovely smell though not what you would call scented.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so this is kind of a natural win from the start.</li>
      <li>Can be used most anywhere on the skin.</li>
      <li>It increases the moisture in the top layers of skin so skin feels softer.</li>
      <li>so I can sleep better.  </li>
      <li>The thinness makes it very easy to spread on very quickly and it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this lotion goes on &amp; quickly absorbs into my skin but leaves it feeling silky soft &amp; looking great</li>
      <li>but it washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
      <li>We are thankful for Amazon delivering this relief to our doorstep, and being able to enjoy its curative properties, for the kind of user that can certainly benefit from a quality product.</li>
      <li>Works fine, easy to use</li>
      <li>The bottle says it&#x27;s fragrance free, but my cats disagree.</li>
      <li>My skin feels smooth.  </li>
      <li>Primary ingredient is Urea, which can cause allergic reactions.</li>
      <li>At night just before bed, I smooth this Eucerin lotion on and it takes the hammering away</li>
      <li>Not my absolute favorite, but in the top four.</li>
      <li>No odor noticed leaving me satisfied with the first experience.</li>
      <li>It also is completely scent free, which I love!  </li>
      <li>He isn&#x27;t one to complain, though, so as long as it can prevent his dermatitis from flaring up again, he&#x27;s happy with this product.</li>
      <li>The lotion is absorbed very quickly into the skin, and it is not greasy.</li>
      <li>I have to use more applications more often than my long time favorite,  </li>
      <li>I am a type 2 diabetic and did not realize we had special skin care needs apart from the feet.</li>
      <li>This lotion soothes (cool the stiffness) of my feet, the diabetic curse of foot problems seems to melt away.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, the bottle does show this to be in the middle of &amp;#34;Light&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Rich&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>As most people know the competition in this segment of the market is fierce, and only the best products rise to the top, for promises of greatness can be made, but delivering on the promise is a whole other thing.</li>
      <li>After trying several products, specially those with high concentrates of Urea 20% cream, Carb-O-Philic/20, Gold Bond, I was hopeful that Eucerin Diabetic&#x27;s Dry Skin Relief Body Lotion, 16.9 Ounce, would be a welcome addition by being a good product that would help to keep things smooth.  </li>
      <li>The Eucerin Diabetics lotion goes on a bit oily but does absorb on the skin quite quickly.</li>
      <li>The lotion applies and absorbs quickly,</li>
      <li>sure if this is normal for lotion&#x27;s since I guess I never bothered reading the labels before</li>
      <li>First, it has a light cinnamon smell.</li>
      <li>It is very sticky feeling, does not absorb easily - even after two hours, and has a mild scent which is not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is pretty pricey, but overall it is a good specialty product.</li>
      <li>Used their older product that seems to have gone the way of the Dodo that I really liked with the older style pump bottle.  </li>
      <li>A good lotion for very dry skin conditions.</li>
      <li>The Eucerin diabetic formula goes on smooth and absorbs fast.</li>
      <li>it does not go on &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; (like Vaseline Aloe Fresh Hydrating Body Lotion).  </li>
      <li>Your skin feels more soft and protected.</li>
      <li>This product has a non greasy and quick absorbing .  </li>
      <li>big bottle, easy to use pump, feels greasy at first and dries non greasy quickly, has staying power</li>
      <li>When I saw a larger size on Vine in a pump it was a no brainer to order more at no charge.</li>
      <li>This lotion is much thinner and waterier than the Body Cream, but it absorbed rapidly and didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all</li>
      <li>But I do not think I would like this feeling on my skin in hot weather yet alone</li>
      <li>(thank you) - and I have purchased them when the first stuff ran out</li>
      <li>This lotion is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>The first night I put it on and squeaked in between the sheets.</li>
      <li>Works great, but I do have that diabetes dry (especially in winter), and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this one out.</li>
      <li>I pressed out a small pump to see if it had a pleasant aroma and really didn&#x27;t detect any scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is not greasy, quickly and completely rubs in without leaving a stain on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anything working more efficiently at healing dry skin without a prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The results so far are that this lotion does provide protection against extreme dry skin conditions, assisting this way in the daily treatment that is the most effective way to keep the body moisturized and feeling healthy.</li>
      <li>I certainly recommend this lotion without reservation, for diabetic foot problems.</li>
      <li>It is almost certainly a &amp;#34;free sample&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Eucerin diabetic cream works wonderful in my dry skin, especially on my elbows where my skin is very dry.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, there are some things I really like about this product.  </li>
      <li>Product is better than expected.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The lotion is absorbed very quickly into the skin, and it is not greasy. The effects on lessening diabetic nerve pains on the skin is a bit better than other non-diabetic lotions, but not tremendously. It is pretty pricey, but overall it is a good specialty product. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin in the winter, sometimes even in the summer. Eucerin diabetic cream works wonderful in my dry skin, especially on my elbows where my skin is very dry. I would recommend it to anyone who has diabetes.</li>
    <li> It is much less oily than other Eucerin formulas but keeps my skin moist.  It appears to work quite well.</li>
    <li> GREAT.....FOR MY DRY SKIN</li>
    <li> This is a thinner cream, but it moisturizes extremely well.  The thinness makes it very easy to spread on very quickly and it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  No noticeable scent.  Really good hydration.</li>
    <li> My dad, who is diabetic, has periodic trouble with raw, itchy dermatitis. He was eager to try this lotion, as it was a name he knew but had never tried. He reports that he finds the lotion helpful, enough so that he is willing to overlook the fact that it feels a little slick on his skin. He isn&#x27;t one to complain, though, so as long as it can prevent his dermatitis from flaring up again, he&#x27;s happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I am a type 2 diabetic and did not realize we had special skin care needs apart from the feet. After obtaining this bottle of Eucerin Diabetics dry skin relief, I&#x27;m still not sure why it is being marketed to diabetics. The formula is nearly identical with Eucerins professional repair for dry skin. This one does seem to absorb better. Verdict? A great moisturizer for everyone not just diabetics.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for a few weeks now, I do not have diabetes, but hypothyroid that causes very, very dry skin..so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  What I like: big bottle, easy to use pump, feels greasy at first and dries non greasy quickly, has staying power-I feel the &amp;#34;protection&amp;#34; of the lotion on my skin-which is an odd feeling, but keeps it from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like: makes my urine smell very bitter, this gives me pause.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out what the bitter smell was while urinating few more than a week and I finally figured out it was my own urine-I thought it was something in our bathroom, maybe the dog peed on the rug or something...but it ended up being my own urine. I haven&#x27;t had any other changes in my diet or routine except for the change in lotion.  As of today I&#x27;m going to stop using the lotion and see if things go back to normal.  I have no idea why my urine would smell bitter/strong from this lotion or what the implications of that could be, but I feel that it can&#x27;t be a good thing.</li>
    <li> This is body lotion is not as thick as I had expected. To be fair, the bottle does show this to be in the middle of &amp;#34;Light&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Rich&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> If you are seeking real relief from the awful discomfort that dry skin can give to a diabetic, especially in the winter, this product is a must. It is non-oily and seems to sink right into your skin, almost as if it is filling in all those little cracks that get far worse from scratching. We use it as a body lotion, and also keep it at the sink to apply immediately after hand washing. Wether or not you are diabetic, you would do well to keep this product on hand. I can&#x27;t imagine anything working more efficiently at healing dry skin without a prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My husband that has diabetes loves the product, personally I find the product is too waxy.</li>
    <li> This was a present.  The recipient loved it.  It works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Purchased for husband. He really likes it.</li>
    <li> I received the skin lotion and am looking forward to using it more. I have used Eucerin products before, but believe this one designed for Diabetics is new.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for developing a specific product for this!</li>
    <li> The best there ever was.</li>
    <li> This product has a longer lasting result than others I have used. The lotion applies and absorbs quickly, that of which I like but does leave a little sticky feel for a short while. No odor noticed leaving me satisfied with the first experience. If you battle dry skin from being a diabetic with the breaking out of irritation as a result, I expect you will be pleased with the feeling of relief after the first few applications. Most other product have a short lived or need of continuous use just to gain control of the problem. This lotion surprisingly performs very well and still keeps your skin feeling good even if you miss a day or two of applying after shower.</li>
    <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t greasy.  My skin feels smooth.  My only complaint is the smell which seems pretty synthetic (not natural).  It&#x27;s not a strong smell but it&#x27;s not pleasing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have diabetes, but liked the idea of an exfoliating ingredient in my body lotion. However I found this lotion to have insufficient moisturizing ability. The only time I think it might be enough is in the hottest summer weather. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and it is especially bad in the winter.  The skin on my fingers crack and bleed and because wash my hands so often, it is a constant battle.  The Eucerin diabetic formula goes on smooth and absorbs fast. It feels a little thin (watery) and I expected it to be thick since it is marketed for diabetics.  My skin is silky soft all day long with the exception of my hands but I need to find a heavy duty cream for them. There was no scent in the version I received.</li>
    <li> The Eucerin Diabetics lotion goes on a bit oily but does absorb on the skin quite quickly. It does leave a slightly oily coat on your skin when first applied. The active ingredients of this lotion are supposed to help remove the dead skin cells while promoting the rejuvenation of new skin cells. It&#x27;s definitely noticeable after using this 3 days straight. Your skin feels more soft and protected.</li>
    <li> First, this was shipped in a small box with a plastic bag around it (glad it at least had the bag!). It arrived with a large portion of the lotion in the bag, due to a broken top. Once I cleaned up the mess, I removed the broken top and used some on my arms and hands. It is very sticky feeling, does not absorb easily - even after two hours, and has a mild scent which is not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up washing it off and chalking this up to a bad experience. I will usually give most products a second try - this one went into the trash.</li>
    <li> Although this lotion does seem to soften my skin, I do not like the sticky, greasy feeling that come with it (and gave it away).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin Calming Cream for several years on my dry, flaky diabetic legs and it works well. It even gets rid of that horrible itchy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I thought I&#x27;d give this new diabetic lotion a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t like it. I found it to be greasy and sticky.  Several hours after smoothing on  the lotion, it was still tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I don&#x27;t recommend this lotion and I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Got 2, one for my dad and another for my grandma- both diabetics and they like them.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the lotion.  Easy to apply and long lasting</li>
    <li> It smells horrid. I tried it anyway and it did work, it actually did really well. I just could not get over the smell.  I found it in the local store and smelled it and it smelled just like the one I got from Amazon. Maybe I am just sensitive to the smell....</li>
    <li> This is probably the best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Not too thick like some of the Eucerin products and not runny like some other brands. It is supposed to be mid range in the heaviness category.  I was Really surprised on how long it lasted on my skin..more than one day.  You can actually feel this on your skin still, after being dressed all day, working, etc.  It says contains alpha hydroxy + ceramide 3.  Alpha hydroxy acid, I thought, is something that&#x27;s an ingredient in facial renewing products..I&#x27;m a bit confused with that one.  Product does say though that you need to be careful about the sun when using this..use sun block and limit sun exposure..hmmmm.  It really moisturizes me, I&#x27;m not a diabetic.  Saw the name and thought it must be really heavy duty stuff if for diabetic use so got it.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the way it feels on the palms of my hands, probably just me tho!</li>
    <li> I like this Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; Dry Skin lotion for my chapped, dry, winter hands.  I like the consistency of the lotion itself, it&#x27;s not too thick and it&#x27;s not too runny.  It does have an interesting fragrance to it, it&#x27;s not perfumey, it smells a little \\&quot;manly\\&quot; to me, though I don&#x27;t mind the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pump bottle on this lotion, it&#x27;s very easy to use.  Squeezing tubes and opening lids can be difficult for me because I have arthritis but this pump dispenser makes dispensing hassle free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way the lotion works on my cracked, chapped hands but I didn&#x27;t like the way the lotion felt when I put it on my face and arms. It felt like there was a little layer of stickiness on my skin, which I did not feel on my hands when I used it.  I also thought there was a little bit of a greasiness to the consistency of the lotion but I liked the way it moisturized my hands, they need serious help in the winter time.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m not a diabetic, I ordered this product because I&#x27;m dealing with winter dry skin - knees, feet, elbows, chapped hands, and other body parts.  I really like it.  The lotion seemed very thick at first but totally blends into my skin without leaving any sticky residue.  It also is completely scent free, which I love!  The pump action works well and is convenient to leave on the bathroom counter.  There was, however, a small leakage during shipping but the container was sealed in a plastic bag so there was no real problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a product that has a non greasy and quick absorbing formula for dry skin.  I am a borderline diabetic, and control my levels with my diet. As I age I find everything has been changing.  Especially my skin.  This product has a non greasy and quick absorbing .  But, little noticeably softness on heels and elbows.  I have used many brands and always seem to come back to my favorite for healing and softness of harsh areas of my body. I have found with Eucerin Diabetic body lotion I have to use more applications more often than my long time favorite,  I would recommend another brand other than this one, It&#x27;s just ok, not great.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the feel of it on my skin after applying.</li>
    <li> A good lotion for very dry skin conditions.</li>
    <li> Feels amazing, like Teflon on your hands. Whole family loves it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very light and I am not diabetic but saw it on Dr. Oz and it is not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The smile is not good. And the skin fell very oil.</li>
    <li> It really helps the dryness of my legs and feet.  I would like it better if it were not so heavy.</li>
    <li> Best cream I have used</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL CREAM, MAKES YOUR WHOLE BODY FEEL LIKE A BABY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Eucerin products so this is kind of a natural win from the start. Things that stand out to me is the smell, there is one, but it&#x27;s really faint. The only wish I&#x27;d have is that that faint smell were a significantly good one. To meet it kind of smells like crayons but that could just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from how it smells, I have no complaints at all. This product functions perfectly as a lotion and sticks around too. If you&#x27;re needing lubrication for your skin, I would recommend no other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall awesome.</li>
    <li> A medium weight skin cream that works really well.  I have been using this cream for about a week and have already noticed that some of the rough, dry patches, like on my heels and elbows, are much, much better.  It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling overwhelmingly greasy, but I have noticed that it does leave a noticeable, body-cream feel for about an hour after use.  I have also noticed that it does its best work when I put it on after a shower.  The bottle says it&#x27;s fragrance free, but my cats disagree.</li>
    <li> Yes this lotion moisturizes and lasts for a few hours. I&#x27;ve noticed improvement in my hands, fingers and heels as they tend to split and crack over the winter but don&#x27;t care for the smell; too much like chemicals. Curel Ultra Healing works just as well, is cheaper and has a nice orange hint to it so I&#x27;ve been using that as a replacement.</li>
    <li> Works fine, easy to use</li>
    <li> I ordered a tube of this through Vine and really loved it.  Great moisturizer, not greasy; not scented...super product.  Does what it says.  When I saw a larger size on Vine in a pump it was a no brainer to order more at no charge. BUT manufacturer&#x27;s apparently send product to Amazon who ship samples--sometimes carelessly.  This pump bottle was tossed in a plastic bag which had about 3 oz. in the bag not the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe this issue isn&#x27;t addressed by the manufacturer with better packaging.  It is almost certainly a &amp;#34;free sample&amp;#34; glitch.  BUT check on line to be sure before ordering--make sure there is some fastener around the pump or carton to prevent &amp;#34;pumping&amp;#34; the pun in transit.  Aside from that, it&#x27;s terrific.</li>
    <li> This is a good, functional, non-greasy moisturizing skin lotion. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my body but does somehow leave one on my hands. It does, however, work wonders on really dry spots like my heels. Not my absolute favorite, but in the top four.</li>
    <li> My wife is diabetic and has very dry skin, especially in winter. She gave this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was satisfied with how it works on her skin. It has little or no smell which was fine with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amazon price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were no significant downsides. Hope it works well for you if you decide to try it out.</li>
    <li> This lotion leaves a sticky feel, but does its job.</li>
    <li> Great product. Within one day, the skin softened up and became supple. Can be used most anywhere on the skin.</li>
    <li> I usually like their products, but this lotion made my skin burn and itch as soon as I  put it on. Hands and arms turned red. Skin peeled with some of the places being deep. Did not feel like a sensitive skin lotion. Has taken quite awhile for my hands to heal and still not completely cleared up.  Also, left my skin extremely dry now. Very uncomfortable situation.&lt;br /&gt;In the Amazon ad they have failed to mention that people should read the warnings on the back.  Sun Burn alert.  I was not outside that long after the second use and it made the situation worse.  I later turned the bottle over and saw the warning.  Just not good for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt; I returned it.</li>
    <li> Great product..I never thought my shins would look normal again</li>
    <li> Really liked this lotion. It was not sticky No fragrance is good for some of us Diabetics. Keeps your skin soft. Helps a lot with the nightly itchy feet and legs.</li>
    <li> I tried this product during a local product demo at our local WM when it first appeared on the shelf.  Although I am only a borderline diabetic, I found this to work quite well on my dry skin.  Never had such dry skin before moving to a State where one has to run a dehumidifier 24/7 nearly year round just to be able to breathe!  I must say though that I didn&#x27;t seem to notice any over and above extra results in this lotion versus the results I get in using normal Eucerin creams or lotions for dry skin. Persons who actually are diabetic may have different results. Bottom line -  Eucerin is just a darn good product, period.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin I&#x27;d just buy the regular Eucerin instead.</li>
    <li> I found the product a bit too greasy for me. I just left a greasy feel when I applied it.</li>
    <li> I still get the greasy feeling in my fingers after using but not as much as other lotion&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Is noticeably more watery looking than the usual lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to really make it stand out other than it has little to no smell to it at all so it&#x27;ll be great for&lt;br /&gt;people that don&#x27;t like smells in their lotion&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this is normal for lotion&#x27;s since I guess I never bothered reading the labels before but there is a warning that it may increase risk of sunburn after use.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and it feels like it is really penetrates into my painfully dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Large bottle so it should last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;THere is a lovely smell though not what you would call scented.&lt;br /&gt;It is medium rich and not so thick you need to wear gloves to continue through your day.&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that is does feel greasy and that is an uncomfortable feeling for me.&lt;br /&gt;HOwever the good vastly outweighs the negative so I gave it 4 star rating.  Greasy feeling is an important element is the use of a treatment that has to take you through working on tablets and writing and to places in my day where leaving a stain or being afraid I will do so is not an option.&lt;br /&gt;I would and in fact have glowingly told friends about his product with the caveat that it should be used when the greasy feeling is not important.</li>
    <li> That clear enough? I became of fan of Eucerin products after getting a shot at a couple of their products via Vine (thank you) - and I have purchased them when the first stuff ran out - it&#x27;s that good. I really like the [[ASIN:B00DEXA0LY Eucerin Body Creme Eczema Relief, 8 oz.]], I keep a tube at home and at the office. Works great, but I do have that diabetes dry (especially in winter), and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this one out. This lotion is much thinner and waterier than the Body Cream, but it absorbed rapidly and didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all and my skin just soaked it up like a sponge after a long stint in the desert. And it lasts too, I don&#x27;t feel the need to keep reapplying it over and over through the day. I know this isn&#x27;t a face cream, but a bit of it on my face cuts back on the flakiness I get after putting some makeup on it.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle this came in was a very generous sized (for the price) 16.9 oz, and I like the pump bottle instead of having to pick up a tube and squeeze some out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, and one I would purchase after this bottle is used up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not diabetic, but I do have dry skin.  Eucerin Diabetic Lotion works for me, also.  I use it every morning, and I don&#x27;t ever have to reapply until the next day.  It&#x27;s not too thick and it doesn&#x27;t feel watered down.  The creamy texture and medicinal scent combine to tell me the makers mean business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the playful scent of floral or fruit and a pretty label, you won&#x27;t find it here, maybe because we never see doctors prescribing that pink lotion that smells like strawberries.  Eucerin aims for respect.  Eucerin got it.</li>
    <li> My wife is not diabetic, but she does have dry skin since we live out here in the desert.  From time to time in the winter I also have dry skin here and need something to moisturize it.  Eucerin has been a great product for years and one that we have had on our shelves.  It works well, is not overpowering, and is something that brings us relief all day long.</li>
    <li> Typically the accepted wisdom is to not purchase anything marketed to &amp;#34;diabetics&amp;#34; because similar (if not more effective) products are available for less cost. This maybe one of those products. However this product seems to be inline with similar regular Gold Bond and Vaseline products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that it works any better than other (non-diabetic) products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are some things I really like about this product.  First, it has a light cinnamon smell. This smell does not last long.  Second it does not go on &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; (like Vaseline Aloe Fresh Hydrating Body Lotion).  The Vaseline product dries but the Eucerin product leaves the feeling of a film of some sort.... but it washes off easily with soap and water. Finally, it seems to cover much better (less goes further than the Vaseline).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely do NOT put it on any type of rash, it will burn.</li>
    <li> Really hydrates well.</li>
    <li> This lotion is exactly what I needed. It helps with dry skin and lasts all day. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have four rough, itchy patches on my skin and they have been irritating me. I put this lotion on and it calmed my skin immediately. I am happy about that!</li>
    <li> Terrific lotion!  This lotion soothes (cool the stiffness) of my feet, the diabetic curse of foot problems seems to melt away.  At night just before bed, I smooth this Eucerin lotion on and it takes the hammering away so I can sleep better.  How valuable is that?  It is just so soothing and not greasy that it great for this use, best I have found.  I certainly recommend this lotion without reservation, for diabetic foot problems.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased to open the box, while it leaks out everywhere, a little disappointed, but it isn&#x27;t broken, do not know why. I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This works, it works really well, I noticed a difference with 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has a light scent that is neither unpleasant nor noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy, quickly and completely rubs in without leaving a stain on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;This company always makes a quality product and this is one of their better ones.</li>
    <li> Made by Eucerin....what else can I say!</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this product for a couple of reasons&lt;br /&gt;- leaves skin squeaky. The first night I put it on and squeaked in between the sheets. Had it of been summer I would of showered again just to get it off but once I was in a warm bed I stayed. But I do not think I would like this feeling on my skin in hot weather yet alone any humidity.&lt;br /&gt;- I pressed out a small pump to see if it had a pleasant aroma and really didn&#x27;t detect any scent. As you pump out full pumps you will notice an aroma the second you apply to your skin and it&#x27;s NOT pleasant. It reminds me of rubber bands..</li>
    <li> Used their older product that seems to have gone the way of the Dodo that I really liked with the older style pump bottle.  When applying this product, it leaves my hands very sticky and uncomfortable and I have to wash them after applying the lotion on my feet. The &amp;#34;Older&amp;#34; product felt really nice to use just as a hand lotion as well as for my feet.  Bought four bottles of this and won&#x27;t buy it again, will use it until it&#x27;s gone though.</li>
    <li> Product is better than expected.  It stays where you put it and does not feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I love the way this lotion goes on &amp; quickly absorbs into my skin but leaves it feeling silky soft &amp; looking great</li>
    <li> Made with alpha and hydroxy + ceramide 3, Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; dry skin relief states that it softens skin after just one use and keeps it that way for 24 hours. I wanted to try this for cracked heels. The directions state to apply after a shower when skin pores are open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have applied this Eucerin lotion to my heels and elbows for several days (sorry not right after a shower) and noticed an improvement in how these areas look and feel in two days. I would say that this lotion works well except for one aspect - a perceived wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that a lotion needs to consist of ingredients that are going to penetrate the skin and remain. This lotion states that it is non greasy. The ingredients do not absorb right away as with other types of lotions. I apply and my heels and hands remain damp/slick. I waited a few minutes and slid my feet into my scuff slipper and the area where my heels were became matted and well, not dry. I had to wash my hands with soap to remove the lotion. The next time I applied this lotion, I put on a pair of socks. I dislike sleeping with socks but didn&#x27;t want whatever ingredient in the lotion that seems damp to transfer to my sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wondered why a lotion with a targeted market of people with diabetes would contain any sugar at all. I checked on just a few ingredients: Mannitol - osmotic diuretic that occurs naturally as a fruit sugar; Sucrose - cane and beet sugar; Shea butter - naturally occurring fat, derived from the nut of the Karite tree; Urea - product of ammonia + carbon dioxide. It slightly alters the structure of the skin, giving other chemicals better penetration thereby enhancing effectiveness. It increases the moisture in the top layers of skin so skin feels softer. Primary ingredient is Urea, which can cause allergic reactions. Because the lotion also contains alpha hydroxy acid, a user is warned to use sunscreen, protective clothing, and limit sun exposure while using the lotion and for aweek afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder at all the chemicals in this product. I think perhaps the shea butter might be making the lotion linger and not allowing my skin to dry enough it to feel dry, but I am unsure. Apparently, Eucerin also makes a foot creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; Dry Skin Relief  lotion are: Water, Urea, Glycerin, Isopropyl Sterate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Glyceryl Glucoside, Sodium Lactate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Nylon-12, Polyglyceryl-4, Diisosterate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Lactic Acid, Ceramide 3, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arginine HCL, Cetearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium PCA, Sodium Chloride, Carnitine, Potassium Sorbate, Mannitol, Serine, Sucrose, Citrulline, Glycogen, Histidine HCL, Alanine, Threonine, Glutamic Acid, Lysine HCL.</li>
    <li> Everyone who has experienced with diabetes (curse that debilitating disease!), whether from personal experience, or someone close to them, know how frustrating the symptoms can be. One of the most urgent symptoms to treat, besides the use of insulin for some that regretfully are forced to use to keep it at bay, is the dryness of the body, like the feet, legs, even the face. The treatment suggested for dry skin is to use a high performance type of cream, that with proper management, can and will keep the dryness devoid of rough, dry, dead skin areas. After trying several products, specially those with high concentrates of Urea 20% cream, Carb-O-Philic/20, Gold Bond, I was hopeful that Eucerin Diabetic&#x27;s Dry Skin Relief Body Lotion, 16.9 Ounce, would be a welcome addition by being a good product that would help to keep things smooth.  The results in the few days of using the product, brought relief to one of our tribe members, who started using it daily replacing a previous lotion, just to be able to find out how effective it was.  The results so far are that this lotion does provide protection against extreme dry skin conditions, assisting this way in the daily treatment that is the most effective way to keep the body moisturized and feeling healthy. Some of the areas in which it was applied were the legs, feet, arms, and lots on the hands, and it has led to good results, with only a faint scent that did not seem to intrude much as far as the user was concerned.  As most people know the competition in this segment of the market is fierce, and only the best products rise to the top, for promises of greatness can be made, but delivering on the promise is a whole other thing. Euchring Diabetic&#x27;s Dry Skin Relief Body Lotion is a decent product, and as much as I would like to say that I went down the ingredients involved, and was able to identify each one and what they do, I have to say that our knowledge as a group is quite limited, to put it mildly. As consumers we keepthinking and hoping, that the manufacturers of the products we use, are professional enough, and caring enough for their customer base, that they would not knowingly sell a product that can cause more harm than good.  So far this product is doing good, but it is entirely based on repetition, for it certainly is no miracle cure-apply once and never have to worry again, instead with daily use it does deliver healing results in a medium thickness formula, not too greasy, and not too thin. We are thankful for Amazon delivering this relief to our doorstep, and being able to enjoy its curative properties, for the kind of user that can certainly benefit from a quality product. 4 Stars.</li>
