<ol>
      <li>but I wasnt impressed.</li>
      <li>This product is awesome!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I got the sassafras version and the smell is magnificent.</li>
      <li>The lather is sufficient and the smell is intially great!</li>
      <li>That being said, it still makes for one good bar of soap in the shower!</li>
      <li>but I get a great shave with this soap.</li>
      <li>It smells great</li>
      <li>I still think it&#x27;s a great soap and definitley recommend it.</li>
      <li>It smells great and goes on well.</li>
      <li>lather, oils didnt seem to be very effective.</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients and the scent as does my wife, but the lather isn&#x27;t always the greatest.  </li>
      <li>Pleasant gender neutral fragrance.</li>
      <li>The scent is also pleasant and not offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Soap is good.  </li>
      <li>Still then the 3 stars are for the smell and the good feel after shaving.</li>
      <li>Otherwise a good product that I would purchase again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a lady, and I use this just to shave my armpits, for the most part, and it is a great alternative to buying shaving cream in a can.</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>The smell of this bar is amazing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent of the soap is amazing.</li>
      <li>It still allows for a nice close shave.</li>
      <li>It does smell nice, give it that.</li>
      <li>While the shave soap from Etsy was good, we have tried others and this is my hubby&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve added my own oils to thicken the lather, but to no avail.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to see a company trying to make a healthy product.  </li>
      <li>The smell is ok it isnt very strong</li>
      <li>I appreciate that it is cruelty free and environmentally friendly, as well as having (what I think is) a great smell.</li>
      <li>Overall, I have found it to be an excellent shaving soap.</li>
      <li>Smell is interesting.  </li>
      <li>Some may love this</li>
      <li>Exotic but not floral.</li>
      <li>Refreshing but not minty.</li>
      <li>As for lathering capability, I think it is okay.</li>
      <li>The charcoal smell takes a bit getting used to, but I still love it.</li>
      <li>The lather could be a touch more lather-y, but it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a scone made without butter--it looks okay</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m appreciative of earth friendly packaging and business practices.</li>
      <li>The lather is pretty good too.</li>
      <li>Although the scent of this soap is good but it doesn&#x27;t do its job properly which is produce good lather.</li>
      <li>I personally enjoy a lather that is a bit more dense.</li>
      <li>It can really lather up with a good amount of water on your brush, however, the lather is not as rich as a shaving cream would be, it&#x27;s more like a light lather.</li>
      <li>soap builds a vigorous foam lather very quickly with a shaving brush, and the lather holds well through pass of shaving.</li>
      <li>Smell is clean, light and earthy.</li>
      <li>This bar is very easy to use and very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to whip up a good volume of lather but as mentioned by others, is not a creamy and hearty lather.</li>
      <li>Instead it is light and dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>Place saob bar in a wooden dish and build up the lather with a good badger hair brush.</li>
      <li>works great, little irritation, smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>Great product, My skin does not irritate like it does with other products.</li>
      <li>This is not a soap for those that need a quick morning routine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The overly airy lather dissipates too quickly and is virtually gone before you can finish shaving.  </li>
      <li>Not crazy about it, but not bad.</li>
      <li>Scent is still powerful.</li>
      <li>A couple of years ago, I bought shave soap on Etsy and a shave brush and bowl for my brother-in-laws for Christmas and found out after that my husband was jealous/disappointed and would have liked the same.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite powerful; you can smell it just by standing in close proximity when the puck is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>I make my own shaving soaps now, but all I did was make my own version of this soap, it was definitely the standard for my recipes.</li>
      <li>I am happy with the ingredient list and the performance (at first I thought it dry, it takes only a bit more time to get the lather I need).</li>
      <li>I find myself re-wetting and reapplying far too frequently for my own taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am now using it as a shower bar, and can attest that the roughness of the bar is nice to wash with, but it wont last much longer.  </li>
      <li>However, this soap has only a mild, all-natural scent that goes away very quickly when rinsing one&#x27;s face.</li>
      <li>I was immediately interested in this soap when I noticed that it contains bentonite clay as well.  </li>
      <li>This is my first experience with this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine if you lather up in sections as you progress through the shave but plan for some extra time.</li>
      <li>(it pairs really nicely with clubman special reserve aftershave), but performance is seriously lacking.</li>
      <li>That makes it very affordable.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
      <li>When I find myself with some extra time, I&#x27;ll indulge myself to the fantastic aroma and not focus on the number of times I have to lather up.</li>
      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
      <li>which is a good thing because it sort of smells a little different.</li>
      <li>More soap, less soap, more water, less water, lather on your hand, in a cup or on your face, it doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried more water &amp; less water, it just doesn&#x27;t perform.</li>
      <li>I have tried using more water, which makes the lather whip quicker and last longer, but then it&#x27;s not of the proper consistency.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone and would definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
      <li>The soap creates an initial lather, but it &amp;#34;falls&amp;#34; fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more work</li>
      <li>and I normally always have a lot of ingrown hairs, however,</li>
      <li>I would normally rate this a one-star.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Not having a lot of luck finding a good soap in the natural/organic market, I&#x27;m sorry to say I will most likely reduce my standards to paraben-free on my next buy, and hopefully find something that does the trick.</li>
      <li>New to using shaving soap</li>
      <li>Like I said I&#x27;m new to shaving soap</li>
      <li>Just expected a more creamier, lasting soap.&lt;br /&gt;Low</li>
      <li>and the lather takes a longer-than-average time to whip, and once applied it tends to dry up quickly.</li>
      <li>If the bar stays warm it is a better experience, but is still a little thin.  </li>
      <li>I use Edwin Jagger 99% natural bars and thought I would try something new to see what is out</li>
      <li>things considered, I like the soap and might re-order it, but I&#x27;ll most likely only use it on weekends when I can take a long time for a relaxing shave.</li>
      <li>But it falls short straight out of the cup.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nowhere near shaving cream</li>
      <li>Regardless, initially, using a badger brush, this soap lathers promisingly.  </li>
      <li>Cool idea, but my blade does not glide down my face, rather, it rubs.</li>
      <li>but it lathers enough for a decent shave.</li>
      <li>The lather is very poor and doesn&#x27;t last for some time, doesn&#x27;t provide good cushioning between the face and the blade.</li>
      <li>Strong and complex enough to wake you up but not lingering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It would make a nice hand soap and this is what this is unfortunately destined for because as a shaving soap it is a total bust.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, it may be a one-off experience and could be highly dependent upon other factors.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does smell nice, give it that. It would make a nice hand soap and this is what this is unfortunately destined for because as a shaving soap it is a total bust. As soon as the lather hits your face it is gone, dissolved into nothing. It&#x27;s like shaving with cold water and sand. There is something missing in this soap, some ingredient lacking.  It&#x27;s like a scone made without butter--it looks okay but as soon as you take a bite you&#x27;ve got a mouthful of flour and all the moisture has been sucked out of your head. I hate starting the day with my face burning and bleeding--but smelling oh so nice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for over 6 months and I love it! The lather is sufficient and the smell is intially great! I would have given this product 5 stars if the smell lasted a bit longer. But it&#x27;s really not a bid deal. No more irritated skin will using this product. Place saob bar in a wooden dish and build up the lather with a good badger hair brush.</li>
    <li> Great product, My skin does not irritate like it does with other products.</li>
    <li> A couple of years ago, I bought shave soap on Etsy and a shave brush and bowl for my brother-in-laws for Christmas and found out after that my husband was jealous/disappointed and would have liked the same.  So, that&#x27;s what he got the following Valentine&#x27;s Day.  While the shave soap from Etsy was good, we have tried others and this is my hubby&#x27;s favorite.  (It doesn&#x27;t matter which scent.)  Also, I only buy one per year -- as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  It lasts that long, even though I borrow it sometimes for my legs!!  That makes it very affordable.</li>
    <li> I use Edwin Jagger 99% natural bars and thought I would try something new to see what is out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated this bar 3 stars for the overall experience.  I love the ingredients and the scent as does my wife, but the lather isn&#x27;t always the greatest.  It ends up getting cold and thin a lot of times.  If the bar stays warm it is a better experience, but is still a little thin.  That said will I use the bar between other bars?  Yes.  Will I buy it again?  Yes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lady, and I use this just to shave my armpits, for the most part, and it is a great alternative to buying shaving cream in a can. I appreciate that it is cruelty free and environmentally friendly, as well as having (what I think is) a great smell. The lather could be a touch more lather-y, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I really want to like this soap, &amp; I continue to try to work it into my rotation with the same results: weak, insubstantial lather that doesn&#x27;t last. I like the scent (it pairs really nicely with clubman special reserve aftershave), but performance is seriously lacking. I&#x27;ve tried more water &amp; less water, it just doesn&#x27;t perform. This puck is about to be relegated to the shower...</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a gift for my boyfriends birthday. This product is awesome! It smells great, it lathers well, the overall appeal of the packaging and black hue of the soap presents a \\&quot;manly\\&quot; presentation, because lets face it, soap is the last thing a guy expects as a gift. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone and would definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> The smell of this bar is amazing.  Unfortunately for shaving, this soap does not hold a lather.  The overly airy lather dissipates too quickly and is virtually gone before you can finish shaving.  I&#x27;ve added my own oils to thicken the lather, but to no avail.  I am now using it as a shower bar, and can attest that the roughness of the bar is nice to wash with, but it wont last much longer.  If the recipe was changed, i would switch back to it in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with this product. New to using shaving soap so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent. Pleasant gender neutral fragrance. As for lathering capability, I think it is okay. Like I said I&#x27;m new to shaving soap so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s normal. It&#x27;s nowhere near shaving cream but it lathers enough for a decent shave.</li>
    <li> Love it!  works great, little irritation, smooth shave.  The charcoal smell takes a bit getting used to, but I still love it.</li>
    <li> I like this shaving soap a lot. The smell is ok it isnt very strong which is a good thing because it sort of smells a little different. The lather is pretty good too. It can really lather up with a good amount of water on your brush, however, the lather is not as rich as a shaving cream would be, it&#x27;s more like a light lather. I have pretty sensitive skin and I normally always have a lot of ingrown hairs, however, since i started using this shaving soap the number of ingrown hairs has reduces a lot and the irriation has also reduced. It still allows for a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> I would normally rate this a one-star.  I give the extra two stars, bringing it to three, on account of the ingredients in the soap.  It&#x27;s nice to see a company trying to make a healthy product.  So for that, kudos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this soap isn&#x27;t working for me, not nearly as well as others I&#x27;m using along side it.  Bear in mind, I have extremely hard water (still measurably hard in spite of using an over-sized GE softener), being in the California central valley region, so soaps are disadvantaged in my bathroom from the word go.  Regardless, initially, using a badger brush, this soap lathers promisingly.  But it falls short straight out of the cup.  More soap, less soap, more water, less water, lather on your hand, in a cup or on your face, it doesn&#x27;t matter.  Within 30 seconds of application, the airy lather has fallen and it becomes really difficult to get a close smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not having a lot of luck finding a good soap in the natural/organic market, I&#x27;m sorry to say I will most likely reduce my standards to paraben-free on my next buy, and hopefully find something that does the trick.</li>
    <li> I have used shave soap in the past that contains bentonite clay, which I have found soothes my skin and prevents irritation while shaving.  I was immediately interested in this soap when I noticed that it contains bentonite clay as well.  From previous experience, I was not at all surprised by the complaints regarding lather.  The soap creates an initial lather, but it &amp;#34;falls&amp;#34; fairly quickly.  That being said, this is a characteristic inherent to any soap that contains clay and is not specific to this brand.  To me, the properties of the clay outweigh the visual effect of not having a thick lather.  Overall, I have found it to be an excellent shaving soap.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the ingredient list and the performance (at first I thought it dry, it takes only a bit more time to get the lather I need). I&#x27;m appreciative of earth friendly packaging and business practices. I make my own shaving soaps now, but all I did was make my own version of this soap, it was definitely the standard for my recipes.</li>
    <li> Cool idea, but my blade does not glide down my face, rather, it rubs. I prefer something smoother, with glycerol in it. That being said, it still makes for one good bar of soap in the shower!</li>
    <li> Some may love this but I wasnt impressed. Just expected a more creamier, lasting soap.&lt;br /&gt;Low lather, oils didnt seem to be very effective.</li>
    <li> Scent isn&#x27;t bad but does not provide a very thick or cushioning lather.  I ended up using it as bath soap.</li>
    <li> Although the scent of this soap is good but it doesn&#x27;t do its job properly which is produce good lather. The lather is very poor and doesn&#x27;t last for some time, doesn&#x27;t provide good cushioning between the face and the blade. Still then the 3 stars are for the smell and the good feel after shaving.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smell is clean, light and earthy. Lather is decent but not spectacular. I&#x27;ve tried synthetic, boar and badger brushes with different amounts of water and I still can&#x27;t seem to whip up that luxurious lather I get from other soaps. I still think it&#x27;s a great soap and definitley recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about the scent of the soap as I usually go for unscented, fragrance-free shaving soaps. However, this soap has only a mild, all-natural scent that goes away very quickly when rinsing one&#x27;s face. The scent is also pleasant and not offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap builds a vigorous foam lather very quickly with a shaving brush, and the lather holds well through pass of shaving.</li>
    <li> Soap is good.  Smell is interesting.  Not crazy about it, but not bad. Soap is typical of &amp;#34;home made&amp;#34; like soaps.</li>
    <li> I got the sassafras version and the smell is magnificent. Exotic but not floral. Spicy but not musky. Refreshing but not minty. Strong and complex enough to wake you up but not lingering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the lather also does not linger. It&#x27;s easy enough to whip up a good volume of lather but as mentioned by others, is not a creamy and hearty lather. Instead it is light and dissipates quickly. It&#x27;s fine if you lather up in sections as you progress through the shave but plan for some extra time. It&#x27;s a little more work but I get a great shave with this soap. When I find myself with some extra time, I&#x27;ll indulge myself to the fantastic aroma and not focus on the number of times I have to lather up.</li>
    <li> This would be a 5-star review except for one thing: the strength of the lather. I am using a standard apothecary mug and have used various brushes (boar, horse, badger) and the lather takes a longer-than-average time to whip, and once applied it tends to dry up quickly. I have tried using more water, which makes the lather whip quicker and last longer, but then it&#x27;s not of the proper consistency. I find myself re-wetting and reapplying far too frequently for my own taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it may be a one-off experience and could be highly dependent upon other factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the soap is amazing. It&#x27;s quite powerful; you can smell it just by standing in close proximity when the puck is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I like the soap and might re-order it, but I&#x27;ll most likely only use it on weekends when I can take a long time for a relaxing shave. This is not a soap for those that need a quick morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: This soap just won&#x27;t lather. Downgraded to two stars. Scent is still powerful.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap does the job. It smells great and goes on well. The only limititation for me is the thickness of lather. I personally enjoy a lather that is a bit more dense. Otherwise a good product that I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Saves me from buying the messy shaving cream. This bar is very easy to use and very moisturizing.  I would recommend</li>
