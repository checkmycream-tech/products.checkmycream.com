      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I started with the starter kit and have to say as an African American male, this product has been great.  </li>
      <li>High recommend!</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t see any difference with this product.</li>

      <li>I complete the regime twice a day every day</li>
      <li>I have the skin  of a 35 year old .woman</li>
      <li>Buying this product on Amazon is GREAT because in the stores, it&#x27;s too expensive!</li>
      <li>I no longer have to wear foundation to cover the blotches (dark patches near my mouth and smile line) and blemishes on my face.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had time to use the product yet BUT wanted to make sure future buyers realize that these are extremely SMALL portions.  </li>
      <li>I am not sure if the product I receipt was authentic Murad products as I broke out in a red rash all over my face.  </li>
      <li>The dark patches are really lightening up, the vitamin C in the product line nurishes and softens.</li>
      <li>and I take half the time doing my foundation when I get ready.</li>

    <li> my wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> work good . I like it.</li>
    <li> The Murad line is exceptional! Hyperpigmention had taken over my face, along with dry skin. The dark patches are really lightening up, the vitamin C in the product line nurishes and softens. Buying this product on Amazon is GREAT because in the stores, it&#x27;s too expensive!</li>
    <li> They are small but this product is so potent that you don&#x27;t need a whole lot. My skin is amazing and I take half the time doing my foundation when I get ready. High recommend!</li>
    <li> Your product is great, but even though, you gave product measurements, the product vs. size was disappointing.  For the money, more product or a bonus product could be incl.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet.</li>
    <li> I love it, been using this product for 3 years. My skin is absolutely beautiful at 56 I have the skin  of a 35 year old .woman</li>
    <li> I am not sure if the product I receipt was authentic Murad products as I broke out in a red rash all over my face.  I have been a Murad customer for a while and never had that experience.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see any difference with this product. Maybe I need to try another one.</li>
    <li> Very small amounts that didn&#x27;t last long enough for me to really see a difference. Serum ran out after 3 uses.</li>
    <li> First use felt great but unfortunately after a week my skin became tight and looked dehydrated.  For a really oily individual this was a clear sign this product was too strong for me. Because of this I discontinue use.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and they loved it</li>
    <li> I ordered and just received the above Murad &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34;.  I haven&#x27;t had time to use the product yet BUT wanted to make sure future buyers realize that these are extremely SMALL portions.  In fact, it looks like a week supply at best.  I thought the price was really good and now I see why!  The picture is deceiving.  But I have heard good things about the results!</li>
    <li> In my opinion this is the best line of beauty products that you can buy. Ive been using murad for 5 years..  never had a complaint.</li>
    <li> Awesome kit.  We need it with today&#x27;s lack of the ozone layer.</li>
    <li> No difference noticed in my skin other than being more oily than normal and breaking out.</li>
    <li> Did you know age spots&#x27; appearance is reduced by Vitamin C?  I love this little tool kit.  I use Dermalogica for everything else (moved to it after using the Murad blue line for a while)... but in the mix I stumbled onto this.  My skin was radiant while using! While I need my acne treatments, I like to use this for age defying benefits every now and then.</li>
    <li> I have been getting facials from a place where they use only Murad products so I got a sample of the serum from there. I love the serum. I have been using it for a couple of months now and I see my skin looking smoother and more even in skin tone. It also feels wonderful on the skin. The moisturizer and cleanser are good but sometimes I feel a little sensation with them -perhaps it&#x27;s the vit c.</li>
    <li> I like the product....very much</li>
    <li> best kit I&#x27;ve used, seeing results in one month, smaller pores, brighter skin,&lt;br /&gt;good size and, good price. worth trying</li>
    <li> This product should be called &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34;! I no longer have to wear foundation to cover the blotches (dark patches near my mouth and smile line) and blemishes on my face. Now, many days all I wear is lip stick and eye-liner; wherein, in time past I would never go any where without foundation for over 25 years.</li>
    <li> I love this renewal kit! My skin appears liter &amp; dark spots appear to be going away ! I will continue to use and recommend to my friends</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff on and off for about a year now. When I use it daily I constantly get compliments on my skin. It was reccomended to me by an esthetician and I love this stuff ! :)</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Good cream for the face.  Kept it moist.</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction at a great price</li>
    <li> A co-worker recommend this product to me.  I was asking about a great product to use as a man that will help revitalize my skin and clear up some dark spots that were appearing on my face.  I started with the starter kit and have to say as an African American male, this product has been great.  I have used it for two weeks and I see great improvement in skin and the dark spots has lessen in appearance, they not disappeared, but I definitely see a change.  Additionally, my face and neck feel much better.  It constantly feel moisturized and fresh. I complete the regime twice a day every day and I love it.  I also use in addition to the skin toner correct with the product, in the evening I used an additional skin tone corrector.  But overall this product is great.  One additional comment, I would buy starter kits as opposed to buying each product individually.  Individually, all the products total $180, for me that is 5 starter kits, which equates to more product at a lower price.</li>
    <li> This product is great I wont use anything else</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very confused about the product, I ordered,  And I received today Peter Thomas Roth conditioner!???? I don&#x27;t want this hair product.. I didn&#x27;t order that!! I&#x27;m very disappointed with the purchase</li>
    <li> Great deal for the combo and price, order it for my mom. Nothing but good news</li>
