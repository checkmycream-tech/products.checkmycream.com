      <li>Overall very satisfied with the product, and I would purchase this again.</li>
      <li>I smell super fresh.</li>
      <li>The one thing I don&#x27;t like about Irish Spring soap is that it doesn&#x27;t work great in the very sensitive areas.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s worth a shot to me.</li>
      <li>They like the fresh fragrance</li>
      <li>I really liked Irish Spring and will use it from now on.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of the original Irish spring.</li>
      <li>\stuff right here.</li>
      <li>Unlike many a shower gel, there&#x27;s no feel of a soap film left on your skin with this soap.</li>
      <li>i start using after my first bath, i did really&lt;</li>
      <li>I love the scent of Irish Spring soap, regardless of authenticity to the original odor of the Irish springs.</li>
      <li>Unlike Dial, Irish Spring washes off easily without leaving a perceptible residue.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recall Irish Spring being this strongly scented.  </li>
      <li>this soap has a great smell and the bars seem to last awhile and keep lathering down to the smallest piece</li>
      <li>This is a very good price that I was unable to match elsewhere including the commissary.  </li>
      <li>If they discontinue a product I rely on week after week, I&#x27;ll try to find a reasonable replacement with a competitor.</li>
      <li>I really like the way this one smells....</li>
      <li>I really like that.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell of it</li>
      <li>The bars soap up my body without much effort.</li>
      <li>I like this regular flavor as opposed to the blue kind that they make</li>
      <li>and I can use it throughout the winter unlike most other soaps.</li>
      <li>In fact, you can adjust your usage accordingly: for important days, whether long or high stress, you can load up on it.  </li>
      <li>Most soap makers have done this (reduced the bar size) over the last several years</li>
      <li>I did not read the description very well on this and was surprised when I got as much soap as I did.  </li>
      <li>It get us clean and lasts a long time?</li>
      <li>They are more hand soap sized rather than the large bath sized bars that they were in the past.</li>
      <li>He says he&#x27;ll be clean for a long time now!  </li>
      <li>Avoid the aloe version (it melts too fast) and whatever other modifications they have made to try and &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; on the original.</li>
      <li>Rip-off on bar size but otherwise good soap.</li>
      <li>I go through these newer, smaller bars in about 2-3 weeks, while before a single bar lasted for more than a month.</li>
      <li>I use this soap to help discourage the deer from ruining some newly planted trees in my yard.</li>
      <li>Growing up, my parents only used Irish Spring (original scent) soap.</li>
      <li>This is a old standby.</li>
      <li>I put a bar in an old sock and tie them to the tree or stack them in the ground.  </li>
      <li>So far, my trees haven&#x27;t been touched again.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s kind of irritating.</li>
      <li>I have a protocol now that if my local grocer/drugist stops carrying or is out of stock on a dry good product that I can find online at the same price or less, I never buy that product again locally.</li>
      <li>On typical days, you can use it sparingly and still come home almost as fresh as the morning.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s soap, it&#x27;s green, it works-it fits in your hand.</li>
    <li> Irish spring is a great soap and this was a great deal but I am tired of the scent. But I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great for freshening up the house, laundry room, linen closets, shoe and clothes closets, bathrooms, living room and anywhere that the scent needs improving. It beats constantly buying plug-ins!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a add on, I buy it for my husband, I love the smell, fresh,fresh,fresh!!!!It&#x27;s the best!!!!</li>
    <li> This soap leaves you feeling clean and fresh.  The scent is nice but not overbearing and stays fresh through most of the day.  It does tend to dry my skin out somewhat especially with hard water but nothing a little lotion won&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> Received when promised</li>
    <li> Fantastic soap nice to feel fresh and the lime smell is awsome I will purchase more from Amazon if it comes in bulk packets to ship to Brisbane Australia in 20 pkts</li>
    <li> Good \stuff right here.</li>

    <li> I mean it&#x27;s soap.... What can you say about soap? It get us clean and lasts a long time? But doesn&#x27;t all soap? I really like the way this one smells....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap. Works like soap. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Irish Spring soap...it smells clean and works great!</li>
    <li> Powerful scent, lathers great, and rinses off very clean. Leaves my skin hydrated and smooth. This soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and I can use it throughout the winter unlike most other soaps. The one thing I don&#x27;t like about Irish Spring soap is that it doesn&#x27;t work great in the very sensitive areas. I reach for a different soap for my personal needs. Otherwise, I like to keep Irish Spring soap on hand.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. The smell is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;When i start using after my first bath, i did really&lt;br /&gt;like it. Seller is definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a old standby. I have been using this product since I was a kid and I still enjoy it. The lather is great, fragrance outstanding, and price, perfect.</li>
    <li> Irish spring is my favorite bar soap because it feels fairly unisex and i feel really clean after.  Gotta love the amazon.com bulk discount!</li>
    <li> This a great smelling, cheap soap.  The smell last for a few hours. Mind you, you probably can purchase this soap for the same price at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have been using it since it came out in the 80&#x27;s. Makes my man places smell like roses and I like that. Fresh balls are good balls!</li>
    <li> Good soap that I&#x27;ve used for years. Lots of compliments on smelling good. Bars keep getting smaller and they think we don&#x27;t notice. Rip-off on bar size but otherwise good soap.</li>
    <li> I use this soap to help discourage the deer from ruining some newly planted trees in my yard. I put a bar in an old sock and tie them to the tree or stack them in the ground.  I&#x27;ve heard mixed review on whether it works, but I like the smell and the price so it&#x27;s worth a shot to me. I did this after they destroyed one of the trees. So far, my trees haven&#x27;t been touched again.</li>
    <li> This is the old traditional Irish Spring soap. If you&#x27;ve always liked it, you&#x27;ll be pleased with these bars. My only complaint is that the bars are smaller than they used to be. They are more hand soap sized rather than the large bath sized bars that they were in the past. Most soap makers have done this (reduced the bar size) over the last several years and it&#x27;s kind of irritating.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap that I used so far that does not irritate</li>
    <li> This product is a good soap that is not overpowering for sensitive skin yet is effective enough to feel clean with a great scent.  My whole family uses this product and when I saw I could buy it in bulk for a great price I ordered it and appreciated having it delivered right to my door.  You get a very good product for a great price and since I always run out, its nice to know I have enough of this soap in the house at all times.</li>
    <li> $9.59/8 bars &#x3D; $1.20 on Amazon. I bought this for $3.97/8 bars &#x3D; 50cents on Walmart. Amazon also offers this for $3.97/8 bars, but only if you have Prime. They call it Prime Pantry. Obviously they could sell it for 50cents a piece LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE does, but nope, only if you have Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bar shrunk from 4oz to 3.75oz in addition to the price increase, and is it just me or is it softer? I go through these newer, smaller bars in about 2-3 weeks, while before a single bar lasted for more than a month. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re softer or because they&#x27;re smaller.</li>
    <li> It is what it says.  It came on the 8th day, which was the last day of the four-day ETA.  But it got here &amp;#34;on time.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this purchase, the hubby likes the scent. Overall very satisfied with the product, and I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE SOAP. I smell super fresh.</li>
    <li> This is a very good price that I was unable to match elsewhere including the commissary.  I&#x27;ve ordered these several times.</li>
    <li> It keeps me clean, and prevents me from smelling.  I like this regular flavor as opposed to the blue kind that they make; that one smells a bit different.  I wish they made an aerosol antipersperant / deodorant that smelled like this.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years and forgot why I started using it. The price has remained roughly the same but the size and volume of the bar has dropped by over 20% in the past 10 years, which I believe outstrips inflation by a whole bunch. I purchased from Amazon because Walmart was out of stock one day. I have a protocol now that if my local grocer/drugist stops carrying or is out of stock on a dry good product that I can find online at the same price or less, I never buy that product again locally. Same goes for the manufacturer. If they discontinue a product I rely on week after week, I&#x27;ll try to find a reasonable replacement with a competitor. As consumers, we can&#x27;t reward retailers and manufacturers for not stocking or discontinuing products we have come to rely on.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite soaps. I&#x27;ve always like it was glad i was able to purchase it Nice smell</li>
    <li> Leaves you smelling manley. Helps mask strong odors. Affordable, well trusted brand. A staple for men for decades. No need for colognes if you use this. Great for teenage boy odors.</li>
    <li> It is soap, it does the job.  Not overly scented, no residual\\&quot; film\\&quot; after a shower.  The problem here is not the product but rather the price.  This same 8-pack sells in retail stores for $4.  At $12, this is a ripoff.</li>
    <li> What can go wrong with a bar of soap?  As i said what can go wrong with a bar of soap?</li>
    <li> If there is a standard leader for deodorant soaps, then surely Irish Spring is it.  There&#x27;s no better source of that &#x27;just fresh&#x27; in the morning feeling than these bars.  In fact, you can adjust your usage accordingly: for important days, whether long or high stress, you can load up on it.  On typical days, you can use it sparingly and still come home almost as fresh as the morning.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the original Irish spring. The bars soap up my body without much effort. I feel clean. I smell awesome. And when I run out of shampoo I even use this for my hair. Squeeky clean at that! Out of all the soaps out there this is the only one we&#x27;ve bought for years and not about to change that now. No cons here. Just pros.</li>
    <li> its...irish spring....like...leprechauns kicked the smell off of my ass.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for many years.  This was a gift for my son and he was excited to have them delivered to his home today.  He says he&#x27;ll be clean for a long time now!  I personally enjoy this soap too.  I like the smell.  I think the price is great.</li>
    <li> Irish Spring makes me feel clean, smell clean and keeps my skin in perfect balance. For years I&#x27;ve been using this soap and for years I&#x27;ve felt good about this decision.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been to Ireland, so it eludes me how one can smell like an Irish spring, since springs are just water... Regardless, this soap is awesome. I love the scent of Irish Spring soap, regardless of authenticity to the original odor of the Irish springs. Smells good. Leaves me clean. Good job.</li>
    <li> Came on time. Product is as described. Very good price, good smell and good for daily use. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> this soap has a great smell and the bars seem to last awhile and keep lathering down to the smallest piece</li>
    <li> Best price around for Irish Spring.  Happy with this purchase. Sometimes you have to look outside the supermarket for items and quantities you need...that&#x27;s why we shop Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have always used this brand and have always been happy with it.I always feel clean and refreshed after shower.</li>
    <li> Smells really strong and can&#x27;t get the scent off.  Think it&#x27;s an inferior product.  I don&#x27;t recall Irish Spring being this strongly scented.  I have to scrub my hand for literally 1-2 min. with running water even with the slightest amount of product on my hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sons.  They like the fresh fragrance and it cleans well.  It is also budget friendly.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves the smell of Irish Spring. I hardly make it out of the shower without being attacked! Five stars!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Irish Spring for decades. We like them all. Unlike many a shower gel, there&#x27;s no feel of a soap film left on your skin with this soap.</li>
    <li> Growing up, my parents only used Irish Spring (original scent) soap. It&#x27;s scent is refreshing and clean. It works, and it lasts!</li>
    <li> The only soap bars I ever use! I love they way the smell and feel on my skin</li>
    <li> This is such a refreshing soap, and I love it. I will continue to buy this soap and encourage others to use it as well.</li>
