      <li>The color selection in this is nice but the bright shadows are very chalky and don&#x27;t have a great deal of pigmentation while the darker shades are like velvet and pop with life.</li>
      <li>But I needed to apply more shadow more than five times to get the color even!</li>

      <li>I found this mostly with the neon shades.</li>
      <li>This professional makeup is long-lasting (with primer) and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to purchase an eyeshadow palette from Sleek because I had heard so many good reviews about their eye products.</li>
      <li>I love the fun brought colors in this palette!</li>
      <li>The colors are pretty and all, but I have bought drug store makeup that is better quality!</li>
      <li>lots of eye looks with this eye Shadow&#x27;s thanks for every thing u guys done a nice job :-)</li>
      <li>The case is strong.</li>
      <li>Sleek has great products &amp; especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>The palettes are cheap and for what you pay</li>
      <li>The wine purple is fantastic.</li>
      <li>but I wish all of the eye shadow colors were as velvety and smooth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The really exciting color in the palette which is rarely talked about is the brilliant neon violet that is at the bottom left of the photo with this product.  </li>
      <li>They last and stay bright with no fading.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s a good feeling only thing is the brush that it came with</li>
      <li>Very pigmented with a smooth formula.  </li>
      <li>So much fun and</li>
      <li>but then again, I should have know trusty old Amazon was on top of things.  </li>
      <li>Those shades made it worth the purchase</li>
      <li>The colors are fun and like nothing I have in my collection.</li>
      <li>At most, I usually need to apply two layers of eye shadow to make my eyes look perfect with any other brand.</li>
      <li>The color are vibrant, rich &amp; creamy.  </li>
      <li>I have had various neon eye shadow over time, but this palette is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Will definitely order more for myself and Christmas gifts.</li>
      <li>The hues are deep and are lovely when blended.</li>
      <li>Bright, but talc-y and soft and not particularly pigmented.</li>
      <li>they are so beautiful and will need a base before appyling them to make the colors pop and stand out more!</li>
      <li>Very vibrant</li>
      <li>but it actually does wear all day just fine even without primer.</li>
      <li>The neons need a little bit of a heavier hand, but are nonetheless amazing.</li>
      <li>Also, is also very durable.</li>
      <li>pretty pigmented, those neon colors are actually really great for neon colors, put them on a white base and its amazing!</li>
      <li>Goes over BB cream and foundation very well.</li>
      <li>Blends well and is very customizable to every need.</li>
      <li>The quality of this shadow is similar to the cheap 88 palettes made in China.</li>
      <li>really nothing to complain about.</li>
      <li>Make sure to use a primer and white base for the best effect.</li>
      <li>The color is decent enought.</li>
      <li>The quality of the shadows is decent and if you use an eye primer they stay on well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very neon and vivid.</li>
      <li>The deeper shades are highly pigmented.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to have to keep spending near one hundred dollars on a whole pallette for the  one color</li>
      <li>It is not much to see in photos, but on the skin and on top of white-</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like that much because I don&#x27;t think it picks up enough eyeshadow when I put it on my eye lids but</li>
      <li>The colors are very intense and when applied with an eyelid primer or a white lid pencil</li>
      <li>love every color in this palette, the only extremely sheer one being the white</li>
      <li>I could see a whole section of my bare eyelid in the crease.</li>
      <li>cheap cheap poor quality!</li>
      <li>have sensitive eyes and this has never bothered me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I fixed it with some 91% alcohol, a paper towel and a penny and re-pressed it.</li>
      <li>shocked how good this is for a fun pop</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it to other people including close friends who are interested in buying the product as well</li>
      <li>The pigmentation is high and  the price is low.</li>
      <li>However, they are kind of difficult to blend.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This professional makeup is long-lasting (with primer) and beautiful.  The hues are deep and are lovely when blended. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to purchase an eyeshadow palette from Sleek because I had heard so many good reviews about their eye products. The color selection in this is nice but the bright shadows are very chalky and don&#x27;t have a great deal of pigmentation while the darker shades are like velvet and pop with life. Those shades made it worth the purchase but I wish all of the eye shadow colors were as velvety and smooth.</li>
    <li> Well, the colours are intense when applied thick. Also, is also very durable. Goes well with liquid or stick eyeliner, and any kind of mascara. Goes over BB cream and foundation very well.</li>
    <li> Love the bright pigments in the shadows of this palette. Very neon and vivid. Stays on fine with a primer or base as any other shadow does. Did not fade during the day.</li>
    <li> I sort of like this shadow palette, although I feel like there is not a lot of pigment and I have to use my more expensive primer to prep my eyes for this shadow.</li>
    <li> The colors are pretty and all, but I have bought drug store makeup that is better quality! At most, I usually need to apply two layers of eye shadow to make my eyes look perfect with any other brand. But I needed to apply more shadow more than five times to get the color even! The colors are patchy, don&#x27;t stay and just terrible all in all. I have been doing makeup for 5 years now so obviously I know what I&#x27;m doing. I have applied eye shadow primer and/or a base and this still doesn&#x27;t work. What a waste of money. I will definitely not buy from this brand again or recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Do not believe the bad reviews. Seriously. I am a big eyeshadow snob.I admit it. I spend tons on big brands like Mac and urban decay. I bought this whilst looking for a cheaper alternative to on  of my favorite urban decay colors that is very difficult to buy as a single an  I didn&#x27;t want to have to keep spending near one hundred dollars on a whole pallette for the  one color I&#x27;m after. I bought this sleek I divine on a whim and I am so happy I did. The colorway I purchased is vintage romance. It is AMAZING. I haven&#x27;t used my expensive stuff hardly at all since this purchase. The gold color is so awesome. The wine purple is fantastic. The three gradient ish pinkish insurgencies are insane. I do use a primer but there have been occasions when I forgot to prime and the  ONLY difference is with the primer it lasts longer but it actually does wear all day just fine even without primer. I can&#x27;t understand why anyone would say this makeup sucks. It does not suck. It rocks. Maybe they didn&#x27;t know what they were doing or something. I&#x27;m not a professional but I am a very serious amateur. I plan to buy another the same as The  one I have already and another different one too. I wish I could try them all. The pigmentation is high and  the price is low.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors. Good quality. The case is strong. Colors will pop with the use of a good eyeshadow primer. Nice.</li>
    <li> Bright colors! I love all the neon brightness! I would purchase this again! The price is very low but the product looks much more expensive!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, it was packed very nicely wasn&#x27;t broken, seller did a awesome job! Highly recommend it to other people including close friends who are interested in buying the product as well</li>
    <li> I have had various neon eye shadow over time, but this palette is my favorite. The quality of the shadows is decent and if you use an eye primer they stay on well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the real true neon pop to the color, however, using an eye primer along with a white base such as NYX eye pencil in milk, you will cross into a true high voltage neon look.  If you use a primer underneath the white pencil it stays on well all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive eyes and this has never bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The really exciting color in the palette which is rarely talked about is the brilliant neon violet that is at the bottom left of the photo with this product.  It is not much to see in photos, but on the skin and on top of white- it is one of the most gorgeous colors EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love every color in this palette, the only extremely sheer one being the white shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great if you love to wear neon clothing and want eyeshadow that can be worn with it.  I use this palette a lot and plan to get another when I use it almost all up.</li>
    <li> great colors and well pigmented however it seems these eyeshadows are very low quality, they feel very heavy and grainy and they barely stick even after using eyeshadow base and primer, the eyeshadows end up on my cheekbones as the night/ day goes on and super difficult to clean off</li>
    <li> Love the colors! Very vibrant and they stay on all day. Will definitely order more for myself and Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> What a huuuuuuuge disappointment, once again another waste of money on sucky makeup, I threw it out, I don&#x27;t recommend unless you plan to paint water colors with this crap.</li>
    <li> This palette has amazing color payoff. The deeper shades are highly pigmented. The neons need a little bit of a heavier hand, but are nonetheless amazing. For this price, you are getting a B.A.R.G.A.I.N.</li>
    <li> The colors are fun and like nothing I have in my collection. However, they are kind of difficult to blend. I have tried it with a primer, a base color, and every which way I can think of, but it does take some patience to make them work. The pigmentation make up for it though. They colors are just as bright as they look and are amazing on the lid.</li>
    <li> Well I thought the palette was going to be bigger when I saw the picture online but it still good I like it the colors are amazing and I feel like I couldn&#x27;t get something like this in America so that&#x27;s a good feeling only thing is the brush that it came with I don&#x27;t really like that much because I don&#x27;t think it picks up enough eyeshadow when I put it on my eye lids but really nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> Awesome shadow.  Great color.  Especially if you put a white cream base underneath.</li>
    <li> good muy buena paleta colores bien marcados....lo recomiendo  con los ojos cerrado !!&lt;br /&gt;son colores acidos y mates  los colores duran todo el dia gracias</li>
    <li> The colors are very intense and when applied with an eyelid primer or a white lid pencil (so the colors POP!). Long wearing! Wore this out to a concert and after sweating and dancing- color still looked amazing! Blends well.</li>
    <li> Had to have this in my collection! Love the bright colors! So much fun and the color pay off is awesome. Make sure to use a primer and white base for the best effect.</li>
    <li> The shadows are a bit powdery and can be blotchy. I found this mostly with the neon shades.The blues and silver are beautiful colors that really pop over a primer. The palettes are cheap and for what you pay I think it is a good purchase.</li>
    <li> The quality of this shadow is similar to the cheap 88 palettes made in China. Bright, but talc-y and soft and not particularly pigmented. Appropriate for the price but not a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller put three Sleek palettes into a media mailer with NO bubble wrap or padding, and one of the colors was shattered. I fixed it with some 91% alcohol, a paper towel and a penny and re-pressed it.</li>
    <li> Thought these were wonderful in the beginning when I did a color test. Not until I actually used them did I think they were just ok. They hold long enough. The color is decent enought.</li>
    <li> cheap cheap poor quality!</li>
    <li> Recieved my palette today march 17, was expected until april 3-16 but so happy i got them today! they are so beautiful and will need a base before appyling them to make the colors pop and stand out more! the packaging is nice and got here in one piece! i cant wait to try them on my clients as well. i recommend them .</li>
    <li> I love the fun brought colors in this palette! This palette is a great price for how many shadows you get. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> My favorite! It works great, stays on, beautiful bright colors!</li>
    <li> pretty pigmented, those neon colors are actually really great for neon colors, put them on a white base and its amazing! shocked how good this is for a fun pop</li>
    <li> Sleek has great products &amp; especially for the price.  The color are vibrant, rich &amp; creamy.  I have all their eyeshadow palettes.</li>
    <li> The colors are very bright, &amp; beautiful, just as advertised! The price is great for quality easy applying eyeshadow. The only reason I am unable to give this item 5 stars is because even though I used a primer, &amp; a very light coat of a chubby white eye pencil (so the colors were pronounced), the shadow creased rather badly near the end of the day. I could see a whole section of my bare eyelid in the crease. Other than that, this product would be perfect, because the colors are very beautiful, unique, &amp; show up quite well. You just may need to touch up, midday.</li>
    <li> Im highly upset my package was awfully packed 4 of. My eyeshadows was broken just terrible wish there was a no star rating</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been wanting to try Sleek for ages after seeing all the YouTubers hype it.  I was shocked to see it offered by Amazon but then again, I should have know trusty old Amazon was on top of things.  Anyway, this eyeshadow is suberb.  Very pigmented with a smooth formula.  I&#x27;ve got to try the other pallets now.</li>
    <li> The colors are very intense and pop when applied with an eyelid primer or a white base shadow. They last and stay bright with no fading. Wore this out in 90 degree heat and after sweating and shopping the color still looked amazing! Blends well and is very customizable to every need. The perfect beachy palette for summer or anytime you need a tropical look.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again when needed!</li>
    <li> Great colors, as bright as they look and I just love this pallet.</li>
    <li> Is really really good eye shadows there really pigmented so that&#x27;s good and I can do lots of eye looks with this eye Shadow&#x27;s thanks for every thing u guys done a nice job :-) I just love the neon colors that this pallet has there really bright</li>
