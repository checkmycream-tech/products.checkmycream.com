      <li>NOT IN original packaging.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way...a lot of suds, great smell, my face feels clean and my skin looks bright and the tone is more even.</li>
      <li>Glad I can buy them for a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Often the old pump bottles didn&#x27;t work, so the new squeeze bottle is a great improvement.</li>
      <li>Although it came in a new container(tube), it is still one of my favorite cleansers.</li>

      <li>one tube received only half of the size of the other tube, may need better package for shipping, did not use yet, hopefully they&#x27;re the one I needed, I think is still a good deal</li>
      <li>But a little goes a long way- less than a full pump works great to remove makeup and/or grime without stripping your skin.</li>
      <li>Leaves my face clean, non irritating, and oil free.  </li>
      <li>so I was surprised to received it</li>
      <li>leaves my face soft not dried out.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars, was because it dries my skin if I use it too frequently.</li>
      <li>Does not dry out my face.  </li>
      <li>cleanser does not dry the skin and yet appears to work well as a cleanser</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have purchase this product from Amazon a few times so I was surprised to received it NOT IN original packaging. I agree with  previous reviewer, Laura Johnson. This should have the ingredient, etc on the product. The box should not look tapered with.  My came in a plastic ziplock bag with a sticker on the bottle. The seller was Warehouse Deals 4 Less so BEWARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have returned it but I was in need of cleanser and took the gamble. I tested it out and confident it&#x27;s the same product.  I will purchase from another seller on Amazon. If it doesn&#x27;t come in original packaging i will return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I love this product...it works great with the clarisonic brush. You don&#x27;t need a lot of product and it goes a long way. I can make my 6 oz. bottle last up to 5-6 months and that&#x27;s using it 2-3 times a day. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. Definitely does the job and is an investment. Remember you only have 1 face, take care of it!</li>
    <li> cleanser does not dry the skin and yet appears to work well as a cleanser</li>
    <li> Great price on a great facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> The only cleanser that doesn&#x27;t make me breakout or dry out my skin &amp; cleans deep! Love it! Have used it for years!</li>
    <li> I like it. cleans my face really good. leaves my face soft not dried out. buying skin medica here is cheaper then in dr office.</li>
    <li> The product itself has always been excellent, but I&#x27;m so glad to see the new packaging.  Often the old pump bottles didn&#x27;t work, so the new squeeze bottle is a great improvement.</li>
    <li> Love it!  A little goes a long way...a lot of suds, great smell, my face feels clean and my skin looks bright and the tone is more even.</li>
    <li> I like this product, cleans my face and removes my eye make up without a problem.  Does not dry out my face.  Will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> All of Skinmedica is a great line for your skin care. I&#x27;ve used  it for years and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Leaves my face clean, non irritating, and oil free.  Good for oily or dry skin. No perfume, just a great cleanser. Skin medica makes excellent products. Glad I can buy them for a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> one tube received only half of the size of the other tube, may need better package for shipping, did not use yet, hopefully they&#x27;re the one I needed, I think is still a good deal</li>
    <li> Great cleanser for everyday use!!</li>
    <li> It works. It is good cleanser. But I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
    <li> This did not come in a box. The list of ingredients are listed on the box so I had no way of knowing what was in it or if this was a used/returned/legitimate product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not safe!</li>
    <li> I love the very light scent of this product, and the way it rinses away so easily.  It is now a regular part of my night regime.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser and would give 5 stars but for fact that it is a bit overpriced and is in a pump.  Was a die hard neutrogena fan for years but this cleanser is much more gentle for sensitive skin.  Downside is that it is in a pump so i won&#x27;t get every drop.  But a little goes a long way- less than a full pump works great to remove makeup and/or grime without stripping your skin.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted - works great!</li>
    <li> Although it came in a new container(tube), it is still one of my favorite cleansers. The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars, was because it dries my skin if I use it too frequently. So, I alternate with a lotion-type cleanser a couple times a week.</li>
    <li> Used it for years, great price!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years. It&#x27;s the only cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, while also not causing acne break-outs. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great price a must need if you dye your hair</li>
