      <li>Product is great, but this is tiny.  </li>

      <li>If you&#x27;re primarily going to use it as a foundation, you might need to add a concealer to assist with covering specific areas.  </li>

      <li>If you want a tinted moisturizer that&#x27;s more moisture and less tint, this is the product for you.  </li>

      <li>It feels soft on skin.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much coverage, but that is what I&#x27;m looking for -- just enough to even out the skintone.  </li>

<li> But as for me, it&#x27;s a bit too much money to spend for a small tube.</li>
<li> I am 63 years old, and  I felt the foundations were too heavy.</li>
<li> The travel size is quite small, so every-day use will require a larger size.</li>
<li> I will check out other Laura Mercier products.</li>
<li> I am blond and the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; often is too pale, and the medium too dark.</li>
<li> so I mix the nude with a darker color to give me a little tan look.</li>
<li> Gives just a little coverage that makes a difference.</li>
<li> so I use the nude, but I do like a little color in the summer</li>
<li> Expensive but a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Soooooo small.  </li>
<li> The one&#x27;s I have used in the past gave just a touch of coverage, which is what I was looking for.</li>
<li> I usually buy the travel size at Sephora and it lasts forever</li>
<li> The small size lasts for at least 2 weeks.</li>
<li> I ordered the wrong thing.  </li>
<li> A must for my makeup bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this had toxic parabens in it. I think it&#x27;s an old formula because the &amp;#34;skin deep&amp;#34; website that&#x27;s rates the toxicity of products didn&#x27;t list this ingredient . So if you like putting cancer causing chemicals on your face this is for you!</li>
    <li> Great to use instead of foundation, though not nearly as much coverage.  If you want a tinted moisturizer that&#x27;s more moisture and less tint, this is the product for you.  If you&#x27;re primarily going to use it as a foundation, you might need to add a concealer to assist with covering specific areas.  It doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy, and is easy to remove.  The travel size is quite small, so every-day use will require a larger size.</li>
    <li> Great coverage and color as expected.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer - a hint of color without seeming to be makeup, and just enough soothing moisture to make my face smooth.</li>
    <li> The picture is VERY misleading!! The tube is the size of your pointer finger! Such a rip off!</li>
    <li> This works very well, gives light coverage and looks very natural. It feels soft on skin. The shade is a nice not chalky light color (sand). I am blond and the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; often is too pale, and the medium too dark. Recommend...pricey...but it works.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong thing.  I wanted the lip moisturizer.  It was my fault now I can&#x27;t remember the name of the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Nice light coverage that is fast and easy. Great for when you want a little coverage but don&#x27;t want to go the full makeup route. Loved the adorable packaging...was wrapped like a cute little present!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for the perfect light coverage and this is it!  There isn&#x27;t much coverage, but that is what I&#x27;m looking for -- just enough to even out the skintone.  It applies beautifully with fingers or with a brush. It leaves my skin looking healthy and not cakey.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this deluxe sample size for less so I would know if I wanted to splurge on the full size product.  I&#x27;ve had this for about a month and there is still so much product remaining.  This should last me about 3 months with daily use!</li>
    <li> I have been using Laura Mercier products for more than 10 years. I like all of her products, but not her mascara. I started using the tinted moisturizer about 5 years ago rather than a foundation. I am 63 years old, and  I felt the foundations were too heavy. The tinted moisturizers add another layer of moisture and sunscreen with an SPF of 20. I am fair skinned so I use the nude, but I do like a little color in the summer so I mix the nude with a darker color to give me a little tan look.</li>
    <li> Light coverage but great for still looking natural.  Easy to carry and travel with in the small size.</li>
    <li> I love this so much, that I don&#x27;&#x27;t even bother with foundation.</li>
    <li> Glad I was able to try this small size.  I have been reading tons of reviews for tinted moisturizers and was happy to find this small size that I could try out. This brand had gotten very good reviews.  Although I like the feel of this product, it gives zero coverage.  The one&#x27;s I have used in the past gave just a touch of coverage, which is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of this size Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer so I could blend 2 colors together: sand and nude. Easy to travel with and the cost per ounce is comparable to the larger size  of theses moisturizers.  I think buying these in the smaller size provides a fresher product than the larger sizes over time for about the same cost.</li>
    <li> good look. Gives just a little coverage that makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair and this is very nice</li>
    <li> Like but a little high priced.</li>
    <li> Soooooo small.  Product is great, but this is tiny.  I usually buy the travel size at Sephora and it lasts forever ( i am a light user of foundation product) but this was pricey for the quantity - check out sephora.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Goes on smoothly.  Would love product with SPF that had slightly better coverage.  I will check out other Laura Mercier products.</li>
    <li> Use it every day. Quit e often without adding foundation. A must for my makeup bad</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but not great coverage. Perfect for when you&#x27;re on the go or in a major hurry</li>
    <li> I just wanted to try out this moisturizer since I heard so much about it. It definitely serve its purpose. But as for me, it&#x27;s a bit too much money to spend for a small tube.</li>
    <li> Light weight, good coverage, really nice.  The small size lasts for at least 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Favorite tinted moisturizer of all time! A staple in my light makeup routine. Leaves my skin so flawless and Actually Improves my skin. Buildable coverage. Expensive but a little goes a long way.</li>
