### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Came in no time, works great!</li>
      <li>The power supply seems to be about the best thing in this kit.</li>
      <li>The foot petal itself isnt the greatest of quality.</li>
      <li>and it all works perfectly</li>
      <li>Alright, this started off as a great kit.</li>
      <li>The package arrived in a speedy manner which is good and the packaging was in good shape and in a sealed box which I always like to see.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s fair kit otherwise.</li>
      <li>To be fair</li>
      <li>Awesome definitely worth 21 bucks and shipping</li>
      <li>My boyfriend loves his and has used it many times already!</li>
      <li>Mainly because this was the best option I found on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I bought two six ounce bottles of GOOD ink for 14 bucks, they&#x27;re worth the invest if you hope the tattoos you&#x27;re giving are any good.</li>
      <li>The customer service was great, and now, I think this is worth the buy.</li>
      <li>so if i were you i would just buy a better ink set please do not rely souly on the ink in the package because it fades very easily as if nothing was done there</li>
      <li>It worked great- for the first week.</li>
      <li>But over all an okay gun.</li>
      <li>I look forward for more business with amazon</li>
      <li>There is so much to say about this tattoo kit, most of which isn&#x27;t good.</li>
      <li>this kit confirmed his desire to be tattoo artist.</li>
      <li>BUT IF YOU ARE HOPING TO DO FULL LENGTH TATTOOS...</li>
      <li>I love it than you so much</li>
      <li>I find my self having to fight the brass adjustment screw on top of the tattoo gun as much as I am spending time on the tattoo.</li>
      <li>Overall, I think the machine was good, but the power supply/inks could use some help.</li>
      <li>This one is soooooooo much better than the last one I had just be sure to throw the ink away its not made in USA but other then than great kit works with no problems.</li>
      <li>It is okay for a beginner I suppose and a decent gun/kit for the price.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with this kit until earlier today when the power supply popped and started smoking.</li>
      <li>but I guess you get what you pay for, right?   </li>
      <li>was very fast</li>
      <li>Sure, but only if you want to try for a day or two to confirm your want to be a tattoo artist.  </li>
      <li>But I put that aside, I could always order higher quality when I wanted to.</li>
      <li>it was a higher quality box😋</li>
      <li>: First, don&#x27;t use the inks.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure most of these parts are unnecessary, or extra, and I have no idea what to do with all these damn rubber bands.</li>
      <li>Decent gun,</li>
      <li>I have a talent in drawing and am planning on getting an actual tattoo education soon, but I wanted to make sure I actually want to be a tattoo artist.</li>
      <li>As I am a newbie there is a lot of things I don&#x27;t know yet and after further experimenting and research I have found by using the provided rubber bands on the needle as a support and on the contact screw makes a positive difference.</li>
      <li>It was fast and proper thsnks ..</li>
      <li>within seconds after putting pressure on the peddle wants to back out.</li>
      <li>I had no idea how to set the machine up, but wikihow fixed me up.</li>
      <li>The peddle seems decent, the ink in my opinion doesn&#x27;t want to absorb into the skin properly.</li>
      <li>: they shipped a new power supply on Monday, and I got it on Wednesday OF THE SAME WEEK.</li>
      <li>They are shipping me a new power supply next Monday.</li>
      <li>I generally recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems</li>
      <li>yes this is a complete set for beginners if your thinking of starting your tattoo hobby or beginning of career</li>
      <li>I have no desire to become a professional tattoo artist, however I am a college student with a talent for drawing and a knack for getting into trouble, so I bought this gun for fun and to make some extra money.</li>
      <li>The needles that came with it dull quickly and don&#x27;t hold ink well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My boyfriend loves his and has used it many times already! He did use the colored ink on me we put blue in the anchor I have on my hip. It got infected! We think it&#x27;s cause of the ink but it could have just been my skin not wanting it. We haven&#x27;t tried it on anybody else yet but thought I&#x27;d let you know.</li>
    <li> There is so much to say about this tattoo kit, most of which isn&#x27;t good. The package arrived in a speedy manner which is good and the packaging was in good shape and in a sealed box which I always like to see. The needles that came with it dull quickly and don&#x27;t hold ink well. The power supply seems to be about the best thing in this kit. The gun once I figured out how to put it together and all that, I will say it works but not well. I find my self having to fight the brass adjustment screw on top of the tattoo gun as much as I am spending time on the tattoo. Not a good thing. The adjustment screw should probably stay where you put it but within seconds after putting pressure on the peddle wants to back out. It just will not stay where it should be. It is okay for a beginner I suppose and a decent gun/kit for the price. The peddle seems decent, the ink in my opinion doesn&#x27;t want to absorb into the skin properly. Update: To be fair I feel I should correct some of my earlier statements. As I am a newbie there is a lot of things I don&#x27;t know yet and after further experimenting and research I have found by using the provided rubber bands on the needle as a support and on the contact screw makes a positive difference.</li>
    <li> I have no desire to become a professional tattoo artist, however I am a college student with a talent for drawing and a knack for getting into trouble, so I bought this gun for fun and to make some extra money. I did not expect this to be a professional gun and had little hopes for it. That being said I DID rate it 4 stars. Mainly because this was the best option I found on Amazon. I generally recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems: First, don&#x27;t use the inks. I bought two six ounce bottles of GOOD ink for 14 bucks, they&#x27;re worth the invest if you hope the tattoos you&#x27;re giving are any good. Second, there are no instructions as to how you should go about setting up the gun. I&#x27;m pretty sure most of these parts are unnecessary, or extra, and I have no idea what to do with all these damn rubber bands. I suppose I&#x27;ll figure it out when the thing starts falling apart. There&#x27;s also no return address, which I find particularly shady. And there are only 5 needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all the issues, it came within three days of me ordering it, and I&#x27;m still waiting on the ink. If anyone knows how to put this thing together, please contact me.</li>
    <li> I give this a 4 because everything was inside the package as shown in the picture and it all works perfectly and it even came sooner than expected now yes this is a complete set for beginners if your thinking of starting your tattoo hobby or beginning of career but there is a problem with the ink its fades away so if i were you i would just buy a better ink set please do not rely souly on the ink in the package because it fades very easily as if nothing was done there</li>
    <li> This one is soooooooo much better than the last one I had just be sure to throw the ink away its not made in USA but other then than great kit works with no problems.</li>
    <li> Decent gun, when it arrived it had several scratches to both the gun and foot petal. The foot petal itself isnt the greatest of quality. But over all an okay gun.</li>
    <li> It was ok just some wrong items</li>
    <li> Awesome definitely worth 21 bucks and shipping was very fast</li>
    <li> I love it than you so much</li>
    <li> It works ink is awful but it&#x27;s fair kit otherwise.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy. Pass on it. Out of the box the power cord was broke and a barrel was not completely drilled out so needle wouldn&#x27;t go through it. Could have been great for the price but things like that make it almost worthless.. Pass on it and buy something a little nicer.</li>
    <li> It was fast and proper thsnks .. I look forward for more business with amazon</li>
    <li> only things I didnt like is how it didnt come with instructions to set it up and how tiny the ink were.</li>
    <li> this kit confirmed his desire to be tattoo artist. thanks</li>
    <li> Alright, this started off as a great kit. I have a talent in drawing and am planning on getting an actual tattoo education soon, but I wanted to make sure I actually want to be a tattoo artist. I had no idea how to set the machine up, but wikihow fixed me up. It worked great- for the first week. The ink sucked, it wouldn&#x27;t stay in the practice skin I ordered. But I put that aside, I could always order higher quality when I wanted to. I was very pleased with this kit until earlier today when the power supply popped and started smoking. I am half way through a tattoo on the fake skin. Plus, the foot petal actually burned my foot.  Overall, I think the machine was good, but the power supply/inks could use some help. And 5 needles is not enough. Would I recommend this? Sure, but only if you want to try for a day or two to confirm your want to be a tattoo artist.  DO NOT BUT IF YOU ARE HOPING TO DO FULL LENGTH TATTOOS...ONLY FOR PRACTICE😁 but I guess you get what you pay for, right?   UPDATE: I contacted the seller about a refund or replacement. They are shipping me a new power supply next Monday. The customer service was great, and now, I think this is worth the buy. UPDATE AGAIN: they shipped a new power supply on Monday, and I got it on Wednesday OF THE SAME WEEK. Plus- it was a higher quality box😋 thank you</li>
    <li> Came in no time, works great! it you don&#x27;t know if tattooing is for you this starter kit will help with the decision.</li>
