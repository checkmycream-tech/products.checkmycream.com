      <li>I used to make my own natural lip balm, before I had kids and no longer have free time.</li>
      <li>I even have special docs from La Jolla who treat me.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wearing this on my first post-divorce date on Friday!</li>
      <li>I have had lip balm made from natural ingredients that have had a grainy feel to them, but this one is very smooth.</li>
      <li>When you apply it it feels very smooth and soft, not at all waxy.  </li>
      <li>This is so rare in a personal care product - it&#x27;s so nice to know exactly what I&#x27;m using on my and my family&#x27;s body!</li>
      <li>I put this product on two hours ago and my lips feel like it was freshly applied.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed using the all natural ingredients until I received my Organic vanilla lip balm at a discounted price to review for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
      <li>The scent is not overpowering either - it&#x27;s just the right balance.  </li>
      <li>and this came right in the nick of time.</li>
      <li>This one is just right.</li>
      <li>I love that this product is natural and keeps my lips so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Honestly it feels weird raving so much about a lip balm of all things, but it&#x27;s just so nice!  </li>
      <li>We go through a LOT of lip balm in our house, especially during these harsh winter months, so I was really excited to be able to purchase this at a discount in order to provide an honest review.  </li>
      <li>One problem is it does feel a bit grainy when I first put it on.  </li>
      <li>I do have a very sore mouth right now, though, so that might be the reason why it feels this way.</li>
      <li>I am a frequent lip balm user as winter is in full swing here in Indiana</li>
      <li>They were no greasy and you couldn&#x27;t tell I had put anything on them, they were just super soft.  </li>
      <li>This product will make your lips very moist.</li>
      <li>I was refunded my money and allowed to keep the product, which I greatly appreciated.</li>
      <li>It does that very well.</li>
      <li>My lips feel very hydrated.  </li>
      <li>This is the first lip balm I have found that contains all natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>It is so smooth and stays on for so long!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Even after a little time my lips felt so smooth and that was just after my first application.</li>
      <li>I first felt it with my fingers to see how smooth and firm it is.</li>
      <li>The next big plus for me is that it is never tested on animals and is earth friendly &amp; recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also love that it&#x27;s organic and has real ingredients - seriously read the ingredient list and you won&#x27;t find any chemicals, wax fillers, or undefined \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>These lip balm go on smooth and last a long time.  </li>
      <li>really like the fact that these are completely organic using only natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>All natural and organic ingredients: Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Beeswax, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Vanilla Flavor, Vitamin E, Organic Rosemary Extract, Organic Calendula Extract.</li>
      <li>I am chemical sensitive...</li>
      <li>I have always used either eos or burts bees products for myself and my 3 kids because I like the natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>so I was looking for something natural and stumbled upon this product.</li>
      <li>you will have soft lips before you know it.</li>
      <li>I live in TN and it is 10 degrees outside</li>
      <li>, their lips are majorly in need of some TLC.  </li>
      <li>You put it on and 5 minutes later your lips are moist and soft.  </li>
      <li>Apparently, Yeouth had a lip balm with Aloe in it, which is what I was looking for, but they no longer do.</li>
      <li>The first thing of course you notice with any lip balm is the scent - I love that it smells like real, natural vanilla, not some artificial imitation.  </li>
      <li>I received my Organic Vanilla Lip Balm very quickly, which was great due to this winter weather is horrible on my skin and especially my lips.</li>
      <li>I received this fast in 2 days and packaged tightly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the lip balm, like really love it!  It is so smooth and stays on for so long!  has a nice light scent but no taste.</li>
    <li> These lip balm go on smooth and last a long time.  My lips have been so dry due to some medication I have been taking.  This product takes care of this problem.  They make my lips feel so smooth.  I gave one to my daughter and she loves them, too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I am so sick of pricey little lip balms leaving my lips dried out and worse than before I used it. Talking to you Burt&#x27;s Bees and Blistex. I will make sure I always have this and share it with my daughters and my favorite friends.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s that time of year again!  The season of chapped, cracked and even bleeding lips.  Every winter I go through many tubes of lip balm.  I have always used either eos or burts bees products for myself and my 3 kids because I like the natural ingredients. When I was offered a discount to try out this all natural lip balm I was very excited and happy to share my experience.  I am a big fan of Yeouth products and this lip balm does not disappoint.  Yeouth Organic Vanilla Lip Balm has a wonderful vanilla(my personal favorite) scent.  When you apply it it feels very smooth and soft, not at all waxy.  My lips feel very hydrated.  My kids also like the feel of it on their lips. It does not have a flavor that I noticed.  I also love that we are a family of five so there is one for each of us.  I labeled them each with a name so we do not share and spread germs. If I could give this product 10 stars I would. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product will make your lips very moist. It has very little smell and taste. I get distracted while working or trying to sleep if my lip balm is too sweet or has a strong smell. This one is just right. Perfect. I highly recommend it for someone who is looking for only moisturizing and little else. It does that very well.</li>
    <li> Very nice lip balm, goes on very smooth and keeps lips moisturized for hours. I have very dry lips in the winter and this product works very good! When you put it on it tastes like a dessert! A mix betwween vanilla and white chocolate!</li>
    <li> It seems to be pretty good, and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.  One problem is it does feel a bit grainy when I first put it on.  I do have a very sore mouth right now, though, so that might be the reason why it feels this way.</li>
    <li> Lips feel smooth when put on.</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than this is an average lip balm that I don&#x27;t plan on purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is natural and keeps my lips so smooth and soft. I recently developed a reaction to a lot of other lip products so I was looking for something natural and stumbled upon this product. Something with Vitamin E was really important to me!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:13a9f353927377d9aa3df4444fbb0c5a]] We go through a LOT of lip balm in our house, especially during these harsh winter months, so I was really excited to be able to purchase this at a discount in order to provide an honest review.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands and flavors over the years and I can say without a doubt that this Yeouth organic vanilla lip balm is up there at the very top of ones I&#x27;ve used.  Too often lip balms are overly hard or feel waxy going onto my lips, but that couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth with this product.  The first thing of course you notice with any lip balm is the scent - I love that it smells like real, natural vanilla, not some artificial imitation.  The scent is not overpowering either - it&#x27;s just the right balance.  This lip balm glides on amazingly smooth, feeling almost buttery as it spreads a thin layer on my lips.  Honestly it feels weird raving so much about a lip balm of all things, but it&#x27;s just so nice!  It does a wonderful job of soothing and moisturizing for me, my husband, and my kids - it&#x27;s great that my kids love it so much because they can be picky about these things and with a couple weeks of single digit temps, their lips are majorly in need of some TLC.  I also love that it&#x27;s organic and has real ingredients - seriously read the ingredient list and you won&#x27;t find any chemicals, wax fillers, or undefined \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;.  This is so rare in a personal care product - it&#x27;s so nice to know exactly what I&#x27;m using on my and my family&#x27;s body!</li>
    <li> Everyone loves Lip Balm especially a good tasting and smelling one! I received this fast in 2 days and packaged tightly. I received 5 tubes which meant I could share with both of my daughters. I live in TN and it is 10 degrees outside and I have parched lips from licking and this came right in the nick of time. My lips are so much smoother, Yeouth is not greasy and I love that it is organic and nontoxic also very important to me that any beauty products I buy are not tested on animals. Yeouth has coconut oil and here recently I have heard great things about coconut oil when used on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have problems with fever blisters and have read that Omega 6 which is in this Yeouth Lip Balm fights to prevent fever blisters. My daughters love their Lip balm and have called to see where I got it from. I would definitely recommend trying this for your winter lips you will have soft lips before you know it. I received this at a discount for a honest review.</li>
    <li> I used to make my own natural lip balm, before I had kids and no longer have free time. I didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed using the all natural ingredients until I received my Organic vanilla lip balm at a discounted price to review for my honest and unbiased opinion. As soon as I took the lid off I could smell the beeswax, and it brought back memories of my lip balm making days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lip balm is goes on extremely smooth. I have had lip balm made from natural ingredients that have had a grainy feel to them, but this one is very smooth. I first felt it with my fingers to see how smooth and firm it is. I think it is the perfect ratio of solid oils to liquid oils. It is firm enough that it didn&#x27;t melt from carrying it around in the pocket of my jeans all day, which to me, is the ultimate test of a lip balm. I will still have to try it out in warmer summer weather, but I think it will pass the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the ingredients are organic. The skin on your lips is very thin, and absorbs anything you put on it. With all organic materials, I don&#x27;t have to worry about exposing myself or my family to unnecessary chemicals. I feel so confident about the ingredients in this lip balm that I have given both of my young daughters their own tubes to use.</li>
    <li> Received the 5 pack of these in a ziploc pouch.  Each was individually sealed after removing from the pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that these are completely organic using only natural ingredients.  The next big plus for me is that it is never tested on animals and is earth friendly &amp; recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the lip balm is very smooth and just glides on without clumping nor does it feel greasy.  Since using this the past few days, I&#x27;ve noticed I have quick licking my lips as often during these cold, windy, dry days of winter.  The moisture absorbs into my lips and makes them stay feeling refreshed.  The smell and taste of vanilla is always great in my opinion.  One good thing is that even as applying the balm the vanilla isn&#x27;t overpowering nor blocks out the smell of my perfume.</li>
    <li> I am chemical sensitive...I mean the real things folks.  I even have special docs from La Jolla who treat me.  For years my lips have peeled every morning until they bled....so sick of it and so desperate to find something that would help.  This stuff is incredible.  You put it on and 5 minutes later your lips are moist and soft.  I put it on before I go to bed and then put it on while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth.  I apply it up over the lip line and then after brushing and flossing, I wipe it off and apply my lip liner and lipstick.  Voila!  Gorgeous lips!  I have searched for years for something with these ingredients and that was pure...no chemicals.  It really glides on beautifully and for once in my life does not leave my lips in worse condition than when I started.  I think I have tried 20 different kinds at least...Get it...Use it and keep using it!  Lovely stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the first lip balm I have found that contains all natural ingredients.  It glides on easily and you immediately feel that your lips are moisturized.  Regular chapstick creates a barrier to prevent moisture loss while this product moisturizes from within.  It has a light vanilla scent and taste, nothing too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular chapstick is made from petroleum jelly; the base of Yeouth is beeswax and natural oils.  I put this product on two hours ago and my lips feel like it was freshly applied.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out or become tacky feeling like other brands.  I am a frequent lip balm user as winter is in full swing here in Indiana so I was glad I was given the opportunity to purchase this at a reduced price to test for quality.  This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I received my Organic Vanilla Lip Balm very quickly, which was great due to this winter weather is horrible on my skin and especially my lips. The package contain 5 tubes of the lip balm, which was great! I was enthusiastic about trying this being that it was organic and I had never used an organic lip balm before.&lt;br /&gt;I had just went to the department store a couple days before I received it and just from going to the car into the store, then from the store back to my car, my lips were burning horrible. It was around 20 degrees and the wind was blowing and blowing. This is something that happens on a regular basis with my lips, And in the summer I have the same problems with being outside in the heat. I will usually get fever blisters from it, if I don&#x27;t put something on it immediately or be proactive and keep them moist like I need to do.&lt;br /&gt;I received my balm and took one out of the package immediately put some on. It had a nice fragrance(light) and went on so smooth. Even after a little time my lips felt so smooth and that was just after my first application. I have continued to use on a daily basis and plan on continuing. to do so. My lips just feel so smooth all the time even if it has been awhile since I put it on. My husband even said something about my lips after I gave him a kiss when he got home from work. They were no greasy and you couldn&#x27;t tell I had put anything on them, they were just super soft.  I received this product from a promotion and at a great price. I am providing my experience with this product. This is based solely on my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Nice aroma. Little too creamy texture for me. Good customer service. The issue I have is not that this is a bad product; rather the product description is misleading, as the Vanilla and the Pink Shimmer described as are the same. Apparently, Yeouth had a lip balm with Aloe in it, which is what I was looking for, but they no longer do. And there is no picture that shows the ingredients as listed on the tube (this should be corrected). Even the video in the reviews is unfocused when it shows the ingredients. I was refunded my money and allowed to keep the product, which I greatly appreciated. The ingredients for the Vanilla are: Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Beeswax, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Vanilla Flavor, Vitamin E, Organic Rosemary Extract, Organic Calendula</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of lip balm over time and I can say this is my favorite. Yeouth lip balm is organic, It has sunflower oil, organic beeswax, coconut oil ,organic vanilla flavor,vitamin E, organic rosemary extract, organic .calendula and usda organic. It goes on smooth and stays on and a light tasting vanilla flavor and scent and does not gather in corner of your mouth which I hate. I received this gift for my unbias and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Who knew that doing something organic for my lips could feel so good? All natural and organic ingredients: Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Beeswax, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Vanilla Flavor, Vitamin E, Organic Rosemary Extract, Organic Calendula Extract. The moisture and vitamins sink into my skin. There&#x27;re no Preservatives, no petroleum or GMO oils, and no synthetic ingredients or flavorings. My lips look and feel oh-so radiant, because I went all-vanilla! I&#x27;m kissably smooth with a hint of vanilla. The gloss has no taste. So, what are my plans? I&#x27;m wearing this on my first post-divorce date on Friday! Woot-woot!</li>
