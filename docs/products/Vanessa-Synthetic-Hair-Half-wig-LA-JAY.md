      <li>I&#x27;m ordering another one for safe keeping.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>Out of the package and playing around with it, I think I enjoyed it all of 30 minutes.</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>love this hair wig.  </li>
      <li>I really love it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS WIG WHEN I HAD IT BEFORE</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ran across this wig.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this wig.....</li>
      <li>and i got so many compliments</li>
      <li>:) I need another one.</li>
      <li>I cant wait to wear my wig out for the first time!!!</li>
      <li>I was very excited about this wig because of the rave reviews it got on youtube.</li>
      <li>good for a hot summer day.</li>
      <li>and it is blond and very cool.  </li>
      <li>It does shed and is easily tangled</li>
      <li>Now a lot of people were able to wear this as a full wig, but once I got it and put it on my head, that was not the case.</li>
      <li>I love this wig so much i&#x27;m going to get a second one :D</li>
      <li>The model does not do it justice, look up some Youtube vids and see the many styles you can get out of this one wig, and protect your own natural hair.  </li>
      <li>and I wanted a wig I could wear that looked like my own hair while still looking real.</li>
      <li>This is such a great wig.</li>
      <li>It honestly just comes across as a real African-American hair period</li>
      <li>I take about 1 inch of hair around the circumference of my head, secure the wig and then finger comb around the edges until my hair is incorporated.  </li>
      <li>A few snips here and there for shape and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>The packaging looked like it was in good condition, the wig itself was old and already fallen, curl patterns had already disappeared for some strands.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a good quality wig for exceptional value and price, it maintains a fresh look for a longer then expected life span of a synthetic wig.</li>
      <li>Many have said you have to LOVE big hair to love LaJay.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s fun too!</li>
      <li>There is the option to comb it out to make it more full, but I left it as is because it looked good right out of the package, and it didn&#x27;t need any alterations/customizing.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love the naturalness of this wig and for a synthetic half wig of this caliber, it&#x27;s the best, and closest, you&#x27;ll ever get to a natural looking 3c-4c (combed out) hair style.  </li>
      <li>The seller was fantastic; shipped right away.  </li>
      <li>This is my first very curly wig and I love it.  </li>
      <li>But, I like the fact that it is soft, you can cut it to suit your style and, with just a little effort, you can blend your edges with the wig for a flawless seam.  </li>
      <li>This is the most natural looking wig that I have.</li>
      <li>This is one of the more versicle synthetic wigs that you&#x27;ll ever see on the market and for such a cheap price</li>
      <li>Looks natural on me :-).</li>
      <li>I just wear a colorful scarf with it.</li>
      <li>Just didn&#x27;t look right on me</li>
      <li>It just did not look right on me, so I put it away and continued wearing my Drew by Beshe.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, soft and can be worn as a full wig.</li>
      <li>And as it ages it looks more natural and realistic !</li>
      <li>Looks so natural, easy to maintain</li>
      <li>This is really big hair!!! :-)</li>
      <li>I am starting to love the wig.</li>
      <li>so your supplier sells you a bunch of defective wigs, you sell them to your customers, how about sending them back and demanding they send you better units????</li>
      <li>I plan on getting more in different shades.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really love the la-jay.just like my own hair.</li>
    <li> This wig is super big. Fuller than what I was used to see in the pictures or in the videos. I really really love it. It&#x27;s light, soft and can be worn as a full wig. Don&#x27;t be shy if you wear La Jay cause people will definitely look at you.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this wig because of the rave reviews it got on youtube. When I received mine I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED the wig looked like someone had taken a paddle brush and combed the unit, while other parts were still in a very curly texture. I contacted Tress Sisters and they told me they had been getting the same review from other customers, so if I sent it back they can&#x27;t guarantee me getting one that did not look used and maybe the manufacture changed the way they made the wigs...WTF so your supplier sells you a bunch of defective wigs, you sell them to your customers, how about sending them back and demanding they send you better units???? some customer service</li>
    <li> Unfortunately did not like, its sitting in the back of my closet. Sent email to company but have not received word back.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the naturalness of this wig and for a synthetic half wig of this caliber, it&#x27;s the best, and closest, you&#x27;ll ever get to a natural looking 3c-4c (combed out) hair style.  It has a lot of volume, extremely dense and because of it&#x27;s length, if it&#x27;s too long for you, it can be adjusted with a simple at home cut or by taking it to a professional to have it trimmed to size.  This is one of the more versicle synthetic wigs that you&#x27;ll ever see on the market and for such a cheap price and it&#x27;s definitely well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets better over time and even when I actually fell asleep in it, the soft curls popped back up to life with a simple finger puff of the tips. It&#x27;s extremely LOW maintenance, unless you&#x27;re accident prone or a pyromaniac, and if you think you mess up by cutting off too much, you can easily braid up your hair and put the wig on sideways for a side-puff, just trim it to how you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You honestly can&#x27;t go wrong with this wig, unless you&#x27;re limited by your imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this product, not only to natural kinky-coily people but to those willing to get a bit eccentric for the Summer as well.</li>
    <li> I was scared to buy this half wig online... but when i got it... put it on... omg i fell in love... from now on i wont have to go to a store amazon is the place for me. when it come to gettin fly this is the wig for me.</li>
    <li> I love this wig. Word of caution, the hair gets bigger as you wear it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend forking it out all the way out the box because it will loosen and grow with wear.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product from a YouTube video. I bought it just thinking it would be a regular &#x27;ole half wig. It came in just a few days and when it arrived I was extremely pleased. I have a small face so I took it to a friend to be cut and shaped. The best thing about this half-wig, it get better with time. I&#x27;ve worn it everyday for the past month and a half and I still get compliments. It blends so well with my natural hair. I&#x27;m even fooling black people... I love it!</li>
    <li> Got this in a 1B. I really love it. Great curl pattern, soft and fluffy with bounce and not too silky-shiny. I get compliments everywhere I go. Looks natural on me :-).</li>
    <li> This blended with my own hair so well I had my own family fooled!!!! It does shed and is easily tangled but I still give it 5 stars because so does my own hair...LOL!!!  The model does not do it justice, look up some Youtube vids and see the many styles you can get out of this one wig, and protect your own natural hair.  And the shipping was so fast...BOSS!!!!!!     P.S.My hair sheds...but not shed like that...I thought I should mention that so yall dont think I&#x27;m sick or something...just my natural shedding...ok I will stop!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first very curly wig and I love it.  I ordered it in the F1010 from Myhaironline.com and it is blond and very cool.  Looks very bohemian.  It hardly matches my natural brown hair, but, so what? I just wear a colorful scarf with it. Sometimes I put a claw clip in it, and wear it as a big bushy ponytail.  That&#x27;s fun too!</li>
    <li> I got this wig in the mail about a few weeks ago and I love it! This is the most natural looking wig that I have. I even fooled my mom and she is not easily fooled. I  cut it just a little in the back but I love how big it is!! So in love I&#x27;m getting another one. La jay is my default hair lol!</li>
    <li> Everyone thinks this is my real hair, but because it&#x27;s synthetic you can&#x27;t wash it.</li>
    <li> I seen a lot of reviews and it seemed like something I would like, it looks great I am thinking about ordering another,anyone that loves natural hair should order this wig.....love it</li>
    <li> I like the wig but the cap size is too small for my head so I can only wear it for a couple of hours :/</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! OH AND DID I SAY I LOVE IT!!!! THIS IS A MUST HAVE. IT BLENDS SO NATURAL WITH YOUR HAIR. I SEE ME WEARING THIS ALL THE TIME.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ran across this wig.  I plan on getting more in different shades.</li>
    <li> i bought this wig to wear to my birthday party and i got so many compliments it is a lot of hair so if you like big hair this is the one to get</li>
    <li> good for a hot summer day. A little too short for me</li>
    <li> This is a very cute unit.  Vanessa is a brand with full pieces and a wide variety of styles.  I&#x27;ve purchased many.  However, my experience with Vanessa products is that they do not last very long.  My last Los Mogan only lasted a couple of weeks before I had to toss it.  I won&#x27;t purchase any more.</li>
    <li> love this hair wig.  I can wear it as a whole or half wig.  It blends with my 4b/c hair beautifully.  It has not lost it&#x27;s curl pattern, even after washing it.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> Love La Jay Wigs!!! This is a good quality wig for exceptional value and price, it maintains a fresh look for a longer then expected life span of a synthetic wig. Very pleased with the fabulous look!!</li>
    <li> Ive had this wig for a while but I only recently starting wearing it.  And now... I hate taking it off!  You can&#x27;t tell me anything when I have this wig on.  It is simply amazing and can be tame enough for the office or fluff up for a night on the town.  I bought two more just for the heck of it.</li>
    <li> My sister&#x27;s really liked this wig, I on the other hand have a smaller head than theirs and felt as thought the wig was waaaaaaaaaaay too big and puffy. I took some shearing scissors and tried to bring the half wig down to a size that I felt was appropriate for my head and still, after cutting this thing up, it&#x27;s still too big. It&#x27;s Just Not The Half Wig for Me. Also, if you want tight curls, do not brush this wig...I repeat, Do Not Brush. It ruins the look and makes it appear like cats went at it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie...this is a BIG girl. But if your going to get a kinky curly wig then you should know what to expect. I love this wig so much i&#x27;m going to get a second one :D It also blends unbelievably well with my natural hair. I did have to cut her down a little but she is a beauty :)</li>
    <li> This is such a great wig. It&#x27;s an afro, so you have to like big hair! But fortunately, it doesn&#x27;t resemble a clown costume, like I&#x27;ve seen with other afro wigs. It&#x27;s so natural-looking that people think it&#x27;s my hair. There is the option to comb it out to make it more full, but I left it as is because it looked good right out of the package, and it didn&#x27;t need any alterations/customizing. It was a great price too.</li>
    <li> It looks soooo natural even though it&#x27;s synthetic. I get compliments everyday on it. I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I fell in looooove with this wig! I am a natural hair gal and I wanted a wig I could wear that looked like my own hair while still looking real. Now, I did have to cut it down to shape my face, and when it first got here it looked as though some parts had been combed through already (that was the only thing I didnt like) but after I cut and shaped it, it was so beautiful I didnt even notice! I cant wait to wear my wig out for the first time!!! From now on I will be buying LaJay&#x27;s!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent wig. Very natural looking. I didn&#x27;t experience any shedding or problems. If you&#x27;re looking for a kinky fro hairstyle, then this wig is perfect.</li>
    <li> Maybe my expectations were a bit high. After reading RAVE reviews and watching a ton of YouTube videos on this \\&quot;diva\\&quot; I was dying to get my hands on one. Out of the package and playing around with it, I think I enjoyed it all of 30 minutes. I just could not get the nerve to wear it out because it just wasn&#x27;t quite \\&quot;right\\&quot;...I pull it out every so often and try it on and play with it, but I am just not feeling it. Many have said you have to LOVE big hair to love LaJay. Guess big hair isn&#x27;t my thing...cute on everyone else, I guess I&#x27;m just more conservative?... I may have her professionally styled or cut to suit my head/face...otherwise \\&quot;she\\&quot; will be resting in the bottom drawer indefinitely.</li>
    <li> This is really big hair!!! :-) which i love!!! A few snips here and there for shape and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Great hair.It was a little bit too much but after cutting some of it, it looked ok.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that I could blend with my own hair while taking myself through transition from chemicals.  Since I can&#x27;t wear it twisted or braided all of the time, I decided to go with this wig.  The reviews are not wrong - this is BIG Texas hair.  But, I like the fact that it is soft, you can cut it to suit your style and, with just a little effort, you can blend your edges with the wig for a flawless seam.  I take about 1 inch of hair around the circumference of my head, secure the wig and then finger comb around the edges until my hair is incorporated.  Since my hair still has some highlights visible, it looks like I have subtle streaking through the front.  Even my son was fooled when he saw me. I&#x27;m ordering another one for safe keeping. I love it.</li>
    <li> The seller was fantastic; shipped right away.  They get the 2 stars - the product gets ZERO.  The product was very disappointing.  Watched a few youtube videos and thought I would be getting something like the picture, or with a looser curl.  Instead the curls were very tight.  Yuck. Looked horrible on me.  It&#x27;s a crap shoot with Vanessa, the manufacturer of this wig.  I emailed them asking why the wig was not consistent in style and quality.  They blew off the email.  Apparently they don&#x27;t care.  So order this at your own risk and don&#x27;t expect to get a wig anything like the photo.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite wig! And as it ages it looks more natural and realistic !</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t look right on me</li>
    <li> I have seen reviews for this unit on Youtube, and it seems that it looked so different on every person. But the way it looked in one video made me want to purchase it for myself in a color 1B. Now a lot of people were able to wear this as a full wig, but once I got it and put it on my head, that was not the case. I was so upset! It just did not look right on me, so I put it away and continued wearing my Drew by Beshe. But then I came back to it to see if this was a total lost cause, and it wasn&#x27;t! It does look similar to some of the wigs I saw on youtube, but I&#x27;ve just come to realize that there are different tweaks with different units. I love how it looks on me, but I wear it as a half wig (what it was created for, lol), because putting it to the front of my hair line makes me look crazy. But I really like it, get major compliments on it, and will order a new one soon, maybe in a different color.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Vanessa La Jay Half Wig after seeing a lot of reviews of the wig on You Tube. I was wathching a video and as soon as the girl put the wig on I went straight to amazon and ordered. When I received the wig I liked it. It gets better with time. I have been wearing the wig everyday since I purchased. I am starting to love the wig.</li>
    <li> This wig is so amazing.  Every time I wear it people think that it is mine!  Plus it got to my apartment in just a few days!</li>
    <li> shipping time and product was excellent</li>
    <li> Looks fake in person...</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS WIG WHEN I HAD IT BEFORE BUT I GOT IT FROM MY COUSIN BUT WHEN I ORDERED IT THEY SENT THE WRONG PRODUCT BUT BECAUSE I DON&#x27;T ALWAYS HAVE A WAY TO GET RETURN INFO PRINTED I COULDN&#x27;T RETURN IT AND NOW I&#x27;M STUCK WITH A WIG I DIDN&#x27;T ORDER AND OUT OF 40.00</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Amazing. Looks so natural, easy to maintain &amp; I get daily compliments :) I need another one.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this wig.....it&#x27;s PERFECT!!!! LOOKS NATURAL AND FITS PERFECTLY! You will love it. THE PRI C E&lt;br /&gt;AND THE WIG IS A STEAL</li>
    <li> Happy with the hair. Looks real</li>
    <li> Great wig I have worn la jay for 3 years now! Mimicks African American hair we&#x27;ll! Fast shipment</li>
    <li> This wig has honestly been better to me than $300 wigs &amp; weaves. It&#x27;s gets better the older it gets. Everyone assumes it&#x27;s my real hair even though you can barely see my little curly leave out. It honestly just comes across as a real African-American hair period</li>
    <li> I love LaJay! Always did, always will! Enough said!</li>
    <li> this does not look like the wig I reviewed too much hair so I tried to cut out the bulk looks worst now i can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> This obviously belonged to someone else. The packaging looked like it was in good condition, the wig itself was old and already fallen, curl patterns had already disappeared for some strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love to find this from another source...waste of money.</li>
    <li> This wig is going to be my staple, it can be very versatile, as seen on youtube it can worn in different styles. It also blends very well with natural hair, I will definitely be ordering more of this style.</li>
