      <li>It can get greasy and rub off during the day, but setting with a powder and touching up with powder can help with that problem.</li>
      <li>I got the darker shade before, but this one is fits my tone better. :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, but know that I am no foundation junkie.</li>
      <li>and it applies smoothly and blends easily!</li>
      <li>goes on very smooth and light.</li>
      <li>It has great coverage with a natural finish.</li>
      <li>I have blemishes on my face and the matte mousse covers them very well, people tell me all the time you have a nice complexion.  </li>
      <li>After seeing this on YouTube and how smooth the coverage was decided to try.</li>
      <li>Its light and airy not tacky greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>Applies smooth and evenly.</li>
      <li>I guess everyhing is a light shade thing now, It doesn&#x27;t  leave pores clogged.</li>
      <li>I feel as if it&#x27;s REALLY smooth though which is a plus.</li>
      <li>Item is genuine and is what I am accustomed to using.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin, and despite it being primarily for oily skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering again very soon!!!</li>
      <li>I GOT IT FOR MY DEAR SISTER WHOM I LOVE VERY VERY MUCH</li>
      <li>It gives you that smooth natural look and overall the best.</li>
      <li>For a very fair toned black woman.</li>
      <li>One of them applied on perfectly and the other was very oily and didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours before wearing off.  </li>
      <li>She loves this as it&#x27;s light and matches her coloring very well.</li>
      <li>but this was seriously worth the buy.</li>
      <li>THE RIGHT COLOR</li>
      <li>I really like this!</li>
      <li>my first time using this product</li>
      <li>At first i couldn&#x27;t  find it in stores.</li>
      <li>When I wear its light and you can barely notice you have it on.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause my face to look oily later in the day.</li>
      <li>I looked very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>

      <li>I love all maybelline products thanks for adding African American products!!</li>
      <li>It looks natural and  lasts all day!</li>
      <li>I found even more strange was that even though it was the same product, the design on the front was different.  </li>
      <li>, it blend in with my skin  and give u  natural look.</li>
      <li>Arrived early.</li>
      <li>I am usually not into buying such products online..</li>

    <li> great coverage, i love this foundation. I&#x27;m medium - dark complexion kinda like peanut butter and this does the job. Its light and airy not tacky greasy feeling. Great price too!</li>
    <li> I love this foundation. It goes on so smoothly and makes your skin look absolutely flawless and perfect. It can get greasy and rub off during the day, but setting with a powder and touching up with powder can help with that problem. I had no idea my skin could look so perfect. I put mine on with a foundation brush.</li>
    <li> I really loved this. I am usually not into buying such products online.. but this was seriously worth the buy. For a very fair toned black woman.</li>
    <li> This is a great foundation that is smooth, easy to apply and make my face look so faultless.  I get looks and many complements every time I am out and about.  People want to know who makes this foundation.  It is getting hard to find this foundation at retail stores.  So stock up.</li>
    <li> I GOT IT FOR MY DEAR SISTER WHOM I LOVE VERY VERY MUCH SHE IS CRAZY ABOUT THIS MAKE UP IT WS THE RIGHT COLOR SHE WILL G&lt;br /&gt;BE GETTING SOME MORE SOON  I WII BUY HER SOME MORE REL SOON THANK U</li>
    <li> After not being able to find them in the stores anymore, I ordered 3.  Not all of them had the same formula.  One of them applied on perfectly and the other was very oily and didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours before wearing off.  I looked very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;What I found even more strange was that even though it was the same product, the design on the front was different.  One was in white, and the other was in black writing.  and the 3rd didn&#x27;t even have the plastic on it like it had been opened.  I was very frustrated</li>
    <li> Ordered the item @ 5pm, and the package arrived the very next day. Item was as described, I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> Maybelline Dream Matte is the best foundation u can use,  I luv it, my sister order her sum and she really like it, it blend in with my skin  and give u  natural look. I will be order again and again,  it is the best.</li>
    <li> Items received in good conditions</li>
    <li> this is perfect.. Im not a foundation person but when I found this I had to try it. its amazing. When I wear its light and you can barely notice you have it on. It makes my skin look 10 times better!</li>
    <li> Its soo creamy and smoothy i like it . Its a really good foundation abd i will repeated again and again</li>
    <li> Love it !! So smooth!! No. 1 choice !!! I love all maybelline products thanks for adding African American products!! Will order AGAIN!! Xoxoxox</li>
    <li> Item is genuine and is what I am accustomed to using. Blends with my skin colour well. I use sparingly for a day look or combine with MAC Compaq when going out.</li>
    <li> goes on very smooth and light. my first time using this product and I&#x27;m impressed. the colour was what I expected.</li>
    <li> The best foundation ever made. At first i couldn&#x27;t  find it in stores. I guess everyhing is a light shade thing now, It doesn&#x27;t  leave pores clogged. It just glides effortlessly accross face. Love it.....</li>
    <li> Applies smooth and evenly. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 8 years now. Waiting for an SPF version of it. Plus the price was so great!</li>
    <li> I really like this! It&#x27;s really smooth and works perfectly. I got the darker shade before, but this one is fits my tone better. :)</li>
    <li> Always a good buy, matches my skin tone perfectly.</li>
    <li> She loves this as it&#x27;s light and matches her coloring very well. She has a hard time finding a matching color and this is what she uses.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup.  Easy to apply and great coverage! Matches my complexion great! I have tried a lot and this works the best!</li>
    <li> I have blemishes on my face and the matte mousse covers them very well, people tell me all the time you have a nice complexion.  I guess they cannot tell I am wearing foundation</li>
    <li> This product retails for almost $20 in the store! Shipped quick perfect match!! I&#x27;ll be ordering again very soon!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now . It lasts a very long time! It has a great medium to full coverage. It looks natural and  lasts all day! It doesn&#x27;t melt off when you sweat and it applies smoothly and blends easily! I have combination skin, and despite it being primarily for oily skin it still looks equally great on my drier areas!</li>
    <li> The brand is good, but what was delivered was a product close to being expired this is suppoded to cling to the insides of the jar, not draw up in the middle. No, I really think this product was sitting on the back of a shelf somewhere.</li>
    <li> I totally love this foundation! After seeing this on YouTube and how smooth the coverage was decided to try. Apply with a foundation brush and get smooth flawless coverage. Very little is needed to apply full face coverage so don&#x27;t let the small bottle deter you. Great for oily skin.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation! !!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I couldn&#x27;t find my PERFECT match in Walmart so I came to Amazon, found my shade IMMEDIATELY, and it was actually in stock. That&#x27;s a plus, product arrived on time, and in tact. Very good product, goes on smooth, and gives me a FLAWLESS finish! I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Terrible! I wish I never bought it. It made me break out. I will never buy a product from Maybelline again. Product Lasted about a month for me though. It didn&#x27; t even control oil.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, but know that I am no foundation junkie. I feel as if it&#x27;s REALLY smooth though which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I like this make up but the price has gone up.</li>
    <li> aaaaaahhhhhhh! i ordered the wrong color! i was mad at first but i just bought another foundation to mix with it to make it darker.</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used on my face. It gives you that smooth natural look and overall the best. No complaints. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3yrs now and will continue using till I find something better even though I&#x27;m not looking.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I buy expensive foundation. I always end up coming back to this. Great make up. Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause my face to look oily later in the day. It has great coverage with a natural finish.</li>
