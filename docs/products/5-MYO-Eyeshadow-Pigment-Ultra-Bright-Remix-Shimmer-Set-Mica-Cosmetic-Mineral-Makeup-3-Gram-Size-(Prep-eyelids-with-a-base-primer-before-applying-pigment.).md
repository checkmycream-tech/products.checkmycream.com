<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love these colors so bright and fun for the summer</li>
    <li> These are some really nice shadows. I compared it to urban decay&#x27;s electric pallet, and these were at lease 2x as bright as any on U.D.&#x27;s You definitely need some primer to make them look good though. Washed off easily.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I am not fond of sparkly makeup, and this has shimmer in it. Not glittery, but I would still like it better if it came in a matte version.</li>
    <li> Those skimpy little pots....and by the way false advertising...there is no way on gods earth ...that any one could achieve the type of result posted...whith the products I received...it is over priced and deceiving...and oh...should I mention the shipping?...unacceptable !</li>
    <li> I do not like at all has nothing to do with the photo ,does not shine in the dark. :(</li>
    <li> Do not buy makeup is horrible on the skin hard to make it flow well and is very hard to get off skin. It gets everywhere even when taking extra caution and def u at ly need primer</li>
    <li> I cant get enough MYO!</li>
    <li> The colors are bright and beautiful. But you&#x27;ve got to be ok with the fact that this product is kind of shady. It just comes in a random unlabeled container, the kind they hand test products out in at placed like Sephora. And it smells super weird. I&#x27;m only going to use it a few times for burning man so it should be fine. But I don&#x27;t know, if you&#x27;re planning on wearing it a lot maybe spend a few bucks more on a more legitimate product.</li>
    <li> very very very pigmented. you will look SO cool even at a sweaty party where it&#x27;s all humid, it really stays in place.</li>
    <li> You get what you see.. they are highly pigmented and neon as hell! Loved it</li>
    <li> Awesome they look just like the picture bright pretty colors very easy to apply and looks really nice</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS COMPANY! These eye-shadow&#x27;s are exactly as they appear in the pics except you can&#x27;t see the sparkle which is beautiful. Not overly sparkly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting glitter everywhere. Its nice without primer but trust me and use primer to really make these colors POP!!!</li>
    <li> Super super super bright. I didn&#x27;t expect them to be so good for the price but I was very pleasantly surprised. No need to buy super expensive pigments.. These work GREAT.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product!!! I get so many compliments on my eyeshadow. I haven&#x27;t tried it on the lips yet, but I intend to. Tip: add white eyeliner and it just pops. Will definitely buy again! Very vibrant colors.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap in every way. Even with a primer on I basically had to just cake it. Pretty cool looking under a black light. Not very easy to apply if you consider how much you have to layer, or how many times you have to reapply.</li>
    <li> not displeased. Great and easy to apply. I enjoy Using this item for my costume makeup. Some people wear it out, but I would NOT leave the house with this on...&lt;br /&gt;~Mandi</li>
    <li> You must put on a primer on first.</li>
    <li> Product was even beautiful when received, the colors are amazing,vibrant,lovers the way it looks when applied! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and I love these. I will be ordering more in the future and the neons glow in black light!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be as pigmented as the picture... Not really but it still looks decent the pink and orange are really bright.</li>
    <li> i love the eyeshadow i have order the other ones n i love it . the reasson why i put 4 stars and not 5 its cuz it was suppost to be shimmery eyeshadow but its really not its like a tap shimmer once you open it . but once its on the eyes it just seems matt . but other than that its great. all day wear . even if you sweat alot it wont come off. all you need is a eyeshadow primer and you are good. i use urban decay eyeshadow primer and jambo stick milk from nyx . not that you need the pencil stick its already bright. but i like mine exrta bright .hope this helps .</li>
    <li> It glowed well, but I assumed it would glow the color that it came in. For example, I used pink eyeshadow, but it glowed orange! Not cute.</li>
    <li> Wow would you look at that... Now you can upload pictures. Hmmmmm wonder why. Anyway.. Love the PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> i used this product for an 80&#x27;s themed party. before using the product on my eyes i used an eyelid primer, and i also put down a white cream base, but it still was not as neon as the product appears in the images. ALSO the eyeshadow chunked up on my eyelids, which was not so great.</li>
    <li> I loved everything about this makeup. The colors match the picture. I even went to a party and the lights on the dance floor were dimmed and everyone loved my makeup because it glowed in the dark.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! But you have to know how to apply loose eye makeup... I GOT SOOOO MANY compliments.... KEY WORD know what your doing.. Loose powder..</li>
    <li> I were this all the time , they are so pretty</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this out knowing how perfectly it would compliment my sense of style. I use the white 24hr. color tattoo eye shadow cream that comes in a little mini jar (if im not mistaken i think mabeline makes it) and brush this on top of that and WOW the color can really be as bright as in the picture! and a little bit of it goes a long way!!!  The only thing I worry about is dropping the container while its open being used I havn&#x27;t yet but I know I wouldnt be surprised when I do just very sad :( anyway the makers of this product should look into some sort of lid for it similar to like a salt shaker or something. just enough to get a little on the lid or just on the brush but still safe enough to where if it gets dropped not all of it will become &amp;#34;dust in the wind&amp;#34; cuz its a very loose powder. I constantly get compliments on my eyes when I use this stuff and I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I adore these colors! They are marvelous! The colors are truly bright and highly pigmented enough to show up on every skin tone.</li>
    <li> They were kinda small you need to prime your eye before useing it but it was ok</li>
    <li> these colors are so bright with a primer under them I just love them</li>
    <li> Love this wish it was less expensive for the small about you get per container bit over all was very pleased!</li>
    <li> Pigmented and absolutely A+++ love these eyeshadows. Will definitely buy more in the future. Myo is a great brand. Love it</li>
    <li> the color pay off is great. but they have a werid smell to them but other than tht there a dup for sugar pill electrio cute collection</li>
    <li> I was looking for vibrant, bright, shocking colors that were economical but went on smooth and didnt require a ton of work to perfect. This is perfect. I was iffy on it and read the negative reviews carefully and was worried when I purchased but thoguht they only cost $5 and if it didnt work out well no biggie. I was totally surprised at just how good these shadows are! I have used them for eyes and lips and here is what I found;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed them and will add it to youtube soon where I give info on how it worked for me and tips for best ways to benefit from wearing the colors Will post it as a comment to this review when its up so you can see it for yourself but in the meantime I found that this product is suggested to only be used with the primers or gloss and that isnt true, they actually work best on their own except the lips that needs at least gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that if you put a small dab of the color on the tip of the applicator and then apply to your eyes dry without any other product, it goes on with one application bright and long lasting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great and I think I will keep buying when I need other colors, their website has better pricing deals!</li>
    <li> Not very bright when putting them on with a brush need to wet brush and then apply for desired brightness overall ok product wouldn&#x27;t recommend for someone looking for actual makeup. Containers tend to leak even when close to making a mess in my makeup box but I just put them in a baggie to remedy this.</li>
    <li> AWESOME is all I can say!</li>
    <li> A good eyeshadow base or mixing medium is needed to keep this shadow intact, preferably something creamy, without it the wear won&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;Really needs layering to wear well not great for professional use.&lt;br /&gt;Workable for a fun night out with friends.</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the picture! After swatching it without a base, my best friend and I love the colors and they are great!</li>
    <li> Love it wish was in bigger quality but I would buy again</li>
    <li> Never received this product, but I will order again</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this makeup and great quality!</li>
    <li> I expect more high pigment in the colors.</li>
    <li> The colors are not as bright and come off easily.</li>
    <li> I will give more stars when I try it on.</li>
    <li> Colors true.and good.and good.and good. And good.and good one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen</li>
    <li> Great product, great grade, goes on great, looks good, beautiful colors, I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> Super bright awesome colors! Great texture to very blendy</li>
    <li> the product is not as vibrant as shown in the advertisements. It is very shimmery which I like but when applied the color appears neutral</li>
    <li> The colors are identical to the image. Such beautiful colors. I use the mac white pencil and the colors just POP !</li>
    <li> Fast delivery arrived way before expected date colors are as stated very bright and bold I just think that they should give you a bigger jar but will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> I love love love the pigments. They&#x27;re nice and bright.  I will order again. My only disappointment is when I did receive my package, one of the containers were proven and there was pink pigment everywhere.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these shadows. I have a blast putting together different looks. I highly recommend putting the shadows on before any other eye makeup because they will transfer to your face a bit since the powder is very fine. You will not be disappointed! Just make sure those lids are tight because the shadows can get messy ;)</li>
    <li> Eh,  cheap you get what you pay for. I bought this just to play around with some crazy makeup looks for certain holidays etc.  you must use a great primer. The color buy its self is very chalky and powdery. I would not buy this again but it&#x27;s always fun to experiment  Shipping and packaging was excellent.</li>
    <li> This was a fun purchase in preparing for a Blacklight Run I am doing later this year.  These came in the exact way as described.  VERY BRIGHT and pigmented colors in the containers.  I am not a makeup artist so application of these is a littler cumbersome.  They are pretty pigmented but it does require a significant amount of product over a primer for staying and concentrated power.  When I say significant it isn&#x27;t a ton but just probably 2-4 strokes versus one stroke of application.  I used a Sephora eyeshadow primer in a nude color and a brush to apply a fun look as seen in photos I will upload with the review.  The Pink, Orange and Yellow were the show stoppers under blacklight. The blue and green were slightly darker and less noticeable against the other three.  This will be absolutely fun for the Blacklight Run.  I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;d wear these for any other time as the colors are insanely fluorescent, but if you want that look these are perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal of Eye Makeup: EASY!  This may be a bad thing if you want it to stay for the long haul.... maybe a setting spray might help seal it on?  As for mine the water almost removed all the colors but orange.  I used Rimmel Eye Make Up remover and it removed everything with no rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No allergic reactions or smells from this product for me; but my skin is normal and rarely has sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT*  DId find a fun daytime look with the neon green eye shadow!  (Uploaded photo, pls ignore the mascara mark-up, lol)</li>
    <li> Love the colors! Lasted the whole night!! 👍🏻</li>
    <li> Love these! use a white base for them to really pop. Very small containers but actually a lot of product in them.</li>
    <li> It burns my eyes, and I don&#x27;t like the way it goes on my eyes but I love the colors</li>
    <li> Even with a base the colors were too light. Not what I expected. They smell funny too.</li>
    <li> I used Nyx eyeshadow base and it works perfectly! I got the same results as the picture! Love them! Great buy for me!</li>
    <li> It is bringer but u have to use something under it to keep it from coming off or caking on your eyes</li>
    <li> Not as bright as picture as shows. Sorely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Shows up great in backlights I&#x27;ve used a wet brush as well as a dry brush to get different results. Super fun!</li>
    <li> My best friend is nicknamed rainbow and she is always wearing eye shadow with lots of colors. Lately the normal eyeshadows looked really full, which doesn&#x27;t suit her personality so I got her these. She adores this stuff uses it daily</li>
    <li> These shadow is life!!!!!...especially the pink omg to die for...would buy these 10 times over</li>
    <li> Just arrived yesterday! I absolutely love them!!! They go on superbly, I used a primer: it goes on nice and neon! I got immediate compliments wherever I went - people loved it! My fav eyeshadows by far!&lt;br /&gt;If you want less neon brightness then tap your brush gently and smooth on your lids. I like it both ways! Makes great eyeliners too! Va va voooooom!</li>
    <li> Love the bright neon colors, I have not used them yet, but I know I will soon!</li>
    <li> I wanted these to replace my other colors I was running out of.&lt;br /&gt;WOW they have done that and so much more! Not only are they amazingly brilliant but BLACKLIGHT REACTIVE!!! hey glow!!! And they look so sexy in regular light too. I used a white cream eyeshadow pencil after a eyeshadow primer &amp; before applying each color with a separate brush of course. On my forehead in the blacklight pics is another paint used that is liquid. Only on my eyelids and under the eye this product is demonstrated.</li>
    <li> Everyone i know has said oh bridgett thats not something u should wear everyday! My reply is ya its totally something &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; would wear everyday! But thats just me, i have the wicked amazing eyes to put it on so why not? This stuff is crazy awesome!!! If u have the eyes for it, and good enough to pull it off i suggest u buy it;)</li>
    <li> Loved these eyeshadows. They look awesome. I highly recommend them.</li>
