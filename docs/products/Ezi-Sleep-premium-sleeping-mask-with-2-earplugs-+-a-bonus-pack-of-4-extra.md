<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got these for my daughter who suffers from chronic migraines. When they come on she needs an ice pack and total darkness.  These have straps and places to hold the ear plugs so she won&#x27;t loose them. She has praised this purchase more so than anything else. They keep the light out and with the ear plugs she is able to keep the noise out as well.  Thankfully I was given this product to review and give an honest opinion. I can&#x27;t tell you how many different masks I have bought her. The kind with ice in the face part, the kind with the cooling beads that you keep in the fridge all did not to the job this mask has done.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for long commutes on the bus or long flights. It blocks out all light and allows me to sleep easy even during the day. It is lightweight, comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation on my nose or around the straps. It also has a neat holding spot for the earplugs on the strap. Great product for travelers.</li>
    <li> This sleep set is wonderful.It works well and will instantly help you get a great nights sleep!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Fast shipping and friendly feedback. Everything is great!</li>
    <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of a sleep mask that comes with earplugs that you can&#x27;t lose between uses! The fact that it comes with two extra sets of earplugs is amazing, because it means I won&#x27;t have to search for earplugs to go with this if these get yucky! This mask really blocks light well, and the earplugs are the comfortable type, and fit nicely in my ears. I have a difficult time getting to sleep some nights, and my youngest daughter will wake up screaming if all of the lights in the house are off, so this is incredibly useful. Now i can leave the hallway light on, and still feel like I&#x27;m sleeping in complete darkness!&lt;br /&gt;I received this mask for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use. I was not told what to say, only asked to give an honest review based on my own experience with the product.</li>
    <li> This Ezi Sleep sleeping mask is super soft and effectively block out all distracting light. This is my second pair and I love it. This is, by far, the most comfortable, well-fitting, and easiest to wear sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever owned. It helps you to sleep soundly and it doesn&#x27;t smudge my eye makeup when I&#x27;m traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great for air travel, daytime sleep, etc.The soft foam Ear Plugs helps cancel out noise so you sleep soundly. It is easy to wash and reusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use and believe will be good.</li>
    <li> Love how great the Ezi Sleep mask and ear plugs work for a good nights sleep . Eye mask helps to block out the light and ear plus help to drown out the sound . These are great for anyone that has trouble sleeping and are great for people who have busy towns/ streets . I recommend the to anyone  and Ezi Sleep Mask  is a great product to buy .</li>
    <li> I love my new sleep mask and ear plugs. My husband who is a Dessert Storm Veteran cannot sleep unless the Tv is on. Its drives me crazy because I couldn&#x27;t sleep that way. With this, I can actually sleep easily with out the aid of melatonin. The fabric of the mask is silk and soft. it stays on my face perfectly. It&#x27;s a great product an I am so ecstatic that I got to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I would also like add that I got the product for free but my opinion about it is entirely my own. If I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll give it a zero star, but this one is a winner. I love it!</li>
    <li> I got this for my Nurse friend who is now working the overnight shift.  She said it works great.  It blocks out all light and sound and makes for a good night or days rest.</li>
    <li> This is my first sleeping mask that I purchased. I am very glad I&#x27;ve invested in this product. It has provided me with best sleep I&#x27;ve had in months! The ear plugs work exceptionally well (also first time using them for sleep). Not sure how often you are supposed to replace the ear plugs but I \ use them for a month before replacing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I bought these was because I was not getting enough productive sleep and it seemed like the best one on amazon. I was living in a dorm and I was able to hear everything outside my room, on top of that, my roommate slept late and noisy. I am a very light sleeper but when I put the sleeping mask on it is basically all black with a little bit of light coming through the nasal area. I LATER FOUND OUT THAT I NEED TO WEAR IT TIGHTER! Doing this fixed the problem with no discomfort added. I also have a small nose and almost non-existence nose bridge! So all my fellow small nosed people, this is gold! The earplugs obviously does not block all sounds, it filters and softens background noise. I have had this for 6 months so far and can not imagine my life without this anymore. I have not washed these yet and its mainly due to the fact that I shower before I sleep. My favorite part of sleeping is putting these babies on right before I sleep. It has become my ritual. I literally can&#x27;t sleep/wake-up well without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;-blocks all light! (even for me with a small nose/nose bridge)&lt;br /&gt;-comfortable&lt;br /&gt;-soft fabric for my face and eyes&lt;br /&gt;-dramatically increased my sleeping productivity&lt;br /&gt;-pockets for ear plugs*&lt;br /&gt;-does not give me a headache nor does it give a discomforting tension&lt;br /&gt;-I have yet to clean it, and its still clean!&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;-the pockets for the ear plugs (yeah, its good for not losing my earplugs but sometimes when I lay on the side with the ear plug pocket I feel it bulging into my head or ear. This only happens when I put it on loosely though. If the mask is on tight where its comfortable and doesnt fall off, it feels great. I just move around frequently when I sleep.)</li>
    <li> Sorry but had to return this product. When it arrived the inner lining wasn&#x27;t stitched properly. Returned it the following day.</li>
    <li> I work nights so this mask definitely comes in handy! It eliminates the need for room-darkening blinds.</li>
    <li> WORKED AMAZING!! LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> I love this mask. I sleep with it everynight and it keeps the sunlight out.</li>
    <li> Works good. Like this product very much</li>
    <li> I am a sleep mask expert from working night shift. I really, really liked this mask. It has that little nose flap which really helps keep out the light. This mask is comfortable and lets no light in. I am not a huge earplug fan, but if you are, it has little slits on the elastic where you can stick the earplugs so you wont lose them - genius. The elastic is a little big for my head but I have a tiny head. It would be perfect on any normal size head. I would definitely buy this again! The product came as stated and was delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for any of my opinions and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
    <li> Excellent to have! My 1 year old just started sleeping through the night, and my 4 year old just started sleeping in his bed by himself consistently, now its hard for me to get to sleep without letting my mind wonder. This is just what I needed to get some rest and shut everything out for a little while. The mask is really soft and luxurious and completely blacks everything out for me, even if the husband has the tv on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> Price is also cheap, the product is also more than expected seller willing to very kindly answering&lt;br /&gt;Please buy good things comfortably</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t cover my eyes all the way, there was a very small light leak in bottom. A little irritating but nothing to worry about. Everything was as  described by the seller.</li>
    <li> Really cute idea! What a great freebie! Mask is adjustable and has little slots in the strap to store a set of ear plugs. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Love the mask!  Fits great, better than so many other masks I&#x27;ve tried.  The ear plugs are a nice touch but not good for sleeping in, way too hard.  Would be great for the range though!</li>
    <li> I love this! It blocks all light so I can stay sleep.</li>
    <li> Just a plain bandage.&lt;br /&gt;The solid can be used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice mask.  Seems well made.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull my hair.  However.....it&#x27;s just too small for my face.  Now chances are, it will fit 80% of the people, but I&#x27;m a tall gal, and this is just a tad small.  But I&#x27;ll still give it decent stars because I think the problem is mine, not its.</li>
    <li> Helps to get a good night sleep</li>
    <li> Got it free and really nice</li>
    <li> I got this to give to my sister, she loves masks.  It was far better quality than I expected.  The ear plugs were standard, but I kept those for myself.</li>
    <li> This mask is a perfect fit for me and my hubby. It comes with two set of ear plugs and a nice pouch to keep the mask and the plugs in. I love the fact that the pouch is included with the product because now everything remains at one place. It is easy to pick up the pouch with its content and keep it in the purse while travelling. The mask itself blocks out light totally. It is a good product overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions. I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
    <li> Blocks all light and the ear buds help reduce noise</li>
    <li> this one works good.  I like to use it when I can&#x27;t go to sleep so easy.  I get stress and sometimes can&#x27;t go to sleep easy.  I just put these on and it helps me to go to sleep.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time sleeping if there is any light at all coming into my room. My room happens to be next to the bathroom and that light always gets left on at night so no matter what I do there is light shining in my room. The Ezi Sleep mask really helps keep the light out. Most sleep mask block most of the light except for right under your eyes and around you nose but with this mask it has a little &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; that goes down a little further to help keep the light out completely. The strap fits comfortably around my head and there is a place to hold the ear plugs that comes with it. It comes in a cute little bag so you can easily take it anywhere with you, and as a bonus you get 2 extra pairs of ear plugs. This is one of the most comfortable sleep masks I have ever had and it really does a great job of keeping the light out so I can get a good nights sleep. I received this product as a sample to test and review. This review is solely my opinion. The information provided is what I experienced.</li>
    <li> works great and the mask is super soft!</li>
    <li> Love this. Does exactly what it says it does .. good product.</li>
    <li> nice material for a mask. love that it came with earplugs. Been testing it out and it helps me sleep at night and during the day/naps. fits perfect for me.</li>
    <li> works great for waking up late</li>
