      <li>I love this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>Glad to see it here!</li>
      <li>What happened to my favorite H&amp;S shampoo?!?  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Combined we rate it as a 4 star product and certainly for those who have dandruff it is one of the best brands available.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I both love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Happy to find a reasonably priced shampoo that works.</li>
      <li>Glad it is on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It gives me lots of volume and does not cause static in my hair and a lot of volumizing shampoos do.  </li>
      <li>we have shiny healthy hair, no flakes or itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find the Extra Volume any more in any store and it&#x27;s the best version of the Head &amp; Shoulders line, so Amazon comes to the rescue again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so i will have to order more soon</li>
      <li>I have been using many kinds of shampoo over the years.</li>
      <li>Will be buying her more when she finishes her stock</li>
      <li>The other perk is that this stuff smells awesome, and it lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair easy to keep in place.</li>
      <li>works well with on fine hair, gives volume without the oily feeling.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is great for my fine wavy hair, and has the added benefit of making the white in my hair &#x27;pop&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Head &amp;amp; Shoulders (extra Volume) is a Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
      <li>does good with dandruff control and makes my hair feel soft and flowy.</li>
      <li>as in once I accidentally used the Garniere Fructise \\&quot;straightening\\&quot; shampoo and the hairs puffed up/repelled each other like magnets) and this stuff leaves my hair looking GORGEOUS, still sleek but also nice and full.  </li>
      <li>My whole family uses head and shoulders, but this one type is special to us girls!</li>
      <li>I actually don&#x27;t have a problem with dandruff, but tried this one day because I am always looking for the perfect shampoo to pump up the volume and not weigh my fine hair down.  </li>
      <li>It did the job and my hair was clean, soft and easy to care for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have super straight hair, (</li>
      <li>I use it for my 11 year old daughter and myself and we have extremely fine hair.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this product to those who have the same concern as I have.</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers, I have been searching for this product in drugstores and have not been able to find it.</li>
      <li>It left my hair clean as well as it gave it some added body.</li>
      <li>This shampoo meets all of our family&#x27;s needs and we will continue using it as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>For me the shampoo was OK as my hair is more thick and coarse.  </li>
      <li>I feel the same way as the other reviewers, I LOVE this shampoo!</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo, not only because it is the only one that works on my scalp, but also leaves my hair fuller.</li>
      <li>That seems odd as it claims it adds volume and body for fine hair.</li>
      <li>This optimizes the full, fluffy look that I like so much.</li>
      <li>The Extra Volume works very well for &amp;#34;less than young&amp;#34; people, and no drying effect that I can see.</li>
      <li>I am currently purchasing this on Amazon because it is becoming harder to find locally.</li>
      <li>I only had one bottle and am not sure where I bought it from, but have been searching and not been able to find it.</li>
      <li>I have no idea why it works better than the other H&amp;S shampoos in this collection, given that they all have the same active ingredient.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even though I have very thick hair, I tend to be oily, and this shampoo works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find the Extra Volume version online since it&#x27;s hard to find in our local drugstores.  </li>
      <li>straight thin hair and Head &amp; Shoulders Full Body Shampoo has done what I always wanted a shampoo to do.</li>

    <li> I love this shampoo!  I actually don&#x27;t have a problem with dandruff, but tried this one day because I am always looking for the perfect shampoo to pump up the volume and not weigh my fine hair down.  I LOVE this stuff!  It gives me lots of volume and does not cause static in my hair and a lot of volumizing shampoos do.  The other perk is that this stuff smells awesome, and it lasts all day.  The only downside is that I can NEVER find this in stores anymore.  Maybe it is my area, but it&#x27;s never in the stores.  Glad to see it here!</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love this shampoo.  I was glad to find the Extra Volume version online since it&#x27;s hard to find in our local drugstores.  Even though I have very thick hair, I tend to be oily, and this shampoo works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> i just love this shampoo, it works great and it smells really good. i am already on my last bottle so i will have to order more soon</li>
    <li> Of all the choices out there, not just Head and Shoulders alternatives, this is the winner.</li>
    <li> This brand works best for me.  I don&#x27;t have a serious problem, so a hit with this shampoo every few days helps keep things in line.  The Extra Volume works very well for &amp;#34;less than young&amp;#34; people, and no drying effect that I can see.</li>

    <li> Best shampoo i I ever used. Leaves my hair easy to keep in place. It gives texture to thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girl friend and she loves it. Will be buying her more when she finishes her stock</li>
    <li> What happened to my favorite H&amp;S shampoo?!?  I have super straight hair, (as in once I accidentally used the Garniere Fructise \\&quot;straightening\\&quot; shampoo and the hairs puffed up/repelled each other like magnets) and this stuff leaves my hair looking GORGEOUS, still sleek but also nice and full.  I have no idea why it works better than the other H&amp;S shampoos in this collection, given that they all have the same active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why can&#x27;t I find it anywhere anymore??

    <li> My wife picked this up as she is always trying different shampoos and every time she shops we get a different brand to test.  We have been using this for several weeks and we have mixed opinions of its performance.  For her she has fine thin hair and it has made her hair frizzy as if it is too harsh for her.  That seems odd as it claims it adds volume and body for fine hair. For me the shampoo was OK as my hair is more thick and coarse.  It did the job and my hair was clean, soft and easy to care for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined we rate it as a 4 star product and certainly for those who have dandruff it is one of the best brands available.

    <li> Head &amp;amp; Shoulders (extra Volume) is a Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Wish we could find it in stores in our area. But now I&lt;br /&gt;know I can order it.</li>
    <li> we have shiny healthy hair, no flakes or itchy scalp. we use this every day with no problems at all</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It keeps the itching away, and still adds volume. Works as well or better than expensive salon products.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find the Extra Volume any more in any store and it&#x27;s the best version of the Head &amp; Shoulders line, so Amazon comes to the rescue again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is full, but thin. This optimizes the full, fluffy look that I like so much.</li>
