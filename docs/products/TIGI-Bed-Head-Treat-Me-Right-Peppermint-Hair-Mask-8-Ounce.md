      <li>it is my good habbit!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great treatment.</li>
      <li>The peppermint cools the scalp and is a great non-medicated choice to relieve the itches.  </li>
      <li>This is great stuff for that</li>
      <li>but it works great.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t understand all the great reviews for this.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always a joy to use it.</li>
      <li>and it smells great.</li>
      <li>Great product, would diffenetly purcase again!&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
      <li>This hair mask is amazing!</li>
      <li>And the smell is so nice!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pleasant and cooling.</li>
      <li>Leave it on for three minutes, until the scalp is wonderfully tingly, then rinse it out and notice how nice and cool your scalp feels in summer.</li>
      <li>But the two things that are best about this product is the smell, and most importantly, the effect.</li>
      <li>It feels so amazing when using in the shower.</li>
      <li>It smells really nice.</li>

      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>and i love the thickness of it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>really wish I knew why when this is a great hair product.</li>
      <li>But i love it as a 1x per week or 2 week thang.</li>
      <li>After leaving it on for five minutes you get a nice, mild tingle on your head.</li>
      <li>The texture is smooth and not only feels good on your hair, but good on your fingers.</li>
      <li>That right there was amazing in and of itself.</li>
      <li>It rinses out real clean and my hair is super easy to comb out.</li>
      <li>I love how when you massage it into your scalp, your scalp becomes cool and tingly.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair smooth, shiny and silky.</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean after I use it, not slimey and greasy.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff didn&#x27;t give my hair a problem but only made it look shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>I only wash my hair 2 or 3 times a week to preserve the color and keep it healthy, and I always make sure to use Treat Me</li>
      <li>I use this a few times a week in place of my normal conditioner, as it&#x27;s good to switch that around every now and again, and I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky or runny, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
      <li>The minty tingles are so refreshing on your scalp, especially if you wash your hair in cool water.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair completely tangle free.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is great for cooling down in the hot summer, although it does a good job of conditioning my unruly, coarse hair year round.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair tons of body and shine, and it&#x27;s super soft and manageable!  </li>
      <li>8 ounces will go a long way! :)</li>
      <li>While there was no dramatic improvement in just one use, I have used it 4 times now.</li>
      <li>(The peppermint really does stimulate your scalp)</li>
      <li>Enjoy the tingly scalp and the extra body and movement in your hair.</li>
      <li>Makes ur hair feel soft and minty fresh.</li>
      <li>I love the fresh tingly feeling it gives my scalp, especially when dry winter set in.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not sure that it is that much better than normal conditioners</li>
      <li>Such an awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;Couldnt go wrong and make ur hair so shiny especially with people with damaged hair.</li>
      <li>I have super fine, thin hair, and this product works wonders.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair that is permed, and this mask conditions my hair without leaving it limp or greasy.  </li>
      <li>It feels so great when rinse away with a cold shower</li>
      <li>The shine factor is not very noticeable, but honestly the softness and lack of excessive frizz has me sold on this product.</li>
      <li>Right mask to help with an extremely itchy scalp.  </li>
      <li>It left my hair so soft and shiny only after using it for two weeks.</li>
      <li>Not only does it deeply moisturize, but it doesn&#x27;t weight my fine hair down like other conditioners and masks.  </li>

    <li> I have super fine, thin hair, and this product works wonders.  Not only does it deeply moisturize, but it doesn&#x27;t weight my fine hair down like other conditioners and masks.  My hair feels clean after I use it, not slimey and greasy.  It gives my hair tons of body and shine, and it&#x27;s super soft and manageable!  I only wash my hair 2 or 3 times a week to preserve the color and keep it healthy, and I always make sure to use Treat Me Right at least once a week.  The minty tingles are so refreshing on your scalp, especially if you wash your hair in cool water.  It wakes me up in the morning!</li>
    <li> I use this a few times a week in place of my normal conditioner, as it&#x27;s good to switch that around every now and again, and I love it. The texture is smooth and not only feels good on your hair, but good on your fingers. It&#x27;s not sticky or runny, it&#x27;s just right. After leaving it on for five minutes you get a nice, mild tingle on your head. It&#x27;s nothing overwhelming. It&#x27;s pleasant and cooling. But the two things that are best about this product is the smell, and most importantly, the effect. It leaves my hair completely tangle free. It also makes my hair feel softer and appear shinier than it ever has. It smells incredible too. It&#x27;s always a joy to use it.</li>
    <li> Buy this. Use this. Enjoy the tingly scalp and the extra body and movement in your hair. About a quarter-size of this mask will be sufficient for shoulder-length hair. Leave it on for 5 minutes or so. I love this. 8 ounces will go a long way! :)</li>
    <li> I love this product; it has a great peppermint smell and really perks up my hair. It&#x27;s a great treatment.</li>
    <li> I blow dry and straighten almost on a daily basis, and this product has brought life, shine and softness back to my hair after only 2 uses! A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my head feel so good! And the smell is so nice! It does moisturize my hair but I&#x27;m not sure that it is that much better than normal conditioners but I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and the sweet smell and awesome feeling on my scalp make it worth the money to me!</li>
    <li> Very good product! It leaves your hair smooth, shiny and silky. It smells really nice. I love it and I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair but I don&#x27;t understand all the great reviews for this.  My hair looked terrible after using this, dry, lifeless, and frizzy.  It does smell okay.</li>
    <li> While there was no dramatic improvement in just one use, I have used it 4 times now. I am sticking to a 2-3 times a week  schedule, and I have seen a big improvement in my hair. It is definitely softer, and my frizz has actually improved! That right there was amazing in and of itself. The shine factor is not very noticeable, but honestly the softness and lack of excessive frizz has me sold on this product. I will be buying a new one the moment I run low on my current little tub. The package looks small, but it has a lot in it.</li>
    <li> now i&#x27;m a curly girl and shouldn&#x27;t be using anything with sodium laurate, but i do. tsk tsk. This is great stuff for that once a week moisturizing conditioner you need. i love the smell and i love the thickness of it. Sometimes my hair is too moisturized from this that my curls don&#x27;t set properly. But i love it as a 1x per week or 2 week thang.</li>
    <li> I started using Tigi Treat Me Right mask to help with an extremely itchy scalp.  The peppermint cools the scalp and is a great non-medicated choice to relieve the itches.  I have fine hair that is permed, and this mask conditions my hair without leaving it limp or greasy.  As I only wash my hair twice a week, I use the mask about twice a month.  The jar lasts a very long time, and is something I will always keep on hand.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great for cooling down in the hot summer, although it does a good job of conditioning my unruly, coarse hair year round. Leave it on for three minutes, until the scalp is wonderfully tingly, then rinse it out and notice how nice and cool your scalp feels in summer.</li>
    <li> this stuff just flat out sucked!  No moisture at all!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before a couple years ago. It feels so amazing when using in the shower. It left my hair so soft and shiny only after using it for two weeks. And call me crazy but I did notice my hair grew a little bit faster with this!! (The peppermint really does stimulate your scalp) I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore :( really wish I knew why when this is a great hair product. If you&#x27;re a skeptic about this, just try it... let the results speak for themselves!!</li>
    <li> Makes ur hair feel soft and minty fresh. Such an awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;Couldnt go wrong and make ur hair so shiny especially with people with damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh tingly feeling it gives my scalp, especially when dry winter set in. It leaves my hair soft and curly without weighing it down. All that and it smells great. I think Tigi has stopped making this product-- so sad</li>
    <li> I notice a difference in my hair the days I use this. Also like the tingly feeling of the mint!!</li>
    <li> Great product, would diffenetly purcase again!&lt;br /&gt;Would also recomend to others, can&#x27;t stand my hair without it!  I love Amazon it is my good habbit!</li>
    <li> My daughter has trouble with her scalp being really dry.  She uses this just once per week and it helps alot.  She is not particularly fond of the smell but it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for years and never used it and found it and thought I&#x27;d give it another chance. I love how when you massage it into your scalp, your scalp becomes cool and tingly. It rinses out real clean and my hair is super easy to comb out. I love this product and just bought 2 more so I can give one to my sister.</li>
    <li> This hair mask is amazing! I use and so does my husband.  Be prepared for a kick.  It feels so great when rinse away with a cold shower</li>
    <li> I love this stuff didn&#x27;t give my hair a problem but only made it look shiny and healthy. I do recommend this product. ^__^</li>
