      <li>The cap works great compared to others I have ordered also.  </li>
      <li>they work great.</li>
      <li>was from Georgia so thats good too.</li>
      <li>had none of the problems others have mentioned, all my bottles droppers &amp; lids fit together perfectly, they do come in three parts so have to fix them together</li>
      <li>They work really good too.</li>
      <li>Nice bottles great price</li>
      <li>Just what I was looking for, at a good price delivered to my door &amp; a portion of the purchase went to my favorite cause NORML</li>
      <li>But the ones I recieved are leak free and good to go.</li>
      <li>it IS too good to be true.</li>
      <li>Bible seem very cheap.</li>
      <li>- what more could ya ask for.</li>
      <li>They hold more like 60.  </li>
      <li>I have been really pleased with my purchase</li>
      <li>but  this was my first go and gave it a shot for the Price which was good shipping</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m looking for better quality bottles made in the good old USA.</li>
      <li>The caps screw down perfectly and have never leaked on me.</li>
      <li>I waited the full 28 days for the product to get the free shipping discount.</li>
      <li>I have gone through about half of these bottles and so far all of them have been perfect.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Not on all the bottles but most of them when you try to tighten the lid it get really crooked and looks cheap</li>
      <li>I am glad I did not waste a bunch of money on faster shipping.</li>
      <li>These are great little bottles!  </li>
      <li>On a positive note the shipping was quick for being from china.</li>
      <li>thing that would make them better is a larger opening to fill them.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>First couple of times I purchased</li>
      <li>If you are doing the same id recommend investing in some better ones.</li>
      <li>They started to take forever to arrive and the quality is pure junk with most failing to properly seal.</li>
      <li>Great bottles only issues I have with them is the drip tip is too wide.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping time was pretty fast considering they come by China Post.</li>
      <li>This order came very quickly so we will see what happens with my next one.  </li>
      <li>the dropper spout is to large for E liquid</li>
      <li>My only negative would be that they are more like 50ml bottles which does cost me on my side unless I charge more for my product.  </li>
      <li>liquid ok if you do not use the dropper nozzle so if you need little bottles to store liquid in an upright position (moving them around too much may cause leakage) than this maybe a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so you may get a dozen or so decently working bottles in the bunch.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but thats not hard</li>
      <li>There are other bottles available on amazon</li>
      <li>Well most of it got here seems the bag had a small rip when it reached me.</li>
      <li>They are okay but wish it was different because it seems to leak a little.</li>
      <li>them completely going around.</li>
      <li>basic flimsy chinese plastic might have been aceptable in a small shop or personal mixing, i need bottles that look good.</li>
      <li>It is worth noting that the dropper tips needed some pressure to seat fully and the lids required a bit of pressure themselves when seating due to the tamper-evident seal.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually even gotten better quality from eBay sellers in the past.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve actually even gotten better quality from eBay sellers in the past.</li>
<li> Drip caps will not snap on tightly and the caps cross thread on the very soft plastic bottles.</li>
<li> These bottles are the cheapest piece of crap, the caps on the top of the bottles split by barely pushing them on which causes the e-liquid I sell to pour all over the place not good for someone trying to start a Business.</li>
<li> you cant tighten all the way down with out</li>
<li> Half the bottles</li>
<li> /&gt;-the parts do not fit together well&lt;</li>
<li> /&gt;-poorly fabricated, the seams of the plastic parts have to be trimmed because they are sloppily molded.&lt;br /&gt;-Once</li>
<li> The dropper plugs do not fit tight enough inside the bottles, so they are useless to me.</li>
<li> I usually just re-order as soon as I get one of the orders in.</li>
<li> They are a little on the thin side and there are some instances where there are mold marks and incomplete deburring, but it is not a significant issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My one complaint is that the droper tubes sometimes needed to be poked out with a pin.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the negative comments and reviews</li>
<li> The product I had inside the bottles was thicker than water, but not so thick that it should have shot out.</li>
<li> have to buy a very small funnel to fill these, but price was reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
<li> So half the bottles are useless.</li>
<li> these are not much good for anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Fir the ones that did work, they were poorly manufactured.</li>
<li> These did have the locking seal cap but once seal broken</li>
<li> These are very thin and will not seal.</li>
<li> I dont know why everyones writting bad reviews.</li>
<li> What a disappointment!</li>
<li> But that is stupid.</li>

    <li> these are not much good for anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;-They do not come pre-assembled&lt;br /&gt;-the parts do not fit together well&lt;br /&gt;-poorly fabricated, the seams of the plastic parts have to be trimmed because they are sloppily molded.&lt;br /&gt;-Once the dropper is installed in the bottle the cap no longer fits without leaking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;- you get 50 for the price so you may get a dozen or so decently working bottles in the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;-they hold liquid ok if you do not use the dropper nozzle so if you need little bottles to store liquid in an upright position (moving them around too much may cause leakage) than this maybe a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping time was pretty fast considering they come by China Post. There are other bottles available on amazon I would try before buying these. I&#x27;ve actually even gotten better quality from eBay sellers in the past. Don&#x27;t get sucked in by the price...it IS too good to be true.</li>
    <li> I dont know why everyones writting bad reviews. Shipping takes a month but thats the only flaw. I bought these as i make juice for ecigs. They work really good too. Especially for the price</li>
    <li> Worked great for what I needed. paint mixture for airbursh</li>
    <li> Half the bottles you cant tighten all the way down with out them completely going around. So half the bottles are useless. Fir the ones that did work, they were poorly manufactured. Lots of the pieces had big pieces of plastic hanging from them. I use them to store e-liquid. If you are doing the same id recommend investing in some better ones. Buyer beware. On a positive note the shipping was quick for being from china.</li>
    <li> Extremely thin and cheap bottles that i COULD OF ORDERED FROM CHINA MYSELF IF I WANTED TO WAIT A MONTH TO GET</li>
    <li> The 30 ml bottles are perfect for mixing &amp; storing my e-juice experiments. They hold enough mixture to last for months.</li>
    <li> Product works as specified</li>
    <li> Great bottles only issues I have with them is the drip tip is too wide.</li>
    <li> The bottles are a very good value when you consider the price.  They are a little on the thin side and there are some instances where there are mold marks and incomplete deburring, but it is not a significant issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any of the problems reported by others with the dropper tips not staying seated or the lids failing to seal.  It is worth noting that the dropper tips needed some pressure to seat fully and the lids required a bit of pressure themselves when seating due to the tamper-evident seal.  If the seal was removed, they screwed on quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again; in fact I just bought a package of the 10ml bottles as well.</li>
    <li> They are okay but wish it was different because it seems to leak a little.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 20ml size bottles not realising they were from China, it was approx 18 days from order to delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I had none of the problems others have mentioned, all my bottles droppers &amp; lids fit together perfectly, they do come in three parts so have to fix them together but thats not hard work.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with my purchase &amp; would buy again from here.</li>
    <li> These have tamper-resistant caps with a breakaway ring to indicate tampering. They are *not* child-proof / resistant caps that require downward pressure to operate.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> They did the job they were supposed to do. My one complaint is that the droper tubes sometimes needed to be poked out with a pin.</li>
    <li> They are as described and work great.  I like the bigger nozzle opening compared to others.  They pour faster.  The cap works great compared to others I have ordered also.  Definitely worth the money.  I was paying about 56 cents a piece and these with shipping only cost me 22 cents a piece.  When you deal in quantity and need quality this is a great bottle to order.  Perfect for e juice</li>
    <li> Nice bottles great price the dropper spout is to large for E liquid my fault but I received what I purchased thank you</li>
    <li> These bottles are the cheapest piece of crap, the caps on the top of the bottles split by barely pushing them on which causes the e-liquid I sell to pour all over the place not good for someone trying to start a Business. Embarrassment I will never purchase made in China bottles again so I&#x27;m looking for better quality bottles made in the good old USA.</li>
    <li> Not on all the bottles but most of them when you try to tighten the lid it get really crooked and looks cheap</li>
    <li> The price ans size of these bottles was what I was looking for, however The dropper plug shot out when I was squeezing the product I had it in out. The product I had inside the bottles was thicker than water, but not so thick that it should have shot out. The dropper plugs do not fit tight enough inside the bottles, so they are useless to me. I waited the full 28 days for the product to get the free shipping discount. I am glad I did not waste a bunch of money on faster shipping. What a disappointment!</li>
    <li> I have gone through about half of these bottles and so far all of them have been perfect. The caps screw down perfectly and have never leaked on me. Will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> These bottles are perfect for e-juice storing and filling cartomizers. if you are looking for e-juice bottles, these are the ones, just don&#x27;t expect them tomorrow, they ship from china.</li>
    <li> I have been really pleased with my purchase and I have re-ordered.  My only negative would be that they are more like 50ml bottles which does cost me on my side unless I charge more for my product.  Something I would rather not do.  This order came very quickly so we will see what happens with my next one.  I do understand that it is international shipping and that can be a problem if your in a hurry.  I usually just re-order as soon as I get one of the orders in.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize they had the locking ring on them, I was happy about that. awesome, good product and I will buy again</li>
    <li> if youre going to distribute ejuice id say keep shopping but  this was my first go and gave it a shot for the Price which was good shipping was from Georgia so thats good too. basic flimsy chinese plastic might have been aceptable in a small shop or personal mixing, i need bottles that look good. so this gets three stars just for the shipping</li>
    <li> I have ordered these several times and it is always a mixed bag. First couple of times I purchased I couldn&#x27;t believe the negative comments and reviews but I now see why people are complaining. They started to take forever to arrive and the quality is pure junk with most failing to properly seal. I will be looking for something elsewhere.</li>
    <li> These are very thin and will not seal. Drip caps will not snap on tightly and the caps cross thread on the very soft plastic bottles.</li>
    <li> Received the 50, 30ml bottles just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that would make them better is a larger opening to fill them.&lt;br /&gt;Will have to buy a very small funnel to fill these, but price was reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> These are great little bottles!  These are a three piece design, consisting of the bottle, a snap-in nozzle and a screw-on cap.  I received my order in relatively short time (considering these were sent from China).  All 50 pieces were 100% intact, with no defects or damage.  I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Only reason why not 5 star is I thought these were child lock caps. These did have the locking seal cap but once seal broken the cap doesn&#x27;t lock. Would recommend seller</li>
    <li> The bottles I received were not 30ml.  They hold more like 60.  Don&#x27;t buy if you are looking 30ml.</li>
    <li> Well most of it got here seems the bag had a small rip when it reached me. But the ones I recieved are leak free and good to go.</li>
    <li> The three components will not assemble and not leak.  If you want to keep the \\&quot;dropper\\&quot; piece seperate from the cap and bottle it will work.  But that is stupid.</li>
    <li> just what the doctor ordered. they work great.</li>
    <li> Bible seem very cheap.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, at a good price delivered to my door &amp; a portion of the purchase went to my favorite cause NORML - what more could ya ask for.</li>
