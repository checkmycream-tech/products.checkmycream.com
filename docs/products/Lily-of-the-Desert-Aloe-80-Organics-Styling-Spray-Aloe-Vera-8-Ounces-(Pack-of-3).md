      <li>This is perfect.</li>
      <li>I have used it on damp hair while styling with a blow dryer and it works great!</li>
      <li>Works great, no buildup.</li>
      <li>Great unscented hairspray.  </li>
      <li>Not matter what reconstructor you use on your hair or how great the conditioner, as soon as the hair shaft is damaged that damage is permanent.     </li>
      <li>Great stuff.  </li>
      <li>Also, no alcohol, which is great because it will not leach the color out of my \\&quot;Naturtint\\&quot; colored hair.  </li>
      <li>Oh and also being able to order on line is the best!</li>
      <li>Really good product.</li>
      <li>If you absolutely can&#x27;t handle any scents or smells, this is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>Really the best I&#x27;ve EVER used.  </li>
      <li>Heck, you&#x27;ll love it even if you love perfumed stuff because it&#x27;s a great pump style hairspray.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re fragrance sensitive you&#x27;ll be very happy with this hairspray.</li>
      <li>Lily of the Desert offers up this excellent styling spray.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect hairspray for a very light, natural hold with flexibility.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love that it is organic and it works.</li>
      <li>I just love this product...</li>
      <li>In trying to get and keep my family healthy, I have switched to organics whenever I can get/find them.</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>But on the whole, a great product.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find it online.</li>
      <li>I am pleased that  organics are doing the job better for me than the plastics and chemicals in many nonorganic products.</li>
      <li>When he ran out, he used some cheap junk before I could get more ordered.</li>
      <li>This is absolutely odorless, never clogs, and provides good hold.</li>
      <li>My mom loved it so much when she used some while visiting us that I ordered her a 3 pack for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
      <li>I spray it on when my hair is drying and it gives light hold and bounce.</li>
      <li>This is the best hairspray I have found with mostly natural ingredients, and it gives a medium to strong hold with no white residue.</li>
      <li>Good product, one of the only water-based hair sprays available, for those who don&#x27;t like spraying alcohol on their hair and around their face.</li>
      <li>This hairspray has good ingredients but it leaves my hair very flat and oily looking.</li>
      <li>My local Whole Foods stopped carrying this great product.</li>
      <li>This is great for everyday hairstyles, but for a special occasion, a stronger-holding spray might be needed.</li>
      <li>It helped some, but in the process, I found this hairspray to be the best non-alcohol hairspray available, that actually holds your hair in place, without making your hair feel like a hard hat.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery and well packaged!</li>
      <li>If you run hot water over the spray nozzle after use, it will help the spray nozzle not to clog.   </li>
      <li>I love this product so much that I ordered 6 bottles total!</li>
      <li>Most \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; hairsprays have alcohol in them (this one doesn&#x27;t), and we&#x27;ve discovered that even alcohol gives off enough of a scent to really bother my husband.</li>
      <li>I have to make sure my hair is completely dry before spraying it or it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold well</li>
      <li>This is the only unscented/fragrance free hairspray I&#x27;ve tried that really does not have a scent.</li>
      <li>It really does the job without all the junk and stink of comparable products.</li>
      <li>This hairspray does a reasonable job of holding my hair.</li>
      <li>It works really well on all hair types and styles.  </li>
      <li>There is no scent, really.</li>
      <li>I find I have to wash them down more often.</li>
      <li>The main issue I have is with the spray nozzle, tends to clog.    </li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>(For me, that&#x27;s a small trade-off to finally be able to use hairspray again.)</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff like a helmet, and it washes out easily.</li>
      <li>My husband and I both use this all natural product for spray hair gel.  </li>
      <li>For me, it works better than other products I have tried to minimally keep my hair in place for the day.</li>
      <li>When my eyes started getting sensitive to various things, I had to change my hairspray to one that did not contain alcohol.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband and I both use this all natural product for spray hair gel.  It works really well on all hair types and styles.  Just use as regular gel.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect hairspray for a very light, natural hold with flexibility.  It has no smell or alcohol in it, which is what I like.  This is great for everyday hairstyles, but for a special occasion, a stronger-holding spray might be needed.</li>
    <li> I  have used this product exclusively for over a year now. It really does the job without all the junk and stink of comparable products. I spray it on when my hair is drying and it gives light hold and bounce. If I put my hair up I can spray it on closer and heavier, and I get a stronger hold. I really love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Really the best I&#x27;ve EVER used.  It is a medium hold without a scent and with no sticky feel.  I do not like a scent in hairspray, I&#x27;d rather not have it compete with any perfumes I wear.  Also, no alcohol, which is great because it will not leach the color out of my \\&quot;Naturtint\\&quot; colored hair.  I also like the organic ingredients. If you run hot water over the spray nozzle after use, it will help the spray nozzle not to clog.   I am pleased that  organics are doing the job better for me than the plastics and chemicals in many nonorganic products.</li>
    <li> I just love this product...NO ALCOHOL...what can I say...try it and you will feel the difference.  Oh and also being able to order on line is the best! Fast delivery and well packaged!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. A redness began around his hairline. I was concerned because of all the junk he&#x27;s used on his hair. In trying to get and keep my family healthy, I have switched to organics whenever I can get/find them. This includes skin and hair. After using this product for a few months, not only did the redness begin to fade, it did finally go away. When he ran out, he used some cheap junk before I could get more ordered. The redness returned. SOLD.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray I have found with mostly natural ingredients, and it gives a medium to strong hold with no white residue. There is no scent, really.</li>
    <li> Alcohol is really bad for your hair. It dries it out leaving it open to severe breakage. Not matter what reconstructor you use on your hair or how great the conditioner, as soon as the hair shaft is damaged that damage is permanent.     Lily of the Desert offers up this excellent styling spray. It gives the hair a ton of hold without weighing it down. I don&#x27;t know if it will work on all hair textures but it does the job on mine. The smell is little to non-existent. The main issue I have is with the spray nozzle, tends to clog.    But on the whole, a great product.</li>
    <li> Great unscented hairspray.  My mom loved it so much when she used some while visiting us that I ordered her a 3 pack for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> Good product, one of the only water-based hair sprays available, for those who don&#x27;t like spraying alcohol on their hair and around their face.</li>
    <li> This is the only unscented/fragrance free hairspray I&#x27;ve tried that really does not have a scent. Most \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; hairsprays have alcohol in them (this one doesn&#x27;t), and we&#x27;ve discovered that even alcohol gives off enough of a scent to really bother my husband. This hairspray does a reasonable job of holding my hair. I have to make sure my hair is completely dry before spraying it or it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold well (that may be because my hair is very thick). If I comb or run my fingers through my hair after applying it, I find I need to spray my hair again. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff like a helmet, and it washes out easily. When I spray it, it does leave a sticky residue on the bathroom floor, counter and walls. I find I have to wash them down more often. (For me, that&#x27;s a small trade-off to finally be able to use hairspray again.) If you absolutely can&#x27;t handle any scents or smells, this is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> My local Whole Foods stopped carrying this great product. Thank god for Amazon. If you&#x27;re fragrance sensitive you&#x27;ll be very happy with this hairspray. Heck, you&#x27;ll love it even if you love perfumed stuff because it&#x27;s a great pump style hairspray. Holds well &amp; it&#x27;s not sticky.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff, but I only paid 8.69! Look around 1st, you can find it priced lower.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  So hard to find a spray gel that&#x27;s unscented and not gooey, heavy.  This is perfect.</li>
    <li> This hairspray has good ingredients but it leaves my hair very flat and oily looking.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much that I ordered 6 bottles total! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like standard hairsprays and styling products. My hair holds its style without being sticky. I have used it on damp hair while styling with a blow dryer and it works great! I ordered a supply to assure I would have it should they decide not to produce it anymore.....like with their Rosemary &amp; Lemon Shampoo and Conditioner. Wish I had known it was going to be discontinued, darn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Amazon Prime had it delivered on time, as usual. I shouldn&#x27;t have to order for a while, but will as needed.</li>
    <li> Have used this for several years but the two places I could buy it stopped carrying it. I was glad to find it online. For me, it works better than other products I have tried to minimally keep my hair in place for the day.</li>
    <li> Works great, no buildup. Love that it is organic and it works. Granted, you don&#x27;t get the same &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; as you would from a sticky, chemical laden product, but I don&#x27;t want that anyway!</li>
    <li> I have trouble with scented hair spray. This is absolutely odorless, never clogs, and provides good hold. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> When my eyes started getting sensitive to various things, I had to change my hairspray to one that did not contain alcohol.  It helped some, but in the process, I found this hairspray to be the best non-alcohol hairspray available, that actually holds your hair in place, without making your hair feel like a hard hat.  Really good product.</li>
