### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but you still don&#x27;t smell its the best ive come across</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>is the best container for it imo.</li>
      <li>The shipping was the festest I had ever experienced too, wonderful customer service!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve been happy for 5 mos).  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great</li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>But I want to smell good.</li>
      <li>Good:  </li>
      <li>I have been very pleased with the results and have given some samples to family.  </li>
      <li>ordered some more of this for me it works great.</li>
      <li>Love the deodorant product!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice</li>
      <li>kind</li>
      <li>I guess i will keep trying to find the perfect natural deodorant to hold me.</li>
      <li>but if you leave for office work at 7AM be sure to get to where you can bathe and reapply by 7PM.</li>
      <li>I like this tottle better than the jar version.</li>
      <li>Ok, so this makes all three types that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t perfect, but it works well enough for days I am at home and won&#x27;t be doing anything that will produce a lot of sweat.</li>
      <li>They both seem to work better than the roll on.</li>
      <li>way better than the tub just shake before use</li>
      <li>Fantastic stuff!</li>
      <li>The customer service from DeodoMom is simply phenomenal-</li>
      <li>(the jar would presumably be even more environmentally friendly, and reusable for something afterwards)</li>
      <li>I was given the DeodoMom jar as a gift, which I liked very much even though I didn&#x27;t care for dipping my fingers into the cream to get out of the jar.  </li>
      <li>Once I get rid of that its fine.  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Also, I noticed I smell more quickly with the product in the tottle, compared to the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The trial size is great, and I will most likely get a full size one, or the cream</li>
      <li>but, this little bottle is perfect for travel.</li>
      <li>So far this is the best natural deodorant I have tried.  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s with any metallic free deodorant.</li>
      <li>Its light, scent free, and works for over 8 hours.</li>
      <li>The only thing that is not that great is the fact that you have to apply it with your hand.  </li>
      <li>I consider the tottle is a very smart design which is an important factor for me to reorder it for many times</li>
      <li>I really like that I don&#x27;t have to deal with unscrewing and screwing the top of the jar and that I don&#x27;t have to dig my finger in to get to the cream.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worthy of a star!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found out I was pregnant at the end of November</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple other products and this is by far the BEST!</li>
      <li>Yes I know good for the planet and saves money but a very plain white bottle with almost no label and no logo, that looks like it was filled in an apartment doesn&#x27;t give me a great feeling about the conditions under which it was made.  </li>
      <li>This really works!!</li>
      <li>then you get a sweaty scent but not a run ya out of the elevator funk more of a sweaty child&#x27;s sweat and for me considering how I can clear a room if I just tighten a screw without deodorant</li>
      <li>However, the longer I used this cream deodorant, the more blemishes I developed.  </li>
      <li>The two do a pretty good job at keeping me dry and smell-free.</li>
      <li>My first two days on the new deodorant were easy days though, and I could STILL smell a hint of b.o. five hours after applying.</li>
      <li>The jar form is a true cream and dries much quicker than the more fluid version.</li>
      <li>but when it comes to something I put on or eat I need to see the exact conditions under which the item is made stored.  </li>
      <li>It does seem to be the same consistency as the jar, which I like a lot better than the roll on.  </li>
      <li>Works very well for me!</li>
      <li>My job is physically demanding most days, so I do plenty of sweating.</li>
      <li>I feel fine about using this for the weeks leading up to when my labor will presumably take place and am not afraid I will disgust those around me in my daily life, or the L &amp; D nurses (well, not with my armpits anyway).</li>
      <li>apparently need fragrance free deodorant for labor so that strong fragrances don&#x27;t confuse the baby when she first tries to breastfeed, and once I started thinking about that, I got quite obsessive about finding the most additive-free thing possible that wouldn&#x27;t require me to go wet a Pit Rock (which are also great, as long as you haven&#x27;t just shaved...)</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin and no reactions at all.</li>
      <li>I decided to try the squeeze bottle, but have found it too runny (therefore less effective).  </li>
      <li>Being pregnant makes you extremely sensitive to smells and this product has zero fragrance, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>The roll on doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m finally aluminum free with deodorant.</li>
      <li>For health reasons, I have been on a quest to find an aluminum-free deodorant that eliminates odor for the whole day.  </li>
      <li>It really does work the tottle</li>
      <li>However, I much prefer the thicker consistency of the product in the jar.</li>
      <li>It is much easier to squeeze it onto your fingers than to scoop it from a jar where it gets under your fingernails.</li>
      <li>I am so happy to have finally found a natural deodorant that not only works, but lasts long, is not harmful in any way and is very reasonably priced!  </li>
      <li>Im a big cruelty free purchaser, and many of the other crueltyfree/natural deodorants i tried just didnt cut it.  </li>
      <li>, I highly recommend it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This deodorant, despite its negatives, did eliminate body odor for nearly the whole day.  </li>
      <li>I may not be putting enough on, so I will keep experimenting with it to see if I get it right.</li>
      <li>The tottle is much better but it would be even better if we didn&#x27;t have to get our hands dirty at all.</li>
      <li>At first, I thought that my reaction was some sort of delayed reaction from the last product I had tried.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Since this product doesn&#x27;t come from a firm with a reputable major history to its credit they need to spell out everything they do and include in their merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Again, since I&#x27;m pregnant, my hormones are changing and I&#x27;m not positive the change in consistency from jar to tottle</li>
      <li>I have tried all kinds of natural deodorant and none of them work.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is the only &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that really works for me.</li>
      <li>After years and years of searching for a natural deodorant that works--</li>
      <li>Lately I have read articles that maybe the crystal is not so safe after all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find a natural deodorant that works, and DeodoMom is showing a lot of promise</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with Lush&#x27;s coconut powder.  </li>
      <li>I have only used this product for two days now but so far no reaction, no odor, and no sweat!</li>
      <li>I have tried so many natural deodorants in the past that either didn&#x27;t work at all, didn&#x27;t last long or still had some sort of ingredient that caused irritation or discomfort.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t like bare bones packaging.  </li>
      <li>I totally recommend this product to anyone who can&#x27;t use regular deodorant and is looking for a natural option.  </li>
      <li>No other products, used before or after the DeodoMom brand, have caused such a reaction.  </li>
      <li>I have been pairing this with the deodorant powder from Lush cosmetics, which helps to keep my pit dry.</li>
      <li>That isn&#x27;t to say it&#x27;s a nuisance, but the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is really more of a thick liquid that can (and often did) drip down my side or onto my clothes before I could transfer it from fingers to underarm.  </li>

<li> I was hoping pure water and just magnesium could indeed go on broken skin</li>
<li> It was the only ingredient that helped odors but no matter how little i used, i reacted.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Yep. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apparently need fragrance free deodorant for labor so that strong fragrances don&#x27;t confuse the baby when she first tries to breastfeed, and once I started thinking about that, I got quite obsessive about finding the most additive-free thing possible that wouldn&#x27;t require me to go wet a Pit Rock (which are also great, as long as you haven&#x27;t just shaved...) in the middle of labor. I feel fine about using this for the weeks leading up to when my labor will presumably take place and am not afraid I will disgust those around me in my daily life, or the L &amp; D nurses (well, not with my armpits anyway). The trial size is great, and I will most likely get a full size one, or the cream (the jar would presumably be even more environmentally friendly, and reusable for something afterwards)</li>
    <li> Five stars.  This ended a long search for a product my husband could use.</li>
    <li> Been using this deodorant for almost a year. Great product. The roll on doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; very well. Finally, tried this cream version and it&#x27;s bit messier but works just as well. I&#x27;ll continue to use this as long as it works for me.</li>
    <li> I tried some samples of this product in the roll on.  I have been very pleased with the results and have given some samples to family.  I intend to switch to this!  It&#x27;s nice knowing I&#x27;m finally aluminum free with deodorant.</li>
    <li> DeodoMom tottle came in a liquid form which I found very hard to apply. I was expecting it to be a cream deodorant instead.</li>
    <li> Love the deodorant product!  I thought I&#x27;d try the tottle applicator, but after using, decided I&#x27;m not a fan of it. I don&#x27;t like that the deodorant residue always seems to dry around the cap opening in little white crumbly bits. I&#x27;ve now tried the jar, the roll-on and the tottle versions and for me, the roll-on applicator is my preference.</li>
    <li> In fact my pits stunk worse. I started just putting a bit of coconut oil and it works wonders, I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great I wanted to get away from all the chemicals in the store bought brands and found this after reading reviews. It works great and I intend to use for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered some more of this for me it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every natural deodorant from the US to Canada and they&#x27;ve either failed to stop stink or they irritate me like mad and that includes all of the &amp;#34;crystals&amp;#34; and the coconut ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I meant to get the roll on but accidentally bought the cream in the bottle form they call the Tottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on just about everything with vinyl gloves so having the cream on my fingers was no issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the cream remains wet feeling though if I do tap my underarms yes indeed it is actually damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did find was NO Skin irritation and I&#x27;m a psoriasis guttate eczema allergic nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odor is controlled for about 12 hours then you get a sweaty scent but not a run ya out of the elevator funk more of a sweaty child&#x27;s sweat and for me considering how I can clear a room if I just tighten a screw without deodorant, this is dang good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three drawbacks in my consideration:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like bare bones packaging.  Yes I know good for the planet and saves money but a very plain white bottle with almost no label and no logo, that looks like it was filled in an apartment doesn&#x27;t give me a great feeling about the conditions under which it was made.  I do support small businesses and the cottage industry but when it comes to something I put on or eat I need to see the exact conditions under which the item is made stored.  I don&#x27;t know what the operations at 30some weeks looks like.  The website doesn&#x27;t show that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all deodorants this one says Do Not Use On Broken Skin.  What the devil do you use on broken skin then as broken skin smells just as bad if not worse than unbroken skin.  This I realize is just my personal dilemma and hopefully not any of yours.  I was hoping pure water and just magnesium could indeed go on broken skin but it burned there, like any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third though the main ingredients are Water and Magnesium there is indication that a few other chemicalsare used but the too tiny to read label doesn&#x27;t spell out what the those Other ingredients are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product doesn&#x27;t come from a firm with a reputable major history to its credit they need to spell out everything they do and include in their merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend this? Yes... but if you leave for office work at 7AM be sure to get to where you can bathe and reapply by 7PM. For physically demanding occupations and overtime to boot maybe just leave this for your days off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has Zero Fragrance</li>
    <li> In an effort to steer clear of tons of nasty chemicals i have been making my own deodorant for a while. I have always used baking soda in my recipes. It was the only ingredient that helped odors but no matter how little i used, i reacted.  Im a big cruelty free purchaser, and many of the other crueltyfree/natural deodorants i tried just didnt cut it.  I have only used this product for two days now but so far no reaction, no odor, and no sweat! I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Ok, so this makes all three types that I&#x27;ve tried.  I really like that I don&#x27;t have to deal with unscrewing and screwing the top of the jar and that I don&#x27;t have to dig my finger in to get to the cream.  Bad things about this container is that there does tend to be a little bit of watery residue at the opening every morning. Once I get rid of that its fine.  It does seem to be the same consistency as the jar, which I like a lot better than the roll on.  Formula seems to be the same.  I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with Lush&#x27;s coconut powder.  The two do a pretty good job at keeping me dry and smell-free.</li>
    <li> So far this is the best natural deodorant I have tried.  I consider the tottle is a very smart design which is an important factor for me to reorder it for many times</li>
    <li> Today was my third day using this product, and I&#x27;m not really impressed. My job is physically demanding most days, so I do plenty of sweating. My first two days on the new deodorant were easy days though, and I could STILL smell a hint of b.o. five hours after applying. Today was a hard day at work, so obviously, my b.o. smell was pretty noticeable. I&#x27;m just confused... people everywhere are raving about this stuff, but I can&#x27;t see why. :/ I must have mutant armpits.</li>
    <li> The tottle type of squeeze bottle, dispenses similar to a shampoo bottle, allows application without contaminating the rest of the product.  This form of deodorant is supposed to be a cream but is very fluid, unlike their other product that is packaged in jar.  The jar form is a true cream and dries much quicker than the more fluid version.</li>
    <li> I was using the crystal because I thought it was less toxic than the regular deodorants/antiperspirants on the market. Lately I have read articles that maybe the crystal is not so safe after all. Who knows, there is no proof. I don&#x27;t want to wait around till they get proof so I tried DeodoMom. Put it on in the morning, went about my day, got all sweaty but guess what? Not stinky! We are supposed to sweat and that&#x27;s fine. But I want to smell good. This works for me. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find a natural deodorant that works, and DeodoMom is showing a lot of promise (I&#x27;ve been happy for 5 mos).  I was given the DeodoMom jar as a gift, which I liked very much even though I didn&#x27;t care for dipping my fingers into the cream to get out of the jar.  I decided to try the squeeze bottle, but have found it too runny (therefore less effective).  I&#x27;ll be going back to the jar, and trying other ways to scoop it from the jar. I have been pairing this with the deodorant powder from Lush cosmetics, which helps to keep my pit dry.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t keep me from smelling. I guess i will keep trying to find the perfect natural deodorant to hold me.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of natural deodorant and none of them work.  I am always so self-conscious at work when I have to work close to someone else but not with this.  I totally recommend this product to anyone who can&#x27;t use regular deodorant and is looking for a natural option.  The only thing that is not that great is the fact that you have to apply it with your hand.  But I had the jar before and that was really messy.  The tottle is much better but it would be even better if we didn&#x27;t have to get our hands dirty at all.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t perfect, but it works well enough for days I am at home and won&#x27;t be doing anything that will produce a lot of sweat. I may not be putting enough on, so I will keep experimenting with it to see if I get it right.</li>
    <li> I have been using DeodoMom brand deodorant since November 2013. Previously I was using the product in the jar, but I have just recently switched to the tottle form for less mess and more convenience. However, I much prefer the thicker consistency of the product in the jar. Also, I noticed I smell more quickly with the product in the tottle, compared to the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I gave this review 5 stars for 5 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. I found out I was pregnant at the end of November and I was relieved that my deodorant was not causing harm to my growing baby.&lt;br /&gt;2. Being pregnant makes you extremely sensitive to smells and this product has zero fragrance, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;3. Again, since I&#x27;m pregnant, my hormones are changing and I&#x27;m not positive the change in consistency from jar to tottle is what&#x27;s allowing my funk to seep through. It might just be hormonal changes.&lt;br /&gt;4. After years and years of searching for a natural deodorant that works-- This one is the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;5. The customer service from DeodoMom is simply phenomenal- Personal, responsive and just plain kind hearted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps to make your decision a little easier!</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff! Works without allergic reaction when nothing else in the world would!</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have finally found a natural deodorant that not only works, but lasts long, is not harmful in any way and is very reasonably priced!  I plan to get this for all my friends and will be a life long user.  Just wish I found it sooner.  I have tried so many natural deodorants in the past that either didn&#x27;t work at all, didn&#x27;t last long or still had some sort of ingredient that caused irritation or discomfort.  The shipping was the festest I had ever experienced too, wonderful customer service!</li>
    <li> I use the roll-on version at home but, this little bottle is perfect for travel. And, it works just as well as the roll-on version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried DeodoMom, I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;It is the only &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that really works for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I had a problem with shipping, although I had ordered several times without any problems, and Deodomom resolved it immediately! This is definitely a product I will continue to order. I&#x27;m undecided about whether I prefer the tottle bottle or the cream. They both seem to work better than the roll on.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice it, unless I run out and have to use something else for a few days - then I wonder why I suddenly smell so bad?? This really works!!</li>
    <li> way better than the tub just shake before use and it lasts me for months! it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet and is not an anti-perspirant but you still don&#x27;t smell its the best ive come across and ive tried um all and almost just gave up hope!</li>
    <li> For health reasons, I have been on a quest to find an aluminum-free deodorant that eliminates odor for the whole day.  I tried so hard to like this deodorant and used it exclusively for an entire month.  This is the third product I have tried in the &amp;#34;natural deodorant&amp;#34; category and, unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:  This deodorant, despite its negatives, did eliminate body odor for nearly the whole day.  Given its surprisingly simple ingredient list, I have to say that it performed well when it came to eliminating odor.  I did work out a couple of times using this (that is, I worked out to the point of sweating through my shirt), and it performed a little less well due to all of the moisture.  However, I still didn&#x27;t stink up the room.  Definitely worthy of a star!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Not-So-Good:  This is a bit awkward to put on and takes some getting used to.  That isn&#x27;t to say it&#x27;s a nuisance, but the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is really more of a thick liquid that can (and often did) drip down my side or onto my clothes before I could transfer it from fingers to underarm.  It also requires longer to dry than I had hoped, but again this wasn&#x27;t to the point of being a nuisance.  It just takes some getting used to.  By the end, I could apply it without making a mess and I had altered my morning routine to include the drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:  Despite the hypoallergenic/non-comedogenic claims, I reacted to it.  At first, I thought that my reaction was some sort of delayed reaction from the last product I had tried.  I developed, essentially, an acne-like rash on my underarms that was both painful and terrible to look at.  However, the longer I used this cream deodorant, the more blemishes I developed.  After four weeks, I finally threw in the towel and within days of ending my use of the product, my underarms cleared up.  No other products, used before or after the DeodoMom brand, have caused such a reaction.  So, unfortunately, this product only gets two stars from me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It really does work the tottle is the best container for it imo. I only wish they had the option to subscribe to it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like this tottle better than the jar version. It is much easier to squeeze it onto your fingers than to scoop it from a jar where it gets under your fingernails. Works very well for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple other products and this is by far the BEST! I have super sensitive skin and no reactions at all. Its light, scent free, and works for over 8 hours. Id reapply at night if you plan to go out and that&#x27;s with any metallic free deodorant. This one definitely last longer than the others.</li>
