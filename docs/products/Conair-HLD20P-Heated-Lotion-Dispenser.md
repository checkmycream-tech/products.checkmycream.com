### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome.</li>
      <li>, this is my best investment yet!</li>
      <li>This is the best invention yet.  </li>
      <li>It is  especially a great buy during winter.</li>
      <li>It is a great buy, and for all you bargain shoppers, wait till the price drops.</li>
      <li>As a massage therapist, I think it&#x27;s a great item.</li>
      <li>The idea was great</li>
      <li>Anyone would love this!!</li>
      <li>She likes it, and it does a good job of warming</li>
      <li>and I LOVE it!  </li>
      <li>Friends and family have tried it and are thrilled.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice idea</li>
      <li>So for that price I liked this product a lot.</li>
      <li>Turn it on and in seconds it warm.</li>
      <li>They say it heats up nicely and helps fight the chills when putting lotion on.</li>
      <li>It takes 2 minutes to heat up, then the lotion goes on like warm silk.  </li>
      <li>I had been without warm lotion for several days and am so pleased to have found another heated lotion dispenser I do a happy dance every morning!</li>
      <li>The on/off switch is located on the top of the dispenser and each and every time</li>
      <li>Love it, always refer to friends and family.</li>
      <li>I pleased with the purchase?</li>
      <li>and I did enjoy the warm lotion</li>
      <li>I did not realize how much better it is to apply heated lotion until this.</li>
      <li>Would love to recommend it</li>
      <li>I could not believe how warm and smooth the cream felt.  </li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large, so I don&#x27;t have to keep refilling it, and my clients just love it when the lotion comes on warm!</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m mostly happy with it so far, but that runny lotiony nose just isn&#x27;t very attractive.</li>
      <li>But with a little better design, this would have been a superb product.</li>
      <li>This is such a great invention.</li>
      <li>putting hot lotion on after shower is the best feeling and skin doesn&#x27;t dry out like before.</li>
      <li>I thought it was a lovely gift and really appreciated it.</li>
      <li>And I was even more embarrassed when I offered to return it for a new one and found out I couldn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>it was definently worth 15</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used hundreds of products and go through them pretty quick.  </li>
      <li>It holds a LOT of lotion, which might be good if you lather down your body a couple of times a day.</li>
      <li>I switch it on when I go for a bath and by the time I am back, the lotion is ready and warm.</li>
      <li>The warm lotion is truly a treat to dry, itchy winter skin.  </li>
      <li>Very nice for professional use, but other than that...</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Seems like other people have had more success, or perhaps don&#x27;t mind the leak; maybe I just got a defective unit.</li>
      <li>This product will make holiday shopping easy for several women on my list!</li>
      <li>thought unit was on the large size.</li>
      <li>I use lotion a couple of times a day due to dry skin and thought this would be a great item for me</li>
      <li>Thanks me every time we talk.</li>
      <li>me used one with so much cream</li>
      <li>so much all the identifying brand marks have worn off and</li>
      <li>Purchased this as a gift for my mother and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
      <li>Such a thoughtful gift.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had for a week or so, but it seems to heat up to a yummy temperature pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>I plan on taking it with me on my Christmas vacation because I no longer want to live without it!  </li>
      <li>The only drawback is putting the top back on after filling with lotion.</li>
      <li>so I can get out and use the hot lotion, especially good for a cold day!</li>
      <li>i do like it but can&#x27;t see why in the world they all of the sudden think it is worth 70.  </li>
      <li>I and ordering a back up right now.</li>
      <li>I ordered new one and they shipped</li>
      <li>The new one I ordered leaks lotion when in the off position.</li>
      <li>As a chiropractor and acupuncturist, I need warm lotion to prepare tense muscles before a treatment session.  </li>
      <li>I turned it off lotion squirted everywhere making a huge mess</li>
      <li>Very durable, can withstand constant use and doesn&#x27;t clog often.</li>
      <li>A real treat for those of us living in colder climates - especially in the winter.  </li>
      <li>but since it&#x27;s been over a month since I purchased the lotion warmer, I cannot return it apparently.</li>
      <li>At first, this seemed like one more useless gadget, until I thought about the dry, itchy skin my husband and I are plagued with each winter.  </li>
      <li>, before it was broken, it was necessary to fill the well nearly full in order to get any lotion out, which meant refilling it nearly every week.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s really a neat little product!</li>
<li> If you leave it in one place too long, undisturbed, you&#x27;ll come back to a lotion stalagmite.</li>
<li> Love having heated lotion on a cold winter day.</li>
<li> Wintering in the COLD north going even more north for the holidays.  </li>
<li> It is too big for those who use specialty lotion in relatively small amounts.</li>
<li> Initially I thought it was small, but now I think it is the correct size.</li>
<li> I was SHOCKED at the price initially, but after thinking about it I think it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
<li> I got this product when the price dropped down to $12.</li>
<li> It is a little hard to do but overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
<li> I previously owned  a Conair heated dispenser for a number of years before I accidentally dropped it and it broke.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a real weinie when it comes to being cold.</li>
<li> It was a waste of $60.00</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m quite annoyed at the item and the &#x27;rule&#x27; of how long between purchase and &#x27;returnability&#x27;.</li>
<li> I live in the mid-Atlantic so January and February can be bitterly cold.</li>
<li> I must keep a small cup under it to catch the lotion.</li>
<li> And no more itching.  </li>
<li> and if you leave it on all the time the lotion gets hard and dries out.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just terrible to feel instant cold on a bare back!</li>
<li> We use lotion daily after showering, which helps alot, but on cold winter mornings that lotion is COLD and thick.  </li>
<li> The heating element still works, but the pump no longer produces lotion when pushed, rendering it useless.</li>
<li> I decided to splurge on this to help avoid my typically chilly routine.</li>
<li> In Alaska, in the winter, using this creme during a session without the Conair Heated Lotion Dispenser would be impossible.</li>
<li> I always hated putting cold lotion on.</li>
<li> I am VERY disappointed and would NOT recommend this to anyone.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had been without warm lotion for several days and am so pleased to have found another heated lotion dispenser I do a happy dance every morning!</li>
    <li> Hi,  They shipped me a used and stinky unit.  I tried to connect it but does not work. I ordered new one and they shipped me used one with so much cream and it took me days to get the smell out of it.  I advise not to order it.</li>
    <li> Still heats lotion a year later.</li>
    <li> I am a massage therapist and use Biotone Herbal Select Body Therapy Massage Creme exclusively. In Alaska, in the winter, using this creme during a session without the Conair Heated Lotion Dispenser would be impossible. I have used this dispenser so much all the identifying brand marks have worn off and I and ordering a back up right now.</li>
    <li> I had been using this lotion warmer/dispenser for about six months when it broke.  The heating element still works, but the pump no longer produces lotion when pushed, rendering it useless. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, before it was broken, it was necessary to fill the well nearly full in order to get any lotion out, which meant refilling it nearly every week. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> What a brilliantly simple idea!  At first, this seemed like one more useless gadget, until I thought about the dry, itchy skin my husband and I are plagued with each winter.  We use lotion daily after showering, which helps alot, but on cold winter mornings that lotion is COLD and thick.  Warming it in this contraption was the solution!  It takes 2 minutes to heat up, then the lotion goes on like warm silk.  And no more itching.  It&#x27;s really a neat little product!</li>
    <li> I got this product when the price dropped down to $12. So for that price I liked this product a lot. It heats the lotion well. Initially I thought it was small, but now I think it is the correct size. I did not realize how much better it is to apply heated lotion until this. I switch it on when I go for a bath and by the time I am back, the lotion is ready and warm. It is a great buy, and for all you bargain shoppers, wait till the price drops. It is  especially a great buy during winter.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift and I LOVE it!  Wintering in the COLD north going even more north for the holidays.  I plan on taking it with me on my Christmas vacation because I no longer want to live without it!  I thought it was a lovely gift and really appreciated it. I was going to buy one for every girl on my Christmas list and went on Amazon to purchase.  I was SHOCKED at the price initially, but after thinking about it I think it&#x27;s worth every penny.  I called my mother-in-law back up and thanked her again!</li>
    <li> This is the best invention yet.  I could not believe how warm and smooth the cream felt.  What a difference from cold cream to warm cream.   The cream itself was smoother and yes, buttery!  I love this, this is my best investment yet!</li>
    <li> Considering this thing cost essentially $60.00, 12 uses is a LOT per use of warmed lotion. It&#x27;s a nice idea but since it&#x27;s been over a month since I purchased the lotion warmer, I cannot return it apparently. I am VERY disappointed and would NOT recommend this to anyone. It was a waste of $60.00 and I&#x27;m quite annoyed at the item and the &#x27;rule&#x27; of how long between purchase and &#x27;returnability&#x27;. It was a gift and I felt quite embarrassed when it broke. And I was even more embarrassed when I offered to return it for a new one and found out I couldn&#x27;t. Save your money.</li>
    <li> As a massage therapist, I think it&#x27;s a great item. It&#x27;s large, so I don&#x27;t have to keep refilling it, and my clients just love it when the lotion comes on warm! It&#x27;s just terrible to feel instant cold on a bare back! Very nice for professional use, but other than that... Very durable, can withstand constant use and doesn&#x27;t clog often.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife. She likes it, and it does a good job of warming lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I thought unit was on the large size. It holds a LOT of lotion, which might be good if you lather down your body a couple of times a day. It is too big for those who use specialty lotion in relatively small amounts. In addition, the dispenser is also not as sturdy as it looks in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Am I pleased with the purchase? Yes. But with a little better design, this would have been a superb product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a real weinie when it comes to being cold. I live in the mid-Atlantic so January and February can be bitterly cold. I decided to splurge on this to help avoid my typically chilly routine. Normaly, after I shower, I slather myself head to toe in lotion. Summer, winter, etc., I *always* lotion-up after bathing. I&#x27;ve used hundreds of products and go through them pretty quick.  &lt;br /&gt;Good:  &lt;br /&gt;It works! I&#x27;ve only had for a week or so, but it seems to heat up to a yummy temperature pretty quickly.  &lt;br /&gt;Bad:  &lt;br /&gt;IT DRIPS! If you leave it in one place too long, undisturbed, you&#x27;ll come back to a lotion stalagmite. It&#x27;s rather big, too, I can&#x27;t find a place to put it on the sink in our bathrooom plus, of course, it leaks so it can&#x27;t stay over, say, the toothbrushes.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seems like other people have had more success, or perhaps don&#x27;t mind the leak; maybe I just got a defective unit. Overall I&#x27;m mostly happy with it so far, but that runny lotiony nose just isn&#x27;t very attractive. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The idea was great and I did enjoy the warm lotion,however I used it three times and put it back in the box. The on/off switch is located on the top of the dispenser and each and every time I turned it off lotion squirted everywhere making a huge mess and if you leave it on all the time the lotion gets hard and dries out. Would love to recommend it but I just can&#x27;t. I use lotion a couple of times a day due to dry skin and thought this would be a great item for me it just didnt measure up.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these for my girlfriend and she loves it.  Friends and family have tried it and are thrilled.  This product will make holiday shopping easy for several women on my list!</li>
    <li> This is such a great invention. I always hated putting cold lotion on. Not anymore. Turn it on and in seconds it warm. Awesome.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my sister and niece.  They say it heats up nicely and helps fight the chills when putting lotion on.</li>
    <li> i bought one of these a couple years ago for fifteen dollars.  i do like it but can&#x27;t see why in the world they all of the sudden think it is worth 70.  it was definently worth 15 but i wouldn&#x27;t pay 70</li>
    <li> As a chiropractor and acupuncturist, I need warm lotion to prepare tense muscles before a treatment session.  The Conair HLD20P lotion warmer works every time!  See my work on drnoreenlong.com</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my mother and she absolutely loves it.  Thanks me every time we talk.</li>
    <li> I look forward to taking a shower so I can get out and use the hot lotion, especially good for a cold day!</li>
    <li> Such a thoughtful gift.  A real treat for those of us living in colder climates - especially in the winter.  The warm lotion is truly a treat to dry, itchy winter skin.  Anyone would love this!!</li>
    <li> Love having heated lotion on a cold winter day. The only drawback is putting the top back on after filling with lotion. It is a little hard to do but overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
