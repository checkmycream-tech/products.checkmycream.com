<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pros: Smells good and is orange cool color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Have been using it for almost 2 weeks and have not noticed anything</li>
    <li> I was in love with the shampoo when I used it the first month months as I stopped shedding hair but the next bottle I ordered was useless. It does not stop hair loss any more, and my hair is shedding like crazy. I am looking fro other alternatives to this shampoo hoping that I might find something that would stop my hair loss, though it is working perfectly fine on my roommates&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo.. 290 Gram bottle should last a few months.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo last fall but didn&#x27;t use it as often as directed.  This spring, I used it faithfully as directed and my hair is thicker.  It did thin somewhat initially and I was in a panic but I stuck with it and it worked.  I&#x27;m a woman in my late 40&#x27;s and have used rogaine without to much success.</li>
    <li> The other reviews are correct when they say this shampoo will initially cause your hair to fall out more.  The problem for me is it never caused it to grow back faster (or at all).  I have tried a lot of hair regrowth products as someone with moderate balding at age 29 and none of them have worked thus far.  I would say that anyone with moderate balding who is trying to at least slow down their hairloss should stay away from this product.      I can&#x27;t really be too upset since I read what the risks were and still decided to give it a shot...  I just want to make sure others don&#x27;t make that same mistake.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this shampoo!  More than a few hairs shed while using this product as directed and I am STILL loosing my head hair after I stopped using it.  Its bad enough going bald but this shampoo makes things 100% worse.  I just hope my lost hair due to this shampoo grows back and this loss is not permanent.</li>
    <li> I tried it for about 3 weeks and by that time my hair got so oily that i had to use any other shampoo to clean my hair. I followed the instructions of DS Shampoo that say you should wash your hair twice,but after i got out of the shower my hair looked like if i didn´t use any shampoo at all or like if i washed my hair with only water.  After that, i couldn´t keep using DS Shampoo to see hair growth results, instead i tried another cheap shampoo and my hair looked great with no oil.</li>
    <li> This is my second time using the product and seems to be working  and recommend it. The seller ships the it&#x27;s fast</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this product for over a year. It was working great then the product changed and made my hair oily. The product is back to good quality again and we swear our hair is thicker and fuller (we are in our 50&#x27;s). We are using their conditioner too and really like it. I highy recomment this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I only started using this shampoo a week ago so it is early days to prove this shampoo works (probably not to be honest my conscience tells me). But as soon as I started using this it seems the shampoo leaves very heavy residue buildup on your hair. Your hair feels greasy, heavy and hard! It feels like they put in massive volumnmiser in the shampoo. After washing when I try to comb my hair it feels like I have put gel on my hair! Not sure I could continue using this any longer, even to finish the bottle! Does anyone else have this experience?</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 2 weeks now, and my hair looks thinner. Since no shampoo regrows hair and this obviously does not seem to help maintain what I have, I am discontinuing its use. I also noticed that it leaves a film on my hair and makes it sticky. After washing with this shampoo I have to lather Nioxin to wash off the Revita residue on my hair. Yuck! I will stick to Nizoral shampoo and minoxidil.</li>
    <li> First, this shampoo is not the only product that I am using to battle my hair loss, therefore it is difficult to say exactly what is working. But what I can say with certainty is that the things that I am doing are DEFINITELY working. If you want to know, keep reading....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per the instructions, I use this shampoo at least once a day. I then use [[ASIN:B002N48LES DS LABORATORIES Spectral DNC Topical Hair Loss Treatment for Men 60ml]]. I apply that once in the morning and at night (again, as per the instructions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use [[ASIN:B000P263EU Rene Furterer Triphasic Regenerating Formula for Thin Hair, .18 oz. - 16 vials]] once a week. At night, I also use [[ASIN:B000P24ER8 Rene Furterer Forticea Stimulating Shampoo 5.07 fl oz (150 ml)]] to wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these 4 products for 3 months now and I see AMAZING results. The bottom line is that they work. Not only has it halted my hair loss, but I also have FIELDS of hair growing back along what used to be my receding hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The majority of the hair that&#x27;s growing back at this stage is like fuzzy \\&quot;baby\\&quot; hair. I see LOTS of this hair where before there was none. There are also hairs that are more mature that have been growing back for longer. These hairs are about half way in between the \\&quot;baby\\&quot; hairs and a totally mature hair. They are longer, have more color, thicker, and seem to be well on their way to becoming a fully mature hair. I expect the other \\&quot;baby\\&quot; hairs to mature in the same way and hopefully, they will all become fully mature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair loss is a major issue with me. If you&#x27;ve read this far, it probably is with you too. If you comment on this review with any questions, I will gladly respond and help you out with any questions that you might have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few years of using this with very good results, the quality of this shampoo has definitely deteriorated. Of the last 4 bottles I&#x27;ve ordered, 3 no longer lathered. No suds at all. I will no longer be using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Oh how I wish the scent would come in some form of air freshener but alas it does not.    But, as a shampoo this is good.  As a Hair Loss shampoo it is not.  My hair fell out worse with this product.  Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Hi everyone, I am a 25 year old male with diffuse thinning and some mild/moderate recession at the temples. The majority of my hair issues have occurred in the last 3 years: A combination of MBP kicking in with age, high stress from the transitional life phase, high testosterone from running + working out + heredity,and Accutane use at age 23-4.     At the beginning of Summer (2011) I was getting sick of my mid-length... yet seeming thin,wispy,and \\&quot;old person looking\\&quot; hair. Additionally, my head was itchy, sort of flat, and occasionally I would get a few pimples on the back of my head (all signs of inflammation). As such, I decided to go with a buzzed \\&quot;5\\&quot; all around at my next hair appointment. Boy did I regret that,thought it did serve as a wake up call. I could no longer ignore this problem.     *Side note- My hair had been bothering me since 2009 when I did this same thing over the Summer and saw VERY mild thinning. This was a good benchmark    Because of this dramatic change, I immediately got in the market for some products and obviously it was overwhelming. I am in healthcare, and yet when I began my research I still couldn&#x27;t avoid that self-diagnosis web-MD over traumatic syndrome. What I mean by this is that it took me a good 4 days to realize I probably wouldn&#x27;t loose all my hair, I probably didn&#x27;t need the strongest drugs right away, and a hair transplant is stupid... also, women will still love you no matter what your hair looks like if you are nice, smell good and have a job.     Anyways, sorry for getting off track but basically I decided on this line of products to help solve my problem! The DS Laboratories Shampoo,Conditioner, and the Spectral-RS (without mindox), plus 3 pills a day of GNC saw palmetto     ... Now, almost immediately my hair condition saw TREMENDOUS improvement. Sure it could be a little bit of a placebo effect but if so I welcome it.    I have experienced-     Significantly less hair falling out on a daily basis ... almost none :)My hair is thicker, my hair is shinier   My hair NEVER itches   I also use the RS- to style as well and that way I am not putting and cloggy   products in my hair.        It is too early to discuss hair regrowth but I am fairly confident I will see some. That said, if I do not I may just add in one more product with more copper peptides and alter that with the Spectral RS as I am not interested in Mindox right now. I don&#x27;t like how I would be locked in with it and I feel as though I may need it in my late 30&#x27;s-40&#x27;s in a worst case scenario.    Bottom line- I think my regimen is \\&quot;winnnnnning\\&quot; all around. Just remember to follow the directions and buy the big bottles as they are cheaper.</li>
    <li> This stuff used to work, I used it for years and it maintained my hair line from age 28-35.  The latest formula is watery, now made in China and my hairline is suffering for it.  At 36 my rate of loss is back to what it was at 27.</li>
    <li> Finally comes with a bottle cap seal, so no more partial spill during the sending of the product!! I periodically buy this when it&#x27;s run out. Always feel disappoint when reviving it because at least 5% to 10% was spill. Great product and I see the difference of thick in my hair.</li>
    <li> I read all the other posts on how the new Revita was terrible but I had two bottles of the old stuff so I just now got around to the New version. I can confirm the new one feels like a very expensive hair thickner and even lacks the nice smell and texture the older version left in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess Ds Laboratories has decided to milk their success and release cheaper gluton filled cash cow version.&lt;br /&gt;OK well it&#x27;s time for me to look out for something new because I am not wasting money on this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW the older version runs out very liquid like, the newer version comes out more like toothpaste, I guess thats all the thickner in it. Also I find it Ironic that they fixed the leaking cap problem just as they switched out the product for a cheaper formulation.</li>
    <li> The quality has diminished. I can&#x27;t bother with this product anymore. You are better off just using a good shampoo and conditioner every other day. Also, don&#x27;t forget to gently massage your scalp to get blood flowing properly, since that helps fight off balding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty, don&#x27;t even bother about your balding hair. Using hairloss drugs will wreck havoc on your hormones/body. Just take some DIM pills to help your body regulate your hormone levels better (since whacky hormones can be the cause of hairloss) and exercise more.rt/have much of.  Minoxidil: To your body, it&#x27;s a toxin. As such, your body WILL build up a tolerance to it later on in life as you continue to use it. Chances are, your hair will grow back, but you will stop gaining hair and just keep whatever you grown. So basically, start using Minoxidil as soon as you KNOW you&#x27;re losing your hair if you&#x27;re a man. Will it work for everyone? No. But it will work for most. Side effects may include an itchy scalp or greasy hair if the product&#x27;s quality is cruddy, but the former side effect only applies to those with messed up scalps. Also, if you AREN&#x27;T going bald due to genetics (but from a disease or hormone levels gone crazy), then this stuff will mess you up if you used it for a while.  Ketoconazole: It&#x27;s found in Revitra! It works faster than Minoxidil does, but sadly, doesn&#x27;t work as well. If you use it at the first sign of hairloss, again, your chances to have a decent baseline is way better. Ketoconazole has a wonderful \\&quot;cosmetic effect\\&quot;. Your hair will become thicker after use, and will slowly grow in diameter to cover more area up to a certain point. In addition to that, it will stimulate your thinning hair to become \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; again. Also, the shampoo will make your scalp hella healthy. If you have dandruff, this stuff will work wonders for you as well. Unlike Minoxidil, your hair won&#x27;t get messed up from using it if you&#x27;re not actually going \\&quot;naturally\\&quot; bald. If your hairloss is on the uglier side of things, combine Revitra with any Minoxidil topical. Use this first to be on the safe side.  Finderstine: Basically, this will lower DHT levels. The only problem is, DHT&#x27;s function is to help MAINTAIN masculine attributes. . . In addition, your estrogen levels *may* rise. It takes your body half a year to adjust to the medication (only 1-3 months for results). It will take your body a year to adjust after you stop the treatment, and even then, it may not go fully back to normal. Toying with your hormones is no joke, nor do I think it&#x27;s worth it just for the sake of having hair on your head. The upside is that you won&#x27;t have to worry about prostate cancer, the downside is. . . Um, the hormonal change. Also, other possible side effects include (due to high estrogen/low testosterone): gaining fat easily, hard time building muscle, mood swings, erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction is usually reversible, but in some rare cases, it is permanent. Again, playing with your hormones is no freaking joke.  Other tips:   1) Being healthy means your hair stays on your head longer. That&#x27;s why hairloss strikes the younger folks more so than it did a decade ago.   2) Biotin, protein, and calcium is your friend! As are all other vitamins/nutritients. Zinc (15mg at least) is also necessary. . . However, Zinc should be take 1-2 hours after ingesting calcium since your body is stupid and would rather ignore out Zinc just so it can absorb more calcium. Taking zinc before bed is best.  3) Work on other things, such as muscle tone or whatever you can do to make yourself feel better about your appearance. Also, ladies(or guys if you swing that way) don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re bald if you have a body like Arnold Schwarzenegger used to have(over exaggerating, but you get the idea).  4) If you&#x27;re ridiculously bald, just shave your head. Nothing looks more ridiculous than having a crow&#x27;s nest on your head or a really bad come-over. Seriously.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to regrow hair if you are going bald or thinning, in my opinion this product will not do it. In my personal opinion it does not stimulate hair growth.  The product is also expensive and arrives with what appeared to be a less than completely full bottle of shampoo.  In terms of the shampoo itself, with all the claims about hair growth stimulation out of the way. The shampoo itself is nice and smells good. If sold at a cheaper price I would purchase again because I liked the smell, but I won&#x27;t be expecting it to help with hair growth.  From my understanding Minoxidil is the only FDA approved over the counter product for hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works when you are lucky enough to get a good batch but just as often the shampoo will have the consistency of almost cured glue and be completely worthless. I&#x27;m through gambling with this product and will look for an alternative.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a couple of months and I  have seen improvment in new hair growth and decreased shedding.  My stylist commented that I had &#x27;alot of new growth :)  I use it about every other day along with daily minoxidil for women  (have been using this much longer with less dramatic result alone).</li>
    <li> I was extremely skeptical about getting results from using this shampoo - essentially it seems like everything rumored to help hair loss was mixed together and thrown into a bottle.  There didn&#x27;t seem to be single ingredient, clinical study that scientifically proved the efficacy of the product.    With a \\&quot;what the hell\\&quot; attitude I&#x27;ve tried the product for a few months.  If nothing else, people have remarked that it&#x27;s a good shampoo.  As an over 40 male, my hair was getting noticeably thinner but still a relatively full head of hair.  After 2 months there is new growth and an increase in thickness - enough so that I think the shampoo is definitely worth the cost and effort.  I actually had a co-worker ask me if I got a haircut because my hair looked different somehow.    Side effects - zero, but I typically never have side effects to anything.  Looking at other reviews, it seems strange that the results differ so much for individuals.    I&#x27;ve followed the directions - wash about 6 times per week/twice each time (apply/wait 60 seconds/rinse/apply/wait 2-4 minutes/rinse).    My conclusion - if you have light to moderate hair loss it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> Good delivery, excellent product.  After using it for one month, I actually see the new hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 3 years now. When I first started I loved it, nice smell left my hair feeling soft, and most important of all was that it kept my hair from falling out. Around the end of 2010 I ordered a a couple new bottle&#x27;s off amazon. When it arrived It didn&#x27;t look the same or smell the same. Which really isn&#x27;t such a big deal, but my hair started falling out like crazy! This never happened in the three years previous while using this. It was like it just stopped working. So i just figured I got some knock offs and called DS labs and they sent me two new bottles directly from them. Well when they got in they looked the same and smelled the same as the amazon ones. My hair was still falling out and this product wasn&#x27;t helping it stop like before. All I can figure out is when they started making it out of the country that&#x27;s when things started going bad. The quality on a scale from 1-10 now is a 0. If it was a year or two ago I would have given it a 10 out of 10. I mean what the heck happened? All I can say is after 3 years I will never order this product again. I have lost half my hair since using the new stuff in less then 6 months and some self esteem and confidence. DS Labs seems like they care more about the money then the customer, probally using cheaper ingrediants and ways of making it. Before purchasing this read some of the other newer reviews in the last year and a half about this product going downhill then decide for yourself if it&#x27;s worth it. Just trying to save you some money and frustration.</li>
    <li> So far I have used the product for about 3 weeks, and have not seen much on the hair regrowth side. It does however make my scalp feel clean, and makes my hair fuller. It also smells good. I am combining this with Minoxidil 5%, and ingesting Flaxseed Lignans (3 pills per day). We&#x27;ll see how this goes. The only product I have ever used that really regrew my hair was Zulvera over 2 years ago before they changed their solution to nothing but dish soap. It was a combination of all kinds of herbs like Lavendar etc. It regrew my hair on my receding forehead in like 3 weeks. It made my scalp tingle after every use. So far I have not come across anything that will regrow hair like that. The Flaxseed Lignans wipe out DHT in your system which burns out hair follicles and causes them to stop growing hair. I would recommend them to anyone. They do help.ANy other questions or comments feel free to shoot me a message.</li>
    <li> My hair never fails to look clean, shiny and I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner. Started it after the chemo 5 years ago.  My only shampoo since.</li>
    <li> EDIT: I&#x27;m lowering my review. This company NEEDS to be more consistent. I feel like I&#x27;m gambling every purchase. I&#x27;m moving on to Regenpure or another more reliable maker for a hair loss shampoo.   PS: Holy crap I made a lot of comma splices in my old review, LOL!  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Look, this isn&#x27;t a miracle cure, don&#x27;t expect it to be.  However, as far as hair loss shampoos go, this is your best bet.   I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years now, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference, for one, I&#x27;ve more or less maintained my hair these last two years, which is all you should hope for really, without using Minox and/or Finasteride. My current hair loss routine is simple, I use the old vodka and cayenne pepper mixture and Revita, that&#x27;s it, and I&#x27;ve maintained.   You might notice shedding with this product, I did, but don&#x27;t get upset, shedding is good, it means it&#x27;s working.  Lastly, use it daily, don&#x27;t skip much if you can help it, hair loss doesn&#x27;t take a day off, you shouldn&#x27;t either.</li>
    <li> This product is an o.k. shampoo. I have used it for several months and see 0 results. It tends to leave my hair limp and lifeless. I have moderate hair loss and was looking for a product to thicken my hair and add volume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using revita for 3 months now.  I must say I am impressed.  I&#x27;m 23 and my hair was thinning; I&#x27;ve tried rogaine and other products like it with no luck.  A buddy of mine told me about it and said it had helped him.    So in 3 months my friends have noticed a difference, and my girlfriend ( who I didn&#x27;t tell, you know 30$ shampoo) has commented that my hair looks fuller.  I love it, I recommend to anyone with thinning hair who wants a simple solution.</li>
    <li> First, the shampoo leaked in the box during shipping. Second, after using it for a few weeks my hair is falling out like crazy! Like I said in the title, not impressed!</li>
    <li> When I received the product the bottle was filled up no more than 60% and there wasn&#x27;t a seal on top of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product but I will never order it from here again. The shampoo also appears to be very thin, almost like its water down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all seems very suspicious. Pretty much I feel like I got less than half of what I paid for. Supposed to last 3 months, mine is almost done after only 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it does what it says: stops my excessive shedding and makes my hair soft and manageable. But, the bottle leaked, this happened the last time I ordered it too. That&#x27;s my only complaint!</li>
    <li> mid 20s and used this product for 2 weeks and made a ton of hair fall out. I think I really messed up because now im trying to get those hairs to grow back. I can&#x27;t believe this product is on the market still. Stay away!!</li>
    <li> Revita works great and I would recommend the product. But when I received my box in the mail, the bottle was opened and leaked all in the box. I only have the option to return it for a refund. I&#x27;m not going to burn $5 on postage to send an $18 empty bottle back for a refund. I cannot trust ordering from this vendor now. I have no choice but to order from somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 3 weeks regularly.  first day when i used this shampoo it i had few hair drop off.  2-4 day 20-30 hairs drop off  end of first week 2-3 hair and i was very happy with the product.  second week it started again 10-20 hairs  3rd week 20-40 hair.   Now I am able to see top of my scalp/crown. It was never this worse.  my scalp started drying and health of my hair just worsened. I have black hair with dark brown shade. the shampoo dried the scalp/hair so much that there was no shine left and my hair started looking whitish. that&#x27;s where i stopped using this product. i wish i stoped using this product before. I would no recommend this shampoo unless you want to get bold in a month.</li>
    <li> Began shedding pretty quickly upon starting Revita shampoo but didn&#x27;t get nervous because insert said it was to be expected. So I finished 1st bottle(goes quick)and started 2nd bottle, shedding continued and got so bad that I started seeing bald spots where there was hair before! So I stopped using half way through the bottle. Went back to using my old shampoo and shedding subsided. Still haven&#x27;t grown back the hair that Revita caused me to lose and don&#x27;t know if it will grow back. I&#x27;m VERY angry that a product that I bought to fight hair loss made me lose more!! I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different products in the past for thinning hair and know the shedding process well and my hair has always grown back after my scalp adjusted to treatments. Not with this shampoo! Really don&#x27;t know what caused this reaction perhaps the Ketoconazole since it can cause heavy shedding if used too much(found this out after the fact)insert and bottle advises to use at least 5 days a week, with 2 applications. Advice: STAY AWAY if you want to keep the hair you have!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 1 month and I can say I haven´t seen much improvement so far. The other problem is that you have to wash your hair twice when using this product. First 2 minutes and then 3-5 minutes. I feel that it takes forever.  Aditionally, I think the product is very expensive for what it does.</li>
    <li> I started using this product a couple of years back and I must say was impressed with the results.  Now I agree with other reviewers...They have deluded the product to maximize resources and profits.  Now just another inadequate hair hopeful product for sale on Amazon. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m not one of the lucky ones.  I&#x27;ve used this product for over 6 months now and I&#x27;m still thinning.  I agree with other reviewers.  The shampoo works well, but just doesn&#x27;t grow back or maintain my hair.  First couple of months of use, I actually noticed I was losing more hair, but the product description did say that will happen.  The manufacturer was right about that!  I&#x27;ll use the rest of the product and report back my results, though I&#x27;m not hopeful at this point.  The shampoo does make your hair appear fuller, so that is a plus.  Though at the end of the day, after your shower, reality sucks...</li>
    <li> Used this for several months, but did not notice any results  positive or negative. It&#x27;s just as if I was using my regular  shampoo. And yes, I did follow the instructions on using it.    Best of luck though if you want to try it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo about 2 months ago and i am starting to see results. i definitely see some hair growth on my forehead on areas which were formerly bald. I think enough has been written about the product by other reviewers, but i would like to reinforce the fact that it needs to be used atleast 5 times a week and two applications(once for upto 2 min and another for upto 5 min)every time it is used to see any results. May not be for everybody as there are a lot of factors affecting hair loss like heredity, lifestyle, habits, etc. But the products works in my case and I actually came back online to order a second time around and thought i would leave my opinion as a user about this product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. My husband and I use it with amazing results, highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This has to be the worst and most expensive shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair began falling out when i started using this but i figured i would keep going since it said your hair might fall out for the first couple of weeks. Its been a little over a month now and i just finished my first bottle of revita. My hair is still falling out and if anything its gotten progressively worse. I had low to moderate hair loss before i started using this, now its high (15+ hairs fall per shower). I am giving this another chance, but i am buying the roundtop bottle to see if its any better and if my hair doesn&#x27;t stop falling out then that will be my last revita purchase ever. Its not even a good shampoo, it dries up and tangles my hair and on some parts it doesn&#x27;t even come off completely from the water so it feels like gel in my hair. Although i&#x27;m beginning to see patches of hair loss on my head, the shampoo is giving my hair more volume which is the only pro to it (somehow i feel its not worth the sacrifice). I will write another review when i&#x27;m done with the second one, i&#x27;m hoping it gets better.</li>
    <li> i cant say that it does miracles but it works&lt;br /&gt;i stopped using it for 2 months&lt;br /&gt;and my hair got thin and now it sheds&lt;br /&gt;im going back to using the product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product will stimulate hair growth but it sure is a good shampoo. It makes my hair feel very clean. Do not use it alone or your hair will be very dry, use it with a nice conditioner and it&#x27;s fine. The price is a bit high but all you need is a tiny bit of shampoo and it will have a lot of lather. One skinny bottle can last very long. I am using it every day for almost a month now.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the way it works. Thicker, fuller hair and using with minoxidil 15% I am getting great hair growth...much more than even when I was younger. Recommend to others...Good luck to you!</li>
    <li> if you do research on hair growth, you will know that these TYPEs of shampoos are really not necessary or do they stimulate hair growth.  I used this product for about 4 months and didnt see much hair regeneration.  This product is expensive and hard to rebuy on a frequent basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend rogain for general hair loss and visit a hair replacement center if needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 23 and have had a rapidly receeding hairline for the past 4 years.  I haven&#x27;t tried much in the way of hair growth products, so I really don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  However after 3 months of using this shampoo I did not see any results.  Actually, my parents state that they think I actually lost ground faster while using this shampoo.    As other reviews have stated, it has a nice smell and texture to it, but I never saw any results using this shampoo.  If I could do it all over again, I wouldn&#x27;t have spent my money on Revita.  What&#x27;s worse, it left my scalp irritated and itchy on top of not seeing any positive results...</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo from a sample that was given to me by my hair stylist.  After trying the sample I decided to purchase the 180 ml bottle of Revita Shampoo from Amazon (USA Vitamins), since it was a bit cheaper than at the Salon.  I am using the shampoo to prevent potential hair loss due to stress and aging.  I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in consistency of the shampoo in the sample package and the $27 bottle.  The sample is much more concentrated; it has a gooey feel like typical shampoos and provides a satisfying, high foaming result when applied to your hair.  However, the 180 ml bottle has a watery feel and definitely does not have the high foaming result when applied to hair; unless I apply triple the amount that I used from the sample.  I will give it one more try and buy the shampoo at the salon.  If the consistency of the Salon shampoo is gooey just like the sample then we are getting a sub par product that someone is diluting and selling cheaper to make a profit on it or DS Lab has no quality control.  If the consistency is the same, watery, I&#x27;ll have to find another hair loss preventing shampoo.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for about 6 months now, along with the conditioner and spectral treatment and we have noticed that where there was no hair at all, there is now quite a lot of new hair growing.  This is not for someone who wants to see instant results - it does take a while before you will notice a difference.</li>
    <li> This is the worst shampoo ever in my life! Greasy and STICKY! If you dont want to spend a whole week washing ur hair w dish washing soap to get off like a buble gum stickiness, just stay away from it. For a second I thought I was going to have to shave my head.</li>
    <li> DS Labs is well known for its hair growth products.  I was truly disappointed when I tried Revita.  It&#x27;s impossible to get out of the bottle.  I have to use both hands to squeeze the container.  It doesn&#x27;t mix well with water and not only can I not get it to \\&quot;slather around on my head\\&quot; I&#x27;m also left with orange globs all over the tub floor that won&#x27;t disolve.</li>
    <li> I have been using revita for about a year.  I did not notice any additional hair loss as some people reported.  The condition of my hair has improved, it is not as dry as before, so I will keep using it.  I believe that using this shampoo has helped because my hair was thinning and this did not get any worse, it did not get much better, but I am still pleased.  I will try the conditioner next.</li>
    <li> lol this is just another shampoo</li>
    <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and I started to see some hair lose (nothing to be alarmed but I wanted to take action now that I still have time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, I still break out easily (face and back).&lt;br /&gt;After 2 months of using this product, I haven&#x27;t really seen a big difference on my hair - BUT now I have Acne all over my back and neck (I guess that means the the product is working!) But now I am having double thoughts about it. I am sure it is working on my hair too (even though I haven&#x27;t nottice it yet), BUT I am breaking out A LOT too.  I am thinking it may not be worth it. But of course, that is just me because I do break out easily.</li>
    <li> At first I used it without conditioner and my hair ended up really dry and full. I loved the fullness but I could do without the dryness. This was my fault, because it tells you to use a heavy conditioner. So, 2nd day, I use it again and also use a conditioner. While I was smoothing out my hair to get the water out, I looked at my hand and it was FULL of my hair. SO SCARY! I can&#x27;t afford to loose more hair. It states that you will loose hair for up to two weeks, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be a handful a day. I would end up bald. Also, while in the sun today for about 2 minutes, I felt my scalp burning. Unbelieveable! AND my scalp has more scaling then I had before. I am returning this item only after using it twice.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make my hair grow any more...smells pretty nice though..the design of the bottle looks fancy but it&#x27;s a little over priced. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it but who knows might work for you.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Finer and dull hair. I tried many shampoos, conditioners and other products including the Laser comb and Rogaine. I started using this shampoo from past one month along with regular use of Rogaine. I started seeing considerable difference in my hair. Now my hair looks thicker and very good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over one and half year with good results when I first started using it in the beginning of 2009.    If I were to rate it in 2009 I would have given it 5 stars. However, based on recent purchases (past 6 months) the product consistency has varied a lot and the product has become more watery and does not stop hair loss any more... the hair have started shedding again. I will tell you that the prior product had stopped hair loss and some hair growth was also noticeable.    I have been patiently waiting to see if the quality improves... but have not seen any improvement yet.     Product container in 2009 had a rounded top and the packaging said \\&quot;Made in USA\\&quot;. If I remember correctly, it was manufactured in Miami Florida. Recently the company has switched to a flat top packaging and the packaging says \\&quot;Assembled in USA from imported materials\\&quot;. I am guessing this is the reason for poor quality.     The prior consistency was thicker shampoo with reddish orange color which required a pea sized quantity that produced enough lather. The newer product is too watery and has a lighter orange color. You need two to three times the quantity to get the same amount of lather.     Bottom line... the quality has deteriorated and product is not effective anymore.</li>
    <li> It is really incredible but I have been reading all reviews of Revita and I never saw something like that, I mean: 1- People complaining about \\&quot;how watery the shampoo is\\&quot;, 2- Some months ago the Laboratory \\&quot;had a problem with a batch\\&quot; resulting in a greasy/sticky layer covering your scalp!!!, 3- Many bottles have leaks.     What does it mean? I think this laboratory has a lot of problems and they are looking for the way to make some changes without being noticed, just in case be careful with what you buy from here.</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My name is Eric I am 26 years old &amp; todays date is 5/9/12.  I just wanted to take a few seconds to write a quick review on this product.  I was very skeptical at first about any type of shampoo that said it would regrow hair.  I was experiencing the start of male patten baldness &amp; a receding hair line.  I can definitely say this product has improved my problem dramatically.  As far as the bald spot at the back top part of my head goes I would say it is almost 100% gone.  It didn&#x27;t do as much as I would have hoped for the receding hair line (We all want miracles) but it still improved that area a lot as well.  Also the rest of my hair looks much fuller.  Only time will tell how long this will work for me.  I have been using it for around six months now just as directed on the bottle.  I didn&#x27;t really notice a change until the third or fourth month.  So stick with it for a while if you are going to try it.  I also followed up with a natural conditioner (Didn&#x27;t want any more chemicals on my head).  I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I felt I just had to put my opinion on this one out there and help raise the rating for this product if just by a fraction of a star if I could. When I ordered this shampoo for the first time I was traveling away for a while and something just made me order a couple of bottles though I had no idea what it was or could do. Not only did the texture of my hair change; it became thicker, more manageable, and much much softer. I can&#x27;t say if I saw new growth or not, I was just soooo happy my hair health was going in the right direction. At first I applied the way the advise it should be... then I took it a step further and started applying it like I do with Minoxidil. I wet my hair, then massage the shampoo into my scalp, wait around 30-45 minutes, and then wash. This way I could apply smaller amounts of the shampoo and guarantee more absorption, thus saving up on the expensive supply, and needless to say, the results also were better.    This was the first hair growth shampoo I tried. But, despite the results I was getting, I just kept thinking there might be something better out there. So, I decided to start looking for shampoos that had similar ingredient formulas, and in no time I came across one with great reviews... RegenePure. Feeling as lucky as I was the first time, I ordered 4 bottles!! I was disappointed like I&#x27;ve never been in my life. My hair health plummeted like it has never before, and I was back to square one in almost as much time as it me to get this improvement.     I don&#x27;t exactly know what works in this formula, or why this one works for me, while RegenePure works for others, but I will definitely keep ordering this until I come across something better, if there is such a thing out there. Or maybe by the time research would have already caught up and found the holy grail for hair repair or regrowth.    Bottomline: try it out for yourself.    Only drawback I&#x27;ve found in almost every package I&#x27;ve ordered is that all of them leaked. The enclosing carton always had dry orange residue on the inside, and since it was dry I could never guess how much was already lost. However, I will not let this affect my rating, since I am rating the stuff itself. 5 stars solid.</li>
    <li> together with the conditioner I went from stragley strands on top to a good head of hair. about half of the thick hair I had before. even my hair dresser who recommended it was amazed. now it may not work for every one but combined with the conditioner it worked for me</li>
    <li> The shampoo itself is orange in color just like the bottle.  Not sure if it is a packing defect in the shampoo bottle design or just my bottle but it leaks from the flip top making a very ORANGE MESS on the bottle itself and the tub shelf.  This shampoo is not cheap and i have lost a good portion of it due to the leaking.  That said, the shampoo lathers well, cleaning my short hair with a single use.  I have noticed my hair looks thicker and i&#x27;m not shedding as much as i used to.  I also use the conditioner (same bottle style - zero problems with it) At this time i am not using the treatment drops - choosing to see what effect if any using just the shampoo &amp; conditioner have on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years now, and was very happy with the over all quality. Not only did it stop hair loss and I could notice some new hair growth, I also loved the clean feeling after shampoo. It left the hair light and added some volume too.  The only drawback was the packaging, which caused several leaking bottles to arrive in my shipments from amazon. I recommended this product to a lot of my friends and was a happy user myself.     Notice the past tense in comments above. Some time during last 6 months, I believe DS Labs which is the manufacturer of this product went public. They changed the packaging, which is now excellent. My last purchase was in March 2011, and I was pleasantly surprised to see a better more user friendly dispensing mechanism. However, what came as a shock was that the formula seems to be completely changed. The Shampoo is much thicker now and is not easily soluble in water.      The results are far worse; no lather in the first application of shampoo - which was not the case with the previous formula. More bad news - after I wash off the shampoo, my hair are left tangled! Now I have very thin hair and receding hairline, which is why I use this product and not even cheap OTC shampoos ever tangle my hair! So instead of stopping hair loss, I end up breaking more hair in an attempt to comb out the knots.     I will probably try one more bottle to make sure that this last shipment was not an anomaly, but if the quality has changed, (alas all good things come to an end! ), I will stay away from the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; Revita.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on the excellent reviews and I am not disappointed. I was experiencing hair loss due to wearing CPAP mask every night-the mask head band was too harsh on the hair follicles. This was until I found this shampoo. A little goes a long way and I use it every day. It has been little over a month and I am noticing more hair on my head where bald patch was predominant. This shampoo has emu oil which stimulates hair follicles. While you can purchase emu oil separately, having it in a shampoo form works better.</li>
    <li> So first of all, I really gotta say that it&#x27;s a great shampoo. I&#x27;ve now been using it for a month, and I can confirm that I really like the smell and the feel of this shampoo every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;DS Labaratories customer service is great - you can just write and ask them about any concern you have and they&#x27;ll reply to you in no time.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, this product&#x27;s goal is to cease hairloss, or at least slow it down.......Well I&#x27;m not sure about that, but I believe that it does slow it down. But still, I&#x27;ll have to comment about that one in a few months to really notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried other shampoos, such as Revivogen (hated the smell and their cleanser, which also caused me to hate their shampoo...), Nizoral and Nioxin (which includes SLS!! but for some reason it&#x27;s got great review around here). Alpecin shampoo was also an option, but Revita doesn&#x27;t lack any caffeine.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, you can&#x27;t go wrong when investing your money in possibly the best shampoo for hairloss that&#x27;s out there in the market, which includes both Nizoral&#x27;s and Alpecin&#x27;s ingredients...&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see anywhere on the booklet that came with the shampoo that it could cause your hair to fall out more but so far my hair is falling out more after using this shampoo..when I switch back to normal shampoo I get my normal hair loss so I know it&#x27;s the Revita shampoo.  I&#x27;m going to give it another couple weeks before I give up on it.  My friend loves this shampoo..she had bald spots and after using this her hair grew back and looks great.</li>
    <li> I wanted this to work, I tried to stick with it, and couldn&#x27;t. I do not recommend this or anything DS Laboratories has to offer. I never had skin problems until I started using their products. I have this rash on my forehead that doesn&#x27;t seem to go away. It was not worth it for me. I wish I never picked up this product. I wish someone would have told me. Well I&#x27;m telling you all now that are considering purchasing this product. Don&#x27;t do it, and look for another alternative. If you pick it up, be cautious, and if you have any side effects at all drop it.</li>
    <li> There is no such thing as a miracle shampoo that will regrow hair lets face it. I have tried everything and this was no exception. The good thing is I noticed a lot less hair falling out into my sink when I run my hands through it. Downside is I don;t see any new hair growth. This stuff is pricey too. Over all a decent product but again it&#x27;s pricey. I also used this will the spray.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo 3 weeks ago and am very disappointed. I&#x27;ve suffered from alopecia for years and it&#x27;s progressivly gotten worse. I was using Pur a dor(sp?) for a couple months. It helped with thinning and hair loss but not with growing hair. So, I wanted to find something to help grow hair. So, I tried this shampoo. Never again! Although it&#x27;s a good volumizer, smells good, it&#x27;s not worth it!  My hair is thinning again. It even sheds throughout the day now. I&#x27;m going back to my Previous shampoo.</li>
    <li> Started using Revita in August 2009 and used for a year straight. Never stopped hair from falling out and of course never grew new hair. I told myself to be patient which wasn&#x27;t difficult because at first I really liked it. I was able to finally stop using Head &amp; Shoulders without my scalp becoming an itchy, scabby mess. However, each new bottle would show up leaking or broken or the shampoo itself would be watery compared to the last one. Finally in the summer of 2010 the top of my scalp started to feel oily. I tried washing it out and it started spreading! Within three weeks the entire top of my head became a sticky, tacky, waxy glob! After some research I tried washing out the toxic waste dump that was my scalp with the following: tea tree shampoo, clarifying shampoo, Listerine and even white vinegar. Nothing worked until I figured I should try something the exact opposite, the extremely moist and creamy Aussie \\&quot;3 minute miracle\\&quot; deep conditioner. Within two rinses the evil creature on top of my head was washed away, however each time i used Revita it would be reborn. So I stopped abusing myself and switched back to head and shoulders. The creature has never returned! This is just another story of a company that can&#x27;t leave well enough alone and just insists on running itself into the ground. DS Laboratories should be ashamed of themselves. What a joke. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo.  Thought that less than the 180 ml volume was in the bottle because level was about 3/4 full.  But I measured out 180 ml into an empty bottle and found that the 180 ml bottle the shampoo comes in is actually bigger.</li>
    <li> Im 24 years old, Male with partial baldness. I still have hair but not as much as on front and top of my head. I started loosing hair when i was 19.     After reviews and reading all different forums I decided to give a try to this product. On the first impression when it came, the bottle was only 3/4 full. I don&#x27;t know if that is how much it suppose to have inside but after going to a store and looking at other shampoos they were filled to the top. That was my first concern.  Next I started using the shampoo acording to the label. First week was great my scalp feelt better. Shampoo seemed to be amazing working. I have not missed a day. Like the bottle said I washed it and than put shampoo into my hair, massage my scalp and let it sit for a white. 2nd week was good too. On the begining of 3rd week I started felling that my scalp is becoming sticky in front and top only. After 2 days it was like scotch tape. I did not know what happened. I though first that its to much fish oil that Im taking. Or to much vitamis. But I take normal dose because I work out every day at the gym. I tried to wash it with different shampoo and it got worst. After good 4 days of not using DS Laboratories Revita Shampoo it slowly went away. I stopped taking vitamins and after 2 weeks tried to use it again and guess what happened? The stickiness came back after 2 days. I cant say it helps regrow your hair because I could not use it for more than 3 months.    I sent email the the company but never got any replies.    Overall I only give 2 because its a nice smelling shampoo. But I have not seen any review complainging about it yet. If any one else had the same problem let me know.</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells nice. I have used it for 3 month. I felt my baby hair that had never be able to grow long has become longer and stronger. My hair loss during shower is much less than before.     My only complaint is this shampoo is too wastery as many others pointed out. I have to use a lot more than I would like to get enough foam and feel like my hair is clean.</li>
    <li> 1st I must say this stuff does work. I definitely see less hairs in the shower drain. I don&#x27;t think this regrows hair but it does help you keep what you have which is good for people in the beginning stages of hair loss. This stuff also expands your hair and makes it look more thick so now its hardly noticeable that my hair is thinning.    I have read several reviews and it looks as though this seller is diluting the shampoo. When I got this it was only 3/4 full and it was very watery. I didn&#x27;t think anything of it until I bought another batch from another seller that sells this in a bigger bottle http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004F1TGLY/ref&#x3D;oss_product. The shampoo from the other seller was very thick. I would definitely stay away from this seller and buy from a different seller. The big bottle is definitely more bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> In just 2 weeks time, my hair is not falling out by the handful, just a few 5 or 6 come out after shampooing!</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product. I used this product when I was 19 years old, when I starting showing small signs of male pattern baldness. I used it for nearly 6 months and I am glad that I stopped using it. I am a male with and still a full head of hair at the age of 22. The product thinned my hair due to the shedding phases, while uses this product. Please stop using it if you still shed after the 4-6 weeks phase. It will take awhile for your hair to completely come back if you dont. If you are like me, who is young and showed very smalls signs of male pattern baldness in the back, just go with minoxidil (kirkland). I having been using it over a year and it took care of my problems with my hair. Not sure how long its going to last, but my hair looks exactly the same when I was in my teens.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for a little over 8 months and here is what Ive noticed:    Pros:    - Thickens hair almsot immediately. Once i switched off this shampoo for a few months my hair looked limp and oily. When I came back to this product, my hair became thicker and fuller. It also cut down on the oil produced by my scalp.    - Cleans hair better than head and shoulders. Since switching to his product I have not noticed any dandruff at all. Even head and shoulders would give me some flakes.    - Bottle lasts a while. It takes a very small amount to lather your hair.    - Smells nice. Personal opinion.        Cons:    - Bottle may arrive broken. This is becoming more and more common.    - WILL NOT REGROW HAIR. This simply thickens your hair so it appears fuller. My small bald spot is still there despite using this for almost a year.    - Expesive.</li>
    <li> I started out with the 180ml bottle didnt notice much changes but I kept on using the shampoo so I bought the 1lt bottle. COmpletely different composition. For it to work the consistance has to be waxy and very very bright orange color. if its somewhat liquid it doesnt work. I would suggest you get the 1lt. I&#x27;ll upload some pics in a few days</li>
    <li> Not worth it. Doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe what it claims. This will not re-grow your hair. The best results I&#x27;ve had is slowing down daily hair loss but nothing more. I continue to use it just to keep the loss at a minimum but over the 2 years that I have been using it, I have seen no areas of improvement on my scalp. A little bit goes a long way so the bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the negative reviews on here.  The ingredients of this product are state of the art in a combination offered no where else.  The antioxidant and anti-androgen ingredients make this also an EXCELLENT acne face wash.  If teenage boys used this as a shampoo and face wash and continued into adulthood, their skin and hair would remain young and clear well into their 40&#x27;s.  The people putting up negative review are either &#x27;plants&#x27; from competitors or they had an allergy to one of the ingredients, neither of which constitute a valid review.  This product&#x27;s ingredients are proven, are backed up by science and when used by a person who tolerates the ingredients, the results are what are claimed by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I started losing hair when I was 23 years old.  At first I was in denial, and two years later, I realized I should do something about it because my hair was getting thinner and thinner.  This shampoo was the first thing I tried.  I washed my hair with this shampoo almost everyday morning (5 to 7 days a week) for a year.  I went through seven bottles of these.  It did not work for me.  It didn&#x27;t grow new hair or stop hair loss.  It volumizes hair, and smells nice, but that&#x27;s not what the shampoo is for.  Also, it lightened my hair color.  I have very dark brown hair.  Using this shampoo made it turn a little lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After quitting this shampoo, I started Propecia (finasteride) and minoxidil and had good results.  A few months later, hairloss stopped (noticeably fewer fallen hairs on the drain every morning), and by six months, the top of the head where I was thinning got well covered in hair again (use to be able to see the scalp skin when looking straight at bathroom mirror (like when you are brushing teeth, etc.), but now it is barely visible due to new hair growth).  I have been using them for over two years now, and I&#x27;m maintaining the results. I have been using minoxidil on top, front and temples.  My top looks as good as when I first noticed the result years ago, and my front hairline receded only slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I learned from this experience is that when something is extensively studied and tested through clinical trials and have FDA approval (such as Propecia and minoxidil), I should try those first instead of alternatives with little to no research or clinical trials to back up the claim.  I tried the shampoo first because I was hoping for a cheap solution, and I tried it even though there was barely any evidence of its effectiveness other than speculative information about the ingredients and some positive reviews in Amazon.com.  In hindsight, if I was going to try it based on those, I should have put more trust on Propecia and minoxidil for their research and clinical trials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this review so you don&#x27;t make the same mistake I made and waste time and money, especially time since longer you wait, more hair loss you will have, and getting back what you lost is harder than maintaining it.  Using Propecia and minoxidil will cost more (~$500 per year vs ~$160 for this shampoo), but it&#x27;s your hair we are talking about.  Please make the informed decision, and I hope this helped.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo. I actually dilute 50% with water and it works fine for me. While it doesn&#x27;t regrow hair, it seems to stop loss. I will continue to buy and use.</li>
    <li> I like the product and have been purchasing from Amazon market place for a while now, the last bottle that I bought was bad, shampoo was thick as pudding, strange color, I definitely won&#x27;t use it so I return it.   During the past year, I had seen on different bottles some inconsistencies (a bit different color from batch to batch, thickness of the liquid etc  on the product but this one was unacceptable.</li>
    <li> I ordered from Amazon this shampoo and it was O.K. Nothing special.  I decided to give it another shot and actually ordered from the company itself and  it was a completely different product. The one I ordered from Amazon was clearly  watered down, and I&#x27;ve read other reviews who say the same. So if you wan to try this  product I advise not ordering from Amazon. The shampoo makes my hair feel great, and we  will see how the regrowth works out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these products. I am a hair stylist and losing my hair has affected more than the average man. Especially looking in the mirror on a daily basis. The shampoo and conditioner are fantastic, and I&#x27;ve used MANY! As with anything out there, some people will be more sensitive. Not everyone can use everything. I find it to be very gentle, moisturizing and light. Lather is good. Just emulsify and distribute evenly. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that my growth with DNC has seemed to plateau after about 8 months. A DS Labs educator advised me to switch to DNC-L for men as it&#x27;s more potent. He also recommended the use of the new F7. I&#x27;ll give it a try. It&#x27;s been good up to this point minus the plateau. Even my mother who never notices anything saw a difference since I&#x27;ve been using these products. I felt compelled as a stylist to share my experience. I hope that it&#x27;s helpful!</li>
    <li> I am 17 right now (yes, I&#x27;m already losing my hair) and like any teenager, I don&#x27;t wanna lose my hair. I began losing my hair really bad about 6 months ago and I read that I should do something about the problem now. So I bought this product, not really expecting any miracles. First, the shampoo feels amazing and really feels likes its doing something. Second, I&#x27;ve only used it for a week now and I&#x27;ve see a SIGNIFICANT difference in hair loss when I wash my hair. I still lose hair, but its not covering all of my hands like it used to. I&#x27;m not expecting to have long locks of hair by using this shampoo, but I am very impressed and happy so far. Lets see what happens in the coming weeks</li>
    <li> Well, here goes my 1st review I ever done.   I don&#x27;t get it, I&#x27;m paying for a product that cost me close to $30. The lid wasn&#x27;t properly working when i got it, and when i opened it, it turned out that the container was only 3/4, maybe 3/5 full. I dont remember ordering Potato chips, from them Id be lucky if its even half full. So whats the deal?  Update: As many 1 and 2 stars as 5 star rating. Obviously something isn&#x27;t right here.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this stuff actually regrows hair but it&#x27;s actually a good shampoo.  This shampoo won&#x27;t work miracles but it only takes a few drops to lather up and work well.</li>
    <li> Look, I bought it from the other reviews, but it must be fake or something, it almost made me BALD! My hair wasn&#x27;t falling as much before. It is really bad, DONT BUY IT!</li>
    <li> for its claimed &#x27;state of the art&#x27; technology, this shampoo does nothing but increases and worsens hair loss. i have used it for around 3 weeks, and has suffered from increased hair loss per shower. very disappointed esp since how effective it claims itself as.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely worth the price that you pay for it. After trying many shampoos I finally came across this. It does exactly what I wanted it to do. Don&#x27;t expect to regrow your hair over night however, constant use is necessary. This is perfect for those that are in the initial stages of balding, because this STOPS it while you are using the product. DO NOT stop taking it after you see results, or you will begin losing again.</li>
    <li> First off let me say that I did not buy this product on Amazon, but ended up looking it up on Amazon to see if I could get a better deal on it because of its high cost.  I bought it from a specialty salon in Minneapolis called Fantasia that is geared toward helping woman that have lost hair due to cancer, and other unfortunate circumstances. I was in with a friend and the stylist highly recommended it. I bought the Specrtal DNC-L for my husband, who has been loosing hair since he was 19, and the shampoo and conditioner to share between the two of us.  I took pics of his head the day before using the products for the first time just in case they do work, I wanted proof:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have only been using the products for 2 weeks so I can&#x27;t comment on magical hair growth, but I can say that neither of us have experienced shedding or greater hair loss. I also noticed that my dry scalp flaking is gone. Not sure if I can attribute that to the product or to the fact that I&#x27;m more mindful to wash it all out leaving my head gunk free. My hair is mid back and the volume that I get from this product is just amazing.  I assumed from the beginning that I would need an additional conditioning product due to the small amount they recommend you use. Here is what&#x27;s worked for me...when I put the conditioner on my scalp I also slather Suave conditioner (it&#x27;s what was in the shower) on my ends and leave both on for the two minutes the instructions say to.  Then I wash ALL of it out as best as possible, towel dry and follow it all with the light Moroccan Oil (that I did buy from Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again I can&#x27;t confirm hair growth, but my fine hair has never had more volume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I asked the stylist about any formula change issues which she couldn&#x27;t confirm of deny, but she did state that they will be changing the bottle structure in the near future.  Could that mean that they are listening to their customers complaints and going back to the tried and true? Who knows, butif you want to try it get it from the company or a trusted retailer.  Chemicals do break down and IF the product that is being sold here is old, it&#x27;s not a far reach to conclude that aging product might be at the root (every pun intended) of the problem.</li>
    <li> Giving this a 5, I was using Rogain foam in the evenings, and this in the mornings while I was in Iraq last year.  I ended up with full head of hair, I was happy I stopped using this when it ran out - went to nothing and hair gradually fell out:(  Started back up with just Rogaine foam about a month ago seeing little to nothing from it so going back to the mixture and hoping it works out this time.  I was extremely happy with this product last time and this was after all the complaints of it being watered down so fully expecting to be happy with it again:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product, and I can tell you it has worked Better for me than the Rogaine Foam, but mixing the two together seems to work AWESOME, going back to taht forumla for some more hair LOL.</li>
    <li> My hair started thinning when I was 18 and I have always had a very dry scalp. I bought this along with some minoxidil to try and stop my hair from thinning. I have used Head and Shoulders for my dry scalp for years. Since I started using this I have not used the H&amp;S once. For me it is a great shampoo that I will continue to purchase regardless of the hair growth properties. Both my wife and me have noticed that my hair does seem a little bit thicker but I dont see it growing like crazy.</li>
    <li> the shampoo is pretty good. i used it as instructed on the bottle    Pros  My hair is a little thicker   My hair doesnt get so oily as it used to (before i got this shampoo my hair got really oily i had to wash my hair every single day, sometimes twice a day)   The shampoo smells great &amp; you dont need alot small amout goes along way  1 bottle almost lasted me a whole 3 months    Cons  My hair is still falling i notice it falling when i pass my hands through my hair &amp; when i brush my hair    I&#x27;ll still be buying the shampoo though.</li>
    <li> Sodium lareth sulfate and sodium laryl sulfate, present in cheap shampoo&#x27;s, are poisonous to hair, cells and quite alot of other things! One of them is actually used as a positive control in the Ames assay for one of the Salmonella thyphimurium strains! The other reason I switched to this is because the minoxidil product I was using caused very greasy hair, alot of dandruff and a build up of sebum on the scalp. This product thoroughly cleans the hair, makes it physically thicker and also increases the effectiveness of minoxidil. And as it contains substances which are good for the hair, it will certainly slow hair loss and maintain a high quality of your existing hair, kinda acting as preventative medicine, but realistically it will not grow your hair back without minoxidil!</li>
    <li> I started to use this shampoo about 6 months ago.  Each bottle lasted up to 4 weeks at the most, maybe I like to consume more than other people (about a quarter size each wash).  Smell is great and I used to have acne scalps which bothering me.&lt;br /&gt;My thinning hair pattern was receding front hairline and thinning top area (not bald).  Before starting to use this shampoo, I examined my hair line carefully (especially the front top area) and I know how much hair I had at one corner spot (I counted it 8 pieces of hair separated by other area).&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about 6 weeks on my 2nd bottle, I almost quit using it.  Then I looked up closely to a mirror and examined more carefully, to my surprised that I found a few more new hair growing in that area.  Now, in that specific area, it doubled the counts at least and some other area that I didn&#x27;t pay too much attention, I could see more new hairs and more dense.  Very very pleased....., with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I bought a bottle of Ds Laboratories Spectral.dnc-l Topical Treatment for Advanced Stages of Baldness after reviewing more DS Products at amazon.  I only used for about a week now, and I can&#x27;t give any review on this product yet.  However, I am optimistic that it will expedite my hair growth.  Patience is the key to success in anything, and believe in it.  Give it sometime, I like to use it more than the suggested amount.  I can&#x27;t believe some people said it will last for 4 to 6 months in one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I always look for the price drop (best price I found was $18 per bottle) and I think it is worth it.  Think about how much money it will cost you to have a hair implants surgery which I was seriously considered.  Glad that I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> My hair stopped falling out the fist day I used it but i did instilled a Inline Shower Filter to remove Chlorine from my shower one week befor useing this.</li>
    <li> Be careful not to purchase based on generally positive reviews. I purchased for that reason, and I had good initial experience with this product last year, however when I used for 2 months this year I paid dearly - BIG MISTAKE! Ive used the Nioxin system, Head and Shoulders, and several other different products over the years - some worked some didn&#x27;t - but by using this product I took enormous steps backwards!&lt;br /&gt;Yes I know, You are supposed to lose some initially, and then it will supposedly slow and grow back exponentially. I waited, I gave it the benefit of the doubt way too long. From the first day of the recent treatment hair loss accelerated, sometimes 20- 30 hairs coming off in my hands during shampooing - more throughout the day. I waited and waited and after 2 months the top of my scalp was clearly visible from any angle even in low light.&lt;br /&gt;When you suffer premature hair loss you cant afford to lose what you have left! I finally ran back to my first love - Nioxin, and my hair is filling in and the damage is slowly being repaired. Don&#x27;t buy this product... unless you can afford to lose what&#x27;s left.</li>
    <li> The product is GREAT!          BUT dont buy from amazon. Every bottle I get leaks and is half empty by the time I get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I cannot tolerate Rogaine (minoxidil), because my blood pressure is on the low side.  When I used it, I got light-headed and came very close to passing out.  I even tried cutting the dose from 1 ml to 0.5 ml, and then again to 0.25 ml. (That was of the regular 5% strength, applied topically, without any open wounds or anything that would make it enter the bloodstream more quickly than it should.)  And I&#x27;m afraid of taking finasteride, because of its side effects.  So that has caused me to look for alternative treatments that are proven to be effective.  This product has a lot of beneficial ingredients in it that have research to back up that they have a positive effect on mitigating alopecia.  What initially drew me to it was a study that I came across regarding ketoconazole (pubmed link: [...]).  I initially used a store brand equivalent of Nizoral shampoo.  After a few days of using it, I noticed that I was shedding a lot less hair in the shower while shampooing, and it did not have any side-effects like the minoxidil gave me.  I even tried the the brand name Nizoral, to see if it were any better, but I noticed no difference, so I switched back to generic products.  I went through a few bottles of ketoconazole shampoos, before I came across Revita.  I don&#x27;t know if it works better with all of the other active ingredients, but it works at least just as well as the store brand ketoconazole shampoo in halting hair loss.  What makes it better though is the pleasant smell and the way your hair feels after shampooing.  Nizoral and it&#x27;s store brand generics leave your hair and scalp very dry.  Revita makes your hair much softer and healthier looking.  The price is also roughly the same as other shampoos that have only ketoconazole.  Even the generic store brand shampoos cost around $20.  So if you are going to add ketoconazole to your alopecia regimen, I highly recommend this over other brands/generics.  So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any substantial hair regrowth from using ketoconazole for about 6 months, but it is at least keeping the hair on my head in place.</li>
    <li> I will buy this again .. I do see some new growth (thinning due to stress from family illness and death) ...</li>
    <li> Great product and awesome price! Everything that was promised in the advertisment. The shipping was very fast and had not issues. I have purchased this same product about 5 times.</li>
    <li> yeah I should of know not to purchase this product but did so under direction of hairstylist.  very disappointing. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I initally came about this product as a gift. I used it regularly for the last 3 months and it left my hair vary soft and nice looking. Plus there was this freshness in my scalp that felt very nice in deed. So I bought another bottle from Amazon last week and this thing is nothing like the product I used before. It is a much thicker formula that sticks to everything, my hair, scalp, hands. Even after I rinse it leaves my hair like a sticky mess. I see now that some people have had the same problem, and that they are getting replacements directly from the company. If the company knew there was a problem with a batch of their product, why didn&#x27;t they recall it from Amazon in the first place? I will not trust this company ever again, no matter what they claim or how many products they replace. Their lack of consideration for consumers is enough to steer clear from them, forever. -JV</li>
    <li> Excellent item!  Excellent item! Just exactly what I was looking for.. Love it! Grrrreat... Great... Great... great...Love this alot... Highly recommend. Satisfied!</li>
    <li> I still use this shampoo as it is the best for my head.  But sadly, it isn&#x27;t even 80% as good as it was a year ago.  As another poster mentioned, this product was simply fantastic, but now it feels like they are just riding their own coat tails.  Which is too bad, because they will not retain their customers or get new ones this way at all.  I&#x27;m posting a 1/5 stars on the sheer fact that this product is losing quality, but it is still a 3/5 for most, and 4/5 of me personally.</li>
    <li> Agree with others who say the formulation of this has changed.  In fact my Dermatologist no longer recommends this to patients with hair loss</li>
    <li> Had to replace Nioxin after 8 years since they changed their formula. You can feel this invigorating your head again. Leaves hair looking thicker and softer.</li>
    <li> I just bought this and I was so excited to use it. After using the shampoo just once I noticed a big difference in my hair. It is much fuller, voluminous, and sleek. It gave my hair volume without making it frizzy. I have been suffering from limp thinning hair and it would fall out frequently. Since using this I have less hair falling out. I also have an oily scalp and cant go one day without washing it but with this shampoo I was able to. My hair is my natural hair color and I don&#x27;t treat it but I do style it with hot tools frequently. You have to shampoo your hair twice whenever you use it as per the instructions and in the shower my scalp feels invigorated and like a cool tingling while you let it sit for a few minutes. After I used it I let my hair air dry before styling and it usually gets frizzy but not when I used this shampoo. I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.</li>
    <li> The only thing wrong with this item is the dispensing top. For some reason it does not have a well made top and leaks shampoo constantly.As for the product itself I am not at the point to say. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and don&#x27;t really see any visual difference. I would imagine if this product is to live up to its claim it would need to be used for a longer duration. I have my fingers crossed though. I am using this shampoo and the DS Cor conditioner along with one of there topical treatments with Nanoxodil. I would think using these three items as a system I should get results quicker? It has only been about a month so I will be able to provide a better review in a bit. DS if you read this please take all of my concerns into consideration. I think at your price point your product should be flawless and should do everything it claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLIST</li>
    <li> Ive been using the shampoo for around 3-4 weeks now and I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the results. I give revita a 3 star rating because I like the smell, feel of the product when I use it (I use 7 days a week not 5 like it &#x27;recommends&#x27;). I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the price-but if the stuff works I&#x27;ll keep dishing out the $$$$.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had frontal thinning for about 2 years now. I have been using rogaine with minimal results so I wanted to up my anty with revita. I had the unrealistic goal of growing a thicker, fuller, 18 year old head of hair I took for granted just 3 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product from a clean slate. I buzzed my hair to the scalp. It&#x27;s been around 3-4 weeks now and I have noticed the hair seems to have regrown a bit quicker than usual when growing back from a buzz..but there is still that embarrassing thinning around my front. I THINK  I&#x27;m noticing some small, new hairs growing in the thin areas but my roommate quickly shoots down my hopes with wisecracks because he still has a full head of hair up top so he doesn&#x27;t understand the self-esteem issues this thinning can bring. I haven&#x27;t been around my family in several months so I&#x27;m eager to go home and get a real unbiased opinion of my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will post again if I notice anything worth confessing on a message board. I&#x27;m the most skeptical guy ever so I don&#x27;t want to read any bs I just want the truth and I hope my experience can in some way help anyone else battling the balding beast.</li>
    <li> First off, I am celebrating the one year anniversary of continual use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I do not believe this shampoo will help someone who has significant male pattern baldness.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I have done considerable research on the ingredient package and believe that this product is good for the promotion of healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Over a 12 month period of daily use, I have not lost additional hair.  I do not have MPB but, due to aging have noticed typical, gradual thinning over the years.&lt;br /&gt;4.  If you use this product, make sure you use a good conditioner as it will leave your hair somewhat dry and brittle.  Revita makes one but it has a tendency to leave the hair (especially fine hair) heavy and oily looking).&lt;br /&gt;5.  Regarding non-prescription shampoos, this one is as good as it is going to get.&lt;br /&gt;6.  As this product is fairly expensive, wash your hair the first time with a less expensive, quality shampoo.  Then rinse well and use the Revita.  Leave it on for 5 minutes or so.  You will need less of the Revita shampoo to lather up if you do it this way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few shampoos for male pattern baldness and I keep coming back to Revita. I used to have sore hair follicles (not sure if that&#x27;s a symptom of the condition) but after using Revita, the soreness stopped. The product also smells quite nice. I use it as part of a regimen that also includes supplements so I can&#x27;t say for sure how much Revita is helping my condition, but my hair seems to like it. Be sure to let it sink into your scalp, don&#x27;t just wash it out right away. My only complaint is that the packaging is not very good. The shampoo is bright orange and tends to ooze out the top and leak everywhere. I would be extremely careful travelling with a bottle of Revita in my suitcase. If they fix the packaging, the product would be greatly improved.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t understand why some people lost hair on this shampoo. i read these reviews initially and it made me switch to Regene Pure which did nothing for my hair. This is the only shampoo on the market that actually regrows hair. However, i don&#x27;t have MPB, but I lost hair several times because of either new medication or a crash diet. It regrew with the help of this shampoo and minoxidil. I also take propecia just in case</li>
    <li> The good thing about this product is that it did not dry out my hair like the Nioxin System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT, however, have the scalp revitalizing effects of the Nioxin 1 System.  I won&#x27;t buy this again, as it did not make my scalp look healthy (white color, instead of flesh tone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $23, I don&#x27;t think it is worth it.  I also tried a different kind, an organic shampoo in a brown hand pump bottle, but again, nothing seems to work as well as the Nioxin.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so drying on the hair...</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this shampoo. I actually can see that it helps with my hair loss and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on the reviews also.  A big mistake.  The bottles pooled the product in the space under the opening and the shampoo bottle leaks also.  I had to use alot of shampoo to get any lather.  I was assured that if it did not work I could get a refund, and I have been trying to contact the site by phone and email.  The mail box is full!!!!!  any ideas how to contact someone?</li>
    <li> no results. This product is not for everyone. especially for black people hair. Need to make a different products. nope!!!!!</li>
    <li> Okay as a shampoo if you like chemically stuff, but didn&#x27;t work at all to make my hair fuller. I went to an all organic natural shampoo and it seems to be working better.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t feel any change or any new hair just waisted my money and time on a regular shampoo hopefully others have better results with this</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works, but iam still using it hoping that it is helping me keep what i have on my head.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 2 years. My hair is very thin and fragile on the top due to heredity as well as medications. I also received a chemical burn from a bad perm. I had a huge bald spot. I started using this everyday and now have much fuller and thicker hair. It has made a BIG difference. I shampoo my hair with daily shampoo first, then I leave this on as a second shampoo then follow with creme rinse. I do not recommend using this as your only shampoo since it does not help it feel and style the way I wanted it to.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Makes the scalp feel tingly. I have noticed a difference over time that not as much hair can be found in the drain of the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given it a few months now and I can saw with confidence that it didn&#x27;t grow any noticeable amount of new hair. However, I believe it did stop or minimize the amount of hair falling out. I think it took about a week or so for it to take effect but hair loss so almost absent now. I have used rogaine and nutricap and Kirkland before and I had little success. I was actually allergic to rogaine and Kirkland. I stopped using those almost immediately after I got really red and itchy,</li>
    <li> This shampoo is possibly the best on the market, even without considering the \\&quot;hair growth stimulating\\&quot; effects.  The mostly natural ingredients leave hair soft and smooth, with no residue as with some other shampoos.  When used in combination with a product containing minoxidil (such as Spectral DNC-L or Dualgen-15), it shows great results in restoring hair growth in areas that were previously receding.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now, and am thrilled with the results.  Each bottle lasts roughly 3 months with daily usage, and for the price it&#x27;s a great bargain.  I would recommend this stuff to anyone looking for a quality shampoo that doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates or sulfides and leaves your hair feeling wonderfully soft and clean.</li>
    <li> When I first received this I should have suspected that there were going to be problems with the container due to the fact that it was already leaking a bit in the box. Upon checking I found that it had a very sensitive push-release top that probably gave way a bit. As it hadn&#x27;t leaked too badly I decided against returning it and used it regularly for the next month. As a shampoo it&#x27;s alright, it seems pretty watery but you don&#x27;t need much to lather properly, and it has a light sweet smell. I really didn&#x27;t notice any particular difference in my hair one way or another, it was clean and manageable although I can&#x27;t say it was any thicker. I had a little under half a bottle left after a month of use. However when I took it with me on a trip, I found upon opening my toiletry case that the touchy push-top had been released and leaked the remaining half all over the case. Maybe if the shampoo had a thicker base it might not have leaked so bad, but since it has the consistency of water it probably poured out pretty quickly. Looking at some of the other reviews I see I&#x27;m not the only one to have had leaking problems with the container, which is a shame because I was prepared to give it a try for a few months. But I&#x27;m in no rush to pay another 25 dollars for a shampoo with faulty packaging, no matter what the shampoo claims to do.</li>
    <li> However it arrived leaking, all lost in the package. Amazon was very good at refunding my order. However i was left with a tiny amount of it, just enough to try. Since then the price gone up. I plan to reorder only when the price drops below $20 again</li>
    <li> I used two bottles of this product and followed the directions exactly. My thinning hair just got worse and I have stopped using it and it seems a little better now.    I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this - it did keep my scalp moisturized to a good level.</li>
    <li> This past June I purchased the shampoo in the pursuit of hairgrowth and assist with my thinning hairline.  I used the product per the attached directions and did not notice any significant hairgrowth or slowing of my hair getting thinner.  In fact I noticed that my hairline was getting thinner since I had been using the product for 6-8 weeks. I noticed better results with Nioxin System 1 Cleanser &amp; Scalp Therapy.  For the price you pay and for only 180 ml, including lack of results, I would not suggest purchasing this product.  (If DS Laboratories would like to contact me regarding this review, please do).</li>
    <li> second time around for this duo, i like the small, its good shampoo &amp; conditioner BUT my hair does grow grow any fuller, faster or anything like that..&lt;br /&gt;Maybe more time is needed.. but I&#x27;m out of the &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I been thrilled about the quality of this shampoo since I started using it in June last year. It&#x27;s expensive but a little goes a long way and over the course of a year my hair is def much thicker, my hair loss is almost the same as it was before but I think it&#x27;s sped up hair generation as I have more hair on the top of my scalp. Folks have commented on that so it&#x27;s not a borderline improvement, my wife for example swears my hair has improved significantly, when I visited my Mom after a year she couldnt believe what I was doing (BTW, I also take Avodart and have been on it for 5 years, however the Revita took the improvements from Avodart to another level). It reeks of quality.    HOWEVER:    Starting this summer (around June-Aug) the shampoo feels watery, and worse leaves a sticky residue in my hair that shows the scalp. It&#x27;s not oil, I went to a dermatologist as it is does not come off no matter how much you rinse or wash. I tried shampoos, dish washing detergent etc. The hair feels waxy, clumpy and stays that way, worse, it looks like that right after a shower where I feel I have gel in my hair. I finally used T-Gel (Neutrogena) which seems to slowy get rid of it over the course of weeks but the &#x27;gelled greasy&#x27; look is still slightly there (but much less).    I ordered another two in Aug, same thing. The dermatologist said it was not a fungus (at that point I wasnt 100% what was causing it and was going crazy, but knew that the stickness started after I started a new bottle of Revita but wanted to confirm) and he suspected the shampoo had some thickening agent (glue like substance). I contacted Revita recently, let&#x27;s see. Meanwhile, I cannoot use the product. The good news is I read another persons comment to this problem below (JK&#x27;s reply to Cheng&#x27;s note). Apparently JK reached out to Revita who acknowledged this is a problem with a batch in the summer, they are replacing affected bottles for free if you contact them.I have reached out to them myself, hope to hear a confirmation on the issue and have my bottles replaced as I want to continue to use the shampoo but at this stage simply cannot.    I&#x27;m surprised staff from Revita are not reaching out to folks in these forums and other customers telling them about the problem as a solid shampoo is getting poor ratings (and in my case almost put me off using it). The only reason why I stuck around is that I&#x27;m an old customer and know what the shampoo can do and saw a drastic quality drop off suddently, however, new customers who bought this the first time will think it&#x27;s crap due to the problem with that batch (and this is reflected in the ratings here which heads south starting June-Sept)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
    <li> have not noticed a real change yet but will keep using long term as a preventative measure. Have only ever read good things about this product. Thanks. 3 more words blah blah blah</li>
    <li> It does what it says. I noticed new baby hairs growing at my crown. Very gentle and my hair is very shiny.</li>
    <li> Product arrived damaged.</li>
    <li> I waited several months (using the product) before doing this review in order to be as fair as possible. This product is borderline false advertising. It is expensive and I don&#x27;t think it really stimulates hair growth. Just so you know, I am not bald, I may have a receding hairline but I still have all my hair. And even so, this product hasn&#x27;t helped on making it thicker or more abundant. Not worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you are paying for the nice plastic container and the fancy packaging. Don&#x27;t take it with you while traveling as it will leak (the cap doesn&#x27;t do a good job keeping stuff in or our of the bottle). Avoid this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why some people are giving this incredible product 4 stars they should give it 5 stars in my opinion!    If for some reason this product it is not working for you ,it&#x27;s beacause YOU ARE NOT USING IT RIGHT..    I have been lossing my hair since i was 17 and i&#x27;m 29 and i gave up 4 years ago trying every product out there. I wish I would&#x27;ve used this product when i was 17 i would still have my beautiful long curlies,mannn    Anyways I was shaving my head recently until I met this girl and she told me to grow it and I told her that it won&#x27;t grow much and that the oily substance was very bad in head you know what I&#x27;m talking about you baldies out there right?    I&#x27;m going to give you guys my trick for regrowing my hair a lot. My hair it&#x27;s growing LIKE CRAZY now my receding hairlines are covering up and my hair it&#x27;s getting thicker. Not only it&#x27;s getting thicker BUT it&#x27;s not FALLLLLING OUT,,,that feels GREAT I tell you     OK OK MY SECRET!    ORIGINAL ROGAINE AND REVITA SHAMPOO!  THAT&#x27;S IT, it works    NOTE: please if you are completely BALD it would not work , Another thing I know they tell you that Rogaine only works in the BACK ,that is a lie it&#x27;s working for me everywhere!    PSS: Don&#x27;t buy the cheap minoxidil generic type buy the original Rogaine believe me it&#x27;s better</li>
    <li> I have been using Revita now for nearly 2 years. All results aside, I do like it as a shampoo. I keep my hair short so a bottle lasts several months. I have been having gradual hairloss for several years now. I started using Revita more as a preventative approach rather than trying to regrow what I have lost. My brother is 4 years younger than me and is completely bald on the top for a couple years now. My rate of loss is much, much less. While it has thinned, it has been very slow. I am happy with the product and will continue to use it. The product has changed over the last couple months. Before the shampoo was very thin, which caused it to leak from the container and was difficult to keep on your head for the required time. When I received my most recent order I found the product to be much thicker which allows me to use less. I like the new product much better. If you are looking for some sort of miracle shampoo that will grow hair on a bald head, I don&#x27;t think this is what you are looking for, but I certainly feel it helps slow the process. If you are young and noticing hair loss, I would certainly recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> The first bottle I bought was actually from my girlfriend who worked at a salon and got it from her store.It worked great and the results were amazing, no exaggeration. After that I purchased it from amazon and the solution seemed to be different in quality and it didn&#x27;t work at all. Didn&#x27;t create &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; or produce any growth.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. It&#x27;s really helped to slow down my hair loss while not being so super expensive like many other similar products. Try it and see it if does the shame for you. It tingles on your scalp Nd this lets you know it&#x27;s working by stimulating your hair follicles.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all as advertised, however does leave a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this it doesn&#x27;t work. In fact I probably lost more hair the time I used it.</li>
    <li> Initially, I was pretty skeptical about the effects of the shampoo. However, after i have been using it for 3 month i can assure you it works 100%. Before, i needed a hair cut once in 2-3 month. Now i see hair stylist monthly. Even though i&#x27;ve used it in combination with Vichy Dercos Amenexil Pro i&#x27;m still confident that the product works. 100% recommended!</li>
    <li> This seems to be the same product as I receive from my stylist.  It has worked really good for me.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price. Buy something from Crew for less money.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely great. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different shampoos in the past and this is by far the best one.  I think it is still early to ensure it&#x27;s working for making my hair regrow, but at this moment (2 weeks using it) I can say that the feeling is great, dandruff is gone, my hair loss is minimum, and my hair looks great.  I definitely will keep buying this shampoo from now on.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome so far.  Normal shedding for a couple weeks and then significantly decreased shedding. Been using for 1 and 1/2 months and am impressed.  Hair loss isn&#x27;t bad yet, but it seems like this product may help keep it where it is.  I have a good amount of experience using hair loss products/doing research and this seems to be a winner so far. Other than stopping the fallout, this product also makes my hair look awesome. I have no clue what people meant by \\&quot;watery\\&quot; or leaving a sticky residue.  Nothing but thick clean hair and significantly decreased shedding.  I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER &amp; I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE HOW QUICK IT COMES IN THE MAIL.  MY HAIR IS SO HEALTHY, LONG AND THICK!</li>
    <li> I wish I could say it helped but there&#x27;s no proof after using the product for over a year. What I can confirm is that the bottle sucks. It weeps the product and leaves a mess. Why can&#x27;t they use a normal plastic bottle.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd bottle I have purchased &amp; found it good enough to send my son a bottle, who has male pattern baldness. I don&#x27;t know if this will grow enough hair to call it a wonder shampoo, however, my son &amp; I both agree that our scalp does not itch, our hair feels fuller and healthier. I see more growth, but am not sure yet if it is my imagination or for real. It will take a few months yet to know the difference. However, since it makes my scalp feel so much better I will stick with it even though it is not an inexpensive product. Obviously I think it is worth the price - just do not expect miracles.</li>
    <li> This shampoo caused my head to break out and at the same time didn&#x27;t help my hair.  I do have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I found Revita shampoo to be very harsh on my hair (shoulder length, color-treated and very fine). The shampoo itself is like glue and you need a lot of product to lather it through your hair. After using this shampoo my hair became the consistency of wool and was extremely difficult and painful to untangle, even after using a thick hydrating conditioner; it stripped my hair color and caused unwanted breakage. I had to stop using it because it was killing my hair so I never got to experience the potential benefits. If your hair is longer or color-treated you may want to use Nioxin for color-treated hair or Aveda Invati instead of Revita.</li>
    <li> Since the very first time I used the shampoo I had a minor shedding, and developed some sort fo dandruff (cant say if it was), so i kind of panicked.  But continue to use it, since I thought all that might be, due to the reaction of the cleaning it was doing to my scalp, and if it helped so many people; i could not believe I was the exception.  2 weeks later, Im OK, no more shedding and the \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; is gone.</li>
    <li> just like other hair products that make promises, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I just started to use it. I wont be able to tell if it works until a&lt;br /&gt;Month or two.</li>
    <li> This is a great volumizing shampoo, but after 6 months of use I can&#x27;t say it has done much more than that. The description seems like this will restore hair, but it doesn&#x27;t explicitly say it will. As others mentioned, the cap design is flawed as the cap will leak if you leave the bottle standing on the cap. The obvious fix for that is to not stand the bottle on the cap. I will probably continue use of this product as it is a great shampoo, but with no expectation that my hair will &#x27;actually grow&#x27; thicker.</li>
    <li> I purchased two bottles and used it as prescribed, but I didn&#x27;t see any results whatsoever. I even supplemented the shampoo with apple phenol tablets and still no visible results. Quite frankly, I think the only thing that works is Minoxidil or Rogaine. My dermotologist said if I wanted to regrow or even keep the hair I had to use it, so I&#x27;m going back to minoxidil. These other products are phony, money-making promotions!</li>
    <li> These hair revitalizing products are very confusing and misleading but i tried this and it seemed to have worked in conjunction with the conditioner. this is the shampoo and i recommend you get both and use them together for good or the best results</li>
    <li> I swear by this Shampoo! My hair was badly damaged from bad coloring techniques. After a good hair cut I started using this Shampoo and the Condioner. I think it made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I actually didn&#x27;t purchase these through amazon, but thought id share my results.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Revita shampoo along with the Spectral DNC spray and Revita conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience didn&#x27;t start off to well. The bottles were leaking all over the place(must be very cheap bottles)&lt;br /&gt;I applied everything as instructed and waited patiently for some results.  Unfortunately after a month of use, not only did it NOT work, but i actually lost more hair with the products. My receding hairline is about 1/4\\&quot; higher now! My thin spots are now bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did take before and after pictures, but i wont even need the pictures as the horrible results are so obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay AWAY from these products.  They help lose hair, not regrow it.</li>
    <li> My hair feels fuller and thicker, but I don&#x27;t know if it is the shampoo itself or the combination of the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I dont like about this product though...&lt;br /&gt;The price, they want you to use this product at least 5 times a week....but you have to use it twice per wash, you put it in first for a miunte then wash it out, then you have to put it in again, wait several minutes, then use the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that this shampoo seems to seperate and pieces of it fall out on my hands when lathering it up....plus you have to use quite a bit to get a good lather going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the fact that you technically are using the shampoo twice 5 days a week it runs out fairly quicker than other shampoos and you need to buy more. I had mine 2 months and it is almost finished (that is even after skipping some days). The conditioner bottle is still full though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a good product, gives good results...but they need to work on making it lather up better, and not have pieces fall out, make it more of a liquid and not so dry.</li>
    <li> We just got the item and it was all over the place, the shampoo was open and half the contant was spilled.</li>
    <li> Good product! Good shampoo... Does not irritate the skin &amp; makes the hair more solid... Not falling out anymore! Try it... Better than losing the hair!</li>
    <li> After started to do workout in the GYM for one month, I found that I loss lots of hair during shower... After googled, I knew that intense exercise will raise testosterone that might cause hair loss. That&#x27;s way I brought this shampoo. I tried for one month, surprising noticed that hair loss problem is reduced. I barely found hair on the drain hole during showering. Also, I feel my hair is in good balance. Not too oil, not too dry. I read some reviewers commented that using this shampoo will cause dry hair. It didn&#x27;t happen on me (I&#x27;m form Asian, straight hair and thicker hair, and that might be the reason). Anyway, it&#x27;s really worth to give it a try!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These company products used to be great! I used the shampoo, conditioner, spray.&lt;br /&gt;It worked! NOT the case anymore. Production was moved to China, quality went down.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do a thing! All products already watery (diluted) and by smell &amp; results I can tell that formula changed! I was absolutely upset with my last shipment. Shampoo was like water VS. GEL like substance in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;I just switched to another brand, I see better results.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference does not leave your hair soft I wont buy again. Over priced as well.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me sorry. This maid my hair dry. And the smell of it is really funky! I could see this working for a male since they don&#x27;t really care about that stuff!</li>
    <li> Made my hair fall out.  This product did more to thin my hair than grow or thicken.  Be careful using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with the shampoo in terms of results...but the packaging is horrible.  First, the box is&lt;br /&gt;just stupid.  Second, the cap is overengineered for the worse.  I guess the idea is to make the bottle look bigger&lt;br /&gt;as you&#x27;re only getting 6 oz (most shampoos are at least 8).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to get all the shampoo out by turning it on its \\&quot;head,\\&quot; the next morning a good portion had leaked out. And it was snapped completely shut. Even if you keep it upright, over time you can see the clear cap filling up with wasted shampoo. Horrible design.  Just put a regular top on it, put it in a regular box, and pass the marketing savings on to the customer instead of trying to make it look like an 8 oz bottle of shampoo with only 6 oz&#x27;s in it. I&#x27;m curious if this is happening to other users.  It&#x27;s been the same for every bottle I used, to the point where now I take a full bottle, take the top off, and transfer it into another shampoo bottle with a regular snap top, throwing the useless empty bottle in the trash. Lastly, you really only need one application.  I use a little more than a quarter sized amount, lather and scrub, leave it on while I wash the rest of my body, and then rinse my head last.  It still works great. If you want to do two apps, just do the first with a tea tree shampoo, then hit it with the DS for 3-5 mins.  The drops are what really matters.</li>
    <li> I ordered my 1st bottle a month ago. I liked it and it said &amp;#34;made in the USA&amp;#34;. I ordered 2 more bottles and just received them. These bottles say &amp;#34;assembled in the USA from imported compounds&amp;#34;. I haven&#x27;t tried these 2 bottles yet and I doubt I will after reading reviews from other users saying that the formulation seems different and their hair is falling out after the label change. I can&#x27;t really rate whether or not the imported compounds work or not but just for changing a good thing, I can only rate it 2. I probably should only give it one, just for jumping on the bandwagon and leaving the USA...</li>
    <li> Thank you for this great product I just love this shampoo -- wish i would have discovered it a long time ago</li>
    <li> I used this product daily as instructed by the label and saw no regrowth or thickening.  Granted I didn&#x27;t see it thin any more, but I don&#x27;t know if I attribute this to the shampoo.  It didn&#x27;t smell bad like a lot of hair growth stimulators though.</li>
    <li> my hair growth is the same after even a month of usage, coming up on 2 months now.. maybe its not for everyone, but hey .. that&#x27;s what they say about every shampoo that doesn&#x27;t work for you.. i have yet to find one.... *USE AT YOUR OWN RISK*</li>
    <li> Well i tried different shampoo nothing worked . Just this shampoo it helps for hair loss because i dont have itching anymore no more dandruff this is really good product for hair my first review</li>
    <li> I am only three weeks in but I am seeing some growth&lt;br /&gt;I will post again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word word word word</li>
    <li> This is a product I used for almost 3 years, and it was great. They then changed the formula. I verified this with the manufacturer. The formula changed in March of 2011. You will be able to tell the new formula by its distinctive neon orange color. The old formula was a rather bland orange color.  Unfortunately, the new formula causes my hair to fall out. What was once an all star product, is now just a bench warmer (too bad). R&amp;D is supposed to improve a product, not regress it. I have since changed to the Bosley hair treatment shampoo and conditioner, and no more hair loss.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews about anything! But believe me I do think this product deserves it!!&lt;br /&gt;I come from a mother and FATHER that have not lost their hair even if they are in their 70´s  but I inherited the same qualities as theirs. I have baby thin hair that besides not growing more than top of my shoulder length is brittle and brakes very easily. I used the smallest hairband from goody and did it 3 times around so I could hold a pony tail!! After using this shampoo for 2 months I have noticed a thickening on my pony tail that I had to change to the normal hairband and of course do it 3 times around.  It has also grown longer faster although not as fast as I would like to.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair look very nice, soft n silky, plus the smell is also good..not sure about the hair growth though..Recommended!!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used for thinning hair. I&#x27;m younger, but have thinner looking hair. After using this for a couple months (along with the conditioner), I definitely see a difference. Doesn&#x27;t tingle like other stimulating shampoos (which I always liked, but since this one works, I like it better) and smells pretty good. Down sides are that it feels pretty cheap, like cheap drugstore shampoo, as well as having the WORST PACKING EVER! This bottle is a joke and product gets stuck in the cap and leaks all over the shower. I have orange drips all over. Still a good product, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am 60 years old with thinning, fine, color-treated hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo with the corresponding conditioner as directed for a month.  No new growth evident yet, but I will continue to use these products regardless because they make my hair feel amazing in both texture and shine!  I do feel that the hair falling out has lessened greatly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo along with the lazer max comb and rogaine foam for 2 1/2-3 years and im  33 still balding. It says you lose some hair at first but will start seeing results but its been long enough im not wasting my $ anymore time for a hat. :(</li>
    <li> I ordered the Revita shampoo and conditioner.  I have previously used one bottle of the shampoo and I am in the process of evaluating if it helps at all with hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived with the shampoo having leaked all over the product box and into the  adjacent conditioner box and even to where it soaked the entire outside of the shipping box.  There is hardly anything left inside the bottle.  It ruined the packaging, all the instructions; and now my whole house smells like shampoo.  I am disgusted and angry. I timed it so I would have shampoo when I ran out and now I will have to buy something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought there was accidentally something wrong with my previous bottle of Revita when I realized that I could not store it on its side or leave it upside down, as the contents would just leak right out.  It seems as if this might be quite an issue for the entire Revita shampoo line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can I trust a company to make a good shampoo if they can&#x27;t even use a bottle that does not leak?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have emailed the company I ordered from and I am sure that they will try to fix the situation, but that doesn&#x27;t change that fact that, to me, this now feels like a cut-rate, b.s. product.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s a bit early to see if the avertised growth stimulation is going to become fact I do like the shampoo as my hair texture seems to be improved.</li>
    <li> Actually, I only used it for THREE TIMES  and I was totally shocked by how many hairs I pulled out each time I used it - a considerable amount of my precious hairs!  I returned it right after.  I am so sorry that it&#x27;s not good for me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon but from a salon that recommended it and I paid quite a bit for it.  It did nothing.  The only thing I noticed was my hair&#x27;s texture became really rough and it seemed like it made my hair really dry and my hair broke off.  I used it for about 2 months until the whole bottle (along with the conditioner) was gone.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have found an improvement in the thickness of my hair.  The directions suggest using twice and leaving it on your head for 5 minutes.  I have used it one time per shampoo, and leave it on my head for 5 minutes.  Twice is too time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;My hair dresser is also pleased with my results, and has reccommended Revita to some of her other women patrons with the same type of thinning hair problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product since the end of last summer, and plan to continue its use.</li>
    <li> New customer to this product. 53 years old and have used various hair loss treatments. Currently taking propecia. Learned about this product from my 87 year old mother who started experiencing hair loss after a hospital stay. Her stylist suggested she try it so I decided to give it a try as well. Have been using for 3 weeks and my hair appears thinner in the front. Although directions state there may be initial hair loss but to keep using product ... So I am . Verdict still out. May rateing may be higher if hair appears to be regenerating. Don&#x27;t want to stop using yet if future potential. Also somewhat drying to scalp.</li>
    <li> I am a woman and I&#x27;ve had weak thinning hair for a few years, it is not pattern female baldness so I was not sure this product would work but decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only 2 days I noticed less hair is falling out, after a week of using this product the shedding has stopped and my hair is almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money. this tuff works!</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo for about 3 or 4 weeks.  I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet, but I didn&#x27;t expect to, but I just have to say that the shampoo leaks into the cap and then ultimately out of the cap and down the bottle - ugh!</li>
    <li> in my case this product didn&#x27;t work at all, the hair loss was the same or more, and i bought the 3 products the shampoo, the conditioner and the little spray!</li>
    <li> When the shampoo came the bottle was opened and leaked everywhere, so I asked them tog resend a new bottle and they said they did over 2 weeks ago and I still haven&#x27;t relieved my replacement bottle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lost so much more hair since using this product they should be marketing this as hair loss not hair growth product.  I was getting better results from head and shoulders shampoo.  Don&#x27;t buy this if you care to keep the hair you have.</li>
    <li> I bought the Revita &amp; Revita.COR products (shampoo &amp; conditioner). I can&#x27;t tell you if the products are working or not, because I have a serious issue with the packaging. I&#x27;m 45 and in good health. But I can&#x27;t squeeze these bottles! The plastic is sooooooo hard, it&#x27;s impossible to get the product out. I leave the bottles upside down, but the flip lid also has an issue. The product gathers in the lid. There is at least 1-2 applications of product in the lid, that I won&#x27;t be able to use, unless I get a screwdriver or some other tool and take the lid apart. I won&#x27;t purchase this product again until they upgrade their packaging to an easier to \\&quot;squeeze\\&quot; bottle with a better lid that doesn&#x27;t collect product. I can&#x27;t imagine if you are older, or have health issues where gripping and squeezing are an issue. You would not be able to use this product at all. I don&#x27;t use the product on a daily basis because I hate fighting with the bottles to get product out.</li>
    <li> Promotes regrowth as long as you keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product consitently since my dermatologist recommended it for hair loss I use it along with DNC, and propecia.</li>
    <li> After careful research I decided to try this product.  The research from DS Laboratories looks good and makes sense regarding why I am experiencing hair loss.  There are no magic bullets regarding MPD but understanding how to control or stop the process is understandable. I have included this as part of a process of exercise, vitamins and hair care.  So far so good.  My scalp feel healthy and while it&#x27;s still early to see any major changes; you definitely feel it working when applied. I am going to give it at least a 2 bottle try to see what turns up.  The price from Amazon made it an affordable option compared to other outlets for this product.  I am currently satisfied with this product and will post again when there is more to report.</li>
    <li> My hair styles recommended for thinning hair i have used it for several months and now I can see an improvment</li>
    <li> Been buying this stuff for a year. I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of regrowth, but at least a lot more isn&#x27;t falling out. I&#x27;d say use it with something else. Not too effective alone</li>
    <li> For balding men this doesn&#x27;t and will never work. Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a year, and no benefits came out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only women can benefit from DS Labs&#x27; products - men with genetic hair shedding will not, ever. Stick to Minoxidil, and when all fails - accept the baldness :&#x60;-(</li>
    <li> Buy a volumizing shampoo and you will get the same results. Dont spend the extra cash on this, its not worth it.</li>
    <li> After using the shampoo for 3 months, I&#x27;ve notice \\&quot;NO\\&quot; differance. As matter of fact it caused me to lose more hair. Save your money!</li>
    <li> I am a 42yo female - starting noticing thinning hair about 5 years ago.  I have tried other products, but had no luck.  My hair stylist recommended Revita Shampoo/Conditioner/Stimulator which I faithfully used for about a year.  My hair felt healthier within the first month or so, but even after a year, I saw no results with regard to the thinning.  In fact, as time went on, I felt my hair and scalp becoming drier.  After a year&#x27;s time and spending a lot of money, I am disappointed that Revita has not worked for me.  The packaging of the shampoo is awful.  The plastic bottle is hard to squeeze, the shampoo is thick (and seems to get thicker) and the flip lid causes the shampoo to \\&quot;spill over\\&quot; into the lid if the bottle is turned upside down.  Ultimately, I gave up and now trying to find another solution.</li>
    <li> These products claim to promote hair regrowth. After two years, I&#x27;ve continued to loose more and more hair. The Revita conditioner is equally not performing. I&#x27;m looking for a quality replacement for both.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my thin hair.  This does support and seems to regrow hair.  It works great me.  Thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little inconsistent sometimes (sometimes soapy sometimes gooey). When I used this exclusively my scalp scratched a little, it stopped when I used another shampoo in combination. It may be working, but the inconsistency makes me a little uncertain.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month but i still have hair fall and dandruff, i didnt like the product</li>
    <li> leaves hair healthy, me and my dad both use it and are very happy with it ...not expensive and well worth the money</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been a Revita user for a few years now. Their shampoo has given me better results than almost any other hair loss prevention or correction method on the market. I&#x27;ve tried propecia, biotin, oils, various topicals such as rogaine, lipogaine, other shampoos...but none of them have done quite as well for me as the revita shampoo has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does stimulate hair growth. I come from a long line of men&#x27;s hair loss. I&#x27;m only 31 but my dome is thinning and I have greys as well. While this shampoo doesn&#x27;t correct the color, it certainly helps eliminate some of the thinning issues I&#x27;ve had. I have thicker, fuller, and healither hair using this shampoo. I keep my hair fairly short- not a buzz cut but never below the ears. This has given me a much fuller look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently the Revita has changed formulas. It&#x27;s not nearly as functional in small doses and the expense makes it difficult to keep up with in my position. I wish the results were still as great but they&#x27;re honestly not. It&#x27;s disappointing. I&#x27;ve been able to find some &#x27;old&#x27; formulas here and there but I&#x27;m hoping they change back before they&#x27;re all gone...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been getting impressive results with straught up vitamins lately, specifically biotin and vitmain b-6 from these hair growth capsules; [[ASIN:B00BYNGI5I Free Natrol Biotin - 10,000 mcg Tablets + Hair Growth Essentials - 60 capsules - Promotes Hair Growth, Healthy Skin, and Strong Nails]].  Would recommend these for those looking for actual growth.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know what has enticed this company to change their original formula (BUT I CAN GUESS: PROFIT!!!) that worked so well for so many people...improved so many lives...the whole situation makes me sick.  if the original formula was the star child of DS Laboratories, what they are misleadingly selling now it is its retarded 3rd cousin with one arm and half of its fingers missing.  please boycott this product until they get the point and do what is right: revert the shampoo to its original and loved version.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo because I really liked the conditioniare and felt it worked. I thought that adding the shampoo would work even better. Unfortunately it has not. In fact it does not work as good as my k-pak shampoo to reduce hair loss and healthy hair.</li>
    <li> This product started working immediately! I am very impressed with the results and will continue to keep using it; however, it is not a miracle worker and may not be suitable for everyone.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair grow alot faster than before, but as for new hair I don&#x27;t see anything. The Lady the cuts my hair told me to keep using it because my hair was growing so fast and \\&quot; it does come in thicker\\&quot;. As for new hair though I don&#x27;t see any.</li>
    <li> Started loosing my hair in my late twenties and was depressed and frustrated that my families genetics had caught up to me.  When I turned 30 (now 35) I decided to take the bulls by the horn. After much research I decided to begin using a combo of Revita and Rogaine foam in late 2008.  To my happy surprise I grew back 95% of my hair including my hairline!  I used the combo until last February when the maker of Revita decided to change there formula that had once worked like a charm. I still and never stopped using Rogaine foam though.  My reason for discontinuing use is simple, much to my dismay it flat out stopped working! I contacted the company and they told me they had improved the formula. Revita in 2008 (the stuff that actually works) was orange but still slightly translucent, the shampoo in 2012 is sticky/oily and a opaque orange.  I think much of it and continued use after it had changed in consistency, my hair became greasy and it left me with heavy residue on my scalp.  My hair started falling out again where I had stabilized it for almost 4 years with my regimen.  It&#x27;s truly disappointing that DS labratories decided to tinker with once was great and a staple in my hair loss treatment. Boooo Revita Booooo!  I now use Bosley&#x27;s shampoo and have had great results and some regrowth. Hope this is helpful to someone planning on trying Revita.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 pregnancy&#x27;s. My hair falls out like crazy while I&#x27;m pregnant. Love it. My hair grew 1 inch in the first 3 weeks I used it. Also had a ton of new fuzzy&#x27;s all around my hairline in the first few weeks. I&#x27;m also a hair stylist and was skeptical when i first was introduced to it. But I Highly recommend this product to all my clients ladies and men that are balding or thinning.</li>
    <li> Just a waste of money if you ask me! It promises much delivers very little! Maybe good for washing, but not much more.</li>
    <li> I think the bottle I recieved is a fake or this stuff is a scam!!! It had absolutely no help for my hair and further it didn&#x27;t clean or moisturize it either. When I applied it to my hair it didn&#x27;t suds up or creat a lather. It simply washed through as if it was just orange colored paste. Lastly its smell was not appealing.</li>
    <li> I am sure this product works great, I haven&#x27;t noticed yet though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I have noticed is the HORRIBLE lid on both the shampoo and conditioner.  When you tip the bottle upside down to squeeze some into your hand the cap of the bottle fills up with about 5 days worth of product and you can&#x27;t get it out, ever.  Not to mention I have to use my teeth to squeeze the bottle because they&#x27;re so hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the shampoo bottle specifically, it leaks out of the lid slowly all over my shower wall and it&#x27;s bright orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I buy this I&#x27;m not going to use the bottles it comes in. I&#x27;ll put the product into a practical bottle that doesn&#x27;t waste a ton of the product.</li>
    <li> Os resultados são satisfatórios, mas tem que ter paciência. Não vai fazer nascer novos cabelos, mas minimiza muito a queda.</li>
    <li> The box arrived on time, but the shampoo was dripping from the box. I had to return the box back. The shampoo quality is not good.</li>
    <li> in one word: it work. Do not expect miracles, but after years using monxidil solutions this is at least as good if not better.</li>
    <li> This product does as it says. I have been using for a couple of months and i have regrowth all over, plus my hair is now like velvet.</li>
    <li> I have used this before was purchase from hairdresser made my hair grow then I found it was the same product on here for cheaper but it made my hair started falling very badly so upset I have bald spots all around the edge has broken off really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like the way revita leaves my hair. Its a good shampoo. Im not sure if it helps with hair loss since this is my third week using it. I hope it does.</li>
    <li> I am a 24 old male and I noticed my hair line starting to recede. I let it go for a while and it became worse and worse. My hair was also starting to appear thinner on top of my head. Not only did I notice it but my fianc&amp;eacute; and friends/family did as well. I have been using this shampoo for only just over two weeks and I can see a huge difference. My hair is thicker, healthier and it has already begun to grow where my hairline is receding. Before I started using this shampoo I noticed that I would shed hair like crazy and no I don&#x27;t see hardly any hair being shed. Not only have I noticed the difference but my fianc&amp;eacute; and the lady that cuts my hair noticed a difference and I never told that I was using anything for my hair. I will definitely reorder when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 2 years now.  I really do think that I am not losing any more hair (at least not more rapidly than the new hair grows in), but I don&#x27;t notice substantial increase either.  Overall, I am satisfied that I am not losing anymore hair without using rogain, or something like that.</li>
    <li> My hair has quit coming out in handfuls.  I have a lot of new hair growth, however I am anxiously awaiting for some fuzz to appear in the bald spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about done with my first bottle of this shampoo. While my noticeable thinning spot at my crown is still there, it seems no more hair comes off when I massage in Rogaine. Also, hair feels thicker. Instead of wash and repeat with this , I first wash with a regular mens &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; shampoo then leave this on like a conditioner for about 5 min. I am going to buy this again and see if continued use, along with Rogain reverses thinning (fingers crossed).</li>
    <li> Been using this shampoo for a few days, pretty concerned about the reviews that the shampoo (and heck even the bottle) had gone down in quality, though early reviews were fantastic.  Luckily, so far so good.  The bottle seems pretty tight to me, and the shampoo itself is pretty darn viscous, I can actually get a pretty lather with about a tablespoon even with my medium length hair, so from that alone I guess the shampoo got it&#x27;s act back together (I hope).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for what it&#x27;s doing to my hair, I noticed an immediate different in the texture and how clean it feels, a step up from the frizzy mess my biotin and nizoral shampoos left me with, but you still might want to find a good conditioner.  Still too soon to tell if it&#x27;s actually helping with my old-man-head hair loss, but it&#x27;s the only one shampoo that has all the ingredient in one bottle that are actually known or at least theorized to help, the strongest being saw palmetto, ketazecolene, and possibly biotin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, the immediate difference will at least make it *look* like it&#x27;s working, so I think I found a new favorite shampoo, I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> Since I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day as the instructions tell you to, I don&#x27;t feel qualified to write about the long-term benefits.  The hair shaft is definitely thicker with one shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 4 yrs.  my hair has greatly thickened.  So much so that I can wear my hair long-before my hair was too thin.</li>
    <li> I start using this product for a month and already seeing some results. Looking forward to order more.I will definitely continue to use</li>
    <li> I bought this product and used it as directed in its entirety.  I honestly cannot say that it did anything for my issue.  I would not spend that much money on this product again.  Although it&#x27;s not a bad product, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> i have to take up space and im tired of reviewing the product so im taking up space... its a great product, try it</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended by my dermatologist to stimulate my hair growth in the front due to a form of psoriasis.  It has been a couple of months, and it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> Edit: so my hair has started to thin and fall out quite rapidly and im convinced its because of this shampoo. The only shampoo that has worked for me has been nizoral. I will throw my revita bottle away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is really nice. I was really skeptical about getting it after reading all the mixed reviews on here but im glad i did. I was using nizoral before and that product worked really good but it seems to have been discontinued...not sure why. Anyways, i switched to lipogaine big 3 a few months back but that shampoo seemed to had made my hair shed...i did research and it seems like salicylic acid was the culprit. Lipogaine has since removed salicylic acid from their shampoo and im thinking of trying it again. I chose this shampoo because i was looking for a nizoral alternative but without salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read various reviews about different batches and thickness and thinness of this shampoo. The one i got wasnt very thick and it was somewhat watery. I would say it is comparable to nizoral. Lipogaine big 3 i would say is thick. My bottle also says &#x27;&#x27;made in usa&#x27;&#x27;. Anyways, i follow the directions and use revita twice per shower...once to clean and the other as a leave in for a few mins.  I havent noticed any shedding with this shampoo and it makes my scalp feel really nice and clean. I havent noticed any regrowth but ive only been using it for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe with this shampoo is the lid. It is overengineered for the worst. When you tilt the bottle to get some on your hand, the lid fills up with some of the shampoo and its basically impossible to get out. A simple cap would have done just fine so no product is waste.  I really hope they make a practical lid but seeing as this product has been out since at least 2008, i dont think its gonna happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, i really like this shampoo, besides the lid obviously, and will keep using it indefinitely.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Revita Shampoo, Conditioner and Spectra DNS-L for 50 days now and I am amazed with the results! This product is absolutely fantastic and is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying many shampoos in the market, I finally came across something that isn&#x27;t just a promisse, it delivers what advertises. However, not sure if it&#x27;s a packing defect in the shampoo bottle design or just my bottle, but it leaks from the top making a very orange mess on the bottle itself and on the shelf. I have lost a good portion of it due to the leaking. I&#x27;ve just bought another round of the three products and pretend to keep using it but, I couldn&#x27;t believe that I had to buy dispensers at the Container Store and transfer the shampoo over it because I was concerned that I would have the same issues again. This product is great and I am already a huge fan of DS Laboratories and have recommended it to many friends going through the same baldness problems as I am!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, Please, Please, look into this issue with the dispenser, it really adds negative value to the laboratory and It&#x27;s not fair because your product really works!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It has made my hair seem thicker and more healthy. I can feel the tingle on my head when I use it. The lid leaks the shampoo out the sides after you use it and leave it in the shower which is annoying for how expensive it is. Others mentioned this so it was no surprise. I will keep using this shampoo for months to see longer term results.</li>
    <li> Quick Note:  I recommend testing your hair with the small bottle and if successful, purchase the 1000 mL version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has delivered fantastic results for me!  While I did notice more hair falling out the first two months, I can now count the number of hairs on my hands.  My hair looks thicker and fuller and friends/family members I had not seen in months can see a difference.  I had them check my crown which is where I&#x27;ve lost the most hair and they noticed new hairs popping out!!!  Definately recommend people losing hair to give this product a try.  It may not work for everyone but for those that it does, worth the time and investment!! Also, this item is not an overnight solution.  It took years to get to where I am today with my hair and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll take just as much time to get back to normal.  Worth the wait ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from this shampoo, I am also taking GNC Biotin 5000 every other day.</li>
    <li> I have been using reboot for 6 weeks now I noticed a huge difference in thegining noticed baby hairs growing longer that  were short.  Now I feel I can&#x27;t use it all time&lt;br /&gt; my hair gets dry and extremely knotted after shampoo  I have to  use conditioner.  Imstill using the product because I bought two bottles I will say this my hair looks fluffy and bouncy the day  I wash it</li>
    <li> Similar ingredients as other simulating shampoos. Packaging and bottle look nice and it smells OK, that&#x27;s about the only good aspects. Not recommended unless you want to waste your money.</li>
    <li> Revita is the first shampoo and conditioner product combo that I&#x27;ve found actually reduces hair loss.  When I shampoo and condition, I find fewer hairs than I&#x27;ve seen in 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is clean, shiny and easy to manage.  The formula for the conditioner is absolutely amazing, as I don&#x27;t need a lot of other product to get a style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best product........ no question</li>
    <li> I have Chemo hair and when I started taking Estregen blockers my hair  got real soft with no body.  This shampoo gives my fine hair a lot of body and thickness.  Two things my hair never had.  This is my 3rd bottle and I intend to stay with it.  It lasts forever and sometimes I use another shampoo for the 1st time you shampoo, then you shampoo a 2nd time with this, always.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have hair issues other than just having naturally thin hair. My hair dresser suggested I buy this stuff as a maintenance shampoo. I love the after affect is has. My hair gets very oily during the day, this shampoo for some reason keeps my hair looking really fresh as if I just washed it. Thats important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give my hair more volume then that of anything I can get at the store. I&#x27;ll probably continue to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As fair as hair growth, like I said I don&#x27;t really have that problem. I do notice having to go to the salon more often for trims though.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, accurate description, well packaged. After two days of use hair feels fuller and illl be looking forward to what progress comes in a month.</li>
    <li> I have yet to see if it actually works. That will take some time. Three of us are using this product.</li>
    <li> It was recommendto me by my hair dresser and I love it. It makes my hair fuller as I have more hair.</li>
    <li> Love it so far, seems to be improving my hairline a bit. I hope that it continues to help and that it is just not my imagination. I truly see a difference after a month of use.</li>
    <li> Product was as expected.  It is a great shampoo that makes your hair feel thicker.  It was just as advertised and was delivered before scheduled.</li>
    <li> Did not notice a differance. I am in the process off starting to lose hair.  Cant tell if its doing anything</li>
    <li> If you are reading this, you need to take the other reviews with a grain of salt. I&#x27;ve read a lot of the reviews and some people are just ridiculous. I&#x27;ve read reviews of people quitting it after two-three weeks because they \\&quot;saw no results\\&quot; or quitting after two days because supposedly it \\&quot;made their hair fall out more.\\&quot; Don&#x27;t listen to these morons. If this product is to work for you, (if it works at all) you have to give it time, not a few days or a few weeks.    With that being said...    - 23yr old  - Male  - Moderate thinning    I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo along with the conditioner for exactly 5 months now. I&#x27;ve used exactly as directed religiously since my hair lady recommended it. It&#x27;s almost impossible to gage if I&#x27;m losing less (or more) hair in the shower...who can actually measure that? Get real.    Is my hair better than it would be if I hadn&#x27;t used this product?  I can&#x27;t say.    Is my hair worse? Not that I&#x27;m aware of.    Did I maintain instead of losing more hair? Again, no definitive answer.    Did it fill in my thinning areas noticeably? No, I&#x27;ve started finasteride (propecia).    Unless you&#x27;re going to a hair specialist every few months and get hair samples/counts done it&#x27;s really hard to tell if this product is working or not.    The shampoo used alone does make your hair thicker and more full looking, especially if you blow dry after.    The conditioner+shampoo will leave your hair flatter than just the shampoo alone.    At best, you might grow a few hairs/maintain your hair/less hair fall.    At worst, you get a quality shampoo that will not damage/ make your scalp/hair worse because of harmful chemicals and additives.    The above has just been my experience and I&#x27;ve been as honest as possible because i know how devastating hairloss is and I want to help people as much as possible.
