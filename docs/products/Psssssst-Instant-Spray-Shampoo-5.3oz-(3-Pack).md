      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>look the company who sold it did great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great...</li>
      <li>In the morning I just curl and brush and the hair looks as good as it did the day before.</li>
      <li>Who thought that was a good idea?</li>
      <li>Ever since I tried this at Nordstrom Ive love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Spray it on, kind of brush it/run your fingers through it, and it still feels like you have no product in it.</li>
      <li>Then I gently brush my hair, sleep on it at night, and it looks perfect in the morning.  </li>
      <li>It does what it is supposed to do &amp;amp; it smell nice.</li>

      <li>A bottle lasts me about a month or two, with me using it about twice a week or more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brands and I feel this works best for my hair.</li>
      <li>the one I buy at drugstore does better</li>
      <li>Also, you should make sure you spray it where there is some ventilation as it seems to linger in the air</li>
      <li>and you do not have to do much touching up afterwards.</li>
      <li>Nice lemony clean scent.</li>
      <li>This is the BEST dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>the best dry shampoo on the market</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo and affordable.  </li>
      <li>Probably the best I&#x27;m going to find with dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This is the BEST dry shampoo out there!</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo I have tried!</li>
      <li>and I love the light scent.</li>
      <li>So far, this product works best for my natural curly hair.</li>
      <li>Light and not too cakey.</li>
      <li>OK, just kidding about never washing your hair again, but seriously, this stuff is awesome.  </li>
      <li>First of all: cheap!</li>
      <li>I love the idea of dry shampoos, but not the smell of most - or my husband doesn&#x27;t - this one is not too stinky!</li>
      <li>This dry shampoo it the best I have found by far!</li>
      <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
      <li>I have blonde dyed hair and it works amazing if I spray it before I go to bed.</li>
      <li>Great classic dry shampoo</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like anything special but will make it so you don&#x27;t have to regret spending your whole night on stumbleupon when you were supposed to be washing your hair.</li>
      <li>all that so the fact that this still leaves me with my normal hair texture is fabulous.</li>
      <li>Tried it, then went to Loreal and found the Loreal dry shampoo to be less than impressive.  </li>
      <li>I saw this first on Amazon but ended up getting it at Ulta.</li>
      <li>Now it is my routine, I can finally skip one day in washing my hair :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to use it many times but it has never worked + there is so much white build up.</li>
      <li>I have tried many but always come back to this.</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo of this range that I&#x27;ve tried - doesn&#x27;t leave an excessive number of particles.</li>
      <li>One of the better dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>My favorite dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Seriously the best dry shampoo I have found</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>It gets the job done and leaves my hair looking much cleaner.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
      <li>it arrived fast and as promised.</li>
      <li>Pssssst has worked well for almost a year straight while my wife has not been able to get her hair wet.</li>
      <li>My new favorite dry shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I contacted the company and they were not only very helpful but sent me full replacements.</li>
      <li>It works very well and leaves no residue even if I spray it on last minute, right before I go somewhere.</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s price for this product is a bit high.  </li>
      <li>However, most of it will dissipate within a few minutes.</li>
      <li>This product is normally for athletic use</li>
      <li>Overall, I really like this product and would get it again!</li>
      <li>I usually buy this by the can in the drug store, but the 3-pack was a better deal.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m just very oily in general and spray all over sections of my roots, so this may not be the case for everyone.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the new packaging means a new formula, but for some reason, I think the Psssssst in the red white and blue cans works slightly better than the Psssssst in the old white and purple cans.  </li>
      <li>dull my hair (like Batiste), nor does it make my hair feel sticky and coarse (Big Sexy Hair).</li>
      <li>Be careful because it adds a tad bit of stiffness if you put too much in one area by spraying too close.</li>
      <li>and I hated it, but THIS is awesome stuff!</li>
      <li>It smells exactly like Coconut Malibu, including the slight alcohol scent.</li>
      <li>A single bottle will last you a decent amount of time, too.</li>
      <li>Need to wait a few seconds for it to soak in and dry for full &amp;#34;dry</li>
      <li>Tried a few different dry shampoos, both cheap and pricy ones and keep coming back to this one.</li>
      <li>My only complaints would be regarding the smell, which is not the worst but still pretty strong, and the amount I need for it to make my hair feel clean.</li>

    <li> I love the idea of dry shampoos, but not the smell of most - or my husband doesn&#x27;t - this one is not too stinky! Works great!</li>
    <li> OK, just kidding about never washing your hair again, but seriously, this stuff is awesome.  I try to wash my hair less often than daily, but it starts to look greasy after about half a day.  I started using this dry shampoo at night.  I section out layers of my hair and spray it on.  Then I gently brush my hair, sleep on it at night, and it looks perfect in the morning.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell but I can overlook that.  Also, you should make sure you spray it where there is some ventilation as it seems to linger in the air and you don&#x27;t want to inhale it.  Amazon&#x27;s price for this product is a bit high.  Walmart has it for less than $5.</li>
    <li> My favorite dry shampoo. I have thick, curly/wavy hair and use dry shampoo several times per week. Comparable to Batiste, but often times Psssst is a bit cheaper. This stuff is great. Happy that I could buy a 3 pack!</li>
    <li> Great classic dry shampoo</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo it the best I have found by far! Suave and Herbal Essence both left a gritty, tough, knotty feel to my hair and I hated it, but THIS is awesome stuff! Spray it on, kind of brush it/run your fingers through it, and it still feels like you have no product in it. I hate hairspray and mouse and all that so the fact that this still leaves me with my normal hair texture is fabulous. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> look the company who sold it did great. it arrived fast and as promised. I just don&#x27;t think this brand works well. I find I have to use like half a can to even look a little less greasy. the one I buy at drugstore does better</li>
    <li> Ever since I tried this at Nordstrom Ive love it! It comes out clear (unless you spray way too close to your head) and smells great!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. Doesn&#x27;t smell like anything special but will make it so you don&#x27;t have to regret spending your whole night on stumbleupon when you were supposed to be washing your hair. A single bottle will last you a decent amount of time, too. A bottle lasts me about a month or two, with me using it about twice a week or more. Just keep in mind that it loses it&#x27;s effectiveness when you use it time and time again with no showering/washing your hair with water in between.</li>
    <li> the best dry shampoo on the market</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, discolored, or powdered.</li>
    <li> I love this productt!!!!  Your hair feels as though you just washed it</li>
    <li> Best for the price.....I have used it for years on my third day after shampooing if necessary.</li>
    <li> I am never without this it works so well!!</li>
    <li> Only place I could find this! Best on the market.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, like the Treseme equivalent and it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
    <li> There are 3 reasons that I would never recommend this shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t work very well. I&#x27;ve tried to use it many times but it has never worked + there is so much white build up. Ew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. When ever I used it my hair somehow got frizzy and oily at the same time...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. There is PROPANE in the ingredients. PROPANE!!?? Who thought that was a good idea?</li>
    <li> One of the better dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used.  Also has the least offensive smell.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. Wish they sold travel size online</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo. Not an overpowering smell. Light and not too cakey.</li>
    <li> Does not spray as &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; as I would like. Need to wait a few seconds for it to soak in and dry for full &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34; effect. I prefer dry shampoos that spray out completely dry and you do not have to do much touching up afterwards.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great...Great for days you can&#x27;t wash your hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I love the light scent. It works well for a refresher or for the in between days of washing my hair. It gives some thickness and volume as well to my hair and this is a plus. Only a little is needed at the roots, massage in and style as usual. This product is cheaper on amazon then in any store so I prefer to buy it here.&lt;br /&gt;**A side note: I had purchased this on a 3 pack before (NOT this purchase) and there was a problem with them. After the first use, the next time I went to use it the pressure had slowly seeped out and left the can worthless. I contacted the company and they were not only very helpful but sent me full replacements. From the lot I purchased, there was a flaw during manufacturing and they corrected that.</li>
    <li> So far, this product works best for my natural curly hair.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best dry shampoo I have found and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. I have tried bed head, batiste, suave, and on and on. I wash my hair only about once a week so the last few days my hair needs a little help. This one uses the least amount to take away the greasy shine then the others I&#x27;ve used. Plus it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out the rest of my hair like the other brands have for me in the past.</li>
    <li> This is the best invention ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Psssssst for years, although for the last 15 or so having to order it by the case online.  It still works well.  I don&#x27;t know if the new packaging means a new formula, but for some reason, I think the Psssssst in the red white and blue cans works slightly better than the Psssssst in the old white and purple cans.  Go figure.</li>
    <li> I saw this first on Amazon but ended up getting it at Ulta. It works very well and leaves no residue even if I spray it on last minute, right before I go somewhere. Be careful because it adds a tad bit of stiffness if you put too much in one area by spraying too close. It gets the job done and leaves my hair looking much cleaner. It also adds a little volume. However, the smell can be an annoyance depending on whether you like tropical scents or not. It smells exactly like Coconut Malibu, including the slight alcohol scent. However, most of it will dissipate within a few minutes. Overall, I really like this product and would get it again!</li>
    <li> Item hasn&#x27;t changed and works just like before.  Convenient when one does not have time to wash hair that day.</li>
    <li> I have tried many but always come back to this.</li>
    <li> My new favorite dry shampoo.  Smells great and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used.  Tried it, then went to Loreal and found the Loreal dry shampoo to be less than impressive.  This is the only one I&#x27;ll keep on hand!</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo and affordable.  Nice lemony clean scent.</li>
    <li> Works. But make hair dull lost the natural health shine.</li>
    <li> This is the best spray shampoo there is. It does what it is supposed to do &amp;amp; it smell nice. A different if on the go &amp;amp; you can&#x27;t wash ypur hair.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Pssssst has worked well for almost a year straight while my wife has not been able to get her hair wet. This product is normally for athletic use but we recommend it for long term use, too.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST dry shampoo out there!</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo I have tried! Love it!</li>
    <li> Adds body and extends time between hair washing.</li>
    <li> My aunt loves this product which allows her to stay in bed while cleaning her hair; the only thing that works for her.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this by the can in the drug store, but the 3-pack was a better deal. Best dry shampoo of this range that I&#x27;ve tried - doesn&#x27;t leave an excessive number of particles. Great for second-day hairstyles or a touch-up before you go out.</li>
    <li> Tried a few different dry shampoos, both cheap and pricy ones and keep coming back to this one. I have blonde dyed hair and it works amazing if I spray it before I go to bed. In the morning I just curl and brush and the hair looks as good as it did the day before. Now it is my routine, I can finally skip one day in washing my hair :)</li>
    <li> I have been trying it out for about a week and it turns spots of my hair white</li>
    <li> Great product, very tolerable fragrance a must for travel!</li>
    <li> Probably the best I&#x27;m going to find with dry shampoo. First of all: cheap! Got a single can at walgreens for $5, which definitely beats the others I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t leave tons of white powder/dull my hair (like Batiste), nor does it make my hair feel sticky and coarse (Big Sexy Hair). Looks great, and feels comfortably fresh. My only complaints would be regarding the smell, which is not the worst but still pretty strong, and the amount I need for it to make my hair feel clean. Seems like my current can will last a month-month and a half? But I&#x27;m just very oily in general and spray all over sections of my roots, so this may not be the case for everyone. Either way, at the price, I&#x27;m happy to have found something that really works!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. I&#x27;ve tried several brands and I feel this works best for my hair. I have black hair and this doesn&#x27;t show the white like the others do. I know there is black colored dry shampoo but that gets messy.</li>
