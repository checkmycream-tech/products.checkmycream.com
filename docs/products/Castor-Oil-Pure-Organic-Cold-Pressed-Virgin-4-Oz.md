      <li>Highly recommend this oil</li>
      <li>/&gt;Neutral scent, so it mixes nicely with other oils and a scented essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased it only about a month ago still need a few months to completely be sure how well it works.</li>
      <li>Lately I&#x27;ve been using it to cleanse my face along with sweet almond oil</li>

I don&#x27;t smell anything bad like some of the other reviews say. I purchased it for the purpose of making my eyebrows grow. They are growing in some places but not in others. Although I haven&#x27;t been using it religiously every single night. It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery,and over all great product!</li>
    <li> This is the last time I tried this product, it does NOT work on me at all. There has been no growth on my eyebrow.</li>
    <li> Its really nice in a convenient bottle :)</li>
    <li> I purchased it only about a month ago still need a few months to completely be sure how well it works. As far as shipping it arrived just as planned. :)</li>

    <li> Shipped quick, product is great just as advertised! I use this and the argan oil (purchased from the same vendor) in my weekly hair treatments, and my hair LOVES it</li>
    <li> Exactlly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I use it for the oil cleansing method. I have dry skin so I use very little. Still have half of the bottle left since I bought it on the 2nd of april . I think it does its job when it comes to  cleansing. I wiped a cotton ball with witch hazel over my face  and no traces of dirt ,makeup or grime showed up after using the cleansing method. I use it with Extra virgin olive oil fyi.I wouldn&#x27;t use this alone because it is a very drying oil .</li>
    <li> i use fort the castor oil pack..it is the miracle oil</li>
