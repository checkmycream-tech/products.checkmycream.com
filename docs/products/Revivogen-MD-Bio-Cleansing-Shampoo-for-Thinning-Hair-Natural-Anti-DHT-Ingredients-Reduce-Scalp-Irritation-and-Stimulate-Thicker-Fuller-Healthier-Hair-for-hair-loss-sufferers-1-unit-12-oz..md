### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product came up as one of the best on \\&quot;Google\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is the best I ever</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;an awesome combo.</li>
      <li>This is the best shampoo I have every used.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Great shampoo !&lt;</li>
      <li>It has a great minty smell.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m proud to say that I haven&#x27;t pulled any out for over a year now.</li>
      <li>Either way, I&#x27;m happy just using this and grateful for it.</li>
      <li>I maybe allergic to one of its ingredients, but for people who are not allergic, it&#x27;ll be a good shampoo.</li>
      <li>cleans well, smells good</li>
      <li>instead it feels fluffier and has good body that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>only product that impressively worked for me was the Perfect Image</li>
      <li>, AS WE AGE MORE DHT IS CONVERTED IN OUR BODYS  , GREAT SHAMPOO  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is a very good shampoo that leaves my hair feeling clean and rejuvenated.  </li>
      <li>for fine hair system 1, it works twice as great</li>
      <li>Smells nice and is not overly soapy but still testing it out to see if I truly like it</li>
      <li>The best endorsement I can offer for Revivogen is this--never has a shampoo left my hair and scalp feeling so great.  </li>
      <li>Nice smell</li>
      <li>Nice shampoo</li>
      <li>overpriced, and it as good as any cheap shampoo.</li>
      <li>Prompt professional service, excellent plus.</li>
      <li>I believe the product has helped stop more of my hair from falling out.  </li>
      <li>but I had better results using Suave kids shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love the smell off it, I don&#x27;t if it helps yet</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey, sure, but it honestly leaves my hair feeling fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t elaborate except to say&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but mostly this one&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t regrown any hair, (or lost any more), but it does seem thicker on the top.  </li>
      <li>There is no shampoo out there that can magically do that.</li>
      <li>Despite the hair loss, my hair really hasn&#x27;t looked this great in a while.</li>
      <li>I am now dealing with the aftermath of my actions, which is a crop circle on top of my head.</li>
      <li>anyway, I will keep using the one I already opened and see if it will do better after a while, if not, I may have to return the set.</li>
      <li>ok to use.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is great for slowing down the thinning process, but you need the whole kit for the best results</li>
      <li>buy three jars of this product, at first I saw more hair, but after two months to stop using it, I end up falling more hair.</li>
      <li>SO if you are looking for these things in a shampoo, this will fit the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is just good not to strip all the natural oils with</li>
      <li>advice is stay with good natural vitamins and be patient.</li>
      <li>At it&#x27;s high price, this is kind of a let-down, hence the 4 star review.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited when I was reading about this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Pretty strong.</li>
      <li>but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>Revivogen is a nice clean shampoo and can be used on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>I really like it !!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll try that soon, though again I prefer non-oily hair, so i rarely use any conditioner at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>if you are loosing hair or not.&lt;br /&gt;You really don&#x27;t need a conditioner after like other shampoos - just cleans great with no build up</li>
      <li>maybe i didnt use it right</li>
      <li>Been using this for several years now, and it keeps my hair full and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>I think it is very gentle</li>
      <li>The only issue I have is that I&#x27;m requiring more than I thought I would.  </li>
      <li>but it only made more hair fall out</li>
      <li>after couple weeks, my hair designer told me more hair than last visit!</li>
      <li>I did extensive research to find the best shampoo, not necessarily to grow my hair back but to strengthen the hair I still have.</li>
      <li>Then it actually caused more hair loss after the first week of use.</li>
      <li>I think we should try to avoid although honestly there is far too big a deal made over that&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
      <li>The shampoo is good in that it gives volume to hair, especially thinning hair, but I only gave it 2 stars because it causes a lot of itchiness on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve certainly lost hair since quitting Propecia, but this product does leave my hair feeling fuller and easier to style.  </li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t tell if it really does anything for hair re-growth.</li>
      <li>With continuous use my hair felt much softer, healthier  &amp; fuller.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First, it is SLS-free which means it is gentle on the scalp.</li>
      <li>I have really found this shampoo to reduce hair loss after using it for over a year now.</li>
      <li>Each bottle lasts a long time so price is far more reasonable than appears.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had this product for a short while and can only say if the product is as good as the service then this is a winner.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for people with or without hair loss for fuller &amp; healthier hair.</li>
      <li>It lathers really well with using only a small amount and gives a nice tingly feeling to your scalp.</li>
      <li>but I think other shampoos might adversely effect it.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive  - but a bottle can last Many months</li>
      <li>I used it the first week, did not feel big difference than the one I was using before, but</li>
      <li>Only used it three times but definitely stopped the hair loss &amp; gives your hair a lot of bounce especially for fine hair...</li>
      <li>By the end of the day, my hair isn&#x27;t looking oily or &amp;#34;separated,&amp;#34; as I am sensitive to the thinning in my hair part...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m scared to try Rogaine as I really don&#x27;t want the initial shed I&#x27;ve read about, so I&#x27;m hopeful that just using this</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perhaps too early to conclusively say whether this product helps fight hair loss or not...</li>
      <li>As far as hair regrowth or anything like that, I think it&#x27;s helping.  </li>
      <li>My hair is back to normal and I have new hair growth which is coming back quite fast.</li>
      <li>Smell like those &amp;#34;tee tree&amp;#34; flavor shampoo which is ok, but little to dry to use on my hair.</li>
      <li>but this treatment has made the hair in that spot soooo much shorter, so short that when I have my hair down the baby hairs stick straight up like a cockatoo&#x27;s feathers.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m someone who prefers dry hair, and I do admit my scalp has had a few &amp;#34;crusties&amp;#34; and some dryness, but overall I&#x27;m pleased and will continue using this.</li>
      <li>For all other reasons though this shampoo is worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>This took a few months, but it was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>but the company was sued and then closed and then replaced by a poor fake product called Perfect Hair which is a very close copy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s doing much in the way of growing new hair, I like how this shampoo makes my hair FEEL---</li>
      <li>I have tried other similar products promising the same things</li>

<li> Its hard to find a product that will work with your hair since every persons body reacts differently to each drug or beauty solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I noticed less hair falling out.  </li>
<li> I have been using this product for about 6 months and as a result I am losing less hair and my hair look fuller.</li>
<li> But seriously, I quit taking Propecia a few months back and decided to give this a shot.  </li>
<li> And it helps give my thinning hair a little volume.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this gimmick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Recently received the product. Smells nice and is not overly soapy but still testing it out to see if I truly like it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months and as a result I am losing less hair and my hair look fuller. I have tried other similar products promising the same things but this is only one that has ever worked for me. It&#x27;s a bit pricy but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I believe the product has helped stop more of my hair from falling out.  I have been using it for 8 months.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have every used. Does not really mater if you are loosing hair or not.&lt;br /&gt;You really don&#x27;t need a conditioner after like other shampoos - just cleans great with no build up&lt;br /&gt;I doubt it grows hair - but I think other shampoos might adversely effect it.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive  - but a bottle can last Many months</li>
    <li> I looked up for shampoo/conditionor which will prevent hair loss. This product came up as one of the best on \\&quot;Google\\&quot;. I used it the first week, did not feel big difference than the one I was using before, but ok to use. Then it actually caused more hair loss after the first week of use. Unfortunatly I already bought another set since it was a promotion product. anyway, I will keep using the one I already opened and see if it will do better after a while, if not, I may have to return the set.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a very good shampoo that leaves my hair feeling clean and rejuvenated.  You can feel it tingling and working any nastiness out of your scalp.  The only issue I have is that I&#x27;m requiring more than I thought I would.  Shampooing with a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; amount (for any other shampoo) will leave me sort of \\&quot;un-lathered\\&quot;.  At it&#x27;s high price, this is kind of a let-down, hence the 4 star review.  As far as hair regrowth or anything like that, I think it&#x27;s helping.  I use it with rogaine foam, and started both at the same time.  I haven&#x27;t regrown any hair, (or lost any more), but it does seem thicker on the top.  Not sure what is helping with this of the 2 though.  But either way I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have really found this shampoo to reduce hair loss after using it for over a year now. I would recommend this to anyone with hair loss issues and who want to improve scalp health.</li>
    <li> I did extensive research to find the best shampoo, not necessarily to grow my hair back but to strengthen the hair I still have. Revivogen has a cream to masage into the scalp and keep in over night to assist with hair Reviving. This is the only company though that puts some of that Reviving ingredients into their shampoos. After a month of using just the shampoo hair started reappearing in my widow peaks. You do the math and buy this product!</li>
    <li> I love the smell off it, I don&#x27;t if it helps yet caz I used it for only 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair look thicker, fuller, and gives&lt;br /&gt;my hair a ton of body, and if I combine it with Nioxin scalp&lt;br /&gt;therapy for fine hair system 1, it works twice as great, it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;an awesome combo. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perhaps too early to conclusively say whether this product helps fight hair loss or not...but I can still say that I like it.  It&#x27;s pricey, sure, but it honestly leaves my hair feeling fantastic.  The best endorsement I can offer for Revivogen is this--never has a shampoo left my hair and scalp feeling so great.  Keep in mind that I&#x27;ve been using shampoo for a long time...  But seriously, I quit taking Propecia a few months back and decided to give this a shot.  I&#x27;ve certainly lost hair since quitting Propecia, but this product does leave my hair feeling fuller and easier to style.  Any growth or prevention would be an added benefit in my opinion.  Despite the hair loss, my hair really hasn&#x27;t looked this great in a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 36 and lost a lot of hair due to chemo (10 years ago) and iron deficiency thereafter. After getting the iron back into control, I saw a dermatologist who recommended this product. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 weeks now and I see a difference in my hair. I have very thin, long, fine hair that needs washing every day so it&#x27;s not oily. While I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s doing much in the way of growing new hair, I like how this shampoo makes my hair FEEL--- By the end of the day, my hair isn&#x27;t looking oily or &amp;#34;separated,&amp;#34; as I am sensitive to the thinning in my hair part... instead it feels fluffier and has good body that lasts all day. Maybe I&#x27;m someone who prefers dry hair, and I do admit my scalp has had a few &amp;#34;crusties&amp;#34; and some dryness, but overall I&#x27;m pleased and will continue using this. I&#x27;m scared to try Rogaine as I really don&#x27;t want the initial shed I&#x27;ve read about, so I&#x27;m hopeful that just using this and some Biotin pills will help. My Dr. gave me a sample of the conditioner so I&#x27;ll try that soon, though again I prefer non-oily hair, so i rarely use any conditioner at all. But maybe that will combat the slight dry scalp...? Either way, I&#x27;m happy just using this and grateful for it.</li>
    <li> When I was a child I would pull out my hair and I&#x27;m proud to say that I haven&#x27;t pulled any out for over a year now. I am now dealing with the aftermath of my actions, which is a crop circle on top of my head. The hair is growing but not fast enough for me, so I thought I would purchase this product thinking and hoping that I would help the hair grow faster, but... It didn&#x27;t. Sadly it made my hair feel brittle, dry, thin and frizzy. I have been using this product for a month now still hoping that I would see some changes but instead it has made my crop circle worse. I don&#x27;t know what happened but this treatment has made the hair in that spot soooo much shorter, so short that when I have my hair down the baby hairs stick straight up like a cockatoo&#x27;s feathers. Since using Revivogen I&#x27;ve been shedding like crazy, hair is constanly falling out. So instead moving forward with my hair this product looks and feels like it is damaging my hair causing me wait even longer for my hair to grow back. I like the smell but it is too overpowering and causes my eyes to burn. I&#x27;m serious when I say this but I had better results using Suave kids shampoo/conditioner. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> after couple weeks, my hair designer told me more hair than last visit! I also can see it. I will keep trying.</li>
    <li> Prompt professional service, excellent plus. I&#x27;ve only had this product for a short while and can only say if the product is as good as the service then this is a winner.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo but I can&#x27;t tell if it really does anything for hair re-growth.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is good in that it gives volume to hair, especially thinning hair, but I only gave it 2 stars because it causes a lot of itchiness on my scalp.  I maybe allergic to one of its ingredients, but for people who are not allergic, it&#x27;ll be a good shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for Nioxin ever since they changed the formula. This shampoo is the best I ever ordered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it is SLS-free which means it is gentle on the scalp. It lathers really well with using only a small amount and gives a nice tingly feeling to your scalp. It has a great minty smell. The formula also includes zinc pyrithione and selenium sulfide, which has some anti-dandruff properties. And it helps give my thinning hair a little volume. SO if you are looking for these things in a shampoo, this will fit the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it will probably NOT do, however, is regrow or slow down your hair loss. So if you are a getting it for this purpose, don&#x27;t get your hopes up. There is no shampoo out there that can magically do that. For all other reasons though this shampoo is worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic,  but does thicken the hair.  It&#x27;s all I use,  was using my wife&#x27;s Biologe before.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and I hope it works!</li>
    <li> maybe i didnt use it right but it only made more hair fall out so maybe it works for some</li>
    <li> I noticed less hair falling out.  I have been on it for 3 months and I use the conditioner and scalp therapy as well.  We will see if it can stop my massive shedding.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two months now and the hair loss has stopped!  The only thing I am doing besides that is taking Biotin.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Only used it three times but definitely stopped the hair loss &amp; gives your hair a lot of bounce especially for fine hair...</li>
    <li> and it has essentially ruined my life. I won&#x27;t elaborate except to say&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo (rotating with others) but mostly this one&lt;br /&gt;for over ten years. I think it is very gentle but it does cleanse the scalp of toxic&lt;br /&gt;stuff, whether its dirt sweat or the chemicals I need to put on there to try to&lt;br /&gt;stimulate regrowth. It does not have a lot of lather to it because it lacks the harsh detergents&lt;br /&gt;that I think we should try to avoid although honestly there is far too big a deal made over that&lt;br /&gt;in my opinion. it is just good not to strip all the natural oils with the dirt.&lt;br /&gt;anyways I like this shampoo its a staple</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I was reading about this shampoo.  I had to try it and was very disappointed.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this gimmick.</li>
    <li> After immediate use of the shampoo/conditioner notice a dramatic reduction in my hair loss.  With continuous use my hair felt much softer, healthier  &amp; fuller.  I highly recommend this product for people with or without hair loss for fuller &amp; healthier hair.</li>
    <li> it gets my scalp too dry.  I can&#x27;t use this everyday.. Maybe once every week or two.  Pretty strong.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo I would like use it all my life</li>
    <li> Smell like those &amp;#34;tee tree&amp;#34; flavor shampoo which is ok, but little to dry to use on my hair.</li>
    <li> No more Hair loss since I start using this Shampoo..However, it makes the hair dry .. I really like it !!</li>
    <li> Revivogen Bio-Cleansing Shampoo is used to counter Nioxin 4 once in a while. I like to change occasionally... this does the trick.</li>
    <li> cleans well, smells good</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great for slowing down the thinning process, but you need the whole kit for the best results</li>
    <li> Its hard to find a product that will work with your hair since every persons body reacts differently to each drug or beauty solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product leaves my hair dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product that impressively worked for me was the Perfect Image but the company was sued and then closed and then replaced by a poor fake product called Perfect Hair which is a very close copy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is stay with good natural vitamins and be patient.</li>
    <li> Have been buying the shampoo and conditioner for my husband for over three years. He claims it slows his hair loss. Each bottle lasts a long time so price is far more reasonable than appears. You only need a little each time.</li>
    <li> total rip-off! overpriced, and it as good as any cheap shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo !&lt;br /&gt;I have been dealing with hair loss for 2 years now. I tried Aveda hair thinning products, pills etc. and no luck. This took a few months, but it was worth the wait. My hair is back to normal and I have new hair growth which is coming back quite fast. I use Nizoral every 3rd day as well. Revivogen is a nice clean shampoo and can be used on a regular basis. 5 stars for me</li>
    <li> buy three jars of this product, at first I saw more hair, but after two months to stop using it, I end up falling more hair. I lost my money.</li>
    <li> Been using this for several years now, and it keeps my hair full and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> it does arrest the hair fall</li>
    <li> MEN  WITH ,GRAYING, THINNING,ALL CAUSE BY DHT PRESENT WITHIN HAIR FAICAL BLOCKED  AT THE ROOT  , AS WE AGE MORE DHT IS CONVERTED IN OUR BODYS  , GREAT SHAMPOO  , WISH  I FOUND BEFORE</li>
