<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good experience  Quick shopping tricks on amazon.com  [...]</li>
    <li> love this. smells wonderful, reasonable price, and really nice fall/winter scent</li>
    <li> Women love this cologne! I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I get. I get teased a bit when they find out it&#x27;s Usher but....I&#x27;m willing to live with that.</li>
    <li> This was my third purchase . And will buy it again ! Great scent . Last for.a good 4 or 5 hours only .Not over powering  I just wished it would last longer .</li>
    <li> the perfume smelled like it had been sitting in a warehouse for years and when u put it on the smell hardly lasts and that the smell isn&#x27;t that good either...disappointed..</li>
    <li> Great price and a great smell.  Really enjoy the clean easy scent</li>
    <li> We bought this for our son - great scent and for a great price.  We love Amazon and the great deals.</li>
    <li> Great price and came on time!  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smell great and my wife loves when I put it on! i walk in the rooms and all you see is heads turning! Buy this and women will love it!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for about four years now. I have others, but this is my go to scent.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. And the price is unbeatable!</li>
    <li> This product IS A WASTE..... I highly recommend to not get it.....  This doesn&#x27;t even have a scent to it...  Smells like rubbing alcohol....  That&#x27;s it...  I literally sprayed ut in a cap and tried to smell it...  Nope not even a fruity aroma or a cheap fragrance just water and rubbing alcohol...  So don&#x27;t recommend this.  Would rather get oranges and rub it on my skin to smell good.  I would give this Zero stars if I could...</li>
    <li> great size good price</li>
    <li> My son is very picky when it comes to wearing men&#x27;s cologne (he wears the same one for years) but when I got Ur for him for fathers day, it was a big hit, he loves it and it sure smells good on him.  Wonderful scent, masculine and alluring at the same time. Love it!</li>
    <li> UR BY USHER IS A GREAT FRAGRANCE. I LOVE THE SMELL OF IT AND ITS GOOD FOR  ANY AGE.</li>
    <li> This smells better then his 1st 1 to me and it kills the vip this is a must have in my book it smelled so good I found a way to get a 8 oz bottle of this stuff and I know they dont make it but when you have enough money you can buy almost anything in this world</li>
    <li> I like this cologne alot it is deff worth the price i paid compared to stores. i highly recommend this fragrance, works well with anyday.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it and it isn&#x27;t a knock off.</li>
    <li> I like the smell a lot.  It is a different smell than the original &amp;#34;Usher&amp;#34;, but it stands on its on.  It does have more of a fruity smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the authenticity of the product. However the cologne smells exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to. I am familiar with the scent and they smell the exact same. With most knockoff colognes they usually aren&#x27;t as strong and don&#x27;t last as long, however so far it&#x27;s lasted 5 hours and still smells great. Fantastic product, came 3 days after I ordered.</li>
    <li> Great smell and nice big bottle</li>
    <li> Great gift! fast shipment</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent and I do as well!</li>
    <li> I receive A LOT of compliments whenever I wear this cologne. Its a chick magnet. Its also long lasting and not overly strong to give you a headache. Its just perfect to languish across the nose. Its masculine enough and very smooth.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews on amazon of how much of a lady magnet this cologne is, I was opted to buy. Then I read one particular review on basenotes.com which says that this stuff smells like all American stetson (which is cheaper). So i went ahead &amp; got the stetson &amp; it actually smelled really good... but I just had to do a personal comparison. After I gave in to buying this cologne, I must say I was very impressed... Stetson is good, but this is great! It is very noticeably different too. Smells somewhat fruity (not overdone), aquatic &amp; very light musky (masculine touch)... its sweet! As others have said, its a warm scent &amp; by no means overpowering, &amp; it will draw compliments. For the price this is a great deal and I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I have to spray a lot just so someone will notice.</li>
    <li> This is an edited review that has been revised after my evolution as a cologne user and experiencing real, designer products that a) smell better and more complex, b) last longer (like 8 hours or more) and project better (like someone 4 feet away can smell it...and smell it all day).    UR is one of those rare scents that stands out and gets the thumbs up from both men and women. I work in an office with 90% women in it and I have had a number of them notice and comment very favorably on UR. That said its primary downfall is that with 4 sprays on all the pulse points this scent goes close to the skin in 2 hours flat and I can&#x27;t smell it unless I press my nose against my skin by 4 hours.    Is the scent nice? Yes. Is the scent cheap? Yes. But you get what you pay for and for around $18-$20 that&#x27;s not much. Fact is that if you want a scent that lasts and that you and others can smell, you need to kick up the price of the product you&#x27;re buying to around $36. Is it double the price of UR? Yes it is....but you&#x27;ll use a third less product and you&#x27;ll get a much more enjoyable experience from it. There are a number of colognes at that price point that are UR peers (i.e.-fresh, clean, non-offensive scents that can be worn pretty much anywhere by anyone)...of them the most highly recommended by me would be 1. (far and away) Azzaro Chrome, 3.4 for $36 or 2. Lacoste Essential, 4.2 for $40. Also to be considered is Ed Hardy Love and Luck, 3.4 $36 (tester through Amazon) though its suffers from the same longevity and projection problems UR does however it gets high marks from women...more so than Chrome or Essential.    In the end UR is, IMO, a cologne for people that don&#x27;t (or in my case didn&#x27;t) know better product is out there. Once you&#x27;ve graduated to the likes of Chrome and then up the chain even farther into the realm of Le Male, A*Men and Body Kouros its really hard to take UR seriously or reach for it. I have 3/4 of a 3.4 oz bottle left and I&#x27;ll throw it on in the rare instance I only need a quick 2 or 3 hour frag for say a movie (and only then because my wife still loves it) but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.    It gets 2 stars from me now (vs. the 5 previously) primarily because women really do seem to like it and because it IS cheap.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my Dad for Christmas and he could not be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it. I got it for a great deal for how much you actually get. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Promptly delivered.. Fancier in real life than in pictures, the craftsmanship of the bottle and lid is top of the line. Amazing smell, lasts all day, smooth and subltle yet crisp and did i mention lasts a looong time!! Deffinatley will be reordering!!</li>
    <li> i love this spray , is strong and fresh . I recommended.</li>
    <li> It came earlier than I expected. It smells great on my husband and its a good size bottle. I recommended.</li>
    <li> Mild fresh scent which is pretty good for the price. I have begun using this as my everyday cologne. I use pricier ones for special occasions though. The scent does not last long and the mildness of this scent means that sweaty armpits may out-smell the cologne. But since I live in cold Seattle where summers last only for 2 months, this cologne works for me the rest of the year. Saves me a ton of money.</li>
    <li> This cologne is as fake as they get. It smells weak and only lasts for about 10 minutes...if you&#x27;re lucky. I don&#x27;t buy colognes from Amazon anymore because it&#x27;s always a gamble as to whether you&#x27;ll get the real cologne or a cheap knockoff like this one.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday. not too strong not too light</li>
    <li> Fake perfume, fake bottle, waste of money</li>
    <li> Smells very nice guys</li>
    <li> Great cologne. Smells great and very appealing. Women of mostly all ages will like the smell and would recommend. I believe this cost around the $20 range and smells better then my polo cologne which cost $70.</li>
    <li> Used to pay about $60 for this stuff so thought this was an awesome deal...it&#x27;s not. Still smells OK...but not nearly as good as the original. Definitely a knock off.</li>
    <li> I smelled this on a friend and it was awesome. On me, not so much though. I shall continue my quest for smell awesomeness because i dont think this is it for me.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted. I previously tried out the other Usher cologne (the black bottle, which has strong musky hints) and prefer this one. It&#x27;s scent is not as strong as other colognes, I&#x27;d say the strength is 6.5 on a scale from 1-10, but I think it is perfect because there is no point in wearing something too strong if it will only overwhelm the people you are talking to and make them only pay attention to smell. On the note of smell, this scent has almost no \\&quot;masculinity\\&quot; to it and could actually be used by both sexes. Three words to describe the scent (in order of dominance) are fruity, aquatic, and flowery. Even though I&#x27;m making it sound almost like girl perfume, it is definitely not girly. It just smells good, and all of my girl friends like it. I usually spray one hit on my neck, and the scent lasts for about 6 hours and as the smell ages, it only smells consistent or better and doesn&#x27;t make me feel overwhelmed or queasy the slightest bit, unlike many other colognes. An analogy to this cologne would be Old Spice&#x27;s newer line of white sticks that are lighter and not as \\&quot;manly\\&quot; in scent (Fiji, Matterhorn, Denali) versus their traditional, muskier smelling blue sticks. A similar cologne to this one is Chrome Azzaro (the blue liquid), but I like this one better because it is not super strong and smells less like girl perfume than the Chrome one. And this one is AMAZINGLY inexpensive.</li>
    <li> It was my brothers christmas gift&lt;br /&gt;He loves it</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive at first because of the low price however, after purchasing it I was very pleased.  I received this cologne before the estimated delivery date that was nice.  It had a very pleasant scent and lasted all day and night.  I would recommend this to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne! Came within two days of me placing my order. No problems or issues with the product. Smells great the ladies love it lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect much from an Usher cologne, but surprisingly, he has released some great scents. This was a present for my step dad, he enjoys wearing it, so does my 10 year old brother, and the price from amazon is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner. Item was just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, and he enjoys wearing it all the time!! It is a nice subtle scent that lasts a long time..</li>
    <li> I bought this product w/o knowing its aroma.  I was very shocked and pleased that it smells so lovely.  I keep getting compliments on it, as well.</li>
    <li> Love it no cons only pros this is a great product money well spent. I recommend this to any one who might be considering buying this product.</li>
    <li> Love this and always have, great smell all year round.</li>
    <li> the smell is cheap, compared to others i purchased, before,, smells like alcohol..havnt worn much, to get any feed back yet, we will see.</li>
    <li> My fiance loves this cologne...it smells good on him and doesnt clash with his body washes.</li>
    <li> Perfume last for such a decent price. And I must say it projects nicely and loved by all those who noted the scent.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing on my man!!! N he loved it...it&#x27;s not overpowering it&#x27;s just right!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know how it smelled but friends told me it smell asome so I was like ok lets give it a try and I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of good complaments at work</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM, I BOUGHT, AND TOTALLY REGRETTED, IT SMELLED OK, HOWEVER, IT ONLY LASTED MAYBE 10-20 MINUTES THEN YOU SMELL NOTHING UNLESS YOU SPRAY ON YOUR BODY AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;THE COLOGNE I BOUGHT AT 99 CENT STORE EVEN LASTED LONGER THAN THIS, IT LASTED ABOUT 2 HRS FOR ONLY 99C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY, I JUST THREW THIS IN THE TRASH,  SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON&#x27;T BELIEVE IN THOSE FAKE REVIEWS THAT SAID IT LAST ALL DAY, DID NOT LAST EVEN 30 MINUTES.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, my girlfriend loves the smell and I&#x27;ve gotten a few complements from others as well. I definitely recommend buying this</li>
    <li> The scent is gone within the hour. Either very old, or a fake. Spend a little more and get from a store.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with his cologane. I&#x27;m pleased with how fast I received it. I&#x27;m getting ready to purchase a 42 inch tv from you in the next couple if days. Amazon thank you because you have saved me money. Happy holidays</li>
    <li> Smells great! Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> So I go to this party right. I walk in the front door. HEADS WERE TURNING! - You ever see the tag commercials where girls fly threw shelves for the guy cause he&#x27;s wearing sex appealing cologne? -THATS REAL! This cologne is a pantie dropping miracle. Every man should have it! If you were to go to stores your looking anywhere from 25-40 dollars ON SALE! Here its 20 dollars! Its quality and quantity for a low price only here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This has always been one of my favorite colognes since the first time I used it. Sweet subtle scent and it lasts a long time. Amazing price on Amazon for this as well, 8 bucks cheaper than at walmart.</li>
    <li> My fiancee loves it very much... this was the second time i bought it... this time at a lower price...</li>
    <li> $18 will get you 3.4oz of a pretty decent cologne.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the best cologne you can get, but it isn&#x27;t the worst either.&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells good, and lasts a little while (granted not as long as I&#x27;d hope, but can&#x27;t complain)&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend likes it as well, and I like the bottle. The cap spins and it reminds me of a flask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, for $18 you can&#x27;t go wrong. It&#x27;s a great value so long as you understand you aren&#x27;t buying the greatest cologne ever made and don&#x27;t mind it not lasting all day. It smells decent for a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. The bottle has a nice weight to it and design. Most importantly; the smell... well it&#x27;s good. Smooth.</li>
    <li> This was a gift , my cousin said &amp;#34; love it has a great scent&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> great product great price whats not to like</li>
    <li> I brought this for my son and he loves it, I will be ordering a second one soon.  I was skeptical at first because of the price, I thought I would receive a watered down version, but it was fine.</li>
    <li> For a low price like $20.00, you cant ask for a better deal. Smells great and the order came in just 2 days on standard shipping!! All in all, great cologne and I&#x27;m very impressed by Usher.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good. A must have.</li>
    <li> It smells SO GOOD! Got it for my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used period.  And I don&#x27;t know the first thing about Raymond Usher  but this cologne is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Good fragrance at this price. But does not last long enough.</li>
    <li> EVERY time my boyfriend wears this I just want to jump his bones! mmm I recommend it to any man that wants to leave a good impression on the ladies!</li>
    <li> Smells good! Nice size bottle! Worth the price</li>
    <li> Great fragrance by Usher. Always complimented on this one especially my girlfriend. If you want the ladies to chase you this is it. Only downside the the longetivity but still smells great. Shipping was fast as well!!</li>
    <li> if you wanna smell like you da man this is for you. lasts long smells great this is what you want to make things just right.</li>
    <li> This cologne was the balm meaning it was everything that I was anticipating, it had a soft scent that were not over bearing to the nose and received many compliments. Wonderful Item.</li>
    <li> Not to overly expensive and smells great!  Husband loves it.. Just ordered another for xmas. I love that its smells great and not expensive!</li>
    <li> Got it in a timely fashion.Now as for the smell everyone so far has said that it is amazing.It is quite strong as well and last a very good amount of time.I will buy this again</li>
    <li> This silver bottle is much better than the black one. He loves it! It&#x27;s hard to find this specific one in stores.</li>
    <li> Great smell, and for guys that are wondering, yes, it gets girls attention.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for a birthday gift. Smells so good on him! And the price here is incredible! Will keep buying!!</li>
    <li> Not sweet or strong. It&#x27;s just perfect for my liking and at a great price. This one is a good purchase if your looking for something new to add to your collection.</li>
    <li> bought for the first time this brand , just excellent , very nice smell , my wife loves it and that is what we want ?</li>
    <li> Usher&#x27;s UR is great...... great price and super delivery.  I&#x27;d recommend to others and definitely a rebuy, value for money</li>
    <li> Thought it would have a more distinct smelling. Wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be. Still looking for a knock out cologne like Aventus to add to my collection.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted my son and friend enjoy this cologne and always smell good.  They are always complimented whenever they wear this cologne.</li>
    <li> The fragance is ok , but I doesn&#x27;t last long, I like the bottle presentation</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A GIFT FORM ME TO MY HUBBY. IT HAS A NICE AROMA FOR THE WARMER MONTHS. IT SEEMS TO HAVE A AROMA OF CITRUS,,MUSK,AND MAYBE WOODS? NICE!</li>
    <li> i have never found anything about Usher i did not like the price is always reasonalabe and it always smells great on my hubsand so this one i will order again.</li>
    <li> I like this better than the first Usher. (In a black Bottle). This one has more forest based smells like moss and ambers. Very nice</li>
    <li> It smells nice. It&#x27;s a great cologne. It stays on you for a decent amount of time and it is an attraction. If your pockets are looking for something reasonable then you should get this.</li>
    <li> It is a great size for travel, the price was good, and I get a lot of compliments while wearing it.</li>
    <li> These were purchase as gifts and both men like the coolness and smell they are not too strong and very inexpensive</li>
    <li> cheap... smell fades away very fast!!.. i think its not the original...</li>
    <li> Love it.  Fast delivery</li>
    <li> the smell was great,  I recomend it :)</li>
    <li> This is great smelling long lasting cologne &amp; the plus is the ladies love the smell of it exactly why I bought it in the first place. So a win win for me as far as I am concerned. Thank You Mr. Usher for picking out such great smell good scents so we can smell like a million bucks &amp; this is good for a single male like me to attract the opposite sex exactly what us men live for until we find that special someone &amp; then we can only smell good for one which we good men strive for. So Thanks Usher You Rock!</li>
    <li> I was searching looking for something  new and this has a great price &amp; has a different kick to it..........</li>
    <li> Husband loves the cologne.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Great service. My son uses it every day! And it was a great price. Will buy again definitely.</li>
    <li> User&lt;br /&gt;This one didn&#x27;t make me sing like Usher  but the ladies come running up to me at work asking what do you have on and where did you get it</li>
    <li> I bought this colon and it came sooner than the shipping date, is a long lastin cologn and smells really good, u can spray it Like 2or 3 times and the smell will stay on your clothes. So I recomend people to buy it it&#x27;s xheap</li>
    <li> Loved it. hints of floral notes, low citrus notes, very very mellow and discrete, lasts all day, about 2 years id say, and he wears it everyday. GET IT!</li>
    <li> smells good, great price</li>
    <li> I was quite sure about purchasing this cologne considering the fact that i have never even smelled or heard of it. Boy thank god I bought it because i dont regret this purchase at all love how it smells and it stays on for a pretty long time too. Defenitly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this cologne...  I get complimented on wearing it constantly and it has a very clean and classy smell, highly recommended it!</li>
    <li> this a great product..i give the shipper two thumbs up....trust me when i say they give you good products not like some...peace</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne, however I don&#x27;t feel that it lasts very long, like some of the other reviews have stated.  I still think it&#x27;s well worth the money I spent on it.</li>
    <li> This scent is a light yet sexy smell that turns out to be my favorite r e r rt e e</li>
    <li> Simply sexy!  Compliments &#x27;&#x27;left and right&#x27;&#x27; with this one!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST men&#x27;s cologne I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Great product, just what I ordered</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes. Women love it. That the whole point, right?</li>
    <li> Exactly what was wanted.  Great value for the size. Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My Son love this by Usher, this smell so Damm Good. when I get a chance I will buy him another bottle and I will buy me usher for women so I could see how that smell. I know it will smell just as good..Love it... Thanks Again Amazon...</li>
    <li> Smells great. My son loves it!</li>
    <li> I just got this about 7 hours ago. Honestly, it is a little in the ball park of what i expected. This had potential to be a five star or a four and a half star cologne BUT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: doesn&#x27;t seem to last- THIS STUFF IS SHORTER THAN HIS SONGS!!! The longevity is pretty...bad.&lt;br /&gt;2: that is it...yes...that&#x27;s pretty much the only flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a proud owner of such colognes as versace pour homme, aqua Di gio, other versace fragrances (my favorite fragrance house) i think this is great for what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you could make it last and a little more stronger, this is great. It&#x27;s unique, pretty straightforward, and a cool alternative cologne. I can see myself wearing this in Virginia beach in one of those Virginia beach shore clubs. People are closer to you (because people are packed in there tight together...including women lol) and they can smell it. But, other than that you will be nonexistent cologne wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see 16-22 year olds wearing this. I would have given five stars of not for the bad longevity and the fact that i didn&#x27;t get a tracking number. But i got a free sample of another cologne when i ordered from fragrancenet.com!</li>
    <li> UR (Usher Raymond) by Usher improves with time.  That is, it starts with a strong odor-- the musky, woodsy ingredients overpower the more citrus elements-- but then fades a few hours later into a more mellow, pleasant scent.  The presentation and bottle are fairly average; the cap/top is nicely designed.  For me this was a mediocre cologne, but I have a preference for lighter, fruitier scents.</li>
    <li> Smells good but does not last long</li>
    <li> it was great and the price was great also!!!</li>
    <li> far cheaper that the stores, prestigious</li>
    <li> Good flavor but does not last long</li>
    <li> Smells good, price is right.</li>
    <li> This purchase have led to me loving the spray. wonderful really and individuals love the smell. Ladies like the smell. Not too strong but really nice.</li>
    <li> Work very good for me....Thank You....!!!!!</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my son, he really liked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its aroma is exquisite</li>
    <li> Awesome. Love it. Great value. Came earlier than I expected. Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Sure Usher&#x27;s career may be washed up but this cologne is not bad.  It smells better than a lot of really expensive colognes.  For the price it&#x27;s tough to beat</li>
    <li> WHATS NOT TO LOVE!!  USER IS ALWAYS A GREAT GIFT FOR MALE IN YOUR LIFE.  MY GRANDSON LOVES THE USHER LINE AND IT IS VERY SEXY!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for three of the men in our family for Christmas.  I had never smelled it, so I kind of stuck my neck out on it.  Gratefully, they all really liked it.  Whew!!  I had heard of Usher, but had never purchased it.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> The perfume comes in a lovely bottle and it has a great scent! Its not too strong and the scent lasts all day long!</li>
    <li> I wanted to get something new and different for my boyfriend.  You know sometimes when men find a fragrance that they like they stick with it forever.  Well from a woman&#x27;s stand point we want some change every now and then.  Trying something new can be exciting.  When he got this and put it on he liked it and I loved it.  I&#x27;m hooked and I hope he is too.</li>
    <li> just one word &#x27;amazing&#x27;, I have been using this cologne like 2 years and don&#x27;t think to change it ....</li>
    <li> I purchased for $17 on Amazon. Good back up cologne. My wife likes the scent. Does not last long though.</li>
    <li> I received the order was on time and was as expected.It&#x27;s well worth the price. I Would recommend it. Long lasting smell.</li>
    <li> good product, but does not last all day</li>
    <li> This was by far the best cologne I have ever owned not only will you thick you will smell good but so will that special lady friend.</li>
    <li> Happy with purchase, would buy from again!!!</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne, fast shipping, and GREAT PRICE. I would definitely order from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;I have so many people compliment me on this cologne.</li>
    <li> I found this on Amazon and was so amazed with the price and the size... I order this for my boyfriend for Valentines day and he and I both LOVED the smell of it. Ladies, if you want your man to smell like a millon bucks- please try!! Nothin more to say-</li>
    <li> very sexy and cool smell....highly recommended to any man looking for a nice cologne...the ladies love it too. thanks alot</li>
    <li> Nothing to do with seller. I had gotten a small sample a few months back or the&lt;br /&gt;same cologne. The 3.4 oz. contents seems less effective..it could be me.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price if it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping..... Love the cologne..... great for going out</li>
    <li> Awesome cologne that last all day. i have received lots of complements from girls and even guys. Even after two days i can still smell the cologne on my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;i wanna wear this cologne every days&lt;br /&gt;great product! totally recommend you buy it</li>
    <li> Good deal!  Love this fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy! It smells absolutely wonderful. It is just the right size. It was just the right price too.</li>
    <li> Great deal and great buy. The owners got the products to me in a timely fashion and I will continue to do business with them.</li>
    <li> Pulls all the honeys, playboy bunnies, those wanting money.</li>
    <li> Love the clean smell of UR on my husband.  Every one comments on how good he smells. Excellent price on  UR.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I have had so many women fall in love with me because of this cologne! You don&#x27;t need looks, personality, money, height, or any of that nonsense. Thank you Usher. Seriously, this stuff smells so good.</li>
    <li> I rolled the dice on this cologne for 20 bucks. To me, it smells like a less obnoxious [[ASIN:B000C214II Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male By Jean Paul Gaultier For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 Oz.]]. I&#x27;m an everyday user of [[ASIN:B000C213ES Acqua Di Gio By Giorgio Armani For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 6.7 Ounces]], and still believe this cologne cannot be touched. I&#x27;ve tried possibly every cologne, and feel most are overpriced. I saw that this cologne has a lot of quality ingredients, so I dropped 20 dollars. This cologne isn&#x27;t obnoxious at all, but it just doesn&#x27;t have that a strong manly smell I&#x27;m searching for. It&#x27;s more of a powdery fruity smell with a touch of masculinity. Seems more like an evening cologne to me. I will alternate between this and[[ASIN:B000P276G4 Boss Selection By Hugo Boss For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 1.7 oz]]which I wear during the evenings. I think a lot of people may like this smell. It&#x27;s just not my favorite, although it&#x27;s nice. Finally, I can&#x27;t stop thinking of how it reminds me of a subtle better masculine version of [[ASIN:B000277N7Y Happy By Clinique For Men. Cologne Spray 1.7 Oz.]] Peace</li>
    <li> My husband love it.. Smell so good.. I gift to him for him birthday .. Is original</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Great value...cheap in price!</li>
    <li> Smells great! Scent lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> Thank you great price and product</li>
    <li> The bottle of spray was empty so i cant rate the smell, Now i have to waste my time to ship back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;vd been using Usher by Usher for men, and still do.  Decided to add this to the collection, don&#x27;t like as much as the other one</li>
    <li> Good, fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> My father especially loved this product he uses it as an everyday smell like casual smell. Not too strong like a going out smell. Good smell for everyone  to smell around you at work or school</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present. I love the smell of this colongne for my boyfriend. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> Usher for men does not last,not crazy about the&lt;br /&gt;fragrance to start off with. Nice packaging but&lt;br /&gt;thats were it ends.</li>
    <li> I truly love the fragrance, and you get what you pay for, That&#x27;s all a consumer could ask for. Thanks for getting it right the first time.</li>
    <li> Great price and great scent.  I keep coming back!</li>
    <li> Really like the way this smells</li>
    <li> It came on time. It smells wonderful</li>
    <li> received on time and just what I wanted</li>
    <li> I bought this as I wanted to experiment with wearing cologne, for a change. I wasn&#x27;t looking to spend too much, so I settled on finding a cheap, but well regarded Eau De Toilette spray, and this seemed to fit the the bill. Reviews were pretty good, and the price was just about right, so I jumped on the opportunity to try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving the package, I was surprised at the quality of the bottle. It was outstanding, as I was expecting something much cheaper for what I paid. Solid and durable bottle, and a nice touch on the metal top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the scent goes, its about what I expected. Its pretty decent, as long as you don&#x27;t spray it too generously. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the scent, as I&#x27;m pretty new to cologne and all, but its pretty good. I&#x27;ve been wearing this for a few month now, and I have grown fond of the smell, but its not &#x27;my&#x27; scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Perhaps, only because I am considering finding something that I like a little better, but for this price, its really quite good. Recommend to those looking for cheap alternative to the expensive colognes, or someone who is just breaking into the &#x27;scene&#x27;, like I was.</li>
    <li> love the way it smells,delivery was very quick.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, totally recommended.!</li>
    <li> The original sense was really nice Smelling but this new one has a distinguish smell that I enjoy very much And people always asking me what I have on. I would recommend this Cologne to everyone.</li>
    <li> Not a very good smell in my opinion.  The other Usher scent that I bought I found to be more enjoyable.  You may like it, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Very positive experience. Look forward to another transaction in the future</li>
    <li> I brought this for a Christmas Gift for my oldest son who is grown! I can tell he was disappointed but after he put it on and got a lot of compliments on how good he smells, the frown turned into a smile! Enjoyed the product and it made it here on time!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing great price! Will buy again</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the price is good too.</li>
    <li> Great scent. My boyfriend put it on very early in the day and by late evening the scent was still strong! Great product!</li>
    <li> He loves it! It is only slightly musky, a little oaky, a very well-rounded cologne for the price.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this cologne. It smells very good. Would tell others too buy the cologne. Rate it a definite 5 star.</li>
    <li> i ordered this 2 days ago and it said it wouldnt be here til next week and it shipped yesterday and is here now, man this fragrance is AMAZING, like im not lying no gimmick, buy it, the chicks dig it. And its cheap as hell, talking bout killing two birds with one stone and i didnt think the stars fragrances smelled good, boy was i wrong.</li>
    <li> This product is simply a great product.&lt;br /&gt;You definitely get the bang for your buck here no question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent lasts all day long, up to 48 hours.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, last a while.&lt;br /&gt;Metal bottle with heavy metal cap.  Very unusual.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a nice gift and a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Spray cap broke.  Never happened to me in all my 30 years of wearing cologne.  Not too satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Two words... Night time. Cause this smell could put the big dogs to rest. Lol don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you. It&#x27;s a contender for sure.</li>
    <li> So I got this product well ontime at my frends door step although she usually enters via her garage door so the packages sat outside or a day and a half before she saw them. Anyway I am in Jamaica&lt;3 and so she wascoming for the christmas holiday so I was looking forward to it. I absoultely love the bottle the top notes are well pronounved and comes across as a nice fruity scent girls will Love. But it only last for about 4hrs for me. So I would recommened it as a night time party cologne.</li>
    <li> Long lasting and smells good. Recommended it to all my friends. Probably one of the best colognes I have ever purchased</li>
    <li> el perfume es original tiene un olor suave refrescante muy bueno para jovenes como yo de 24 años se lo recomiendo buen precio aqui en pr ese perfume sale como en los $55 dolares lo compre en $22</li>
    <li> The fragrance has a very fresh scent..I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments about it. The thing is though it seems to fade away quickly...it&#x27;s either that or my nose just gets accustomed to it really quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. I like this for work. Not to strong and not sweet.</li>
    <li> Superb scent! Day time &amp; evenings. My wife &amp; my mom both loved it! And just $20 I am glad I didnt go wrong!</li>
    <li> It is a birthday gift for my husband and it smells awesome I have it to him early he really like the smell at just the right price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne. The usher part is pretty cheezy, but it&#x27;s a less popular one that gets a lot of compliments and a lot of guys don&#x27;t wear it.</li>
    <li> it smells good but is very strong</li>
    <li> Sexiest smell for men . All girls , ladies &amp; women and also men like this smell . I&#x27;ve been using this since I received it . This is third bottle . Love this product</li>
    <li> Perfect.. All eyes on you when you wear this!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and it was what I wanted...thank you!!! Not too mention the price was PERFECT!!!!! Thanks again!!! How could you pass this deal up for this price. Woman love the smell of this!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the price of it its worth it. when i order it it gets shipped to me usually 2 days before the estimate. i love the smell, the price, and the service.</li>
    <li> Would buy again.The product sells realy good. the aroma drives the Women Crazy.A real great buy so buy!!!! I will do again.</li>
    <li> Now my vest smell good</li>
    <li> The scent does not last very long. The smell was not mindblowing in fact its is alright at best. Maybe because it says made in the US. Eau de Toilette is usually a hit when from France. The bottle has a spray painted look and feel to it.</li>
    <li> Yeah, its good stuff, fair price.</li>
    <li> Good product ... And excellence fragrance</li>
    <li> This scent eclipses Usher&#x27;s inaugural cologne &amp;#34;Usher&amp;#34; yet both are equally pleasing to the olfactory organs. Trust me, this cologne will not disappoint. Buy it.</li>
    <li> great product. can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
    <li> This cologne has been my fragrance of choice for the last 4 years and continues to be into the 2015 year.</li>
    <li> SEXY SMELL BUT NOT COMPLEX OR LASTING , GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE OFFICE (AT LEAST FOR THE FIRST HOURS IN THE MORNING) , VERY GOOD COLOGNE AND SIZE FOR THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> Great smell, wife loves it! Recommend this to everyone. Spray it on after morning shower and smell great the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son, who is disabled.  Nice scent, long lasting.  When we get ready for church on Sundays, he looks for the cologne and gives it to me to spray.  I have to say I think he likes it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t keep my girlfriend off of me when I wear this.  Only 4 stars because my girlfriend wants to do inappropriate things with me in public when I am wearing this.</li>
    <li> The smell is good but it lasts only about 2 hours. Knockoff?</li>
    <li> This is a hidden talent if I can say so, I work at a fragrance shop and this is always a favorite with the customers, and of course myself, I&#x27; actually due for another bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really picky with how I smell and don&#x27;t usually wear cologne. I got a sample-size bottle of this as a gift a few years ago. When it ran out, I tried using the other samples in the package, but I kept thinking I needed this again. Women always tell me I smell good when I&#x27;m wearing it, but it doesn&#x27;t last long, so it&#x27;s only women in the first half of the night. I suppose I could spray it between the layers of my clothes and it would evaporate more slowly, but then it would be overkill and I&#x27;d be the &amp;#34;cologne dude.&amp;#34; I compared it with Usher and liked this one better. I used Le Male for a while, but it&#x27;s pricey. This bottle will probably last me 3 years or more. Also, the packaging is beautiful and the bottle looks very nice on the dresser. For under $20, this stuff is a steal.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful. my husband loved it,</li>
    <li> Get compliments all the time, I bought it before but I seen it at a better price on here, do I was like got to get again</li>
    <li> Amazing gift for my boyfriend! Also the bottke was bigger than I thought it would be which is amazing.</li>
    <li> Good cologne for everyday use. Suspect on buying something before smelling it but glad I bought it. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> not for regular use. The fragrance is very strong, but it is more suited for parties or stuff..the fragrance is pretty  good though. you will like it 15-20 minutes after applying</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, it&#x27;s his casual cologne. I actually really like this scent on him and like that he uses it every day. I hit the bull&#x27;s eye with this one.</li>
    <li> Have to get used to it but after a whille, smells good. Cant beat the price for this product. Overall Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say anything bad about this cologne!  Huge bottle for a good price and smells very good.</li>
    <li> I usually use Axe&#x27;s chocolate scent which did good for me in high school but after a few days of using Usher&#x27;s fragrance in college I got a few complements from girls I dont even know. It smells good and its not overpowering like some colognes you would find in the dollar store</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I loved this!  YES, buy it.  It is the best my husband&#x27;s had in a while</li>
    <li> It doesn´t last more than 15 minutes</li>
    <li> Girlfriend bought this for me a few years ago and I absolutely love it. It smells right and lasts throughout the day. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I do believe this is a knock of version..  I smelt this product at a local macys and it smelt so much better.  Buyers beware, the deal is to good to be true.</li>
    <li> got this for my bf n he loves it!!</li>
    <li> this is FAKE it only last 10 mins on my skin. the smell don&#x27;t even smell like the Original UR.</li>
    <li> Love it! this scent stay on longer than most popular cologne, will buy it again</li>
    <li> wonderful crisp scent to wear and last very long and a great price .</li>
    <li> My son really liked this fragrance.  Gave to him for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the bottle is really cool if that matters to anyone, it did leak a small amount in shipping and so that is why the four star rating but it was so small it was pretty much not a problem. I will say that it does smell exactly the same as Swiss Guard&#x27;s spray, so do not buy the two because its a waste of money...</li>
    <li> Smells great, i wish it were stronger</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Ur\\&quot; by Usher smells great. It last long and my girlfriend can&#x27;t keep her hands off me. i rate this product as a five star toilette spray for men.</li>
    <li> Excellent. i have no complains what so ever about the product. The package was delivered very quickly and item was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Smells great. You won&#x27;t regret buying it. Came on time.</li>
