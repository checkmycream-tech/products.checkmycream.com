### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>it smells great!</li>
      <li>BEST SOAP EVER !!</li>
      <li>:D    </li>
      <li>Soap is very good</li>
      <li>The product worked great for lightening the skin, but it wouldn&#x27;t tan because it bleaches the skin.</li>
      <li>Now i just feel great.    </li>
      <li>The soap is amazing!</li>
      <li>It smells soo good.</li>
      <li>Smells good and visibly lightened my skin within days just as promised on the box.</li>
      <li>When I ordered this product the smell was wonderful, and it did smooth my skin like it says</li>
      <li>so so good.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>It does work and it smell good, but just make sure you buy the lotion that goes along with this one too.</li>
      <li>Overall: GOOD STUFF and YES very satisfied :D</li>
      <li>Another great thing about this soap, you know how everyone gets razor bumps or sweet spots (what some folks would call it)</li>
      <li>It does leave your skin very smooth, you will notice your skin is smoother.</li>
      <li>I Love the Smell</li>
      <li>One more thing: THIS SOAP SMELLS SOOOOOO FREAKIN</li>
      <li>oh my goodness..not sure about the lighter skin just yet</li>
      <li>THAT MAKES ME QUESTION WHETHER ITS AUTHENTIC OR NOT.</li>
      <li>i love it on my skin</li>
      <li>the papaya soap works so much better than this.</li>
      <li>and I feel so confident.</li>
      <li>, i am a shade lighter.i will be ordering more ,today</li>
      <li>Like most skin whitening products though, the results are incremental and don&#x27;t happen overnight.</li>
      <li>after you use it, since it does exfoliate, it does dry the skin out a lot so use a great moisturizer!</li>
      <li>But overall it is a very good soap I recommend for teenagers</li>
      <li>It was so smooth</li>
      <li>should keep their skin blemish free.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll notice results quicker if you&#x27;re already fairly light skinned.</li>
      <li>It literally leaves your skin so smooth.</li>
      <li>The only thing that I like about this soap is that it hads a good smell to it</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been using this soap for a a couple of months with NO results whatsoever, and my skin tends to lighten pretty easily.</li>
      <li>I like this product because it does not dry your skin after use, I chose four stars to rate this product because I have good feelings about the results I have seen so far.</li>
      <li>I will certainly continue to use it!</li>
      <li>Super duper moisturizing...left my skin so soft and clean feeling</li>
      <li>The soap does whiten but very very very gradually.</li>
      <li>Other whitening soaps do not have a good smell, but this one smells really marevelous.</li>
      <li>...will come back with another update...absolutely love..</li>
      <li>I first used KP duty body scrub</li>
      <li>I use this soap first in the bath</li>
      <li>Another good thing is the bar last really long.</li>
      <li>No joke, I gave this a 4 star for certain reasons.     </li>
      <li>I liked the pink one better because of the little pink beads in it that helps more.</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t really seen the Results that I thought I would ...</li>
      <li>Its very pleasing and calming.</li>
      <li>I said to myself wow!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars for not being super effective and showing dramatic results within the first use, but</li>
      <li>Con: as far as the whitening, it didn&#x27;t whiten as fast as i anticipated</li>
      <li>I was skeptical about doing so at first, since I have fair skin which is highly sensitive.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a new complexion.</li>
      <li>The skin definitely does get darker the first 3days then the layer peels off after the 5th day.</li>
      <li>This is my first time actually purchasing this soap.</li>
      <li>I was like WOW...</li>
      <li>After nearly four weeks of use the product has yet to produce any discernable results whatsoever.</li>
      <li>I was completely embarrassed.</li>
      <li>WOW &amp; smells</li>
      <li>but before i would alllwayys be so self conscious about it.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s smoother, is soft and it is moist</li>
      <li>however it does it slowly but surely.</li>
      <li>This product definitely works, but I felt like my skin turned more pale than it did lightening up.</li>
      <li>i mean excellent for sensitive skin, and at first when you jump out of the shower you feel weird with a the after effect of the soap, but when you dry off.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking to correct dark blemishes or lighten certain skin areas.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen/felt a difference the first few times I used it.</li>
      <li>This soap smells great but as far as lightening any of my marks or old scars it failed its purppse!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The soap is amazing! No joke, I gave this a 4 star for certain reasons.     Pros: Soap is very good i mean excellent for sensitive skin, and at first when you jump out of the shower you feel weird with a the after effect of the soap, but when you dry off. It literally leaves your skin so smooth. I was so amazed that i didn&#x27;t even use lotion! Another great thing about this soap, you know how everyone gets razor bumps or sweet spots (what some folks would call it) this soap actually cleared it out. I was like WOW... Now i have less razor bumps and I feel so confident. Sounds cheesy i know but before i would alllwayys be so self conscious about it. Now i just feel great.    One more thing: THIS SOAP SMELLS SOOOOOO FREAKIN GOOOD     Please note : Everyone is different when using this product, please be advised we all have different skin types. :D    Con: as far as the whitening, it didn&#x27;t whiten as fast as i anticipated however it does it slowly but surely. So that&#x27;s why i rated a 4 star. if i could give it a 4 and a half i would&#x27;ve done so..    Overall: GOOD STUFF and YES very satisfied :D</li>
    <li> This is my first time actually purchasing this soap. I was skeptical about doing so at first, since I have fair skin which is highly sensitive. I&#x27;ve seen/felt a difference the first few times I used it. I have some dark patches that took quite a long time to fade. I see an improvement in my skin color and texture. I will be writing again with an update</li>
    <li> My skin has been breaking out real bad since using this soap! My skin is itching like crazy and I have hundreds of small little bumps all over my body...... I won&#x27;t purchase it anymore! A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I brought this soap at the local Farmers market. It smells soo good. Its very pleasing and calming. Other whitening soaps do not have a good smell, but this one smells really marevelous. Another good thing is the bar last really long. The soap does whiten but very very very gradually. It does leave your skin very smooth, you will notice your skin is smoother. One of the reviews stated dont use on face. you should use on face, thats where I noticed ssmoother skin. Just build up gradually to leaving it on. I leave mines on all night and I dont have any problems, and never have. Each person is different. I also gave 4 stars and not 5 to the lightening not really noticeable. But overall it is a very good soap I recommend for teenagers should keep their skin blemish free.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works, but I felt like my skin turned more pale than it did lightening up. I&#x27;m african American i wanted to even out my neck and face. my neck is way darker than my face and body. So I used it on my face neck and body, and in three days my face kept getting lighter and my neck looked darker and my body stayed the same. The beads inside the soap some times were painful against my skin. The skin definitely does get darker the first 3days then the layer peels off after the 5th day. and it&#x27;s a new complexion. But it wasn&#x27;t the shade I was going for, so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Carcinogenic content.</li>
    <li> Smells good and visibly lightened my skin within days just as promised on the box. The trick is to lather it and allow it to sit on your skin for 3-5 minutes before rinsing it off. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days and am already getting compliments on my glowing complexion. I will certainly continue to use it!</li>
    <li> People have different skin tones and the same problem like Whitehead&#x27;s on nose....it didn&#x27;t do that to me. Keep In mind they don&#x27;t all work on peoples faces.  It was so smooth n I seen a difference between my skintone n my dads skintone. Mine was lighter then his. I said to myself wow!!! N it smells great! It don&#x27;t even show bumps on my face.  It just lighten up. I use this soap first in the bath then the other soap then apply coconut oil. Amma purchase the belo whitening lotion.</li>
    <li> I Don&#x27;t Dislike it I Love the Smell but I haven&#x27;t really seen the Results that I thought I would ...I will However continue to use it and Hopefully will see Results Soon</li>
    <li> This soap is &amp;#34;AMAZING!! I still have some left but the amount that I didn&#x27;t use this soap is lightning my skin....WOW &amp; smells so so good. My skin is glowing, it&#x27;s smoother, is soft and it is moist</li>
    <li> I choose this product to lighten up my ance scares on my face. It did nothing for me but dried my face out. Not lighten at all. The only thing that I like about this soap is that it hads a good smell to it</li>
    <li> I like this product because it does not dry your skin after use, I chose four stars to rate this product because I have good feelings about the results I have seen so far. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to correct dark blemishes or lighten certain skin areas.</li>
    <li> THE BOX CAME OPEN IT WASN&#x27;T SEALED AT ALL! THAT MAKES ME QUESTION WHETHER ITS AUTHENTIC OR NOT. BUYERS BEWARE!</li>
    <li> THIS SOAP IS NO GOOD ,IT DO NOT WORK FOR WHAT IT CLAIMS.</li>
    <li> I liked the pink one better because of the little pink beads in it that helps more. It does work and it smell good, but just make sure you buy the lotion that goes along with this one too.</li>
    <li> the papaya soap works so much better than this. i&#x27;ve been using this soap for a a couple of months with NO results whatsoever, and my skin tends to lighten pretty easily.</li>
    <li> BEST SOAP EVER !! LOVE IT! START WORK AFTER 5 DAYS!!REORDERING NOW</li>
    <li> This soap smells great but as far as lightening any of my marks or old scars it failed its purppse!!! Not worth the time or money !!!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll notice results quicker if you&#x27;re already fairly light skinned. Like most skin whitening products though, the results are incremental and don&#x27;t happen overnight. I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars for not being super effective and showing dramatic results within the first use, but then again, what whitening product does?</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product the smell was wonderful, and it did smooth my skin like it says&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side I didn&#x27;t see any lightening of the body or my face when I used it for acne spots&lt;br /&gt;and after you use it, since it does exfoliate, it does dry the skin out a lot so use a great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> After nearly four weeks of use the product has yet to produce any discernable results whatsoever. There hasn&#x27;t been any lightening of the skin.</li>
    <li> i love it on my skin i see a different, i am a shade lighter.i will be ordering more ,today</li>
    <li> Super duper moisturizing...left my skin so soft and clean feeling I first used KP duty body scrub then this product oh my goodness..not sure about the lighter skin just yet...will come back with another update...absolutely love..</li>
    <li> I used this product because I started getting dark skin under my underarms from shaving.  I had my friends wedding to attend in the summer time. The product worked great for lightening the skin, but it wouldn&#x27;t tan because it bleaches the skin. So I showed up in a strapless dress totally tan except my under arms. I was completely embarrassed.</li>
    <li> After a few days of using it my skin became noticeably whiter. For those wanting whiter and smoother skin this is recommended.</li>
