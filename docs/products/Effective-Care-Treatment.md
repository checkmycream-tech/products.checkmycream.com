      <li>Now for the past four months I have been using the Effective Care line.</li>
      <li>Smells and looks like vanilla pudding yum, this stuff is strong best of all you only need a little and a little bit goes a long way</li>
      <li>I live in 80% humidity or higher and it manages to tame my hair for the most part.</li>
      <li>I have also paid a lot more money on products while receiving much less results.</li>
      <li>All I could do is smile at the results of using this product because I felt like My real hair texture is back.</li>
      <li>This product gives my old, gray hair the shine &amp; body it needs!!</li>
      <li>I have natural thick hair and it works lovely!</li>
      <li>I tried a sample at home and it made my hair feeling new and soft.  </li>
      <li>My hair is so smooth and soft in one use (not even half the packet).</li>
      <li>It also detangled my hair which was an unexpected surprise.</li>
      <li>My hair felt gritty and this just absolutely did wonders.</li>
      <li>But overall, i like this product because it made my hair soft and feeling new and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This hair repair solution works soooo well. I tried a sample at home and it made my hair feeling new and soft.  Before you use it, read instructions just in case. But overall, i like this product because it made my hair soft and feeling new and thats why i bought it.</li>
    <li> After having to do waaayyyy too much stuff to my hair, in a 48 hour period, after a horrible salon botch job, this stuff is a godsend.  So thick and awesome.  Leave it in for as long as you want, the longer the better, and it will condition your hair to silky softness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and love it! I was happy to find it in a larger pump style bottle!</li>
    <li> I use this as a deep conditioning treatment after I touch up my roots each month. Leaving it in for about 10 minutes before rinsing. I wash my hair every other day, and once a week use this in the shower as my conditioner. I use a regular condition in between used. This product is well worth the price and this size will last quite a while. A little goes a long way. My hair is down to my lower back, and while I have a lot of hair, each shaft is thin, so this helps it from tangling up. It also doesn&#x27;t have a thick cheep perfume smell to it like so many products do these days.</li>
    <li> This hasn&#x27;t had too much of an effect on my hair, but it does feel a bi thicker after using this. It doesn&#x27;t help with damage or softness though, so I don&#x27;t recommend it for that.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great quality for the price though, this is a very big bottle.</li>
    <li> This product works I have relaxed hair. This conditioner brought my hair back to life.  I use it once every two weeks. My hair has length and body.I also purchase it from Sally hair supply</li>
    <li> Just dyed my hair dark brown &amp; this stuff made it shine and soft like no other! Couldn&#x27;t love it enough! I just bought a sample at my nearest Sally&#x27;s now I&#x27;m totally going for the big bottle! :) Buy this - trust me it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> really good conditioner, it leaves my hair did and silky, and also it smells awesome. it is a good investment.</li>
    <li> Best vegan conditioner.</li>
    <li> I used it once and I was also not allowed to be reimbursed for it so I donated it to Good Will.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this item from Amazon, but felt compelled to leave a review. I went to Sally&#x27;s and this on sale for $10.00 great buy. This product is AWSOME!!!!! I have been dealing with over processed hair for about 4yrs, and have adopted a habit of pulling or breaking off my straw feeling strands and Ugly split ends. This product made my hair feel and look healthier since being over processed. My hair feels soft and strong. All I could do is smile at the results of using this product because I felt like My real hair texture is back. My strands use to look swollen and feel like Straw(ugh),but Ion has help my hair tremendously after just one use. My thought is, if I continue to use this product while transitioning to natural, I can keep my fingers out of my hair(breaking off strands) and keep hair on my head :). If your dealing with the same problem that I am, Trust me this product works and I will purchase this item again, and again.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional product for building up the texture and silkiness (not oily) of your hair. I have used this for several years. I live at least three hours from a Sally&#x27;s store now and I buy it online because I can&#x27;t do without it. I live in 80% humidity or higher and it manages to tame my hair for the most part. I have also paid a lot more money on products while receiving much less results.</li>
    <li> Smells and looks like vanilla pudding yum, this stuff is strong best of all you only need a little and a little bit goes a long way, it deep conditions so well it&#x27;s like having beauty salon treatment without leaving home. This is especially great after dying or bleaching hair. It also detangled my hair which was an unexpected surprise. It definately restores dry to severely dried out hair. For some of us who&#x27;s hair spreads out like a wild bush when frizzy, or in my case the bride of Frankenstein this stuff is like a miracle, the one I given by a friend was in a packet I used some and still have most of it left</li>
    <li> This product gives my old, gray hair the shine &amp; body it needs!! I&#x27;ve been using it for several years.</li>
    <li> I had bought a little packet of this after highlighting my hair for a deep conditioning. My hair felt so good afterword, I decided to buy a whole bottle. This leaves my hair feeling so soft, and smelling wonderful. Even when I haven&#x27;t washed my hair for a whole week, it still feels great.</li>
    <li> I have natural thick hair and it works lovely! This softens my hair. My ends are slightly damaged because of coloring, but it provides wonderful softness and moisture until I can clip the ends. I love it!  The only conditioner I use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in England, Qatar, South Korea, Japan, UAE and so many more and it works consistently!  I used to have to find different products for the place I was station…after I used this I didn’t have to look any further!</li>
    <li> Picked this up after bleaching my hair completely white and then turning it grey. My hair felt gritty and this just absolutely did wonders. My hair is so smooth and soft in one use (not even half the packet). I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have used three different types of Ion hair care from Swimmers when living in FL and constantly in the water and bleaching my hair. The Cool Blonde because my hair is naturally dirty blonde along with bleaching every 6 weeks. Now for the past four months I have been using the Effective Care line. I shampoo and condition leaving the conditioner in for 3-5 minutes in a hair clip while I finish showering, I have even used Intensive Therapy once every two weeks. For the past two years I have stopped bleaching my hair but I dye it once every maybe six months, my hair became dry but I have never had split ends. I did my research from amazon to sally&#x27;s beauty supplies and you tube videos people seemed to love this. Since using it every other day for the past four months my hair has become even more dry and brittle along with major split ends. After washing and conditioning my hair is very tangled I even used an extra pump or two but that didn&#x27;t even work. I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s fine and long I mostly natural dry with the occasional flat iron, my hair just breaks off and falls out when brushing wet or dry. After many years of using the Ion Brand I am officially turning my back on it.</li>
    <li> Ion Efective Care Treatment is great for extremely damaged hair thats been over-processed, over bleached. If your hair is breaking so bad u are afraid to comb it, This is the product for you. I bought thousands of dollars worth of conditioners,masks,treatments. Ion Effective Care is one of the best at stopping hair breakage right away after the first use. It should be named, Ion Emergency Care Treatment. I use twice weekly on my fried, damaged hair. Now my hair is beautiful, shiny, strong and healthy. Almost no hair fall out when I comb it.</li>
