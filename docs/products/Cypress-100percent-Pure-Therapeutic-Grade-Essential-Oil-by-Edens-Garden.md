      <li>This is a good quality pure oil to be trusted.&lt;br /&gt;Letha</li>
      <li>I have been happy with all my purchases from Eden&#x27;s Garden so far.</li>
      <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly!  </li>
      <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
      <li>All I can say is fantastic</li>
      <li>Still to early to tell but my husband say it feels good on his calves.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Personally I think that it smells very nice ---</li>
      <li>Very nice concentrated essential oil.  </li>
      <li>Love it thank you so much!</li>
      <li>I also mix it with either lemon or lemon grass and sweet almond oil and put it on my spider veins</li>
      <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
      <li>Making my own cosmetics and lotions and this is essential to any firming lotion recipe.  </li>
      <li>very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It smells pure and powerful.</li>
      <li>I really like these oils!</li>
      <li>and I love this oil to blend with others for various things for the body.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell much like the actual cypress tree, its ok i guess.</li>
      <li>Very strong peppermint oil, not much else to say.</li>
      <li>Would not use straight or on its own in the diffuser as it is a little too piney for me.</li>
      <li>I assumed it was an whole ounce</li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>The label doesn&#x27;t state that it is therapeutic grade, which I much prefer.  </li>
      <li>It really works and did not smell offensive or like chemicals.</li>
      <li>Really works in cellulite mixture</li>
      <li>To avoid allergies, it is best to add no more than 5 drops of an essential oil to jojoba or another quality oil and apply externally.</li>
      <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m stlll rating it high.</li>
      <li>to early to tell if it is really working.</li>
      <li>while it isnt what i thought it would be like, it&#x27;s still nice, would be good to use when sick/stuffy and may make a sick time bath fizzy/tablet or a homemade &amp;#34;vaporub&amp;#34; to open up the head</li>
      <li>Cypress oil is very versatile and Edens Garden ships same day and sell high quality oils!</li>
      <li>and I really like the Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils.</li>

<li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>
<li> Product as expected.</li>
<li> I use it along with other oil for massaging the feet.</li>
<li> Usually cypress leaf and twig are used to make cypress bud tea - not an essential oil because oil and water do not mix.</li>
<li> Combines well with other essentials and alone.</li>
<li> I purchased this product to use in conjunction with other products to help relieve symptoms of endometriosis.</li>
<li> i was just slightly disapointed</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not able to use it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good  oil Got it to help breathing and to mix with others Not sure if it has helped or not.</li>
    <li> Love to put this in my cleaning water!</li>
    <li> Fast shiping , great product</li>
    <li> Love this product and I use it a lot. I especially like to mix this scent with other essential oils, such as lemon, lemongrass or grapefruit and put it in my humidifier. It seems to purify the air and is soothing. I also mix it with either lemon or lemon grass and sweet almond oil and put it on my spider veins and I have noticed they seems to be clearing up some. I don&#x27;t do this every day, but it does seem to be effective.</li>
    <li> Love the essential oils, great buy!</li>
    <li> Very nice concentrated essential oil.  I am pleased with the quality and the quantity.</li>
    <li> .i gave it 4 stars b/c i was just slightly disapointed it wasnt what i thought.Years ago i had bought Mainstays (walmart) brand candle in the &amp;#34;bergamot cypress&amp;#34; scent. i burn them sparingly b/c i am sooo in love with how it smells. i got this oil as well as the bergamot to try to recreate my love. while it isnt what i thought it would be like, it&#x27;s still nice, would be good to use when sick/stuffy and may make a sick time bath fizzy/tablet or a homemade &amp;#34;vaporub&amp;#34; to open up the head</li>
    <li> very reasonable price. good quality</li>
    <li> Making my own cosmetics and lotions and this is essential to any firming lotion recipe.  Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> This mixed with Lemongrass is shrinking the burs I have on the outside of my foot, and starting to shrink my bunions!</li>
    <li> just what I needed, worked great</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Has helped out her legs a lot.</li>
    <li> This oil is one I diffuse with various combos in my son&#x27;s room and he loves it. It&#x27;s more of a guy smell to him. Great cypress oil!</li>
    <li> Soothing, wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very strong peppermint oil, not much else to say.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Product as expected.</li>
    <li> just started will update</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Doterra oils but they were getting too expensive so I started trying Eden Gardens which has comparable product. I use Cypress for circulation and I feel as if this brand is more potent. I&#x27;m happy with the quality and price.</li>
    <li> I give this product a rating of excellent for quality. The bottle sealed when I received. The oil really smells great. It smells pure and powerful.</li>
    <li> Love it thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Love cypress. smells great!!!!Thanks</li>
    <li> Still to early to tell but my husband say it feels good on his calves. I bought it to help improve his circulation. He has stents in his legs but to early to tell if it is really working. Came quick and in great shape.</li>
    <li> Combines well with other essentials and alone. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This product did not do what it was suppose to do but it stunk so bad and the smell lingered long after it was applied. Will I purchase it again, NO.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit smokey for me, like mesquite</li>
    <li> Seems to be great quality to me. I have been happy with all my purchases from Eden&#x27;s Garden so far. It smells lovely.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful and clean.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use in a blend for cramps.  I really like it.  Eden&#x27;s garden has great, quality oils at an amazing price.</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil to use with a carrier oil to massage on ankles and up the leg for better circulation and to help with arthritis pain.</li>
    <li> i use this oil on my son almost daily as part of a therapeutic blend for bedwetting.  it works wonderfully!  will buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome in blends for skin. Would not use straight or on its own in the diffuser as it is a little too piney for me. Worked well on my skin!</li>
    <li> works for my conditions.  Will use in my diffuser as well</li>
    <li> does wonders for trauma</li>
    <li> Really works in cellulite mixture</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the oils. Everything is just what I wanted with this product and delivery.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use in conjunction with other products to help relieve symptoms of endometriosis. I used it as a bath and it did seem to offer some relief.</li>
    <li> All I can say is fantastic and I love this oil to blend with others for various things for the body.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful and added to other oil&#x27;s and a carrier oil it has made up a nice smelling blend for my husband.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly!  This oils are amazing!!!  Great product!!</li>
    <li> Cypress oil is very versatile and Edens Garden ships same day and sell high quality oils!</li>
    <li> Love Eden&#x27;s Garden products!</li>
    <li> It smells nice and I have used it a couple times. Nice packaging, well protected. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I have been happy with this company and with their products- this oil was effective for the intended uses.  Good!</li>
    <li> mix in bath with lemongrass GREAT for hangovers.</li>
    <li> I get most of my oils from Edens, they have all been awesome.</li>
    <li> I assumed it was an whole ounce but it a third of a one.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell much like the actual cypress tree, its ok i guess.</li>
    <li> Great Transaction, product of great quality, delivery was quick and experience was wonderful!</li>
    <li> Have purchased several essential oils from this seller.  Their product, speed of delivery and prices are very good.  I specifically like this brand over the others I have purchased, I feel the quality of the oils are the best.  I will keep ordering these wonderful oils.</li>
    <li> The best therapeutic oil at a great price.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a problem with wetting the bed at night and this is a good quality EO and it helps her keep it in control. Eden&#x27;s Garden is a great company as I have purchased most of my EO from them.</li>
    <li> Personally I think that it smells very nice --- I use it along with other oil for massaging the feet.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m allergic to the oil so I&#x27;m not able to use it.  It has a lovely smell so I&#x27;m stlll rating it high.</li>
    <li> Smells very clean and forestry.</li>
    <li> It has met my expectations.</li>
    <li> The label doesn&#x27;t state that it is therapeutic grade, which I much prefer.  The extraction process can modify the molecular structure and therapeutic benefit, so I was sorry to see the product was not certified or even labeled as therapeutic.</li>
    <li> I used the Cypress Oil as a natural insect repellent. It really works and did not smell offensive or like chemicals.</li>
    <li> I really like these oils! They are really good for the price. I use them for all kinds of aches and pains.</li>
    <li> This is a good oil. I use it for stress and strength. Good stuff here.</li>
    <li> Smells good, I love it and I really like the Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils.</li>
    <li> Cypress used medicinally is astringent - stops excess bleeding, reduces bruises, varicose veins, and hemorrhoids when added to a carrier oil and applied externally. Internally the tea (not this oil) is relaxing and calming, cools anger and stops excess menstrual bleeding. To avoid allergies, it is best to add no more than 5 drops of an essential oil to jojoba or another quality oil and apply externally. Usually cypress leaf and twig are used to make cypress bud tea - not an essential oil because oil and water do not mix. So use this sparingly and apply to help ease joint pains from poor circulation and sore legs. This is a good quality pure oil to be trusted.&lt;br /&gt;Letha Hadady&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
