      <li>more than inhaling so I cannot comment on how it works.</li>

      <li>Really satisfied with purchase.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.  </li>

      <li>Super fast delivery for a great price.</li>
      <li>Easy assemble and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Drawing from this thing is amazingly easy and produces lots of smoke.</li>
      <li>It would have been a beautiful item but after the second time</li>
      <li>The quality of the bowl is fine, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics:</li>
      <li>Looks and works great especially for the price, cant beat it!</li>
      <li>And it is great quality, especially for the price they&#x27;re selling it for.</li>
      <li>Really cheap quality I had to throw away after 1 use</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely smooth and never clogs.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m by no means a hookah connoisseur, but the parts are all very cheap and flimsy - feels like something you&#x27;d find at Walmart (made in China), the whole item just seems to lack in quality.  </li>
      <li>I was super excited to receive this hookah.</li>
      <li>The hookah came in a very timely manner and when it arrived it looked even better than on the web page.</li>
      <li>I contacted amazon for full refund.  </li>
      <li>The look is true to the picture</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cool came as it appears</li>
      <li>cause I love it that much.</li>
      <li>The rubber seals don&#x27;t seem to be very airtight and the pipe is made up of cheap pieces that fit together.</li>
      <li>Pay the #20 more and get a $50 hookah, particularly the &amp;#34;Never</li>
      <li>If you want a hookah of good quality that will last a long time just go to a hookah shop where you can actually examine the workmanship and pick one out that best suits you.</li>
      <li>it okay butthe hose have a plastic taste even after washing but over all it is very presentable and just priced right</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a super fun thing to have to sort of bring everyone together.</li>
      <li>Overall great purchase and is everything i expected it to be and more.</li>
      <li>Maybe a clear coat of paint or polish would have helped get a better review.</li>
      <li>nice, class is different</li>
      <li>The pieces are flimsy and cheap, pretty much plastic plated with chrome.</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend it to others :)</li>
      <li>It is a pretty item and was purchased for &amp;#34;décor&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>highly recommend neverxhale products!!</li>
      <li>however it doesn&#x27;t make for a very enjoyable experience; case and point are the hoses which had dried glue spilling over the edges and</li>
      <li>shipping was super fast and when I opened the box to see my new hookah</li>
      <li>the design tends to peel off &amp; the material is really rusty.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very well built and smokes well.  </li>
      <li>Shipped fast arrived on time and in one piece.</li>
      <li>nice hookah, i always get big smoke clouds out of it and its made solid and sturdy.</li>
      <li>I would suggest to put a little more water in it than you normally would in any other hookah and ice cubes are a nice touch.</li>
      <li>The hoses were super short</li>
      <li>Classic case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; with this piece.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend spending a little more and finding an alternative that is not made by this company.</li>
      <li>Since it has two hoses,  multiple people can use it at once with is a lot of fun.  </li>
      <li>WILL DEF UPDATE THIS AFTER THE NEW ONE ARRIVES</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m planning on buying new hoses.</li>
      <li>I just wish it came with instructions, especially since this was my first time ever using a hookah.</li>
      <li>First issue is that both hoses that came with the hookah have air leaks so it doesn&#x27;t smoke properly.  </li>
      <li>But when we dumped out the water when we were done and rinsed it out, we found that if any water drips down the outside of the glass, it washes off the blackish-gray coloring, leaving gray stains on anything it touches, mostly my hands and the counter.</li>
      <li>and all I can say is wow...</li>
      <li>Exhale 22&amp;#34; 2 Hose Hookah Shisha Complete Set with Carrying Case - Smoke Swirl</li>
      <li>This product is of disposable quality, definitely not meant for real use.</li>
      <li>I really like the idea of a two hose hookah with ball bearings on each side, but I just got this hookah today and have already had multiple problems.  </li>
      <li>and I had no trouble with the seller.</li>
      <li>but it seems old</li>
      <li>They had no trouble sending me the correct one after.</li>
      <li>I had to order this particular product twice because the first time they sent me a completely different hookah with missing parts.</li>
      <li>The base has a nice looking design till you get to the top and it looks like they got lazy and gave up.  </li>
      <li>The seller and shipment were fine, however the itself product is EXTREMELY poor quality.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be a quality hookah. But I def didn&#x27;t expext for it to be falling apart even before I used it. As soon as I got it a string that was wound around the hose broke and began unravelling, before we ever even used it.&lt;br /&gt;When we did use it it worked well. But when we dumped out the water when we were done and rinsed it out, we found that if any water drips down the outside of the glass, it washes off the blackish-gray coloring, leaving gray stains on anything it touches, mostly my hands and the counter. It was easy to wash off at least, but now I have a hookah w half the color of the base missing from water drips. Maybe a clear coat of paint or polish would have helped get a better review. The string thing I wouldn&#x27;t have mentioned otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: you get what you pay for. And if u like nice things, this might not be the hookah for you.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this it&#x27;s a piece of s***!!!! It&#x27;s cheap and flimsy ! Such a waste of money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way too difficult to pull from these hoses. Plus one hose practically fell apart with one use. Should have put the money to a legit Hookah set.</li>
    <li> I am a college student and I ordered this hooka to share with my friends. It has been an amazing hooka. The base is made of very solid glass with an intricate design on it the looks great. It&#x27;s very easy to keep clean and works perfectly. Since it has two hoses,  multiple people can use it at once with is a lot of fun.  It&#x27;s extremely smooth and never clogs.  I love using it with my friends all the time and I recommend it to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> it okay butthe hose have a plastic taste even after washing but over all it is very presentable and just priced right</li>
    <li> nice, class is different</li>
    <li> I bought this months ago! And it is great quality, especially for the price they&#x27;re selling it for. I just wish it came with instructions, especially since this was my first time ever using a hookah. YouTube helped me out though.</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of a two hose hookah with ball bearings on each side, but I just got this hookah today and have already had multiple problems.  First issue is that both hoses that came with the hookah have air leaks so it doesn&#x27;t smoke properly.  Also, the hookah stem itself has an air leak causing problems smoking.  It&#x27;s a cool hookah, but without being properly sealed it&#x27;s basically useless.</li>
    <li> Hoses fell apart within a week. Everything else is fair, but not the best quality.</li>
    <li> The hookah came in a very timely manner and when it arrived it looked even better than on the web page. It came with both hose that will get the job done and the vase it a nice weight and feels like it will hold up for years. The paint feels cheap but looks amazing and hasn&#x27;t scratched off yet. Drawing from this thing is amazingly easy and produces lots of smoke. I would suggest to put a little more water in it than you normally would in any other hookah and ice cubes are a nice touch. Overall great purchase and is everything i expected it to be and more.</li>
    <li> It works great! I had to order this particular product twice because the first time they sent me a completely different hookah with missing parts. They had no trouble sending me the correct one after. The only thing I will note is that when smoking out of this, there&#x27;s a bit of a rattle. I&#x27;m not sure if something was assembled incorrectly or what. Overall, I like it.</li>
    <li> Awesome hookah. Easy assemble and easy to use. Arrived on time. Also a nice decorative piece. Great for the price. Really satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.  It&#x27;s very well built and smokes well.  I have no complaints, definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> the design tends to peel off &amp; the material is really rusty. i dont know if it was just mine but it seems old</li>
    <li> Hookah itself is great but the hoses started to fall apart about a week after we got it.</li>
    <li> The seller and shipment were fine, however the itself product is EXTREMELY poor quality. The head appears to have been cracked glued back together (there is a hole where a piece of ceramic is missing on the side of the head and lines indicating such). The hose was very, very poor quality. The item did not meet my expectations, very hard to use due to poor craftsmanship. This product is of disposable quality, definitely not meant for real use. It is very difficult to pull smoke. I would highly recommend spending a little more and finding an alternative that is not made by this company.</li>
    <li> Me and my boyfriend just began using hookahs and we have decided to purchase one for ourselves and couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better! This hookah looks so great and in the perfect condition! We are always receiving compliments, it is a must have!</li>
    <li> Classic case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; with this piece.  I&#x27;m by no means a hookah connoisseur, but the parts are all very cheap and flimsy - feels like something you&#x27;d find at Walmart (made in China), the whole item just seems to lack in quality.  Function wise it does work however it doesn&#x27;t make for a very enjoyable experience; case and point are the hoses which had dried glue spilling over the edges and the ends leave a metallic taste in your mouth (and when I bought plastic tips they didn&#x27;t even fit onto the ends of the hoses due to the weird size mouthpiece).  The rubber seals don&#x27;t seem to be very airtight and the pipe is made up of cheap pieces that fit together.</li>
    <li> No need to read the nonexistent directions.  Shipped fast arrived on time and in one piece. I like that you can have one or two pipes.</li>
    <li> shipping was super fast and when I opened the box to see my new hookah I was extremely happy :)  took 3 seconds to put together.&lt;br /&gt;fired it up and all I can say is wow...very smooth...highly recommend neverxhale products!! thanx guyz!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect hookah for beginners, seeing as it is a very inexpensive alternative compared to others, YET it&#x27;s still very good quality. My roommate and I bought this for our dorm room in college as a sort of get together thing for us and our friends, the sizing is perfect for being stored in a cabinet. It&#x27;s not too big and not too small. It&#x27;s a super fun thing to have to sort of bring everyone together. The designs on the bottom are beyond perfect and everything came in one piece. It shipped promptly and I had no trouble with the seller. The look is true to the picture and like I said before the price simply can&#x27;t be beat! I will definitely be buying from NeverXhale again!</li>
    <li> Packaging and everything was ok, as well as delivery. Problem #1, it says it brings 2 hoses and it only brought 1!! False advertisement much. Problem #2, the base is so cheaply made such bad quality that the bottom of the vase and does not even sit steady/flat on the table (or whatever your putting it on). It feels like its always going to tip over and with a Hookah you cannot have that!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont get this! Pay the #20 more and get a $50 hookah, particularly the &amp;#34;Never Exhale 22&amp;#34; 2 Hose Hookah Shisha Complete Set with Carrying Case - Smoke Swirl Glass Vase - Choose Your Haze&amp;#34; one. Its $50 and its awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived broken...twice.  It would have been a beautiful item but after the second time</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because of the reviews it got but when I first used this item I was very disappointed. The hoses did not even stay in the valve. I had called the company and the lady said it was supposed to be that way.. I actually had to tape the hoses to the valve in order to get ANY smoke. Although when the hoses were taped on it, it produced a great amount of smoke. I&#x27;m planning on buying new hoses.</li>
    <li> Initially bought it as a present for a friend but ended up keeping it for myself cause I love it that much. Super fast delivery for a great price. Would definitely recommend it to others :)</li>
    <li> I was super excited to receive this hookah. It had awesome review&#x27;s which is always a plus for any buyer. Unfortunately my hookah arrived with a broken base. I contacted amazon for full refund.  Albeit I definitely intend on buying this hookah again. Besides the broken base the actual hookah was beautiful!!!!!!!! Just wish the seller would have doubled wrapped it. One thin layer of wrap vs NYC mail carriers means the hookah had no chance of arriveing in ONE piece. WILL DEF UPDATE THIS AFTER THE NEW ONE ARRIVES AND I CAN ACTUALLY USE IT.</li>
    <li> Overall, it is a god hookah that works well. An issue that I had with it is that it doesn&#x27;t include everything. It&#x27;s advertised as coming with tongs to handle the coal, it&#x27;s even on the box that it comes in, yet there was never any tongs. I also expected rubber stoppers in case I only want to use one hose. Most multi-hose hookahs come with these, but this did not.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Looks great.</li>
    <li> It came with both hoses, but unfortunately one of them is clogged some how and will not pull any air through. I am unable to fix it, so I had to deal with just using one hose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base does look nice. Unfortunately, the neck piece doesn&#x27;t seem to screw together correctly again once you&#x27;ve taken it apart. Getting the tray piece to fit onto it should not be as challenging as it is. The quality of the bowl is fine, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics: 3/5&lt;br /&gt;Base: 3/5&lt;br /&gt;Neck piece: 2/5&lt;br /&gt;Hoses: 1/5&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 2/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Great hookah for the most part but mine didn&#x27;t come with an ash tray, not worth returning, but an inconvenience none the less.</li>
    <li> nice hookah, i always get big smoke clouds out of it and its made solid and sturdy. very easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> Looks and works great especially for the price, cant beat it! if you are looking for one, Id recommend this.</li>
    <li> When I bought it i was expecting the base to be destroyed, but it wasn&#x27;t. The only problem was the neck, it was way longer than it needed to be. But i Ground it down to size so it fits. let me tell you 18&amp;#34; is huge!</li>
    <li> The hookah worked great and the customer service was super helpful.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. The pieces are flimsy and cheap, pretty much plastic plated with chrome. The base has a nice looking design till you get to the top and it looks like they got lazy and gave up.  The hoses were super short I didn&#x27;t realize that when I looked at the description. If you want a hookah of good quality that will last a long time just go to a hookah shop where you can actually examine the workmanship and pick one out that best suits you.</li>
    <li> Really cheap quality I had to throw away after 1 use</li>
    <li> Terribly made, Cheap materials used to build this</li>
    <li> One star is missing because it did not come with a sample packet of mara-hoochie. It is a pretty item and was purchased for &amp;#34;décor&amp;#34; more than inhaling so I cannot comment on how it works.</li>
    <li> not a good hookah at all cant even use it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cool came as it appears</li>
</ol>
