<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This  product was exactly what I wanted and was expecting. Only problem is I am going through it quickly and will have to order more soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently using this product at least twice a day on my belly and breasts to prevent stretch marks.  I&#x27;ve done some research and got some information from a local herb store that recommended using Emu Oil to prevent them.  So far so good!  I&#x27;m 33 weeks and no stretch marks, I&#x27;ll keep you updated if anything changes.  I&#x27;ve started using it on my face as well.  I have dry skin and live in Alaska where it&#x27;s very dry.  My husband used it the other day on his razor burn and was so surprised at how well it worked to relieve his discomfort (one time application).  This brand also seems very good quality.  Based on what I&#x27;ve read, Emu Oil should be colorless and odorless.  The first kind I used, which was purchased at the local herb store was twenty-two dollars for 4 oz, thin consistency, yellowish and had a smell to it.  Well I went through that in no time but I didn&#x27;t care because if at the end of this pregnancy if I spend a couple hundred to prevent strecth marks and it actually works... Oh well!  So I was thrilled to get it here for the price!  I am using it quite a bit, I apply it very generously.  So I will be buying more here probably in the next week.&lt;br /&gt;Other facts I&#x27;ve read... It the most penetratable oil to the skin, has omegas 3, 6 &amp; 9.  There is a vague amount of Vit. E in this product which is supposed to help its sustainability and it also helps the Emu Oil penetrate the skin deeper and better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m open-minded to it&#x27;s pain relieving benefits but have had none to use it with thus far.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product and this brand.  I&#x27;m still experimenting with it but have yet to be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Almost 36 weeks and so far so good on stretch marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Well folks!  I got the darn scratch marks. It is now just over three months since I gave birth and the stretch marks showed up a week to 10 days before I went into labor which was right at 42 weeks.  I didn&#x27;t get a lot or get them every where, just at the center of my stomach and they are already slowly fading.  Doesn&#x27;t change my opinion of this product, still five stars!of my stomach and they are already slowly fading.  Doesn&#x27;t change my opinion of this product, still five stars!</li>
    <li> I tend to think that folks may be unsure/misimformed a about Emu oil. I almost totally cleared up my dogs \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot; and even helped me with my dry facial skin......................GOOD STUF, I&#x27;m so glad ai found it!!! ~:o) Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great for the skin...recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this, but it really does work.  When ever my knees start bothering me I just rub this on for 3-5 days and the pain disappears.  So, yes this product does work!</li>
    <li> As a lifelong unbeliever in \\&quot;miracle cures\\&quot; I was reluctant to spend a lot of money on a small amount of oil. Reading all the reviews on emu oil convinced me to give it a try. I got the pint size and made several batches of lotion (home hobby), started using it on my pain areas (feet and neck) and within two days I felt a noticable reduction in the cronic pain I&#x27;ve had for years. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and although it is not a \\&quot;miracle cure\\&quot; the constant pain has been significently reduced and I even have pain free periods that I haven&#x27;t experienced for years. My wife is using it on her back pain and has experienced similar, but not as much relief. So the results vary depending on the medical cause of the pain. I am a believer in emu oil and as long it works we will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I practically use it for anything on my skin and hair and it works. My hair dresser recommended this product for my damaged non-growing edges. I saw results in a few weeks. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I always sound like a walking commercial for this stuff- I use it in my hair, to make it sleek and shiny and control frizz, I use it on my face to reduce acne, I use it on cuts in place of neosporin, I use it on my body instead of lotion, I use it on a sunburn to take away the sting...I LOVE this stuff.  I always keep a small bottle on me to give to friends, and I&#x27;ve yet to pass some along and not get the other person hooked.</li>
    <li> Use this for everything.  Just look it up on google for all the uses.  You&#x27;ll be amazed.  Be sure and get this brand, though to make sure it is pure Emu Oil!!!  I put this on cold sores and canker sores.  I put it on sore gums and even on bruises and cuts. I don&#x27;t want Emu Oil that may have contaminates in it and a lot of the others do.</li>
    <li> Very good product. We use it for everyday moisturizing, on sunburns... and may more uses. I would recommend this product. Great price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on the boys (2 black labs) for about 2 weeks now and there is a remarkable improvement in their achy joints, dry skin, and hair loss.  One had gotten to a point where he could not longer jump up on the bed...now he is able to once again curl up with his brother on the bed for their afternoon nap.  He jumps up and down from the bed with ease.  Also, they both get seasonal allergies which leaves them with flaking skin and hair loss- pretty bad this year.  No longer an issue as the flakes are pretty much gone while the hair is regrowing.  AND... their elbow calluses are almost completely gone- the skin is very supple and is almost completely covered with hair.  I find that massaging them with the emu oil every 2-3 days is working wonders.  I also use it on my dry skin with equally impressive results.  I only wish I had found this stuff earlier in our lives!</li>
    <li> I bought this along with [[ASIN:B000BNRKPY Heritage Store Castor Oil, 32 Ounce]] and like them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use the Castor for my hair more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil does fine as a moisturizer but it is too thick sometimes. And the thickness settles to the bottom because it is uneven and not homogenous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have to shake it up really hard or mix it with a stick before apply for optimal result.</li>
    <li> I use this oil in my hair.  My hair has grown 4 inches in about 8 months.  I love it because it&#x27;s growing my hair after a couple years of my hair not growing at all. I will keep using this product on my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Prompt service.  Good price.  Excellent product.  The consistency is good.  The labeling is forthright.  Product is 99.9998 percent emu oil and .00022 percent vitamin e.  I recommend buying this size or larger for the savings if it can be stored properly.</li>
    <li> Great Price Great Product Great Service !!! What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a sugggestion when my mom was diagnosed with throat cancer and neede to undergo radiation. A friend of the family suggested this after her friend had \\&quot;tried everything\\&quot; out there and nothing worked to keep the skin intact from radiation burn/pain/redness, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom applied this a few hours before radiation always -- and possibly used here and there inbetween. She had 35 radiation treaments of the neck/head/mouth... monday through friday for 7 weeks. One day -- ONE DAY -- she did not use this before radiation, and the difference was immediately noticed. Her skin was red and more \\&quot;burned\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The radiation techs and dr.s had never seen a person&#x27;s skin look SO GOOD (almost completely normal in appearance) after all of those radiations as hers. They had not even heard of this product and were suggesting and giving out samples of eucerin, aquaphor, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an oil - so you need only a small amount - she used about 1/4 to 1/3 of the container over all of that time, and I gave out the rest to some of my patients at my pharmacy who were newely diagnosed with cancer and headed to radiation for head/neck treatment. This should be reviewed with your dr if you are going to use this, and some dr&#x27;s are skeptical... but that&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t want to put on an oil directly before the radiation due to increased chance of burn enhancement. The oil should be fully fully soaked in way before the treatment. This may save you or a loved one from so much discomfort along with the appearance of the radiation treatment burns.</li>
    <li> The first bottle he had seemed to alleviate his itching.  The second bottle does not stop his itching like he expected.</li>
    <li> The label is misleading. This product contains a mixture of both vitamin E oil and emu oil. This product is not 100% pure emu oil. The product works well. I&#x27;m interested in knowing what the percentage of emu oil &amp; Vitamin E oil is in this product.</li>
