### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best combination of lotion components I could look for.</li>
      <li>They were very happy.</li>
      <li>now THAT stuff worked perfectly</li>
      <li>This is a great lotion and it smells wonderful</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s nice lotion, it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve ever had--</li>
      <li>Very nice mint smell and consistency</li>
      <li>It smells so good and is great for your skin.  </li>
      <li>So when I find a pleasantly scented product that does not trigger allergies, it gets four stars out of the gate.</li>
      <li>But it is a good lotion, would recommend.</li>
      <li>May work good on drying up a skin problem?</li>
      <li>It was a good value for size and price.</li>
      <li>but all together its a good product</li>
      <li>Very refreshing not greasy</li>
      <li>Love the smell!</li>
      <li>Love the scent!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this body lotion!</li>
      <li>This product smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Guess I&#x27;m a butter kind of girl.</li>
      <li>Nice peppermint smell</li>
      <li>This is a refreshing and good quality lotion.</li>
      <li>I like the lotion, it has a nice smell and goes on well.</li>
      <li>Not as moisturizing as I need during the warm weather months when I have more sun exposure.  </li>
      <li>Great on dry skin, great on aching legs and body.</li>
      <li>I wish it had more of a cooling feeling and a more peppermint smell.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of Peppermint.  </li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I really love this body lotion.  </li>
      <li>Lovely scent.</li>
      <li>Love this lotion.</li>
      <li>Great lotion, not thick or sticky.</li>
      <li>It has more of a strong tea tree oil smell.</li>
      <li>I love the mint smell of this lotion, it goes on smoothly and it is comforting to wear all day.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of the tea tree peppermint shampoo and conditioner by OGX and was excited to find that they also made a lotion.</li>
      <li>It turned out to be a really lucky pick!</li>
      <li>and I enjoy using, it gets five.</li>
      <li>This is a very light lotion, so if you&#x27;re looking for something that doesn&#x27;t get absorbed quickly, look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>silky texture and great for winter dry skin plus the peppermint smell!</li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>Will most definitely purchase again!</li>
      <li>She loves it too evidently.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of lotions, but this is my favorite one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>The mint scent is super light, just enough to tell you it&#x27;s there, but not at all overpowering.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion so much, that when our local stores stopped caring it I found it on Amazon and ordered 5 bottles.</li>
      <li>The lotion is great for dry skin and has helped relieve some of the very dry patches that I have.</li>
      <li>I thought it would smell more like the shampoo &amp; conditioner, but it&#x27;s not very minty.</li>
      <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this one because it was actually just the second-cheapest mint scented one I could find on amazon with free shipping.</li>
      <li>Of course, there is no standard of any kind as to what those ingredients actually are.</li>
      <li>The peppermint is a clean subtle scent and best of all is the shimmer it leaves behind.</li>
      <li>Most of the ones I&#x27;ve used previously are way to heavy/greasy, and personally I don&#x27;t like the way some of the scents can be very overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and it has reduced the redness I often have.</li>
      <li>It could be natural oils, it could be Di-ethyl phthalate.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it isn&#x27;t natural.</li>
      <li>With frequent use it seemed to be somewhat drying.</li>
      <li>It could be a bit more thick when applying.</li>
      <li>And i love how subtle the peppermint scent is.</li>
      <li>I bought it at a local store on clearance and was disappointed to find it is the best lotion I have ever used since the store discontinued carrying it.</li>
      <li>This leaves a soft scent that last for hours.  </li>
      <li>As much as I like the other product I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again.  </li>
      <li>Its strong when you initially put it on but is subtle in 5 minutes.</li>

<li> Typically anything that lists &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; as in ingredient is basically going to cause me to break out in welts and stumble or the inhaler.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m surprised that this product contains mineral oil.&lt;br /&gt;Mineral oil is not good for the skin because it clogs pores, and</li>
<li> , I have always preferred pumps so that I dont have to shake it down every time to squeeze it out.</li>
<li> Slightly itchy.</li>
<li> got some really painful dry elbows when winter started last year, and I needed some lotion because I didn&#x27;t care for some others we had around the house.</li>
<li> The lotion is creamy and silky, but you can barely smell the scent, which is disappointing.</li>
<li> Very thick so you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
<li> My face either breaks out or dries out really bad when i use lotions</li>
<li> I was disappointed.</li>

    <li> Cooled my skin and made me feel tingly. Also made my very dry working hands feel some relief. Will most definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> no no no  didn&#x27;t like it at all...didn&#x27;t sooth at all...finally ended up buying Village Naturals Therepy muscle relief lotion. now THAT stuff worked perfectly</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Peppermint.  This leaves a soft scent that last for hours.  The lotion is great for dry skin and has helped relieve some of the very dry patches that I have.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Very refreshing not greasy</li>
    <li> I love the scent of the tea tree peppermint shampoo and conditioner by OGX and was excited to find that they also made a lotion. The lotion is creamy and silky, but you can barely smell the scent, which is disappointing.</li>
    <li> Nice peppermint smell, it&#x27;s nice lotion, it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve ever had--so that&#x27;s why 4 stars instead of 5.  I think the scent is relaxing but if you don&#x27;t like scent or peppermint, don&#x27;t get this one!  It was a good value for size and price.</li>
    <li> Love this. My face either breaks out or dries out really bad when i use lotions and this doesnt do either. And i love how subtle the peppermint scent is. Its strong when you initially put it on but is subtle in 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> I received lotion instead of body wash</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised that this product contains mineral oil.&lt;br /&gt;Mineral oil is not good for the skin because it clogs pores, and&lt;br /&gt;it isn&#x27;t natural.</li>
    <li> I love the mint smell of this lotion, it goes on smoothly and it is comforting to wear all day.</li>
    <li> Very nice mint smell and consistency</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this body lotion! I bought it at a local store on clearance and was disappointed to find it is the best lotion I have ever used since the store discontinued carrying it. Amazon.com to the rescue! It moisturizes without leaving my skin feeling greasy. I have sensitive skin and it has reduced the redness I often have. The peppermint is a clean subtle scent and best of all is the shimmer it leaves behind.</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing. It could be a bit more thick when applying. It has sheer in it as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion and it smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Christmas present for someone else.  They were very happy.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. I&#x27;m not a big fan of lotions, but this is my favorite one I&#x27;ve ever used. Most of the ones I&#x27;ve used previously are way to heavy/greasy, and personally I don&#x27;t like the way some of the scents can be very overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got some really painful dry elbows when winter started last year, and I needed some lotion because I didn&#x27;t care for some others we had around the house.

    <li> Love the scent! With frequent use it seemed to be somewhat drying. Slightly itchy. May work good on drying up a skin problem?</li>
    <li> Great lotion, not thick or sticky. I would prefer if it came in a bottle with a pump though, I have always preferred pumps so that I dont have to shake it down every time to squeeze it out. But it is a good lotion, would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very thick so you don&#x27;t need a lot. Soaks in well. Lovely scent.</li>
    <li> I really love this body lotion.  It smells so good and is great for your skin.  Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I like the lotion, it has a nice smell and goes on well. I wish it had more of a cooling feeling and a more peppermint smell. but all together its a good product and I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Watch out it has glitter in it!</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Not as moisturizing as I need during the warm weather months when I have more sun exposure.  As much as I like the other product I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again.  Guess I&#x27;m a butter kind of girl.</li>

    <li> I love this lotion. Great on dry skin, great on aching legs and body. I love this lotion so much, that when our local stores stopped caring it I found it on Amazon and ordered 5 bottles.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. I thought it would smell more like the shampoo &amp; conditioner, but it&#x27;s not very minty. It has more of a strong tea tree oil smell.</li>
    <li> This is a refreshing and good quality lotion. I have purchased three bottles because my sister took one of mine. She loves it too evidently.</li>
    <li> I have fragrance allergies, and anything scented is hit or miss for me. Typically anything that lists &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; as in ingredient is basically going to cause me to break out in welts and stumble or the inhaler. Of course, there is no standard of any kind as to what those ingredients actually are. It could be natural oils, it could be Di-ethyl phthalate. So when I find a pleasantly scented product that does not trigger allergies, it gets four stars out of the gate. When I find one that works well and I enjoy using, it gets five.</li>
