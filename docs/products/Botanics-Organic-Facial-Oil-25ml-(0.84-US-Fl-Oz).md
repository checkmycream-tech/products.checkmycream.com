      <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recently discovered that my skin is much more sensitive than I thought, so I&#x27;m really trying to avoid processed products with lots of chemicals.</li>
      <li>I really like this one</li>
      <li>Hence trying the Coconut oil, for example-- very nourishing, but it never seemed to really seep into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft - and looked consistently &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; in like....forever???  </li>
      <li>, Boots!)-- anyway, tested a small drop, and was in love at first touch.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for a few days but love it so far!</li>
      <li>This is way better than other more expensive brands I have tried (Caudalie, Tarte).</li>
      <li>I have used other brands of facial oil and they don&#x27;t sink in as quickly as this one does.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The oil absorbed quickly, instantly, had an absolutely divine floral smell, and did not make my skin feel greasy in the least.</li>
      <li>not a single thing</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this for quite a while now. It absorbs easily and does not make me sweat like heavier creams. It keeps my face soft and smooth. I have recommended this to quite a few of my friends.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t find another facial oil with organic ingredients. It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;m 40 and this is essential for me especially during the winter. I have used other brands of facial oil and they don&#x27;t sink in as quickly as this one does. I have combination skin.</li>
    <li> I have extreme dry skin so I love this product. I do not feel greasy after using it. The oil seems to soak in very quickly and it makes my face very soft.</li>
    <li> I love all Boots products. This is excellent and much less expensive than the &amp;#34;other brands&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My favorite facial oil. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, absorbs well. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of facial oils, and regular oils and this has given me the best result for the best price. My skin has been SO much better since I stopped using regular moisturizers. It is about half the price at Target though.</li>
    <li> I am over the moon about this oil. I tested a small drop on my hand at Target (by the way, I can&#x27;t believe Boots is at Target-- this feels like a line more suited to Sephora or Nordstrom! Please don&#x27;t ever stop selling your Organic line, Boots!)-- anyway, tested a small drop, and was in love at first touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil absorbed quickly, instantly, had an absolutely divine floral smell, and did not make my skin feel greasy in the least. Just extremely hydrated and nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extreme combination skin, only exacerbated by the very dry and cold climate I live in. I&#x27;ve tried higher end products (Trish McAvoy, Clinique) and natural oils as well (Coconut oil, sesame oil, etc) for the face in different capacities-- and this is probably my favorite winter soother so far. I&#x27;ve recently discovered that my skin is much more sensitive than I thought, so I&#x27;m really trying to avoid processed products with lots of chemicals. Hence trying the Coconut oil, for example-- very nourishing, but it never seemed to really seep into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little cocktail of a facial oil definitely does. I use it for a variety of things-- after a face wax, to calm a dry spot, or just to give myself a little treat before I go to sleep, smelling lovely. You will definitely be impressed with the quality of this oil, especially at this price. Boots, don&#x27;t ever sell out to Sephora!</li>
    <li> Love the way this has made my skin glow after using for the last 2 weeks!  My skin was feeling sooo dry and I&#x27;ve been using this every morning and at night.  Im glad to say that it has proven to be useful on very dry skin!</li>
    <li> I have just been getting into facial oils, I have oily skin but strangely you still have to keep your skin hydrated so it doesn&#x27;t over produce oil and causes blemishes. I always  clean my face and then do a face mask before using any oils, and I do this before bed, I haven&#x27;t done any during the day. I really like this one, it smells good, it doesn&#x27;t add a weird color to my face or drip off, it is a good oil and really helps to hydrate my skin and it looks good in the morning. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Overpriced!! When I ordered it the size in ounces was incorrect so I paid double what it is sold for at my local target !! Won&#x27;t be reordering!! But I do love the product!!</li>
    <li> Great price point and the stuff is amazing for fight winter dryness.</li>
    <li> Best facial oil I have tried!!! The price is unmatchable for the quality and size bottle. I will definitely be continuing to use this product. My skin is super dry as I live in the desert, and this works great. This is way better than other more expensive brands I have tried (Caudalie, Tarte). HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> I  had been using argan oil (which costs $48.00 for the same size) when I heard about this product.  It is amazing and I will never again pay for the pricey stuff again!</li>
    <li> Where do I begin?  ALL - absolutely ALL of the skincare products in this line are amazing......  My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft - and looked consistently &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; in like....forever???  I&#x27;ve done the full circle from the finest European French lines - to the Finest in Asia...and there&#x27;s no comparison for me.  It didn&#x27;t take months, weeks or days.... it took only 30 minutes to visually notice and physically feel the transformation.  I hope they keep the formulas and keep the business model and plan - raise the price - but keep the quality the same.... don&#x27;t change one thing... not a single thing</li>
    <li> I am not sure about this face oil at this time....</li>
    <li> My skin is so dry &amp; flaky in the winter, I saw results after a few uses!  I will never be without this fabulous oil again!!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and when fall and winter hit, my skin gets so dry. So I was searching for something stronger than my moisturizing cream and that wouldn&#x27;t clog pores, or make me feel greasy. I saw this oil at Target for $8.99 and decided to just go for it. I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for a few days but love it so far! My pores have shrunk, my skin is soft, and I just really love it. You only need to use a small amount and the bottle will last a long time! I am able to wear this underneath my makeup. The only draw back is the smell reminds me of a lemon/acidic smell. Its not too overpowering, but not the most attractive. Either way, I would certainly recommend this product to anyone!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item based on the reviews from here.  Got it at Target for alot less than Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately my skin did not absorb this product at all, so my experience was not positive. Extra virgin coconut oil is better and more cost effective,  in my humble opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note,  it has very little smell, which i find great.</li>
    <li> With my hormones out of whack due to pregnancy, my skin texture is also off and I have to be extremely careful of what product I put on my face.  Otherwise, it will become so blotchy and red.  Even the moisterizer that I have always used bothers me. I came across the Botanics&#x27;s Face Oil and I love how it works.  My face is slowly regaining the glow and nonetheless, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  I think it will be great for winter time to add extra moister to the skin.</li>
    <li> I have never had such smooth skin and the mild fragrance blends easily with other perfumes. I am buying a bunch of them for my friends.</li>
    <li> I love this facial oil it makes my skin feel very soft but when I  bought it  3 or 4 months it was  $8.99 a bottle and now it is $19.00 for the same size bottle.  What changed?</li>
    <li> I love the L&#x27;Oreal face oil but just thought I&#x27;d try something else for a change.  I used this oil twice and hated the smell both times.  I went back to L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from dry skin like I do, mix One or 2 drops of this oil in your moisturizer.  Wonderful for that dry winter skin!</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the price. There are so many facial oils to choose from and I have compared this favorable with a high end product I have used.</li>
