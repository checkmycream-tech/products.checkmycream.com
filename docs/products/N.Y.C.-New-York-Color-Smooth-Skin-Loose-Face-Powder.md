      <li>but I believe with most loose powders</li>
      <li>I dont really like the sponge that comes with it</li>

    <li> Im a dark skin jamaican girl and im like caramel slightly Hershey and I took a chance with using this and after my concealer and foundation I use this to set everything before my setting spray and its not ashy at all doesnt make my face all caked up.

And its soo light weight on your face, and again does not look ashy it got on my clothes and sheet but I just brush it off with my hands, and there everything was fine so im not an expert but I believe with most loose powders u might get a little mess. Just use with caution people dont bad mouth the product because your not careful. Anyway its amazing, especially for my darker skin.</li>
