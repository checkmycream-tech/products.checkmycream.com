      <li>If you like a strong mouthwash this is the one for you.</li>
      <li>Most of its ingredients are pretty good and simple, so I feel good about that (no alcohol base!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this natural mouthwash, best one so far.</li>
      <li>Was bummed when Tom&#x27;s of Maine was bought by Colgate and was pleased to find another true cruelty free product in Jason.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mild, yet refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Been using for a couple of months now,  my gums are much healthier now,  Dentist isn&#x27;t complaining as much, if at all,  lol</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fluoride free , woo hoo.</li>
      <li>Love this gives fresh breath no irritation no residue will buy again</li>
      <li>Love the cinnamon taste and keeps my breathe fresh all day.</li>
      <li>Some people may enjoy the clove flavor, but it&#x27;s not flavor</li>
      <li>Just staying flouride free.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so important to use products that don&#x27;t have antibiotics in them.  </li>
      <li>this really works well and tastes great too, I highly recommend</li>
      <li>The first one was mint and was ok, but I had to get used to the flavor.  </li>
      <li>, bottom line: this mouthwash is better than many I have tried, it does have ALMOST all natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>, bottom line: this mouthwash is better than many I have tried, it does have ALMOST all natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more &#x27;natural&#x27; than many of its competitors, it contains peppermint oil, cinnamon, blah, blah.  </li>
      <li>finally a great mouthwash minus any harmful chemical additives, flavorings, etc...</li>
      <li>(It would be nice if companies were required to provide a complete list of ingredients in their listing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aqua, glycerin, polysorbate 20, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, camellia sinensis leaf extract, citrus grandis (grapefruit) seed extract, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel</li>
      <li>I normally love Jason products but this did absolutely nothing for my breath.</li>
      <li>Thanks for such a great product.</li>
      <li>Very refreshing and makes your teeth white.  </li>
      <li>As long it is a good price, I recommend it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting or leave my mouth dry, and it tastes good.</li>
      <li>My husband, who likes a strong minty flavor, didn&#x27;t care for this, even though it works really well.</li>
      <li>JASON is the natural alternative to Listerine (which I love, but don&#x27;t use anymore</li>
      <li>mouth really feels clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not going to blast your mouth like one of those huge commercial brands, but it is a nice, gentle, natural product.</li>
      <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>Plus, as an added bonus, no nasty OJ taste that happens after regular brushing and mouthwashes.  </li>
      <li>My favorite mouthwash after Tom&#x27;s of Maine went all corporate on us and screwed up by deleting Cinnamint from their lineup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gave me major acid reflux; the flavor was just way too strong.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried this particular flavor, but I&#x27;ve used some of their other mouthwashes and loved them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Jason products, this always left me feeling good without the overly mediciny or alcohol-based feeling other mouthwashes did.</li>
      <li>Nice Cinnamon flavor, and had some sweetness to it due to having Xylitol in it.  </li>
      <li>Too much for me.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that the ingredient list is so short and natural.</li>
      <li>but it most certainly is not.</li>
      <li>This Jason Brand seems to be pretty natural</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to having the refreshing zest of cinnamon in my mouth but am left with only the sliiiiiiiiiiiiightest hint of it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the Tom&#x27;s of Main mouthwash until they changed their formula recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is also too expensive for the size of bottle, and I use it up much too quickly to be cost effective.</li>
      <li>(Dig a little deeper, and you will find that many of the carcinogens that are rampant in our cosmetic and beauty products have been banned in other countries, but are just fine for us!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
      <li>it has clove and cinnamon which really seem to be naturally antibacterial.  </li>
      <li>I also use Power Smile toothpaste or Crest 3D White along with this.</li>
      <li>SLS, saccharine, or pretty much anything I can&#x27;t pronounce is a big NO.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s sort of like the strange aftertaste of the peppermint oil.</li>
      <li>The flavor is okay, but I just wanted plain Cinnamon to compliment my cinnamon toothpaste.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Feels good after each use , so fresh, so clean !&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride free , woo hoo.</li>
    <li> My husband thought it tasted like soap.  It does leave a weird aftertaste in your mouth.  My kids love it and they can all use it.  Much better than the mouthwashes for children in the store.</li>
    <li> This product is all natural so I feel very safe having my family use it.  The taste is amazing.  Unlike other natural dental products, Jason products really work.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s been a while since i bought this. i&#x27;m glad i got it again. not too strong and it has a great taste.</li>
    <li> Best ever.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> they work like they should! I would recommend this to anyone! check them out now I am just looking for words.</li>
    <li> I have severe allergies and something called geographic tongue.  I can&#x27;t have anything for oral hygiene with SLS and I prefer to not have any artificial ingredients. SLS, saccharine, or pretty much anything I can&#x27;t pronounce is a big NO.  Since switching to the Jason line, my reactions have been almost non-existent.  It&#x27;s mild, yet refreshing.  It&#x27;s a nice addition to the toothpaste line.  It&#x27;s not going to blast your mouth like one of those huge commercial brands, but it is a nice, gentle, natural product. Plus, as an added bonus, no nasty OJ taste that happens after regular brushing and mouthwashes.  Love the Jason line.</li>
    <li> I love that I am not rising my out with alcohol. Great cleansing action.</li>
    <li> Not strong if you&#x27;re used to listerine. But Light lingering flavor isn&#x27;t bad at all,  gently freshens breath!</li>
    <li> I like the Cinnamon Powermint Mouthwash. I put it in a smaller container and carry it in the car, in my purse and the big bottle stays home.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again.  As long it is a good price, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and makes your teeth white.  I also use Power Smile toothpaste or Crest 3D White along with this. I really love this product.</li>
    <li> Was bummed when Tom&#x27;s of Maine was bought by Colgate and was pleased to find another true cruelty free product in Jason.  Love the cinnamon taste and keeps my breathe fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Jason products, this always left me feeling good without the overly mediciny or alcohol-based feeling other mouthwashes did.</li>
    <li> This works really well and gives great smelling breath. I also feel like it gives a dose of energy from mint oils in it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this mouthwash. Cinnamon flavor, natural ingredients. But it&#x27;s like washing your mouth out with soap. I tried it twice and ended up dumping it down the drain.</li>
    <li> How is it that this has been around as long as my father and I never knew about it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it on a whim because a friend was discussing how non-mint toothpastes and mouthwash don&#x27;t mess up your sense of taste when you consume something after using it (think orange juice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is fantastic, and no one has mentioned bad breath yet!  Now to finish off my Scope so I can replace this in the cars too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been transitioning to sulphate/paraben free toothpaste and mouthwash because I was getting canker sores and felt I might be sensitive to the sulphates (gone over it with my doctor, there is no true answer for why people get canker sores -it&#x27;s either stress, low immunity, or sensitivity to acidy foods/chemicals). I like the taste of this - it&#x27;s not overwhelming or fake tasting. However, it does sometimes have a bitter aftertaste. Some say it&#x27;s a bile like aftertaste which might be right, but it&#x27;s not quite as gross as that thought. It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s sort of like the strange aftertaste of the peppermint oil. It&#x27;s hard to explain - it&#x27;s certainly not as bad as orange juice after brushing your teeth nasty. I usually only use it before bed so it&#x27;s not really an issue. It doesn&#x27;t burn but it does feel refreshing!</li>
    <li> I had tried some of the other Jason &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mouthwash products.  The first one was mint and was ok, but I had to get used to the flavor.  I think because it was less sweet than the name brand mouthwashes, it was kind of weird at first.  This Cinnamon Powermint one was really good.  Nice Cinnamon flavor, and had some sweetness to it due to having Xylitol in it.  After finishing this bottle, I purchased another similiar Jason mouthwash that was Cinnamon Clove flavored.  That one I&#x27;m having a hard time with.  Some people may enjoy the clove flavor, but it&#x27;s not flavor I want when using mouthwash.  Maybe it&#x27;s because we make our Christmas ham with brown sugar and cloves, but that&#x27;s what it reminds me of.  I will be going back to the Cinnamon Powermint.</li>
    <li> My favorite mouthwash after Tom&#x27;s of Maine went all corporate on us and screwed up by deleting Cinnamint from their lineup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Jason flavor is the closest I could come to the old Tom&#x27;s Cinnamint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the price...the $6.39 is competitive with the version on the shelves of your local store; but I ordered &amp;#34;PRIME&amp;#34; and still got charged for shipping..another $4.99, which makes this a bad deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product but the confusing shipping pricing charges makes it a downgrade to 2 stars.</li>
    <li> love it - wish it were less expensive</li>
    <li> So fresh and wonderful taste and scent! A must have!</li>
    <li> great flavor.  mouth really feels clean.</li>
    <li> Does not taste like cinnamon.  Tastes like peroxide and bleach!  With a hint of mint.  Huge waste of money, wanted something that tastes like big red gum.</li>
    <li> Tasty and healthy. I use bath &amp; body Jason (lavender) products so I knew I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with the mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Kinda meh.  Feels slimey in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried this mouthwash before, just the toothpaste, but I do like it.  It doesn&#x27;t burn and the taste is refreshing.</li>
    <li> VERY sweet! Even when diluted at the recommended ratio!</li>
    <li> tastes good and is helping my teeth, thanks</li>
    <li> I came to this product because I wanted an all natural mouthwash. And, to be fair, this product is pretty good in a lot of ways. Most of its ingredients are pretty good and simple, so I feel good about that (no alcohol base!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does have polsorbate 20 as the third ingredient, which raises a flag for me. It starts to make me wonder why the company trumpets &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and then tries to slip that in under the table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the flavor of this is like cinnamon sugar water -- thick and sweet, like liquid Big Red gum. Too much for me. It almost feels like I&#x27;m swilling my mouth with candy. Also, I&#x27;ve found it to have a strange, slightly bitter after-taste. Not the worst thing in the world, but not a fresh, clean feeling like you want with mouthwash.</li>
    <li> finally a great mouthwash minus any harmful chemical additives, flavorings, etc...this really works well and tastes great too, I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Seems to be easier to use than the ones that burn.  I can actually swish for longer than 10 seconds.</li>
    <li> A little too strong for our family. If you like a strong mouthwash this is the one for you. My husband, who likes a strong minty flavor, didn&#x27;t care for this, even though it works really well.</li>
    <li> I have tried their cinnamon clove and a few other flavors in the past. I really recommend the Cinnamon Power mint because the intensity of the flavor seems more subtle compared to the other offerings. A+</li>
    <li> I found out about this mouthwash just from searching for natural stuff on amazon.  I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the Tom&#x27;s of Main mouthwash until they changed their formula recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually love this mouthwash even more...really great cinnamon and cloves taste that lasts.  It feels like it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product packaging (and name) gives it the feel of something you&#x27;d find at a $1 store but it most certainly is not.</li>
    <li> Does wonders for me, especially working in the field of having to talk face to face all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it leaves this weird after-taste the whole day, but goes away when I eat something.</li>
    <li> JASON is the natural alternative to Listerine (which I love, but don&#x27;t use anymore b/c I think it&#x27;s a bit too chemically abrasive). I haven&#x27;t tried this particular flavor, but I&#x27;ve used some of their other mouthwashes and loved them. It really does seem to whiten my teeth. :D</li>
    <li> Taste is unpleasant, and I don&#x27;t like the way it coats the inside of my mouth.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased mouthwash and toothpaste and love them both. My mouth feels clean and also my breath feels clean and I am very happy with the Jason line.</li>
    <li> Gave me major acid reflux; the flavor was just way too strong.</li>
    <li> Love this gives fresh breath no irritation no residue will buy again</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers have noted, I wish this were just Cinnamon and didn&#x27;t have the mint. The flavor is okay, but I just wanted plain Cinnamon to compliment my cinnamon toothpaste. This is also too expensive for the size of bottle, and I use it up much too quickly to be cost effective. I have not been able to find a natural brand that is plain cinnamon.</li>
    <li> This product is animal cruelty-free, which is why I chose it. The flavor is great! I use, and continue to be pleased with, many Jason products.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. However, I prefer Jason Healthy Mouth Tea Tree &amp; Cinnamon Mouthwash over this one.  The only reason I went with this over the other is that Amazon offers a subscription with this product and not with the Healthy Mouth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to sanitize my mouth every time I use a mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;I use Jason PowerSmile every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the predominately mint flavored mouthwashes on the market.  This has just enough to refresh your mouth but not overpower.  Love the cinnamon flavor.</li>
    <li> Love this natural mouthwash, best one so far.</li>
    <li> great taste, but, my dentist recommended thart i have a mouthwash with floride</li>
    <li> I love the fact that the ingredient list is so short and natural. It doesn&#x27;t sting or leave my mouth dry, and it tastes good.</li>
    <li> Good, clean taste, not overpowering of cinnamon. Doesn &#x27;t have the drying affect many mouthwashes seem to cause. Will definitely buy again, and highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is basically water. I&#x27;m so disappointed in it! I was really looking forward to having the refreshing zest of cinnamon in my mouth but am left with only the sliiiiiiiiiiiiightest hint of it. It truly feels watered down and maybe I&#x27;m just used to all the chemicals and whatever else they put in Scope and Listerine and ACT? This Jason Brand seems to be pretty natural so maybe this is what I get for being more healthy. But it sure disappoints. :(</li>
    <li> Nice taste although I would prefer just the Cinnamon and not any mint taste - inexpensive and worth trying so see if you like, too.</li>
    <li> I have bought this before and will buy again. Great product for those who want a fresh mouth without chewing poisonous gums or gargling with flouridated mouthwashes. Just staying flouride free.</li>
    <li> I found it!  I LOVE Jason products.  It&#x27;s so important to use products that don&#x27;t have antibiotics in them.  Thank God for Jason!</li>
    <li> Been using for a couple of months now,  my gums are much healthier now,  Dentist isn&#x27;t complaining as much, if at all,  lol</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash......what a great flavor......feeling......lasts  and lasts......the only one I&#x27;ll ever use again...Thanks for such a great product.</li>
    <li> It is a natural product and seems to have lasting results.  it has clove and cinnamon which really seem to be naturally antibacterial.  i use this stuff after flossing and then i brush and that seems to work best.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash has a nice flavor, and noticeably freshens breath.  I do not know if it kills germs, but I appreciate that this does not have Saccharin in it.</li>
    <li> It tasted alright. It barely tasted like anything, let alone cinnamon. I normally love Jason products but this did absolutely nothing for my breath.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite.  I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s not using Scope or Listerine anymore.  I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> Ok, this is not a terrible mouthwash. It works pretty well.  It&#x27;s more &#x27;natural&#x27; than many of its competitors, it contains peppermint oil, cinnamon, blah, blah.  Here is my problem with it. It is labeled \\&quot;all natural mouthwash\\&quot;.  This is not an outright lie, companies are allowed to label their products as such, even when it&#x27;s not totally true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polysorbate 20 is the third ingredient-that means theres a bit in there.  Here is information on polysorbate 20 that I found on the Bubble and Bee Organic Website.. \\&quot;Polysorbate starts out as harmless sorbitol, but then it&#x27;s treated with carcinogenic ethylene oxide.\\&quot; It goes on to say that if you look up polysorbate, it&#x27;s not rated as a concern. But that is because they don&#x27;t take into consideration the ethylene oxide, and it can be laced with heavy metals\\&quot;.  (For reference, this is an awesome website that has a &#x27;chemical of the day&#x27; section. I use it all the time!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the mouthwash is manufactured by Hain Celestial Group, one of the big boys buying out small organic businesses, then slightly &#x27;altering&#x27; (never for the better!) their products.  Google \\&quot;who owns organic\\&quot;, you&#x27;ll be surprised at what companies dominate the organic market. It&#x27;s no surprise that these natural foods not so natural.  (Dig a little deeper, and you will find that many of the carcinogens that are rampant in our cosmetic and beauty products have been banned in other countries, but are just fine for us!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the complete list of ingredients. (It would be nice if companies were required to provide a complete list of ingredients in their listing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aqua, glycerin, polysorbate 20, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, camellia sinensis leaf extract, citrus grandis (grapefruit) seed extract, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) water, perilla ocymoides seed extract, cinnamomum zeylanicum bark oil, eugenia caryophyllus (clove) flower oil, illicium verum (anise) fruit/seed oil, mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, menthol, sea salt, sodium bicarbonate, xylitol.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a truly natural and effective mouthwash, mix up your own, its costs almost nothing and stores well.  Mix distilled water, baking soda and a few drops of peppermint oil. Mix and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line: this mouthwash is better than many I have tried, it does have ALMOST all natural ingredients.  I returned mine with the message that it was not all natural, as advertised.  I don&#x27;t appreciate a big company dirtying an otherwise great product with nasty chemicals.  I am just sick of it.  I don&#x27;t like paying some fatcat to poison me, and you shouldn&#x27;t either.ea salt, sodium bicarbonate, xylitol.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a truly natural and effective mouthwash, mix up your own, its costs almost nothing and stores well.

    <li> i love this mouthwash.  it does the job without the alcohol and the burn.  since it is concentrated, i dilute it with one part mouthwash to one part water, and it works perfectly.  this is the only mouthwash i use now!</li>
