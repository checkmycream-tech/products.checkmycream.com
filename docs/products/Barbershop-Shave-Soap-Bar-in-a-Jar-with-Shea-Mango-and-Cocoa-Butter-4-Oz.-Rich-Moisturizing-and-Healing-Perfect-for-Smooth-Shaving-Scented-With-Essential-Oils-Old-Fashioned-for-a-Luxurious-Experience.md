      <li>Great lather.</li>
      <li>Lathers up nicely and has a wonderful &amp;#34;Woodsy&amp;#34; sent.</li>
      <li>But a great wake up without any menthol- its</li>
      <li>Paired with Gillette&#x27;s newest fusion razor yielded the closest, smoothest, shave that I have ever experienced.</li>
      <li>Great scent.</li>
      <li>The Bay Rum, Orange and Clove scent Barbershop Shave Soap Bar in a Jar smells so nice!</li>
      <li>My husband looked great and smelled so good after using this.</li>
      <li>Good for travelling and at home.</li>
      <li>Best there is for a smooth face.</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>but I did and was very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I got the cedarwood and the scent is very nice , if you can get this to lather it would make for an enjoyable shave .</li>
      <li>was given this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>Scent is very mild but in a good way.  </li>
      <li>Very light and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells!he lather will start to build.</li>
      <li>and I seem to get a better glide than the Proraso.  </li>
      <li>He has been using products with Bay rum scent for a long time and this Bebelush product has a delicious tropical scent.</li>
      <li>MUCH BETTER SMELL IS VERY MILD BUT SHAVE IS SOOOOOO SMOOTH</li>
      <li>This has a clean scent that I appreciate a lot more than the foofy florals that ladies shave cream comes in.</li>
      <li>It lathers up very well and does a good job of providing a comfortable shave but</li>
      <li>The soap washes off my silver tip badger brush pretty good and does not leave a residue; keep in mind that I use a mild hand soap to wash off the preShave oil and shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like how it made the razor glide smoothly</li>
      <li>In fact my underarms look hydrated and smooth.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of this product to review on my blog.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The lather is good and after shaving, his skin is soft and touchable.</li>
      <li>I also loved it because it didn&#x27;t make my underarms itchy or red.</li>
      <li>This stuff is a lot thinner than standard shaving cream, which is a good thing because it helps you see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Positively makes shaving so much nicer, and has a Nice aroma.</li>
      <li>A quick note-</li>
      <li>I was clean shaven- smooth and silky, with no knicks and bumps like I normally get.</li>
      <li>My husband was very excited to try out this old fashioned shave soap when I told him about it.</li>
      <li>it stays nice and wet.  </li>
      <li>Lathers up pretty well</li>
      <li>Makes shaving so much easier!</li>
      <li>The smell is very nice but subtle - in a good way, not overwhelming as some soaps tend to be.</li>
      <li>It certainly wasn&#x27;t slippy.</li>
      <li>doesnt lather very well.</li>
      <li>Very fall/winter scent (cedarwood/clove).  </li>
      <li>Got a really good lather with only a minimal amount of soap.</li>
      <li>Having shaven with an electric razor for my most of my adult life, I&#x27;m a noob when it comes to the old-school double edge razor.</li>
      <li>For this review, I received one BebeLush Barbershop Shave Soap in a handy little tin!  </li>
      <li>I have gotten good results with several other soaps using less water , more water , whipping in a bowl  or in my hand .</li>
      <li>Just a small amount is enough to make the razor glide more smoothly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I use mostly DE razors with a few injectors and GEM SE razors to mix things up and it works well with all of them.  </li>
      <li>I was glad that it worked good for my husband, but I was disappointed with two of the ingredients, which were propylene Glycol and Titanium Dioxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This might not be a problem for most people as I shave rather slowly — after all, no need for yet-another-trip to the Emergency Room (you know you&#x27;re going to the ER too much when the billing department starts to send you Christmas cards and the CEO of your insurance company</li>
      <li>More moisturizing than usual shave soap.  </li>
      <li>I live in an area with soft water, so</li>
      <li>I can get great thick lather off it with an average badger brush- 20 seconds to load the brush, then build it up in a bowl.  </li>
      <li>It makes an OK lather , but doesn&#x27;t last long enough to finish a pass .</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive leg flesh, so shaving can be a horror show for me.</li>
      <li>Used once so far.</li>
      <li>WAIT TO FINISH OLD ONE</li>
      <li>HAVEN&#x27;T USED UP OLD CAKE</li>
      <li>does make your skin feel soft after shaving.</li>
      <li>I use it daily and my jar has already lasted more than a month and a half with plenty left!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended and I plan on trying future sents!</li>
      <li>a new thing might motivate him to shave his extra fur.</li>
      <li>Creamy and smooth, delicate on the skin.</li>
      <li>I have also noticed my face doesn&#x27;t burn as much nor seem as irritated as it has with other brands.</li>
      <li>The lather also does not dry out on your face-</li>
      <li>only complaint is that the soap dries up fairly rapidly (this could be common for all soaps like this, I don&#x27;t know).</li>

<li> Got this bad boy a few weeks ago and was amazed at how good it smelled!  </li>

<li> My husband has been using it to shave his face and he says, that the soap makes it easier to shave, since it’s not so thick, like shaving cream.  </li>
<li> isn&#x27;t terrible, but its below average for shave soaps that i use.</li>
<li> , sorry dudes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
<li> And I&#x27;ve used them all up, except one was so bad, I threw it away.  </li>
<li> getting lather never seems to be a problem except with really bad soaps so YMMV.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very light and moisturizing. Makes shaving so much easier!</li>
    <li> Used once so far. I wanted this for shaving kit. Lip pops on with friction not a screw on. I like it. Good price.</li>
    <li> More moisturizing than usual shave soap.  Cinnamon/clove scent may slightly irritate your skin if you&#x27;re highly sensitive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different shave soaps.  And I&#x27;ve used them all up, except one was so bad, I threw it away.  This was not thrown away.  It&#x27;s very strange, there was a sensation that it was ... gritty.  It wasn&#x27;t, but... there was an awareness, or sensation of grittiness.  It certainly wasn&#x27;t slippy.</li>
    <li> The Bay Rum, Orange and Clove scent Barbershop Shave Soap Bar in a Jar smells so nice! It made it easier for me to shave. Since it&#x27;s like a solid wax, I used my fingers to make a circular motion on the surface of the Barbershop Shave Soap Bar and then I applied it to my underarms. I like how it made the razor glide smoothly and how I got a closer shave. I also loved it because it didn&#x27;t make my underarms itchy or red. Just a small amount is enough to make the razor glide more smoothly. The BebeLush Shave Soap Bar in a Jar didn&#x27;t leave my underarms dry. In fact my underarms look hydrated and smooth.</li>
    <li> I got a chance to review Barbershop Shave Soap Bar in a Jar. This is a perfect gift for Father&#x27;s Day, or birthday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does make your skin feel soft after shaving. I love the way it smells!he lather will start to build. Shave, rinse and feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> Lathers up nicely and has a wonderful &amp;#34;Woodsy&amp;#34; sent. I love that it has nothing fake in the ingredients. I have also noticed my face doesn&#x27;t burn as much nor seem as irritated as it has with other brands. I use it daily and my jar has already lasted more than a month and a half with plenty left! Highly recommended and I plan on trying future sents!</li>
    <li> Got a really good lather with only a minimal amount of soap. The smell is very nice but subtle - in a good way, not overwhelming as some soaps tend to be.</li>
    <li> doesnt lather very well. isn&#x27;t terrible, but its below average for shave soaps that i use.</li>
    <li> Very fall/winter scent (cedarwood/clove).  But a great wake up without any menthol- its the clove- lots of clove.  If you don&#x27;t like clove this is not the soap for you.  Scent does not linger after the shave and rinse off.  I can get great thick lather off it with an average badger brush- 20 seconds to load the brush, then build it up in a bowl.  It does not seem to dry out my skin.  I would classify it as slightly above average slickness with tons of cushion.  The lather also does not dry out on your face- it stays nice and wet.  I use mostly DE razors with a few injectors and GEM SE razors to mix things up and it works well with all of them.  A quick note- I live in an area with soft water, so getting lather never seems to be a problem except with really bad soaps so YMMV.</li>
    <li> Best there is for a smooth face. My husband looked great and smelled so good after using this. He loves the way his face feels!</li>
    <li> People have different ways that they shave, some use shaving cream, shaving gel or soap.  Have you heard about the BebeLush Barbershop Shave Soap yet?  For this review, I received one BebeLush Barbershop Shave Soap in a handy little tin!  My husband has been using it to shave his face and he says, that the soap makes it easier to shave, since it’s not so thick, like shaving cream.  Even though we got the cedarwood, cassia and clove scented soap, it has a very little scent that you can hardly smell.  I was glad that it worked good for my husband, but I was disappointed with two of the ingredients, which were propylene Glycol and Titanium Dioxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> My husband was very excited to try out this old fashioned shave soap when I told him about it. He has been using products with Bay rum scent for a long time and this Bebelush product has a delicious tropical scent. The lather is good and after shaving, his skin is soft and touchable. I like that this container lasts for several months and he likes that it evokes an oldfashioned barbershop shave.</li>
    <li> One of the best shaving soap I have used until now. Creamy and smooth, delicate on the skin. Good for travelling and at home.</li>
    <li> Having shaven with an electric razor for my most of my adult life, I&#x27;m a noob when it comes to the old-school double edge razor. Based on my limited experience, I like this soap a lot. This stuff is a lot thinner than standard shaving cream, which is a good thing because it helps you see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the soap dries up fairly rapidly (this could be common for all soaps like this, I don&#x27;t know). This might not be a problem for most people as I shave rather slowly — after all, no need for yet-another-trip to the Emergency Room (you know you&#x27;re going to the ER too much when the billing department starts to send you Christmas cards and the CEO of your insurance company writes you a personally to thank you for helping them get a volume discount)</li>
    <li> Got this bad boy a few weeks ago and was amazed at how good it smelled!  I&#x27;ve been a Proraso user for several years and recently wanted to switch it up, thankfully I picked a winner.  Lathers up pretty well and I seem to get a better glide than the Proraso.  Scent is very mild but in a good way.  The soap washes off my silver tip badger brush pretty good and does not leave a residue; keep in mind that I use a mild hand soap to wash off the preShave oil and shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - I always use a pre-shave oil and after shave balm- I would never do without.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product to review on my blog.&lt;br /&gt;I have a fuzzy man that needs to shave. He has a raging neck beard, so I was happy to receive this product to review. I thought- hey- a new thing might motivate him to shave his extra fur. Well, I was mistaken. I guess the Stanley Cup Playoffs are still on and shaving is a no go. However, all is not lost! I also have some furry legs in need of a close shave. I decided to try the soap for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW- the ladies are missing out on the experience of shave soap. This has a clean scent that I appreciate a lot more than the foofy florals that ladies shave cream comes in. I have really sensitive leg flesh, so shaving can be a horror show for me. I was a little nervous to try this soap.. but I did and was very pleased with the results. I was clean shaven- smooth and silky, with no knicks and bumps like I normally get. I think I will be keeping this for myself, sorry dudes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> It makes an OK lather , but doesn&#x27;t last long enough to finish a pass . By the time I get to my neck the lather has almost dried up. This also does not produce the slickness that some other soaps have. I have only been wet shaving for about 3 months , so maybe I don&#x27;t have enough experience to find what works with this soap. I have gotten good results with several other soaps using less water , more water , whipping in a bowl  or in my hand . Just could not get this to perform well enough for me. I got the cedarwood and the scent is very nice , if you can get this to lather it would make for an enjoyable shave .</li>
    <li> HAVEN&#x27;T USED UP OLD CAKE YET BUT TRIED THIS ONE ANYWAY CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO FINISH OLD ONE THIS IS MUCH BETTER SMELL IS VERY MILD BUT SHAVE IS SOOOOOO SMOOTH</li>
    <li> Great lather. Great scent. Paired with Gillette&#x27;s newest fusion razor yielded the closest, smoothest, shave that I have ever experienced.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good! Received it from my wife as part of a gift and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever smelt so manly. It lathers up very well and does a good job of providing a comfortable shave but the best part is the lingering smell of the soap under your nose after you&#x27;re done. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Positively makes shaving so much nicer, and has a Nice aroma. I will never purchase canned shaving cream again. I recommend this product.</li>
