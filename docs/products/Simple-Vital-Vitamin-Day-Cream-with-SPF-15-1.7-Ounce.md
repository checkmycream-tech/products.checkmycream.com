      <li>Just as good and a lot cheaper!!!</li>
      <li>i use it all over my body its that good!</li>
      <li>and I am so happy to have found this.  </li>
      <li>I used this product before &amp; loved it.</li>
      <li>Those pro&#x27;s are a good start.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this day cream.</li>
      <li>My skin has never looked or felt better!</li>
      <li>b/c I really love this cream!</li>
      <li>to many to count!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell which is nice.</li>
      <li>the smell is wonderful it very creamy...never had a seperation prob at all...</li>
      <li>and this one is doing the job quite nicely.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly nice considering the price.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t separate or have a fragrance &amp; it felt good on my skin &amp; moisturized it just fine.</li>
      <li>It seemed great at first but after a couple of hours my skin started to burn and I turned into a marshmallow puffy face.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve had very good success even in Florida sun with Biore&#x27;s dual fusion spf 30 and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s spf 50 UVA/UVB, one of which I wear every time I go out because I fry quickly.  </li>
      <li>FOUND THE ULTIMATE BEST MOISTERIZER EVER!</li>
      <li>It feels great and moisturizes without making me feel greasy, but it really made my skin break out.  </li>
      <li>Glad someone is selling it here.</li>
      <li>My skin is better than I have seen in years.  </li>
      <li>Im here to buy more &amp; buy more of their products especilly the night cream..</li>
      <li>The facial wipes are great too!!!!</li>
      <li>I love these products.</li>
      <li>okay, I guess,</li>
      <li>I slathered a healthy generous amount all over too.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It is very nice for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t imagine how this could be a good product for anybody with very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I had got two free jars of these with one still in the box</li>
      <li>The smell is light, but unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, this is a sign I shouldn&#x27;t use cheap freebies</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t experienced any red or blotching like others</li>
      <li>I wish I could take your free samples</li>
      <li>I see a lot of reviewers got this as a free sample with something else</li>
      <li>I have young skin that I keep in good condition.</li>
      <li>I got a full size jar of this for free with an order I placed through another company, not amazon.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find anything special about them.  </li>
      <li>I got this in a shipment as a freebie, full container.</li>
      <li>It looked like a good idea - simple.  </li>
      <li>Like so many others I had high hopes for this brand.</li>
      <li>I have very fair, very sensitive yet also dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and just about everything touching my face makes it break out</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how so many people with rosacea and very sensitive skin rated this 5 stars.</li>
      <li>They obviusly haven&#x27;t thought to add sunscreen to the cream that&#x27;s good for sensitive skin, in fact, they seem to have chosen particularly noxious chemicals and the whole product</li>
      <li>I do have somewhat sensitive skin, so simple sounded good.  </li>
      <li>, I really needed a moisture cream, this works for me!</li>
      <li>I should have looked here first.</li>
      <li>I am happy to report that my skin has improved in both texture and appearance in the last two weeks, thanks to Simple.  </li>
      <li>I need to start off by saying i LOVE simple products.</li>
      <li>This cream doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive, acne prone skin!</li>
      <li>I have mild rosacea acne and mild to moderate sensitive skin &amp; mild dryness</li>
      <li>It is very oily, I have dry skin and thought this would be okay</li>
      <li>Great for people like me with extremely sensitive but very dry facial skin.  </li>
      <li>i HIGHLY recommend!</li>
      <li>It was also very greasy on my skin.</li>
      <li>I really like this cream.</li>
      <li>and hope get some thing that real is for my skin.</li>
      <li>but i can only hope that this product will stay available because it has saved my skin.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes very well</li>
      <li>My sensitive, rosacea-prone skin is now protected from the sun on a daily basis (important, as I walk to work every morning)!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had this kind of reaction before and since the reaction only happened with the product containing sunscreen, I can only surmise that is what caused it.  </li>
      <li>but this made my face warm and itchy within a few minutes of putting it on.  </li>
      <li>The skin from my chin to above my lips and out from the corners of my mouth all errupted into very sore,  very itchy bright red blotches that took almost two weeks to calm down and several more weeks for my skin to approach normal again.  </li>
      <li>and I have tried so many other products.  </li>
      <li>I knew that because my face was a whole lot dryer since using the NEW product.</li>
      <li>so as I get older, I like that.</li>
      <li>This has made my skin soooo smooth and absolutely no blotches from it.  </li>
      <li>I finally washed with a rose/witch hazel toner I have and that helped calm the itching.  </li>
      <li>Pretty much the opposite of what one would expect from a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It took a few days for my skin to adjust to a new product, but I am glad I stuck it out.  </li>
      <li>This came free in a shipment from a local big box store</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I used this the first day and the skin under and around my eyes blew up into big puffy sore almost bag like blotches.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and normally used Cetaphil</li>
      <li>IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN STAY FAR FAR AWAY!</li>
      <li>I can no longer use some of the brands that are sold in the department stores because of my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This cream has no odor and works well on my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive to the type of ss used, but olay never did this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Oil of Olay sensitive, Neutrogena, and Lancome were among others that I have tried but without luck.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, so I bought this since I trusted the brand.</li>
      <li>After one application of this, my face is back to normal.</li>
      <li>I can find a product that is NEW to Simple.</li>
      <li>If I react to it without sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t imagine what people who actually have sensitive skin will do.  </li>
      <li>but I have seen an increase in my normal dry spots that were clearing up.</li>
      <li>Anyone with very sensitive dry skin can use it without worrying about breaking out from it.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and dry.</li>
      <li>Not long after putting it on, my eyes started to burn and I immediately washed it off and threw it out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It feels great and moisturizes without making me feel greasy, but it really made my skin break out.  Not so simple :(</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a year ago now.  I have very fair, very sensitive yet also dry skin.  Prior to this I was using Aveeno but something in it&#x27;s composition changed and my skin started to burn when I put it on and my face would turn red.  Oil of Olay sensitive, Neutrogena, and Lancome were among others that I have tried but without luck.  This cream works wonderfully for me.  It doesn&#x27;t turn my skin red, I don&#x27;t get any bumps, it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, I do not have any discomfort when I use this product, no complaints here.  It moisturizes very well and I don&#x27;t need a separate night cream with this.  I see a lot of reviewers got this as a free sample with something else they bought- I wish I could take your free samples b/c I really love this cream!</li>
    <li> I love these products. I have just recently started using the scrub, toner and both night and day cream. My skin has never looked or felt better! And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> My sensitive, rosacea-prone skin is now protected from the sun on a daily basis (important, as I walk to work every morning)!  My skin often reacts to sunscreen, so I was skeptical -- how could something this affordable really be gentle?  It took a few days for my skin to adjust to a new product, but I am glad I stuck it out.  I also use the non-drying cleanser... but only in the evening, since I find it rather drying (actually)!  I am happy to report that my skin has improved in both texture and appearance in the last two weeks, thanks to Simple.  Hurray!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the sunscreen or other ingredients in this product that irritated my eyes. My eyes kept watering the entire day when I had this cream on. Won&#x27;t use again.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this day cream. I have very dry skin and a touch of rosaccea and this one is doing the job quite nicely. Surprisingly nice considering the price. I will keep ordering this product.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and dry. This day cream is the only face lotion that hasn&#x27;t burned my skin and made it peel. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but i can only hope that this product will stay available because it has saved my skin.</li>
    <li> I had to give this one star in order to even write this review. I need to start off by saying i LOVE simple products. Except this one. I used it ONCE and I broke out horrifically! My face is still swollen and has a rash all over it and this is only the second day after I initially used the cream. It seemed great at first but after a couple of hours my skin started to burn and I turned into a marshmallow puffy face. My skin is so dry and flaky with little bumps all over. I am miserable thanks to this terrible cream. IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN STAY FAR FAR AWAY!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is actually an exfoliating cream for me so as I get older, I like that. It is very nice for sensitive skin and I can tell a difference when I run out of this stuff. My skin gets dull without it. . .  this simple cream works.</li>
    <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive, acne prone skin! Also, it took care of the inevitable winter dry-skin peeling.</li>
    <li> I got this in a shipment as a freebie, full container. I noticed bumps around my mouth the same day but didn&#x27;t realize it was from the cream  till day two when I saw bumps EVERYWHERE and these are the tiny ones that if you touch them they pop and are painful :0(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually stick to Neutrogena and Oil of Olay, this is a sign I shouldn&#x27;t use cheap freebies I&#x27;m not familiar with. I slathered a healthy generous amount all over too.</li>
    <li> it smell real bad so i thought would let sit there and smell got worst i tried big mistake just turn my face real red i will never buy any thing of product again it not for sensitive skin at all.to bad i guess try some thing else and hope get some thing that real is for my skin.</li>
    <li> I received this item as a freebie and decided to try it. Not long after putting it on, my eyes started to burn and I immediately washed it off and threw it out. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but this did not agree with me at all. It was also very greasy on my skin. Hated it.</li>
    <li> As I read the other reviews, I had to wonder if they were writing about the correct product. This cream has no odor and works well on my extremely sensitive skin. I can no longer use some of the brands that are sold in the department stores because of my sensitive skin. This cream reduces my redness and dryness. It does tend to separate towards the end of use but I just stir it and then apply.</li>
    <li> I got this as a freebie after ordering several of the simple products elsewhere but I feel I have to comment. I used this the first day and the skin under and around my eyes blew up into big puffy sore almost bag like blotches.  The skin from my chin to above my lips and out from the corners of my mouth all errupted into very sore,  very itchy bright red blotches that took almost two weeks to calm down and several more weeks for my skin to approach normal again.  I&#x27;ve never had this kind of reaction before and since the reaction only happened with the product containing sunscreen, I can only surmise that is what caused it.  Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive to the type of ss used, but olay never did this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the productsvthemselves...I didn&#x27;t find anything special about them.  They are.. okay, I guess, but I won&#x27;t be buying them gain and gave mine to someone else that wanted to try them.</li>
    <li> Like so many others I had high hopes for this brand. I have young skin that I keep in good condition. I decided to try this brand after using boutique brands since I was fifteen and I learned this lesson the hard way. In a word it&#x27;s awful. It&#x27;s so thin like its been watered down and I have to apply it at least twice to feel like its doing anything. Worst of all though, it brings out ALL the red and blotchiness in my skin and leaves a ghastly sheen over my whole face. I&#x27;m putting this in my beach bag and only using it when I need sunscreen. No wonder they discontinued it.</li>
    <li> FOUND THE ULTIMATE BEST MOISTERIZER EVER! do you know..how..many..creams i have tried in 57 yrs?? to many to count! i rec&#x27;d this as a freebie and Im here to buy more &amp; buy more of their products especilly the night cream..the smell is wonderful it very creamy...never had a seperation prob at all... i use it all over my body its that good! i HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> I used this product before &amp; loved it. Now I am unable to find it anywhere. So I decide to check Amazon &amp; there it is. Glad someone is selling it here. I can find a product that is NEW to Simple. But after this product arrived at my house &amp; I compared active ingredients, they are not the same products. I knew that because my face was a whole lot dryer since using the NEW product. After one application of this, my face is back to normal.</li>
    <li> This came free in a shipment from a local big box store so I thought I would give it a go.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t react to any other facial products but this made my face warm and itchy within a few minutes of putting it on.  I hadn&#x27;t used any other skin products that day so it wasn&#x27;t reacting with anything else.  I tried washing it off and using my moisturizer but it didn&#x27;t help.  I finally washed with a rose/witch hazel toner I have and that helped calm the itching.  If I react to it without sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t imagine what people who actually have sensitive skin will do.  I don&#x27;t know how it does as a sunscreen since I wasn&#x27;t going to go outside with an already pink and itchy face.  I would avoid it.  I don&#x27;t know about sensitive skin but I&#x27;ve had very good success even in Florida sun with Biore&#x27;s dual fusion spf 30 and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s spf 50 UVA/UVB, one of which I wear every time I go out because I fry quickly.  The spf 30 isn&#x27;t enough for me unless it&#x27;s the cooler months or I&#x27;m only outside a short time.  Neither of them clog my skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and normally used Cetaphil but it&#x27;s so expensive. I got this as a freebie in my order and decided to use it. It doesn&#x27;t smell which is nice. It is very oily, I have dry skin and thought this would be okay but every time I opened the bottle the oil will be separating from the the cream so I&#x27;d close it and shake it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still decided to give it a try. It doesn&#x27;t rub into the skin well. It is very thin and not a heavy type of cream at all, when I rub it on my face using just a dollop it just sits on the skin. It takes forever to rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any red or blotching like others but I have seen an increase in my normal dry spots that were clearing up. I had got two free jars of these with one still in the box however I am going to toss them out.</li>
    <li> I got a full size jar of this for free with an order I placed through another company, not amazon.  I did not expect it to be in with my order.  It looked like a good idea - simple.  I do have somewhat sensitive skin, so simple sounded good.  I tried some on my face and it had an oddly drying affect.  Almost as if I had applied a powder to my skin.  Pretty much the opposite of what one would expect from a moisturizer.  It didn&#x27;t sting or burn, just very dry.  The smell is light, but unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Great for people like me with extremely sensitive but very dry facial skin.  I use to use an Oil of Olay product but it was discontinued so I figured I&#x27;d try this.  Just as good and a lot cheaper!!! Anyone with very sensitive dry skin can use it without worrying about breaking out from it.</li>
    <li> On the heavier side for a day lotion and gets little drippy in the container if you don&#x27;t mix it. Moisturizes great though!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so I bought this since I trusted the brand. I should have looked here first. My face was swollen and red as a tomato within a few hours. They obviusly haven&#x27;t thought to add sunscreen to the cream that&#x27;s good for sensitive skin, in fact, they seem to have chosen particularly noxious chemicals and the whole product is basically a low-quality suntan lotion. I&#x27;m very disappointed with Simple.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. I have VERY sensitive skin and just about everything touching my face makes it break out, I really needed a moisture cream, this works for me!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I have tried so many other products.  None of them worked.  My skin never got mosturized and I would get blotches from them.  This has made my skin soooo smooth and absolutely no blotches from it.  My skin is better than I have seen in years.  I have tried all the products from A to Z and I am so happy to have found this.  The facial wipes are great too!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how so many people with rosacea and very sensitive skin rated this 5 stars. It didn&#x27;t separate or have a fragrance &amp; it felt good on my skin &amp; moisturized it just fine. Those pro&#x27;s are a good start. However each time I used it my skin became itchy, red, and blotchy. I have mild rosacea acne and mild to moderate sensitive skin &amp; mild dryness so I can&#x27;t imagine how this could be a good product for anybody with very sensitive skin. I ended up throwing it out. It bothered me enough I would not consider using their products again.</li>
