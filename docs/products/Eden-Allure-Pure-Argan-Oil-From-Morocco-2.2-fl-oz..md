      <li>Better than most.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think it lubricates any better than 100% olive oil.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This brand steams the argan oil to remove or decrease the nutty smell which is ok.</li>
      <li>I am sure you will like it.</li>
      <li>- baby oil does a better job of moisturizing and softening.  </li>

      <li>For skin, it helps moisturize and smooth away wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I primarily bought this for my face, to help with my acne and acne scars.</li>
      <li>Very light, and really does nothing</li>
      <li>and although I&#x27;m sure this is pure oil, it seems to sit on the skin.  </li>
      <li>Overall good product though.</li>
      <li>We love to wear our hair straight for ease of mornings.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find anything extraordinary with it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for two months now as my main moisturizer, and I have to say that I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
      <li>Besides, now there are better oils in general...</li>
      <li>This product was more affordable and in a larger bottle.  </li>
      <li>It makes my summer feet smooth and soft again.  </li>
      <li>In my experience, this is a skin product first and foremost.</li>

      <li>I have used it now for over a year and the results have been stellar.</li>
      <li>I do not have frizz for the first time in my life thanks to the Argan oil.</li>
      <li>It has helped my hair so much.</li>
      <li>I only use this on my skin, and it is wonderful for reducing/removing lines, combating dryness, and maintaining overall texture--all year round.</li>
      <li>If I run out, I will not wear my hair straight without it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference with my acne</li>
      <li>I know how much to use for my face</li>
      <li>I mix a few drops of Bulgarian Rose Oil and use it on my face and hair.</li>
      <li>so far so good, but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if it really does anything.  </li>
      <li>Have not used it long enough to see what kind of result it does.  </li>
      <li>It does not have any scent and leaves your skin soft and dewy.  </li>
      <li>It is also naturally curly.</li>
      <li>It is getting more expensive than when I first bought it.</li>
      <li>I bought Eden Allure&#x27;s Pure Argan Oil because it was a much cheaper alternative to more expensive brands such as Josie Maran.</li>
      <li>I do like that it is all natural and can be used all over the body without clogging pores, but I&#x27;d buy evoo next time not this.</li>
      <li>I really like this product for my hair and compared to other brands of argan oil , this one doesn&#x27;t smell rancid.</li>
      <li>I do think this is a good lubricant, but it is very expensive for the quantity.</li>
      <li>but it just made my hair very oil and weighed down.</li>

    <li> so far so good, but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if it really does anything.  No smell, that&#x27;s a good thing. Nice texture too.  Seems to distribute well in my long hair.</li>
    <li> It has a very light nutty scent, unlike my experience with Life-Flo!  A little does go a long way and I&#x27;ve just ordered my 3rd bottle in 8 months! Very happy it&#x27;s now available in 2oz bottles with Amazon shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought Eden Allure&#x27;s Pure Argan Oil because it was a much cheaper alternative to more expensive brands such as Josie Maran. I&#x27;ve used this for two months now as my main moisturizer, and I have to say that I love how it feels on my skin. It does not have any scent and leaves your skin soft and dewy.  It does not feel sticky or look shiny at all. You only need to use a little each time so this bottle will last you quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Argan Oil before from Josie Maran.  This product was more affordable and in a larger bottle.  However, it does not absorb well.  I know how much to use for my face and although I&#x27;m sure this is pure oil, it seems to sit on the skin.  Oil from Josie Maran soaks in better.  It is good for feet, legs and body.  It makes my summer feet smooth and soft again.  I&#x27;ll use the bottle but probably will not reorder.  My purchase was for my face and neck area.  For body use it&#x27;s a good bargain.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s the only facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve used since discovering it several years ago. Try it.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful. It has helped my hair so much. My hair is not frizzy like it used to be. I use the oil everytime after washing and drying my hair and will never be without it again. So glad to have found this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s one of the few argan oils that does not have an unpleasant scent - I mix a few drops of Bulgarian Rose Oil and use it on my face and hair.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for the seller, but this &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34; oil is no big deal.  Very light, and really does nothing - baby oil does a better job of moisturizing and softening.  Think I&#x27;ll stick with my Bio-Oil.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have very long hair (non processed), down our backs. It is also naturally curly. We love to wear our hair straight for ease of mornings. This is a must for our hair. If I run out, I will not wear my hair straight without it. This stuff is my miracle in a little bottle. I do not have frizz for the first time in my life thanks to the Argan oil. A little goes a long long way.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 years and I like it.  It is getting more expensive than when I first bought it.</li>
    <li> I do think this is a good lubricant, but it is very expensive for the quantity. This is not a moisturizer (there is a difference) and I don&#x27;t think it lubricates any better than 100% olive oil. This brand steams the argan oil to remove or decrease the nutty smell which is ok. I do like that it is all natural and can be used all over the body without clogging pores, but I&#x27;d buy evoo next time not this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on another review that it was &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; moroccanoil. I&#x27;m not discrediting that it&#x27;s not pure but it just made my hair very oil and weighed down. It could also just be my hair type. I will continue to order the other Moroccanoil I was using.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with another at the same time.  While I do like this product, I do not like the pump.  I would prefer a dropper but again that is my personal preference.  This product has no scent at all which is good because some I have tried have a very unpleasant scent.  It does what is says it will and the cost is comparable to others on the market.  If you try it I am sure you will like it.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Eden allure&#x27;s argan oil. I really like this product for my hair and compared to other brands of argan oil , this one doesn&#x27;t smell rancid. However, be careful when you use this on your skin because if you are acne prone then you should only apply this to drier areas of your skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this argan oil because I love the Moroccan Oil for my hair.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any benefit to my skin which is disappointing.</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic for skin and hair. For skin, it helps moisturize and smooth away wrinkles. Works well under make up or alone and it is fragrance-free. For hair, it helps detangle, and add shine. It only takes a drop or two.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, and appears to be 100% argan oil. I&#x27;;d never used it before though so I am a little disappointed because it&#x27;s so thick that it is difficult to distribute through my hair. Overall good product though.</li>
    <li> Have not used it long enough to see what kind of result it does.  The quanity and price were fine.  Only time will tell if it does what it is suppose to.</li>
    <li> I only use this on my skin, and it is wonderful for reducing/removing lines, combating dryness, and maintaining overall texture--all year round. I never even thought to use it on my hair because there are specific hair products on the market with argan oil in them that are much less dense than this. In my experience, this is a skin product first and foremost. I have used it now for over a year and the results have been stellar. I will continue to use this as long as I can find it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find anything extraordinary with it and I&#x27;ve been using for several weeks now.  To me, it&#x27;s just okay!</li>
    <li> Better than most.  But not the &#x27;holy grail&#x27; moroccan oil it claims to be.  Besides, now there are better oils in general...</li>
    <li> I primarily bought this for my face, to help with my acne and acne scars. I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference with my acne but it has definitely helped with the scarring. It is slowly going away.</li>
