<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect sun kissed gleam</li>
      <li>It leaves the face flawless.</li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>Very nice product, and very good price!</li>
      <li>This is a great product for people who cannot use the pinks and reds.  </li>
      <li>I have fair skin so most bronzers tend to look like dirt on my face, but this one is perfect!</li>
      <li>Loved the color and how it compliments my skin</li>
      <li>Great bronzer for the price I paid and make sure you get those coupons.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This bronzer is great and better than most out there.</li>
      <li>If you have more of a light tan than a golden tan, it will probably work perfectly for you.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the perfect shade for just a quick application yet keep a natural look.</li>
      <li>And oddly, this has a great scent!</li>
      <li>, It is very easy to apply with the enclosed brush at a very reasonable price</li>
      <li>but this is still to light.</li>
      <li>I bought two of these to make sure, and I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not the real thing.</li>
      <li>I am a blond, but have never been able to use anything but this for my particular skin tone.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very flexible and can be easily worked with.</li>
      <li>I have a golden tan, and it takes a lot of this Cheekers Bronzer to show up on my cheeks.</li>
      <li>The bronzer itself was nice, but just expect to use a different brush.</li>
      <li>A good color that is not too dark is &amp;</li>
      <li>I will probably not repurchase, but only because I like a more matte face.</li>
      <li>I know that&#x27;s strange, as most powdery products don&#x27;t smell, but when I first opened this, that&#x27;s what I noticed first.  </li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t look quite as dark on my face as it does in it&#x27;s package, but it&#x27;s a nice bronzer for your cheeks, nonetheless.</li>
      <li>I prefer a product with less shimmer, but the color is nice.  </li>
      <li>I really like my bronzer</li>
      <li>thanks so much amazon and cover girl</li>
      <li>It looks nothing like the deep bronze I got from the store, and it wipes right off like dust.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m pretty white</li>
      <li>This is very soft, natural looking blush.</li>
      <li>I apply it with a bigger brush and it is the perfect amount/color to not have that dirty bronzy look when you&#x27;re heavy handed</li>
      <li>The bristle are not stiff enough for bronzer application, and are also very coarse.  </li>

    <li> The color is lighter than I thought it would be. I&#x27;ve got a lot of Irish in me so I&#x27;m pretty white but this is still to light. I think I will save this for winter. A good color that is not too dark is &amp;#34;Iced Cappuccino&amp;#34; without being pink.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin so most bronzers tend to look like dirt on my face, but this one is perfect! It&#x27;s very flexible and can be easily worked with. It&#x27;s the perfect sun kissed gleam I was looking for. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
