      <li>This is my Dad&#x27;s favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>My FAVORITE smell for men.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this on my husband.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While I liked the original better - the aroma has been toned down but still the best</li>
      <li>and I was able to find it effortlessly, have it shipped and can enjoy the perfume</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best sweet musk male scent.</li>
      <li>This time, with the first bottle, the atomizer top had no working hole!  </li>
      <li>Strong woodsy smell...</li>
      <li>but for me this is hands down the best smelling cologne for guys -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This scent is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Received very quickly - enjoy this cologne.  </li>
      <li>Either RL have dropped the quality standards or the product was not an original.  </li>
      <li>Luckily I thought to pluck the cap from the just finished bottle and exchanged the two, and it works just fine.  </li>
      <li>The product exterior looks every bit original except for the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I know he will be so happy he has been out for a long time</li>
      <li>A great gift and arrived sooner than expected.</li>
      <li>Good sized bottle and will last me a couple of years.  </li>
      <li>Thank you for sending the product so quick.</li>
      <li>You can catch this at a decent price on Amazon most times.</li>
      <li>A classic and an absolute favorite, very sexy and masculine scent.</li>
      <li>A refreshing initial blast of eucalyptus reminiscent of old-school shaving cream, followed by a warm set of exotic spices.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>This is appropriate mostly for winter, fall and spring, but it could be warn in the Summer in the evening with one less spray.</li>
      <li>This is a very good perfume, a classic that I was not able to find.</li>
      <li>;-)  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There is really nothing really spicy, sweet, or floral here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the best, just wish it was not so expensive.</li>
      <li>but this was a concern (and I will not be tossing old bottles until I make sure the new bottle &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>decent price, quick delivery and real product.  </li>
      <li>The pure essence of &amp;#34;manly.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Smells OK but not like the original Safari, this one didn&#x27;t last all day long like Safari</li>
      <li>Thanks....</li>
      <li>I really like the smell of.</li>
      <li>This is not the same fragrance as the original.</li>
      <li>Decent longevity and sillage.</li>
      <li>Do not confuse &amp;#34;old-man&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34;; it is most definitely the latter.</li>
      <li>This is a rare find in local stores in my area.</li>
      <li>Pleasant aged leather,juicy citrus,a little soapy and a touch of non sweetened spice.</li>
      <li>The new one is gaining dust in the bathroom cabinets.  </li>
      <li>Hard to find in stores now, but one of my favorite scents.</li>
      <li>This is an old scent but he loves it.</li>
      <li>What can I say, this stuff drives my wife wild.  </li>
      <li>Was much cheaper back when I started.</li>
      <li>You know this is only the second cologne by Ralph Lauren I have acquired...always liked Polo Green</li>
      <li>A slight musk scent that&#x27;s not too sweet or overpowering.</li>
      <li>I only got 1 girl in my life - and she doesnt particularly care about what cologne I wear -</li>
      <li>/&gt;Started off with Old Spice/English leather and graduated to this - I dont like any of the new age colgnes - where they all smell too much like each other</li>
      <li>It seems like it&#x27;s watered down but not same as original.</li>
      <li>This one takes four times the spray to last the two hours while the other takes 1 spray to last the whole day!  </li>

<li> This one takes four times the spray to last the two hours while the other takes 1 spray to last the whole day!  </li>
<li> After that it becomes very mild through three sprays then its gone being a faint skin scent according to the wife.</li>
<li> I have used Safari over the last 10 years and still have a little left from a bottle i purchased at a department store and this one smells different and doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
<li> Either way, I am learning that it is best to buy colognes and perfumes from the departments stores that you trust and pay the extra bucks instead of this little less expensive but poor quality online purchase.  </li>
<li> Just a touch goes a long way.</li>
<li> This was on my shopping list for a very long time</li>
<li> Sad I no longer even use this new one as I used to the old one i.e. almost daily.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s sort of a leathery, dry, outdoorsy type scent.  </li>
<li> , it deserves single star insofar as quality is concerned.</li>
<li> It arrived as expected and is just the same as I pick up in Dillards withought the headache of fighting the crowd, plus a little cheaper.</li>
<li> The problem with this cologne is it seems to hold on for only a few hours.</li>
<li> I usually stick to Lacoste Red, but I think this will be my alternative smell.  </li>
<li> This one hardly lasts two hours before there is almost no fragrance left, the other one lasts all day.  </li>
<li> The only thing is it&#x27;s hard to get.</li>
<li> This is one of the few places he can get this cologne</li>

    <li> Bought as a gift for my husband.  Loves the cologne.  Was delivered on time as stated.</li>
    <li> Always has been one of my favorite scents!!</li>
    <li> This is not the same fragrance as the original. I have used Safari over the last 10 years and still have a little left from a bottle i purchased at a department store and this one smells different and doesn&#x27;t last as long. It seems like it&#x27;s watered down but not same as original. Tried contacting seller about this but no reply.</li>
    <li> This is an old scent but he loves it. The price was also great. This is one of the few places he can get this cologne</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne by Ralph</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered very happy y</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne! A great gift and arrived sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite cologne. Have been using it for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite he gets it for christmas I know he will be so happy he has been out for a long time and this is the only place to get it</li>
    <li> My father has always been a fan of this cologne and I got him some more for Christmas. Very nice smelling.</li>
    <li> Safari my favorite parfume.never stop use safari for me is the best one.you can try it.later u tell me what happens.</li>
    <li> Good sized bottle and will last me a couple of years.  What can I say, this stuff drives my wife wild.  ;-)  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love this on my husband.  He gets a lot of compliments and questions as to what it is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years now. Was much cheaper back when I started. You can catch this at a decent price on Amazon most times.</li>
    <li> Great product. The only thing is it&#x27;s hard to get. Thank God for this site.</li>
    <li> The product exterior looks every bit original except for the fragrance.  Either RL have dropped the quality standards or the product was not an original.  I have one I bought 5 years ago and can compare the strength of the scent and the duration of the scent sprayed on either hand.  This one hardly lasts two hours before there is almost no fragrance left, the other one lasts all day.  This one takes four times the spray to last the two hours while the other takes 1 spray to last the whole day!  Sad I no longer even use this new one as I used to the old one i.e. almost daily.  The new one is gaining dust in the bathroom cabinets.  Either way, I am learning that it is best to buy colognes and perfumes from the departments stores that you trust and pay the extra bucks instead of this little less expensive but poor quality online purchase.  I give it a 3 star for the price otherwise, it deserves single star insofar as quality is concerned.</li>
    <li> I love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stays with you all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the compliments from all --especially the ladies -- are never ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best cologne on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sort of a leathery, dry, outdoorsy type scent.  Safari is a very fitting name for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is really nothing really spicy, sweet, or floral here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good fragrance, but just not my type of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it but would not buy again.  Not b/c of its quality, but just not my type of scent as I said.</li>
    <li> Been wearing it for 20yrs. still get compliments of all ages.</li>
    <li> Perhaps the best scent ever formulated. Timeless, it lasts but is not overbearing. I&#x27;m complemented on it constantly. I only give it 4 stars because of the fact they discontinued the after shave several years back and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me in Ralph had a brain blip and tanked this.</li>
    <li> This is the best, just wish it was not so expensive.</li>
    <li> Great product and service.  My son loves this fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is a rare find in local stores in my area. I have always received compliments on its fragrance, and I&#x27;ve been a Safari guy fir years. A slight musk scent that&#x27;s not too sweet or overpowering.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product .</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores now, but one of my favorite scents. Very happy.</li>
    <li> You know this is only the second cologne by Ralph Lauren I have acquired...always liked Polo Green/Original.Safari I really like the smell of.Very firm in it&#x27;s eucalyptus base.Pleasant aged leather,juicy citrus,a little soapy and a touch of non sweetened spice.The problem with this cologne is it seems to hold on for only a few hours.After that it becomes very mild through three sprays then its gone being a faint skin scent according to the wife.Six sprays now were talking but it&#x27;s just pissing away money compared to Aramis EDT...unless I was gifted Safari.Safari smells wonderful but the dollar signs just aren&#x27;t there .</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE smell for men. The pure essence of &amp;#34;manly.&amp;#34; Rawr!!!!</li>
    <li> An excellent cologne. Decent longevity and sillage. A refreshing initial blast of eucalyptus reminiscent of old-school shaving cream, followed by a warm set of exotic spices. This is appropriate mostly for winter, fall and spring, but it could be warn in the Summer in the evening with one less spray. In addition, not that it effects the quality of the juice, but the case and the bottle are works of art and will immediately stand out in your collection. This could be worn by anyone over 18. Do not confuse &amp;#34;old-man&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34;; it is most definitely the latter.</li>
    <li> This was on my shopping list for a very long time and I was able to find it effortlessly, have it shipped and can enjoy the perfume</li>
    <li> This scent is fantastic.  I bought it as a replacement for Eddie Bauer adventurer, and it has lived up to my expectations.  The scent will last 8+ hours with just a spritz.</li>
    <li> Smells OK but not like the original Safari, this one didn&#x27;t last all day long like Safari i know that smells on clothes days after use.</li>
    <li> Safari is my husband&#x27;s and my favorite men&#x27;s scent.  This is a great fragrance for anyone who likes a spicy cologne.</li>
    <li> I love it. It smells so good!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift. A classic and an absolute favorite, very sexy and masculine scent. Just a touch goes a long way. I hope they never do away with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad for Christmas, because I remember my cousin loving it.  So I happened to smell it myself once it arrived and decided I needed to get one for me.  I usually stick to Lacoste Red, but I think this will be my alternative smell.  Can&#x27;t go wrong here.  Strong woodsy smell...a man&#x27;s man scent as my wife would describe it.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product. I wish they would continue to create this cologne. It&#x27;s the best sweet musk male scent. Almost like a honey chocolate with spice. PERFECT.</li>
    <li> I only got 1 girl in my life - and she doesnt particularly care about what cologne I wear - but for me this is hands down the best smelling cologne for guys -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started off with Old Spice/English leather and graduated to this - I dont like any of the new age colgnes - where they all smell too much like each other&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I liked the original better - the aroma has been toned down but still the best</li>
    <li> This is my Dad&#x27;s favorite cologne. It arrived as expected and is just the same as I pick up in Dillards withought the headache of fighting the crowd, plus a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is a mixed review.  I have been getting this for years.  In fact, decades.  Ever since Dunhill stopped making Blend 30.  It is a very nice cologne and I get compliments.  All the purchases have been 5s... decent price, quick delivery and real product.  This time, with the first bottle, the atomizer top had no working hole!  It was probably out of alignment but could not be used.  Luckily I thought to pluck the cap from the just finished bottle and exchanged the two, and it works just fine.  I am not going to open all the bottles I bought but this was a concern (and I will not be tossing old bottles until I make sure the new bottle &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Received very quickly - enjoy this cologne.  Thanks....</li>
    <li> Good price,fast delivery</li>
    <li> Good deal fast service !!!</li>
