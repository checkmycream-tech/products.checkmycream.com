### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Marvis makes the best toothpaste.</li>
      <li>But it makes my mouth happy!</li>
      <li>very good quality and good flavor.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>Very good product, and smells good :)</li>
      <li>The best toothpaste available.</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste!</li>
      <li>I like the Licorice one, but my wife hates the smell, so I decided to play nice and try this one.</li>
      <li>Leaves you fresh with a great taste.</li>
      <li>Marvis makes great toothpaste - Strong Mint and Whitening Mint are both fantastic.  </li>
      <li>As I have mentioned before, I love this toothpaste because of it&#x27;s creamy texture and taste.</li>
      <li>I am a fan of the Marvis brand of toothpaste and have tried most of the flavors.</li>
      <li>but the Aquatic Mint is closer to a Colgate taste which I like better.</li>
      <li>It is kind of sweet as others have pointed out.</li>
      <li>Marvis Aquatic Mint toothpaste is my favorite toothpaste and recommended by my Dentist, It is a very fresh scent and although it does not have fluoride, it can take the place of Listerine.</li>
      <li>I love Marvis toothpaste because it&#x27;s not overly sweet - the flavor on the packaging is strong.</li>
      <li>; and it&#x27;s a much more rich, sweet flavor.  </li>
      <li>The regular mint one is great though.</li>
      <li>It is imported, has a great taste (the aquatic mint and ginger are my favorites), and leaves your mouth feeling cleaner and more fresh than any other toothpaste I have tried.</li>
      <li>I feel like a snob ordering special toothpaste from Europe, but let me tell you...</li>
      <li>nice refreshing paste not what i expected from aquatic but very icy and fresh im going to try jasmine mint since there so many great reviews on it</li>
      <li>So clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>Use very comfortable, fresh and natural</li>
      <li>Classic Strong Mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The name made me think to myself &amp;#34;Bright, fresh, etc...</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the higher price if you want to treat yourself and impress any houseguests you may have.</li>
      <li>They got it right the first time and aren&#x27;t messing with it.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t what you might expect when you think &amp;#34;Aquatic,&amp;#34; though, so be aware.  </li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t really like how this tastes.</li>
      <li>I get this straight out of the dentist feeling.</li>
      <li>leaves your breath smelling better than any other toothpaste i&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>After spending entirely too much time looking at massive aisles of tooth&amp;#34;pastes&amp;#34; in stores only to find that most brands define tooth&amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; loosely and refuse to spell out exactly what you&#x27;re buying, I found Marvis and haven&#x27;t bought another brand since.</li>
      <li>not as \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; as most american toothpastes the flavor lasts a while and your whole mouth feels clean.. it wont froth as much as regular pastes do and, a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;aquatic mint&amp;#34; is a little odd, so I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend it for your first Marvis product -- go for one of the more traditional flavors like the green, which is a more traditional mint:</li>

<li> This is a cooler mint than the other Marvis Mint.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s painfull to use any other toothpaste when I run out.</li>
<li> a bonus, the tube is less than 100ml, so you can travel with it in your carry on luggage and not be hassled by TSA.</li>
<li> but it is less expensive to order online.</li>
<li> as promised, and not some creepy hybrid of toothpaste and gel, or worse, just gel.</li>
<li> ill gt aquatic mint again</li>
<li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Marvis Aquatic Mint toothpaste is my favorite toothpaste and recommended by my Dentist, It is a very fresh scent and although it does not have fluoride, it can take the place of Listerine. I have tried the Jasmine toothpaste also and I like the taste but the Aquatic Mint is closer to a Colgate taste which I like better. There are stores that carry this brand but it is less expensive to order online. I recommend getting three to save on shipping costs. The order is also delivered within a week and is returnable.</li>
    <li> Love it!! 5 stars*****</li>
    <li> leaves your breath smelling better than any other toothpaste i&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> nice refreshing paste not what i expected from aquatic but very icy and fresh im going to try jasmine mint since there so many great reviews on it i dontvthink ill gt aquatic mint again jasmine or cinnamon</li>
    <li> Very good product, and smells good :)</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t really like how this tastes. It is kind of sweet as others have pointed out. The regular mint one is great though.</li>
    <li> As I have mentioned before, I love this toothpaste because of it&#x27;s creamy texture and taste. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a cooler mint than the other Marvis Mint. I love Marvis toothpaste because it&#x27;s not overly sweet - the flavor on the packaging is strong. I also like that it is actually toothPASTE as promised, and not some creepy hybrid of toothpaste and gel, or worse, just gel. After spending entirely too much time looking at massive aisles of tooth&amp;#34;pastes&amp;#34; in stores only to find that most brands define tooth&amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; loosely and refuse to spell out exactly what you&#x27;re buying, I found Marvis and haven&#x27;t bought another brand since. It&#x27;s never &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;. They got it right the first time and aren&#x27;t messing with it.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste! It&#x27;s painfull to use any other toothpaste when I run out. Leaves you fresh with a great taste.</li>
    <li> not as \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; as most american toothpastes the flavor lasts a while and your whole mouth feels clean.. it wont froth as much as regular pastes do and, a little goes a long way.</li>

It is imported, has a great taste (the aquatic mint and ginger are my favorites), and leaves your mouth feeling cleaner and more fresh than any other toothpaste I have tried. Definitely worth the higher price if you want to treat yourself and impress any houseguests you may have. A+</li>
    <li> Use very comfortable, fresh and natural</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste available. A little goes a long way and the mint continues to freshen your breath after brushing is complete.</li>
    <li> This is the finest toothpaste in all the land. I feel like a snob ordering special toothpaste from Europe, but let me tell you...there&#x27;s nothing in the US that compares.</li>
    <li> Marvis makes great toothpaste - Strong Mint and Whitening Mint are both fantastic.  This isn&#x27;t what you might expect when you think &amp;#34;Aquatic,&amp;#34; though, so be aware.  The name made me think to myself &amp;#34;Bright, fresh, etc...&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s a much more rich, sweet flavor.  If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, though, go for it!</li>
    <li> What can I say? I am a fan of the Marvis brand of toothpaste and have tried most of the flavors. I like the Licorice one, but my wife hates the smell, so I decided to play nice and try this one. The &amp;#34;aquatic mint&amp;#34; is a little odd, so I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend it for your first Marvis product -- go for one of the more traditional flavors like the green, which is a more traditional mint: Classic Strong Mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, the tube is less than 100ml, so you can travel with it in your carry on luggage and not be hassled by TSA.</li>
    <li> very good quality and good flavor.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive. But it makes my mouth happy! I get this straight out of the dentist feeling. So clean and fresh. I will be buying it again, no doubt.</li>
