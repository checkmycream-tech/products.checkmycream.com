### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I was so happy!!</li>
      <li>The pads are impregnated with salicylic acid, an excellent exfolliant that works fantastically well.    </li>
      <li>If you are looking for blackhead removal, try biore strips because I have had great luck with those.</li>
      <li>I find it works best if you kind of \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; the target area.</li>
      <li>I use a washcloth afterward, wrung out with very warm water, and it seems to take off the residue while cleaning up the rest of my face.    </li>
      <li>Just take exceptionally good care of the attachment head, there are no replacements or work-arounds for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>but nothing seemed to work exceptionally well.    </li>
      <li>This product did a great job at cleaning my face, but I think it could have had more abrasive pads.</li>
      <li>We are very pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>there are more cost effective alternatives!</li>
      <li>I think your paying more for the packaging then the product!   </li>
      <li>This gadget is amazing.</li>
      <li>I tried using it beforehand without doing so and the pads got too oily to do their work effectively.</li>
      <li>This device works nicely.</li>
      <li>What I liked about it is,it also works as an Exfoliate, along with clearing up my skin.   </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Blackhead Scrub, which is relatively effective for me, but I was looking forward to this blackhead &#x27;eraser&#x27; that would take care of the problem</li>
      <li>I have used every kind of scrub that you can think of but</li>
      <li>it is nice</li>
      <li>All you need to do put a pad on the top, get the pad a bit damp, twist it to turn it on, and you&#x27;re good.</li>
      <li>If I pull my bottom lip up to stretch out my chin, the device works great to clean the pores.</li>
      <li>Both clean pores very effectively.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and very refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Even though, I didn&#x27;t feel any actual discomfort, I thought it best to not use the product again.</li>
      <li>This is impressive considering what I have tried over the last year.  </li>
      <li>I think she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t have that many blackheads, and they aren&#x27;t that noticable, so</li>
      <li>I have read many reviews</li>
      <li>Hope this helps :-)</li>
      <li>Hope this helps :-)6.7 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Eraser\\&quot; although it does not remove my blackheads (imagine my dismay after 3 weeks of trying my pores were still as clogged as ever), the pads were a bit more abrasive, which I like.  </li>
      <li>You purchase refillpads that attaches on top of the unit.</li>
      <li>You put a medacated pad on the top , which velcros on.</li>
      <li>This product DID get rid of most of my blackheads.  </li>
      <li>This one seems to have more salicylic acid on the pads than the wave</li>
      <li>On top of it you attach medicated pads.</li>
      <li>I have tried many scrubs, creams, gels, etc.</li>
      <li>This is an OK product.</li>
      <li>Sure, it exfoliates, but as for the minimul blackheads I encounter, it did nothing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt; - The cleaning pads are easy to get on and off, very easy...</li>
      <li>Quick and easy, and a good way to apply some blackhead fighting medicine before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This kit is FAR superior!</li>
      <li>I am 26 with pretty fair skin</li>
      <li>it worked great for me, don&#x27;t expect a miracle or everything to disappear over night, but in 2 weeks my skin was clear again, so it worked for me, love it.</li>
      <li>If you have a huge blackhead problem, I&#x27;d just advise giving it a chance to work, and that means more than just a day or two.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and very effective in keeping her skin clear of blackheads and blemishes.</li>
      <li>br /&gt; - Ergonomic unit, easy to hold as you use&lt;br</li>
      <li>The item is compact, the pads are easy to put on and off</li>
      <li>, it feels refreshing and clean, but temporary.  </li>
      <li>so easy to do it in the shower or just before you go out..</li>
      <li>do think the pads alone are pretty nice.  </li>
      <li>In our house, the second Wave has died while the original Blackhead eraser is still going strong like the Energizer Bunny!!!</li>
      <li>This product, however, took a huge three inch chunk off of the discoloration.  </li>
      <li>Neutrogena ARE BOTH Johnson &amp; Johnson Companies AND the refill pads fit devices across brand lines.</li>
      <li>, it leaves your skin feeling tingly, smooth and silky.  </li>
      <li>My husband liked it very well.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
      <li>A loofah and a good sudsy facial soap would probably be better, and would be cheaper.</li>
      <li>I have very large pores and tend to get many blackheads and did not see any difference what so ever using this product.  </li>
      <li>** Original</li>
      <li>&quot; do is clean your nose/face -</li>
      <li>I think that this works okay, but the design is kind of overkill - you could accomplish the same thing by just using a scrub or a loofah type of device.  </li>
      <li>It does clean my face well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit after use my skin does feel pretty good, but not any more than just using a regular wash cloth.  </li>
      <li>you already own the Wave, I would suggest skipping the Clean and Clear Blackhead Eraser Kit.</li>
      <li>However, when I stopped scrubbing I found that my chest burned a bit and was bright red.  </li>
      <li>Can be very drying to your skin if used more often.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is an overall good product that targets those stubborn blackheads and yet doesn&#x27;t overdry your skin.</li>
      <li>(You&#x27;ll want to avoid too much pressure that can encourage your skin to produce more oils)   </li>
      <li>but I find it best to wait a couple days in between treatments as the Eraser leaves my skin pretty raw.  </li>
      <li>Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s Blackhead Eraser Kit is a well packaged product with neutral design and coloring that makes it suitable as a gift item for men and women alike.  </li>
      <li>But when I looked into the first available mirror, I was startled to see my nose had turned a bright shade of (sunburned) red.</li>
      <li>I think this eraser is excellent for teens who need a little more encouragement to stick to a daily cleansing routine.</li>
      <li>It does not specify how long to use the product, so you run and gun until you think you are good.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this kit, which is reasonably priced and easy to use, to any parent of a teenager.</li>
      <li>It provides nothing that you couldn&#x27;t achieve, more cheaply, with a bit of vigorous scrubbing with your favorite face cloth or with a slightly abrasive cream, followed by application of acne medication.</li>
      <li>It gets your skin very even and smooth aswell which is a bonus.</li>
      <li>If not, this might be worth the purchase.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The medicated pads are simple to attach (just like velcro), lather well, and contain an effective cleanser.</li>
      <li>and I love it so far.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have many blackheads these days, but they pop up enough that the Clean and Clear Blackhead Eraser Kit sounded appealing.</li>
      <li>It might not make all your blackheads magically disappear like some people seem to be expecting, but it does a much better job than other products I have tried.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed the process itself, especially the whipping up of the rich lather, as well as the vibrating sensation from the included gadget (but let us not go there).</li>
      <li>a 4 star for the packaging, the way this product is used, and it lead me in the right direction about the Salicylic acid.   </li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t lather up right away    </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of blackheads, but this cleaner really leaves my face feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>The battery operation doesn&#x27;t really do anything extraordinary.  </li>
      <li>This may not be such a big deal though since the pads work with water to stir up into a foam, which aids greatly in cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It ranged from very severe to mild acne.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a problem with blackheads or acne (anymore), so I can&#x27;t evaluate it for removing or reducing those conditions, but I can say that it makes my skin feel fresh, clean and very soft each time I use it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice, small, palm-sized gadget, battery operated and easy to use.</li>
      <li>The Clean &amp; Clear blackhead eraser has generally made my face look very fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have many blackheads, just occasional ones and this eraser</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that the combined use has given better results overall.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say this C&amp;C is pretty much more of the same.  </li>
      <li>While it may work better for others, it simply did not for me, and I would not recommend it.</li>
      <li>My only caution would be to make sure you don&#x27;t oversaturate the medicated pad or it will wash away the cleanser then drip all over the place while you try to use it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really lather up like it says it should, &amp; it also doesn&#x27;t really feel as though skin is truely being exfoliated.  </li>
      <li>Be consistent with its usage, and you will see the difference within the week.</li>
      <li>I like using it because it makes my skin feel fresh like any face-scrub, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending too much money on it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> im really embarassed to say that I bought this, but ive tried every gimmick and this one works.</li>
    <li> While I never get zits or blackheads, I have been using a silicone product in my hair for the last year to get it pin straight.  There is no product like it for my particular hair (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried everything!) But of course with every \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; thing in life there is always a downside.  The miracle hair product leaves me with a broken out chest.  I have tried many scrubs, creams, gels, etc. but nothing seemed to work exceptionally well.    Since Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s active ingredient is salicylic acid, a product that is in my daily scrub I use on my chest, I expected nothing different than I was currently using.  I was further disappointed when I put on a pad and turned the machine on and all it did was a sad little vibration.  I used it to scrub my chest and again found myself disappointed as it did not feel as rough as the scrub I was currently using and couldn&#x27;t fathom it doing anything productive.  However, when I stopped scrubbing I found that my chest burned a bit and was bright red.  I was shocked!  It scrubbed a lot better than I gave the little guy credit for.  While my scrub has large exfoliating pieces this product has very fine and small scrubbers which actually did a better job than I would have ever guessed.    And now for the kicker:  My zits/blackheads cleared up!  This is impressive considering what I have tried over the last year.  Another added bonus: on my face I have an area of my face that is badly discolored from sun exposure and all the special expensive scrubs I have purchased from \\&quot;fine department stores\\&quot; and online have done little to change it.  This product, however, took a huge three inch chunk off of the discoloration.  I will be working and working to see if I can get the rest off but I find it best to wait a couple days in between treatments as the Eraser leaves my skin pretty raw.  Overall:  Pros: It works to clear up zits and blackheads AND can remove skin discoloration!!!    WARNING: Use at night or when you will not be immediately exposing your skin to the public since your skin may turn bright red temporarily.  Additionally, I would not use this product daily as it may be too harsh for most people to use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have many blackheads these days, but they pop up enough that the Clean and Clear Blackhead Eraser Kit sounded appealing. After using it, however, I have a hard time noting any difference between this and a similar product (the Wave) for skin care from Neutrogena. They both have the same little battery-operated contraption and the same kind of pads that you attach to it. The result is the same, too, namely the feeling that your skin is smoother, cleaner, and more radiant. In fact, the little devices are interchangeable. Is the same true of the pads? It seems like it from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already own the Wave, I would suggest skipping the Clean and Clear Blackhead Eraser Kit. If not, this might be worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian W. Fairbanks</li>
    <li> This is an overall good product that targets those stubborn blackheads and yet doesn&#x27;t overdry your skin. Some products make your skin peel and it looks even worse after a few days. Clean and Clear doesn&#x27;t leave your skin too dry and it doesn&#x27;t feel tight. Give it a try and you will like how your skin feels.</li>
    <li> This is a nifty little device! All you need to do put a pad on the top, get the pad a bit damp, twist it to turn it on, and you&#x27;re good. I just went in small circular motions 2 times over my face; when I was done my face felt good.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Neutrogena Wave a month ago.  I picked up a blackhead eraser refill pack on a whim because the Wave refills were out of stock, and discovered that while the pads provide different results, the systems are completely interchangeable.  I&#x27;d recommend purchasing the Wave (it&#x27;s about 7 dollars cheaper) and alternating the use of the different kinds of pads.  The Wave pads are intended for daily use, while the Eraser instructions say 3-4 times a week or so.  I&#x27;ve found that the combined use has given better results overall.</li>
    <li> UPDATE March 2, 2013...The prices of these discontinued kits have be absolutely crazy and cost effective alternatives have been offered like the original Wave. The Wave is so much cuter and had a massive advertising AND commercials compared to this kit. Guess what? This kit is FAR superior! In our house, the second Wave has died while the original Blackhead eraser is still going strong like the Energizer Bunny!!! I STILL wouldn&#x27;t pay 40 BUCKS for it but it would be worth at least 20 BUCKS. As other reviewers have mentioned, the refill pads are hard to find BUT the various Neutrogena pads do fit and there are CVS versions available in some areas. When all else fails you can use your own cleanser on well cleaned recycled pads. Just take exceptionally good care of the attachment head, there are no replacements or work-arounds for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this an upgrade to a 4.0 - 4.5 STARS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********* Original Review*********&lt;br /&gt;Yes this works...it&#x27;s discontinued...there are more cost effective alternatives! Catch an original Neutrogena Wave for about ten bucks and Gentle Exfoliating Refill Pads at a decent price-seven bucks- and you&#x27;re good to go. The Blackhead Eraser pads AND the Gentle Exfoliating pads each have 1% Salicylic Acid - the acne fighting medication to be used every other day so you don&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI Clean and Clear AND Neutrogena ARE BOTH Johnson &amp; Johnson Companies AND the refill pads fit devices across brand lines. The Clean and Clear Surge uses Citric Acid for skin brightening and doesn&#x27;t have Salicylic Acid :(  Discontinued devices and scarce refill pads are running the prices SKY-HIGH. Look around and compare 8-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get a Wave you can also use a dab of another Salicylic Acid based cleanser/scrub on a cleaned-recycled wave pad.

    <li> Blackheads have never been a big problem for me, per se, (you would have to get up close to see them)  but I jumped at the chance to see how far Cosmetic Science had advanced since my teenage years.     You see, as far as I am concerned, my whole generation had been lied to by the powerful Military/Industrial/Pimple Med Complex of the 80&#x27;s, having been promised beautiful unblemished skin countless times by these companies. And even though we went along and spent lots of money on those foul smelling creams, not once did I ever see or hear about anyone ever successfully defeating a single pimple.     Of course, that was a long time ago, and most of us got through adolescence relatively unscathed (unless you look real close) and I got to wondering if maybe enough time had passed for science to finally catch up to all those empty promises.     So, once the package arrived, I eagerly opened up the package and followed the simple instructions. A few minutes later, I was happily applying the product all over my face. I really enjoyed the process itself, especially the whipping up of the rich lather, as well as the vibrating sensation from the included gadget (but let us not go there). After I had finished, my face actually felt a lot cleaner than it had in long time.    A couple of hours later, I started to notice some furtive glances from people around me. Could it be my radiant complexion? This I had to see  for myself! But when I looked into the first available mirror, I was startled to see my nose had turned a bright shade of (sunburned) red. I checked for blackheads and although they seemed to have disappeared, the pores left behind were HUGE and VERY noticeable.    Even though, I didn&#x27;t feel any actual discomfort, I thought it best to not use the product again. I suspect the reaction was due more to my weird skin type than to the product itself.    Would you have the same reaction? Probably not, but I can not, in good faith, recommend this item without letting you know about the unfortunate side affects I had to put up with.     So now you know.      EDIT - it&#x27;s been 10 days since I used the product, and my skin is back to normal, so there&#x27;s no permanent damage to report (which is always a plus!)</li>
    <li> This is a decent product.  Basically it&#x27;s a hand-held motor that you slap a small face-cleaning pad on, and it vibrates on your face to clean blackheads out of your pores.  Well, I don&#x27;t know about removing blackheads, but it does slough all the dead skin off your face. I have sensitive skin, so it left me red and blotchy afterward, but my skin definitely felt a lot softer and smoother. And although it didn&#x27;t actually remove any blackheads, I had an easier time removing them the old fashioned way (squeezing them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint with this product is that the pads they give you come in a sealed package.  After opening the package, there is no way to seal it up again and the pads inevitably dry out, making them essentially worthless unless you put them in a zip lock bag.  This may not be such a big deal though since the pads work with water to stir up into a foam, which aids greatly in cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it leaves your skin feeling tingly, smooth and silky.  So, it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
    <li> I think that this works okay, but the design is kind of overkill - you could accomplish the same thing by just using a scrub or a loofah type of device.  The battery operation doesn&#x27;t really do anything extraordinary.  It also seems like kind of a waste to use the little pads once and then throw away - you&#x27;d go through them pretty quickly.  I also don&#x27;t think that you could use this everyday, as it would probably make your skin pretty raw.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this item-it&#x27;s easy to use and very effective in keeping her skin clear of blackheads and blemishes.</li>
    <li> Well, I did not purchase this through Amazon but I saw it on sale for 6.49 at Rite-Aid. For this reason I decided to go with it over Biore strips. What an awful choice that was. The instructions were really bare. It does not specify how long to use the product, so you run and gun until you think you are good. That is bad considering you are using an acne removal product.  This leads to the biggest problem. It does not remove blackheads. Its more of a novelty in a well presented box but does not do anything acne related. It resembles a miniature car buffer. The pads did not fit correctly in mine and took awhile to keep them from sliding out of the vibrating stick. The pads are also scented with a cheap perfume, which makes it awkward for male use.  It also left a sticky residue on my face that took 3 thorough washes to remove it all. If you are looking for blackhead removal, try biore strips because I have had great luck with those. Only use this if you are looking for dry skin removal on your face, but then again you can use a loofah. There are no advantages to purchasing this.</li>
    <li> I used this , it does it work and clear the blackheads but it leaves the skin very dry. Mine was an oily skin,and it left it heavily dry.   Though the blackheads were removed , so try to use for few less minutes</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited to buy this, as I&#x27;ve suffered from seemingly incurable blackheads for years. While this product made my skin soft and shiny, it did absolutely nothing for my blackhead problem. The second time I used the blackhead eraser, my skin was left dry, scaly and painful in the areas I gave special attention to. While it may work better for others, it simply did not for me, and I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have read many reviews and I don&#x27;t think they are doing this product justice. I am 26 with pretty fair skin and I have had blackheads on my chin and nose for years, (as long as I can remember).After using this for only 3 days, I have already seen an improvement and not just a little improvement, but a major one. My blackheads have not completely been removed, but they sure are close to being gone. I understand it may not work for all people but I have and will continue to recommend this product to anyone who will listen. P.S. If you are gonna try it, get it here on Amazon, because I paid 3 times the price when I bought it in the store.</li>
    <li> I have the typical blackhead problem of the oily T-zone plus the blackhead trap on my chin. Granted, they&#x27;re tiny, but if you don&#x27;t keep after them, you get stretched pores and BIGGER blackheads.    This device works nicely. It&#x27;s a nice, small, palm-sized gadget, battery operated and easy to use. The pads are impregnated with salicylic acid, an excellent exfolliant that works fantastically well.    The pads attach with velcro. Wet &#x27;em and scrub away. The device works with that vibrating mode, similar to the Neutrogena device I have.    I find it works best if you kind of \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; the target area. Not so much with your fingers, but by facial movements. If I pull my bottom lip up to stretch out my chin, the device works great to clean the pores. Same thing with my nose in the whorls where blackheads seem to multiply.    After several days, my skin looks pink and healthy, not at all dry, and my skin is somewhat sensitive. The blackheads aren&#x27;t \\&quot;black\\&quot; anymore, so it clearly works on that problem. I use a washcloth afterward, wrung out with very warm water, and it seems to take off the residue while cleaning up the rest of my face.    The only caveat I&#x27;d issue is to be careful using this with any other product with salicylic acid. Overdo it, and you might get a bad case of the peels!    I like it. If you have a huge blackhead problem, I&#x27;d just advise giving it a chance to work, and that means more than just a day or two.</li>
    <li> Overall, this blackhead eraser cleans your face well and leaves it soft and smooth. The medicated pads are simple to attach (just like velcro), lather well, and contain an effective cleanser. For my older than teen skin, the cleanser was a little drying but not too much. I don&#x27;t have many blackheads, just occasional ones and this eraser did the job of shrinking those down.   The eraser device is little more than a vibrator that you spin in circles on your face. You need to control how much pressure you use to get the amount of cleaning you want. (You&#x27;ll want to avoid too much pressure that can encourage your skin to produce more oils)   I&#x27;d recommend that when you start to wash your face, you wet the pad and start lathering it in the palm of your hand. If you apply it directly to your face, water will run down your face - a little messy.  I think this eraser is excellent for teens who need a little more encouragement to stick to a daily cleansing routine. The device adds a little more importance to face washing and feels pretty good - almost like a little massage. I&#x27;ll be getting one for my stepdaughter - I think she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> The results from this were not what had been expected. Skin was smoother but did not see any improvement in the removal of blackheads.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Clean &amp; Clear is a brand I trust. Blackhead Eraser, as with any other Clean &amp; Clear product, is effective. You can feel it working. Be consistent with its usage, and you will see the difference within the week.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money this was...It seems like it is hit or miss with this product - obviously I whiffed :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have that many blackheads, and they aren&#x27;t that noticable, so I thought that the eraser would work well for me. Unfortunately it has not, and I have been using it for about 10 days now. I see absolutely no noticeable difference, and the only thing this product \\&quot;may\\&quot; do is clean your nose/face - that is about it. It \\&quot;erases\\&quot; absolutely nothing...</li>
    <li> I used to use a face loofah with Proactiv Solutions body wash, it&#x27;s all the same product in different containers.    I had mild to moderate acne on my forehead, cheeks and chin and my skin is normal to dry.    I&#x27;m going to get straight to the point:    Pros:  -- removes bumps after the first few uses  -- vibrations reduces puffiness under eyes  -- clears up acne and acne scars  -- leaves skin soft by removing dead skin  -- easy to put together and use  -- cheaper than Proactiv Solutions  -- works faster than Proactiv Solutions  -- medicated pads not rough to use on face  -- no harsh smells from the medicated pads  -- simple and handheld, not bulky  -- refills are not expensive  -- no product or time limit on how long to use the eraser      Cons:  -- dries out skin (I suggest you use moisterizer afterwards)  -- doesn&#x27;t lather up right away    THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ACNE AND A WANT FOR A SIMPLE BEAUTY REGIMINE!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has used this product a few times now, so the review is all hers:  This Clean &amp; Clear product doesn&#x27;t erase blackheads. The feeling it gives you after you use it is nice, it feels refreshing and clean, but temporary.  I wouldn&#x27;t say I have \\&quot;problem skin\\&quot;, I have normal skin, and normal blemishes, and this just doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does. I like using it because it makes my skin feel fresh like any face-scrub, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending too much money on it.</li>
    <li> Sure, it exfoliates, but as for the minimul blackheads I encounter, it did nothing.  I didn&#x27;t experience that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling afterwards, as I do with a certain mudmask.  A loofah and a good sudsy facial soap would probably be better, and would be cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product is a vibrating face cleaning unit much like the \\&quot;wave\\&quot;. You purchase refillpads that attaches on top of the unit. You wet it and clean/scrub your face with it. This one seems to have more salicylic acid on the pads than the wave but ultimately, it is the same product made by a different company.</li>
    <li> The item is compact, the pads are easy to put on and off but overall it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have much oomph to it.  I sometimes use Aeeno single circle cleansing pads and they seem to work the same if not better then this product.  I have very large pores and tend to get many blackheads and did not see any difference what so ever using this product.  It does clean my face well but I wouldn&#x27;t specify this as a blackhead eraser.  Just another cleaning item with a battery for you to be even lazier in washing your face.  While I use it, I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this item to a friend.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start with the pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt; - Ergonomic unit, easy to hold as you use&lt;br /&gt; - The cleaning pads are easy to get on and off, very easy... but they don&#x27;t come off when you&#x27;re using it.&lt;br /&gt; - The solution on the pads smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the begative points&lt;br /&gt; - The replacement pads are not readily available at my regular shopping haunts (like Target)&lt;br /&gt; - The replacement pads are a bit expensive, for what you are getting&lt;br /&gt; - And the flat base with the pad on it is difficult to get all over your nose, where most blackheads occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 2 weeks, every night and was not impressed.  At least I did not notice any difference in my complexion.</li>
    <li> I bought the Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser kit for my 14 yo son, who had not had consistent results using the Wave, a competing skin cleansing kit. I can really tell the difference when he uses the Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser consistently. When he misses a few days, the results show up on his face a few days later. I would recommend this kit, which is reasonably priced and easy to use, to any parent of a teenager. It is a good first step for a relatively small price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some results are noticeable within a few days, I&#x27;d suggest giving it a week or two before deciding if this product is for you. Don&#x27;t give up too soon...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he is always complaining about blackheads and no scrubs or cleansers seem to work on them. I thought I would give it a try too and I love it so far. It makes your skin super smooth and makes your pores appear much less noticeable. It might not make all your blackheads magically disappear like some people seem to be expecting, but it does a much better job than other products I have tried. We are both pleasantly surprised with the results, even after the first use. I would not however recommend this product to people with really sensitive skin. It can make your skin a little dry, so use a good moisturizer afterward!</li>
    <li> I have used one other product similar to this made by Neutrogena. Both products work very much in the same way. Both clean pores very effectively. The package suggests 3 uses weekly, which may be a little taxing on sensitive skin. I suggest starting with once and working up to more frequently. I withheld one star because this particular product was a little harder on my skin than the aforementioned competitors&#x27; product, but didn&#x27;t clean any better. My face was blotchy and felt dry and tight for a while after the treatments.  If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, it probably won&#x27;t bother you at all. My husband liked it very well.  You truly can see a difference in just one treatment. It can even be used if you have make-up on but works a little better if you remove it first. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product for a reasonable price and takes very little time to use. My only caution would be to make sure you don&#x27;t oversaturate the medicated pad or it will wash away the cleanser then drip all over the place while you try to use it.</li>
    <li> As a teen, I looked forward to &#x27;middle age&#x27; when pimples and blackheads would no longer be a problem.  Unfortunately, here I am at that point in my life and I&#x27;ve gained wrinkles without losing those darned blackheads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Blackhead Scrub, which is relatively effective for me, but I was looking forward to this blackhead &#x27;eraser&#x27; that would take care of the problem completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of use, I see no difference in the results between the Neutrogena scrub, and this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major flaw with the Blackhead eraser is the product application.  The instructions don&#x27;t say if the &#x27;eraser&#x27; is waterproof, and there&#x27;s no real o-ring around the battery compartment, so I believe it&#x27;s not.  This means you can&#x27;t use it in the shower - which is frustrating, because using it at your bathroom sink is a mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wet the pad enough to create suds, the soap drips down your face and all over the &#x27;eraser&#x27; and your hand.  If you don&#x27;t wet the pad enough, then you create too much friction and can damage facial tissue - leaving flaky patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think the pads alone are pretty nice.  Just wet and scrub, then rinse.  Quick and easy, and a good way to apply some blackhead fighting medicine before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the pads, but the &#x27;eraser&#x27; is erased from my beauty regimen!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve previously used the Neutrogena Wave (see my review here on Amazon).  I&#x27;d say this C&amp;C is pretty much more of the same.  It doesn&#x27;t really lather up like it says it should, &amp; it also doesn&#x27;t really feel as though skin is truely being exfoliated.  My skin is pretty sensitive and it did dry my skin a little after using it for a few days in a row. I&#x27;ll admit after use my skin does feel pretty good, but not any more than just using a regular wash cloth.  In the end I&#x27;d say save your money.  This product seems to be more gimmicky than anything else.</li>
    <li> Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s Blackhead Eraser Kit is a well packaged product with neutral design and coloring that makes it suitable as a gift item for men and women alike.  Its strange that this product is marketed as a blackhead &#x27;eraser&#x27; because there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any discernible effect on this product targeting and eliminating blackheads specifically.  Where it does deserve kudos is its functionality as an overall facial exfoliator.  Using this product for several days consecutively will give your face a noticeable and healthier texture and sheen.  Your mileage may vary, however, on the blackhead front.  Give it a try if you&#x27;re curious and in need for some smoother facial skin - it does deliver on that front.</li>
    <li> File this product under \\&quot;what&#x27;s the point?\\&quot; No matter what it says on the package, here&#x27;s what it actually is: A lower power vibrator, to which you attach pads that are soaked in salicylic acid. Essentially, it&#x27;s a toy quality exfoliater with some generic acne medicine on the pad. It provides nothing that you couldn&#x27;t achieve, more cheaply, with a bit of vigorous scrubbing with your favorite face cloth or with a slightly abrasive cream, followed by application of acne medication. I&#x27;m not even convinced that the acne medication, such as it is, has much affect on the blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any even, this has already been filed deep in my bathroom closet, and will most likely find itself in the trash the next time I do Spring cleaning.</li>
    <li> The Clean &amp; Clear blackhead eraser has generally made my face look very fresh and clean.  It worked as advertised to reduce blackheads and seems to offer a gentle exfoliation of the skin as well.  It includes several replacement pads.  You turn the bottom and it rotates gently.  You then press against the skin.  It is a painless way to improve your skin clarity.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> The biggest thing I noticed about this product is how smooth it left my skin feeling even after the first time I used it.  I do not use it daily because my skin is extremely sensitive to almost anything I use on it, but I use it periodically.  Each time I use it, I have the same feeling of just how soft to the touch my face is.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with blackheads or acne (anymore), so I can&#x27;t evaluate it for removing or reducing those conditions, but I can say that it makes my skin feel fresh, clean and very soft each time I use it.</li>
    <li> It burns your eyes!     Seriously though after months of use I see no improvement at all just look like a chick now.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> This product that I received from amazon.com did not come with insrtuctions on how to use the black head eraser. All it said was how to attach the sponge to the little machine. Did not say how long to use for, how much pressure to apply, nothing! I used one time for about 2 minutes and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all in the dissapearing of my black heads. So I then used it again for a long time, still didn&#x27;t see the black heads dissapearing. All I noticed was my face was completely dried out! And then it made me break out! And I don&#x27;t get a lot of pimples (white heads) so I know it was the black head eraser. I should have known. Clean &amp; Clear products have never worked for me before, they always dried out my skin, so I should have learned my lesson back then.</li>
    <li> I have had really bad blackheads for a long time on my nose.  I have used every kind of scrub that you can think of but nothing worked.  I got The Clean and Clear Blackhead eraser and I was so happy!! It cleared at least half of my blackheads after two uses. I totally recommend this to anyone with tough blackheads.  It gets your skin very even and smooth aswell which is a bonus.</li>
    <li> I have really tiny pores on my face and they are often clogged so I have lots of blackheads on my nose, cheeks and chin.  This product DID get rid of most of my blackheads.  However, because of the vibration and abrasive nature of the medicated pads, I now have broken capillaries on my nose (visible tiny blood vessels) which DO NOT go away.  I would avoid using this product if you have delicate, sensitive skin (especially around your nose).</li>
    <li> This exfoliates so your skin feels softer after using it but blackheads do not dissolve, disappear, get erased or anything like that. My pores actually looked larger on my face after using it. It also left dry scaly patches around my nose-like when you have a cold and you&#x27;ve used too much tissue. Not worth the $17 I paid for it at all.</li>
    <li> The Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser Kit looked promising from the description and packaging.  It contains a battery-operated device that vibrates.  On top of it you attach medicated pads. The idea is that the device vibrates while you rub the pads over the infected area, clearing away dead skin by use of exfoliation and thereby removing blackheads.  I followed the instructions and tried it out for two weeks.  I don&#x27;t have many blackheads but do have a few.  After two weeks, I noticed zero difference in my complexion, with the exception that my skin was slightly rougher on the areas I used it. The product warns you not to use it too much or this will happen, but I followed their usage guidelines exactly.  I noticed no minimization in blackheads.  And after thinking about it, I don&#x27;t see how their product can make such claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The medicated pads contain nothing more than salicylic acid, which is the basic ingredient found in all acne/blackhead products.  The vibrating action didn&#x27;t do anything I couldn&#x27;t do myself by washing my face vigorously with my hands.  The product was a mess after using it since soap was leaking all down the sides (although it was simple to clean), and my face smelled too \\&quot;perfumy.\\&quot;  Bottom line is that the pads are a bit expensive to replace, and this product won&#x27;t work much better than a simple face-cleaning regimen.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of blackheads, but this cleaner really leaves my face feeling clean.  I do have a lot of adult acne, and I feel this has helped a lot.  It is easy to use and very refreshing.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I suppose when it comes to reviewing products, I do not mind being a guinea pig for skin products.  I have had problems with acne since I was about 12yrs (I later found it was caused by an allergic reaction to dairy).  It ranged from very severe to mild acne.  I got this solely because of its promise to erase blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It reminds me a lot of the [[ASIN:B000V2J3ZK Neutrogena Wave Power-Cleanser and Deep Clean Foaming Pads]], same basic design, a vibrating base with a round abrasive pad attached to the head.  The design of this is long and round round rather than a design that is made to fit perfectly in the palm of your hand like The Wave.  Where I found the Wave to be way to really exfoliate, the \\&quot;Clean and Clear Blackhead Eraser\\&quot; although it does not remove my blackheads (imagine my dismay after 3 weeks of trying my pores were still as clogged as ever), the pads were a bit more abrasive, which I like.  Although it failed to unclog my pores anymore than my Dove disposable face wipes, it did seem to help clear up my whiteheads a bit at least because of the abrasive pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, I would say this product is a lot like any other similar product on the market, it does not do what it says sadly, even though I did like the abrasive pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  God Bless ~Amy</li>
    <li> Although I am beyond the teen acne years, I wanted to try this out due to my excessively oily skin. What I particularly liked is that it left my face feeling soft (though I did notice quite a few dry spots after using). The gentle cleansing action worked well, but I found that it was no better than my buff puff and regular non-oily cleanser (and significantly less expensive also).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably will revert back to my regular cleansing routine as I didn&#x27;t really find that this was a significant improvement relative to the cost of the product.</li>
    <li> The black head eliminated lather is effective; however, the product dries the face considerably.  My face was so dry that moisturizer didn&#x27;t help and for days my face was dry, cracked, and peeling following only a couple applications of the product.</li>
    <li> Anyone trying to remove a blackhead with this may increase the production of sebum which is what a black head is made of!    Over stimulation on naturally oily skin will on exacerbate the problem!    Stay away from products that irritate the skin like this.</li>
    <li> Love this little thing, it works so well and saves me the time of scrubbing myself.. so easy to do it in the shower or just before you go out..</li>
    <li> This product did a great job at cleaning my face, but I think it could have had more abrasive pads. I totally did not feel the exfoliation on my face. Also, you may have to wash your face with a gentle soap and water beforehand to really get any benefit out of this. I tried using it beforehand without doing so and the pads got too oily to do their work effectively. This is an OK product. I don&#x27;t doubt the effectiveness of the forumlated pads, but perhaps they could improve this product by adding a little bit more of a scrubber-like surface to the pad or offer something to attach to it. Without it, those of us who have oily skin may not get as much out of it as we can.</li>
    <li> I was surprised about this product.I do like it.     You put a medacated pad on the top , which velcros on.It&#x27;s small in size.  It comes with the one battery.It viberates. I keep it in my shower.    The pad is rough in texture. What I liked about it is,it also works as an Exfoliate, along with clearing up my skin.   I&#x27;m passed middle age, but have simi oily skin.     I think your paying more for the packaging then the product!   I took the pads to my Dermatolagist. He said it clears up your skin cause this has Salicylic Acid in the pads..  I did buy something else with Salicylic Acid but it does not work as well. I think because this is exfolingating also.     My Dr. said there are products out there with the Salicylic Acid, that are allot less money.     I use the pad acouple of times, by buying a tube of Salicylic Acid and puting it on the pad.     a 4 star for the packaging, the way this product is used, and it lead me in the right direction about the Salicylic acid.   Also it did help the little bid of blackheads I do have. Might of made my pores smaller!!!</li>
    <li> The Clean and Clear Balckhead Eraser Kit is SO simple to use. Attatch the cleaning pad, turn it on and it deep cleans your face. Be careful, it does such a great job you should only use it once a week. Can be very drying to your skin if used more often.&lt;br /&gt;It does everything it promises to do. We are very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> it worked great for me, don&#x27;t expect a miracle or everything to disappear over night, but in 2 weeks my skin was clear again, so it worked for me, love it.</li>
    <li> Contrary to the advertisement, this product does not do any blackhead removal or cleansing as advertised. However, it is easy to use and provides a soothing and deep cleansing. The motion in the cleanser is soothing and not abrasive and can be used everyday. It is usable in the shower as well.</li>
    <li> This gadget is amazing. I found it very easy to use, and it works extremely well. I actually saw a difference after my first use which I have NEVER had happen with any other product. This is highly suggested!</li>
