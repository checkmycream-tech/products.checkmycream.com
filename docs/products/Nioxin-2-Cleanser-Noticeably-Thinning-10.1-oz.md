      <li>hair is baby fine, so It needs all the help I can give it to have body</li>
      <li>Stress, light exposure, health, etc...  </li>
      <li>and my hair is soft and shiny, but growth wise, I will not be continuing this product.</li>
      <li>I went from thinning hair receding hair to think full hair.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m just happy to have hair at this point, so I can live with it not being as soft.</li>
      <li>Quick to lock in weight</li>
      <li>I gave it a four because it is worth trying, but don&#x27;t expect &amp;#34;body perm body&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t think it works much better than other thickening products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Same product made in US sold in certain salons is better.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really see my scalp.\\</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t really tell a difference in the thickness of my hair.</li>
      <li>Received this product so fast I was</li>
      <li>After a couple months, I did notice that I didn&#x27;t see as much scalp on my head.</li>
      <li>Packaging somewhat different and formulation may have changed somewhat from original iteration.</li>
      <li>This shampoo does not seem to be quite the same quality as the original product I used.</li>
      <li>The first few weeks will freak you out, because you will notice more hair loss than normal as the product adjusts to your head.</li>
      <li>Be aware that Tjmaxx also carries this product at a considerable discount.  </li>
      <li>I have used Nioxin previously and love the product.  </li>
      <li>The main reason why I know</li>
      <li>The Nioxin conditioner is better than nothing, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as other conditioners.</li>
      <li>Shipping was OK, did leak a little, but it was a screw on cap.</li>
      <li>The results are well worth the extra cost of this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 38 with long hair, so it&#x27;s starting to come out more.</li>
      <li>I have used Nioxin products for about eight years due to baby fine thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>and she said it wouldn&#x27;t look right since that only works with people who have thicker hair.</li>
      <li>I have found that it helps me keep what hair I have, and it aids in promoting the growth of new hair.</li>
      <li>I was quite surprised to find that I am required yto pay the postage on returns.&lt;br /&gt;Petty phony!</li>
      <li>The hair does not seem heavy or overly clean, just straight.</li>
      <li>I may even try using another conditioner once a week to keep it soft.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft and really does thicken it so my partially bald patch is not so noticeable.</li>
      <li>This works very well for thinning hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
      <li>The new hair will grow back in soon enough (you&#x27;ll notice little hairs sticking straight up on your head).</li>
      <li>Due too side effects from taking a new chemo medication, my doctor told me to stop using fragranced shampoo</li>

<li> So I stopped using it as soon as my bottle ran out and within the next few months, I was back to seeing scalp.</li>
<li> definitely has slowed down hair loss</li>
<li> this works really well and seems to slow the hair leaving the scalp down quite a bit&lt;br /&gt;thanks will buy again</li>
<li> so I was not able to use your product long enough to see the results that are advertised.</li>
<li> Because winter was a bit harsh this year, I decided to order it from Amazon rather than the local store.</li>

<li> I have tried other Nioxin products but do not seem to need them after using just the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
<li> My thin, naturally curly hair does not curl after washing.</li>
<li> KGs or LBs, a little trick to change it from one to the other</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure that other packing would help.</li>
<li> It made my hair horribly flat and thin.</li>
<li> in my hair, maybe not as thick as it&lt;br</li>
<li> Nioxin works is because beauticians always told me I had really thick hair.</li>
<li> Disappointed that my husbands thinning hair looks the same after 4 months using it everyday along with the conditioner &amp; styling products.</li>
<li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and my hair began to thin a bit.</li>
<li> Once I started using Nioxin, nobody has ever made another comment about my hair being thin or \\&quot;fine.\\&quot;</li>
<li> No noticeable change. :(</li>

<ol>
    <li> Nioxin changed formulas and this is ok.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is just the best love it. Received this product so fast I was so surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Janice Perez</li>
    <li> No noticeable change. :(</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 6 weeks.  It&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t think it works much better than other thickening products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is baby fine, so It needs all the help I can give it to have body and this does help. I gave it a four because it is worth trying, but don&#x27;t expect &amp;#34;body perm body&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Someone recommended Nioxin to me many years ago. I have been using it ever since. I am very pleased with it. Because winter was a bit harsh this year, I decided to order it from Amazon rather than the local store. It arrived on time and there was no damage.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, just what the Vet said. Shipping was OK, did leak a little, but it was a screw on cap. I&#x27;m not sure that other packing would help.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not seem to be quite the same quality as the original product I used. Packaging somewhat different and formulation may have changed somewhat from original iteration. I believe this is a different manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin products for about eight years due to baby fine thinning hair.  The results are well worth the extra cost of this product.  Use a smaller amount than your usual shampoo and conditioner.  I have tried other Nioxin products but do not seem to need them after using just the shampoo and conditioner.  I did have to wait longer than expected for the product to arrive, however.  Be aware that Tjmaxx also carries this product at a considerable discount.  CVS is now also carrying this product.</li>
    <li> It made my hair horribly flat and thin. Which I thought would be the opposite for this product.  Quite disapointing.</li>
    <li> Noticeable improvement to how my hair looks after a month+ of use. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and my hair began to thin a bit. Using this cleanser has helped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 months and I can&#x27;t really tell a difference in the thickness of my hair. It smells and feels great and my hair is soft and shiny, but growth wise, I will not be continuing this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 38 with long hair, so it&#x27;s starting to come out more. I don&#x27;t want to chop it off though. I wash my hair every other day, in combination with the Nioxin 2 conditioner. After a couple months, I did notice that I didn&#x27;t see as much scalp on my head. In fact, I got to the point where I thought \\&quot;I don&#x27;t need this stuff. I can&#x27;t really see my scalp.\\&quot; So I stopped using it as soon as my bottle ran out and within the next few months, I was back to seeing scalp. WARNING: The first few weeks will freak you out, because you will notice more hair loss than normal as the product adjusts to your head. This means it&#x27;s working. The new hair will grow back in soon enough (you&#x27;ll notice little hairs sticking straight up on your head). Stick with it. The hair that initially falls out won&#x27;t be noticed by anyone else, but you. I have to have conditioner to keep my hair from being tangled/ratted. The Nioxin conditioner is better than nothing, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as other conditioners. However, I&#x27;m just happy to have hair at this point, so I can live with it not being as soft. I may even try using another conditioner once a week to keep it soft. The main reason why I know Nioxin works is because beauticians always told me I had really thick hair. One day, one told me I had \\&quot;fine\\&quot; hair. I asked for layers and she said it wouldn&#x27;t look right since that only works with people who have thicker hair. Another beautician told me practically the same thing. Once I started using Nioxin, nobody has ever made another comment about my hair being thin or \\&quot;fine.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel great and I am sure my hair is beginning to thicken. If your hair is thinning give it a try you will love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years since chemo thinned my hair.  I just switched to this one for thinning hair.  It provides the look of more hair than I have.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since 2001. I have found that it helps me keep what hair I have, and it aids in promoting the growth of new hair. My hair is definitely thicker than it was before I began using NIOXIN.</li>
    <li> always like nioxin they works for money</li>
    <li> seems to work.... definitely has slowed down hair loss</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin previously and love the product.  It makes my hair soft and really does thicken it so my partially bald patch is not so noticeable.</li>
    <li> Much more expensive in stores. Great price. Great product</li>
    <li> this works really well and seems to slow the hair leaving the scalp down quite a bit&lt;br /&gt;thanks will buy again</li>
    <li> Disappointed that my husbands thinning hair looks the same after 4 months using it everyday along with the conditioner &amp; styling products.</li>
    <li> Bought this a number of times. will keep on buying - great for my hair and very practical price-point.</li>
    <li> You will notice the cleanser working immediately, but you need to massage it in your scale for the best use. I went from thinning hair receding hair to think full hair. Stress, light exposure, health, etc...  there are soo many things that can affect hair growth or lack of hair growth. The healthier you are in every aspect the better results you will in see.</li>
    <li> A great product for thinning hair!</li>
    <li> Cleans the hair well. My thin, naturally curly hair does not curl after washing. The hair does not seem heavy or overly clean, just straight. There was a time when I even ironed my hair to straighten it out and could have used this product. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to know the long term effect. Will use the entire bottle, then evaluate.</li>
    <li> Due too side effects from taking a new chemo medication, my doctor told me to stop using fragranced shampoo so I was not able to use your product long enough to see the results that are advertised.</li>
    <li> I have used the Nioxin System 2 Cleanser for about&lt;br /&gt;2 years.  My hair had been thinning due to RX drugs,&lt;br /&gt;and age I suppose (I am 70).  There is a definite&lt;br /&gt;improvement in my hair, maybe not as thick as it&lt;br /&gt;was when I was 20, but better than it was before&lt;br /&gt;using Nioxin.  Recommend for sure.</li>
    <li> This is working really good for dandruff. I have been using it for a month now.I recommend this product .</li>
    <li> This works very well for thinning hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  I also use the Nioxin gel after washing.</li>
    <li> Made in Mexico, lower quality. Same product made in US sold in certain salons is better.</li>
    <li> Good mild shampoo for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a larger container. I wish they reported size in ounces than what they use for measuring. Great product though</li>
    <li> I did not get the product I ordered. I was quite surprised to find that I am required yto pay the postage on returns.&lt;br /&gt;Petty phony!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and accurate.  Quick to lock in weight, durable strap hooks onto itself to make loop around bag handle.  KGs or LBs, a little trick to change it from one to the other</li>
