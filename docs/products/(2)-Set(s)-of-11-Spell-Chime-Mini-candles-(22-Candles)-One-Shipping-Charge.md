      <li>Enjoy :)\\&quot;.</li>

      <li>Thanks a lot. :)</li>
      <li>With my work schedule, I am unable to make it to the store to pick up more candles, so these are just perfect.</li>
      <li>the seller: Thank you so much, the price was great and it shipped AND arrived earlier than what the date was on here.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked them they were small and cute!</li>
      <li>They came within a week, exactly as it said, 22 candles!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
      <li>Lovely smaller candles for quick situations !  </li>
      <li>I am just now getting the chance to actually put them to use and they burn nice and even.</li>
      <li>I like them, and I got them pretty quickly all in all.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very conveniently sized and they fit great on small altars.</li>
      <li>The price is right</li>
      <li>They save space, and are very convenient to handle!</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more in the future when needed.</li>
      <li>They are great for various things you use candles for, they burn for like 2 and a half 3 hours.</li>

      <li>This is an amazing set of small tapers.</li>
      <li>the colors are vibrant.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend ordering stuff from them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not totally disappointed I&#x27;ll just have to find larger ones next time</li>
      <li>They seem the have about the same amount of wax as a tea light but don&#x27;t burn nearly as long.</li>
      <li>My second order of these-good price and fast ship</li>
      <li>Beautiful candles, and they last so long, but I didn&#x27;t expect them to be this short and thin.</li>
      <li>I like that these candles are small in size and they fit my needs</li>
      <li>They are big enough to write or carve into but are small enough to burn quickly!</li>
      <li>BUT, they&#x27;re a little larger than the size of a cigarette and burn almost as fast.</li>

    <li> They came within a week, exactly as it said, 22 candles! And they had a wonderful message on them. It read, \\&quot;Wrapped in candlelight. Enjoy :)\\&quot;. Almost gave me tears that somebody took the time to wrap my product. Various colors, and very useful. I have already used many of them. They save space, and are very convenient to handle! A great buy!</li>
