### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>VERY happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>It comes in very handy</li>
      <li>but the product was good</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>I love this thing already!</li>
      <li>First, shipping was excellent!</li>
      <li>but i probably would have liked maybe some sort of plastic sleeve over it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good material and easy to work with though.</li>
      <li>Easy to use!</li>
      <li>After I got my first one or two and loved them so much, I continued to build a wardrobe of them because they are ideal for a quick hair fix and they look great.</li>
      <li>hairbow/band itself is very good quality (way better than American Apparel&#x27;s!)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to buy more!</li>
      <li>They are even cute with the twist on top, like &amp;#34;mouse ears&amp;#34; or off to the side.</li>
      <li>Love this throwback to the 90&#x27;s hair accessories.</li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t think it was going to work well with that hairstyle, but it definitely succeeded my expectations and it was great!</li>
      <li>I love these headbands with wires.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
      <li>super cute!</li>
      <li>It item came quickly, but was in cute packaging!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Adorable, fun headband.</li>
      <li>So fun!</li>
      <li>, anyways, shipping was superb, i was actually expecting it waaaay later.</li>
      <li>Very cute, not cheaply made. :)</li>
      <li>Very soft material, in my opinion, much better than what is shown.</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t mind THAT much, because of course it was super cheap and coming from a overseas country</li>
      <li>Very cute, but seems like it&#x27;s too long.</li>
      <li>The fabric material is light and soft too!</li>
      <li>What is shown is a very cheap, chiffon, sheer like material and the item being quite short, but what i received is a sheer, nice cotton, polyester like material!</li>
      <li>The head band looks exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>OVERALL, 98% :)</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had other headbands like this that weren&#x27;t so long and liked them better.</li>
      <li>Even though it wasn&#x27;t 2 days shipping it still came pretty fast, about 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Definitely well worth the price!  </li>
      <li>Easy to shape due to the wire inside the fabric.</li>
      <li>and i put it up into a high pony, and i won&#x27;t lie, because the wire is very soft and flexible</li>
      <li>( I live in Florida by the way)</li>
      <li>I like this one better because you can wear it wide or you can fold it to make it smaller.</li>
      <li>It came fairly quickly than what the expected date was.</li>
      <li>The wire, is extremely flexible and even a little weak than i would like it, but for the price and with the shipping, for me, i don&#x27;t mind, at least not for now, because i will probably buy more and more, depending how great it really works and last!</li>
      <li>The wire inside is kind of weak, it doesn&#x27;t hold as firm as others.</li>
      <li>Item came in a little bubble envelope like packaging, as much products do, just bigger.</li>

<li> One small thing i will add is, when i opened my package, my item was just folded up inside, for me</li>

    <li> Very cute, but seems like it&#x27;s too long. I&#x27;ve had other headbands like this that weren&#x27;t so long and liked them better.</li>
    <li> Love this throwback to the 90&#x27;s hair accessories. Constructed well, works well, and durable and the price is perfection &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Just received! First, shipping was excellent! I order on March 15,2015, shipped the next day and got it June 2nd , when it said that the expected date was from June 11-June 29, then on the actual amazon tracking it said i would receive it June 29, anyways, shipping was superb, i was actually expecting it waaaay later. ( I live in Florida by the way) Item came in a little bubble envelope like packaging, as much products do, just bigger. I loveee the item! Very soft material, in my opinion, much better than what is shown. What is shown is a very cheap, chiffon, sheer like material and the item being quite short, but what i received is a sheer, nice cotton, polyester like material! The wire, is extremely flexible and even a little weak than i would like it, but for the price and with the shipping, for me, i don&#x27;t mind, at least not for now, because i will probably buy more and more, depending how great it really works and last! I tried it with my very thick, long curly hair and i put it up into a high pony, and i won&#x27;t lie, because the wire is very soft and flexible i didn&#x27;t think it was going to work well with that hairstyle, but it definitely succeeded my expectations and it was great!

    <li> Love this! So fun! Easy to use! super cute!</li>
    <li> Adorable, fun headband. Easy to shape due to the wire inside the fabric.</li>
    <li> I love these headbands with wires. If you do too Amazon also has a 10 pack of assorted colors, although they are not as wide. This is made of sheer lightweight material. It&#x27;s about 4&amp;#34; wide. I wear the twist in the back and just tuck the ends under. The other ones I suggested are only about 2&amp;#34; wide. I like this one better because you can wear it wide or you can fold it to make it smaller. They are even cute with the twist on top, like &amp;#34;mouse ears&amp;#34; or off to the side. Even though it wasn&#x27;t 2 days shipping it still came pretty fast, about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too long for my head and it took to long to come. It&#x27;s good material and easy to work with though.</li>
    <li> It came fairly quickly than what the expected date was. The head band looks exactly like the picture. The fabric material is light and soft too!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted... Took a little long to get it but the product was good</li>
    <li> I have received several compliments.  It comes in very handy</li>
    <li> Very cute, not cheaply made. :)</li>
    <li> I have about 20-25 of these I have accumulated from Amazon. All different colors and material, to match everything I wear. They are the easiest thing in the world, to wrap around your head, give it a twist and you look put-together. After I got my first one or two and loved them so much, I continued to build a wardrobe of them because they are ideal for a quick hair fix and they look great. I get so many compliments.</li>
    <li> $4 bucks! Definitely well worth the price!  It item came quickly, but was in cute packaging!&lt;br /&gt;The hairbow/band itself is very good quality (way better than American Apparel&#x27;s!)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to buy more!</li>
    <li> Shorter than I expected however it&#x27;s neat. It&#x27;s not a full size for an adult. But still works</li>
