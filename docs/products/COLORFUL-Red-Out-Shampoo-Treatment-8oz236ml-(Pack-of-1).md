      <li>That worked better.</li>
      <li>This works like magic.</li>

      <li>Works better in getting out the brassiness after bleaching knots on closures.</li>
      <li>This product works wonders i love it...</li>
      <li>so glad i found it.</li>
      <li>Then I shampoo with this product, but don&#x27;t leave it on more than a minute or two, scrubbing it into the scalp hair and through to the ends.</li>
      <li>Within four or five applications, I get beautiful chestnut at the roots, and a nice neutral golden blonde for the rest of the hair.</li>
      <li>I had no issues working the product into the hair and removal is easy.</li>
      <li>Shampoos clear, and gets rid of that brassy root color - amazing!</li>
      <li>I lived with it for two weeks, and decided to box dye it myself to a cool brown.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ever been able to get most of the red out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was super fast!</li>
      <li>Well she was right.</li>
      <li>The picture on the right is after two uses.</li>
      <li>Its safe to use it up to 3 times in one day, and I did it once and still ended up with red in my hair and an orangey tint.</li>
      <li>First.</li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>I am glad I read the prior reviews</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>i over processed my lace and it was very brassy...</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo-</li>
      <li>I really like how this works for me.  </li>
      <li>the shipping is decent</li>
      <li>So I thought I was able to do this, but Im not much for patience apparently.</li>
      <li>Sometimes you may need to apply it a second time, but it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>Lathers really well and given a few minutes sets up very quickly.  </li>
      <li>but i was it with red out about 2x and it washed right out...</li>
      <li>The picture on the left was after the cool brown, and you can see the red in the scalp.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually easier to get off my skin than the Black Malva Conditioner and does a much better job, but as with any toner/color corrector it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.</li>
      <li>When my colorist removed the black permanent dye from my hair nothing I have done since has been able to eliminate the aggressive red undertones in my (now) medium brunette.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s supposed to remove unwanted hair dye previously added and restore your hair to its original color.</li>
      <li>which was in a natural 1b.</li>
      <li>Does not mute as much of the red tones as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>I had another hair dresser attempt to take the red out with ash, but it only helped so much.</li>
      <li>THis product helps to tone down the red in your hair, but does not make it a true brown.  </li>
      <li>Loved it I over bleached my $375 wig which is really expensive, the roots were really brassy and in other places they were blonde when I tell you this stuff works that is a understatement.</li>
      <li>I search high and low and finally found it on Amazon!</li>
      <li>Spoke to my hair stylist about dying in back to my natural.</li>
      <li>This seems to be getting worse as I become more gray.</li>
      <li>Make sure you put on protective gloves before you use this product, it has a thick deep blue color.  </li>
      <li>I have thin, fine, medium brown dyed hair.  </li>

<li> I have thin, fine, medium brown dyed hair.  </li>
<li> She warned me that red fades and that it wouldn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> i&#x27;m 18 with natural hair that i had previously had heavily blonde highlighted.</li>
<li> I naturally have long dark ash blonde hair.</li>
<li> Tried other brands that claims to do the same without  having the same results of Red Out..</li>
<li> I have long, medium-brown hair that is pretty thick, and there is some orange-brassiness from box hair color that has faded.  </li>
<li> im not sure if i left the bleach in for too long or not long enough but what i do know is my knots and hair thats closest to the look alike</li>
<li> My first lace closures I buoght that I bleached the knots on resulted in an ugly unrealistic brassy look, I used the RED OUT toner shampoo to tone down the brassiness and it worked better than I expected, it completely eliminated the brassiness!</li>
<li> When my hair is colored dark brown it sometimes fades to a coppery red color.  </li>
<li> i thought the money was a waste till i came across a how to fix your bleached hair video on youtube long story short</li>
<li> and it didn&#x27;t even get rid of the red in my hair a little.</li>
<li> not much luck at the time.</li>
<li> and there was not much difference in my hair.  </li>
<li> This might work well for others with a small amount of red in their hair.</li>
<li> She said other than bleaching it all she could do is cover it up with a dark brown</li>
<li> and I would have to let the red slowly over the course of a year wash out.</li>
<li> Like other reviews said, you can leave it in way longer than the processing time!</li>
<li> I did feel it damaged it a little (hair).</li>
<li> I use a heavily moisturizing shampoo to cleanse, this counteracts some of the drying effect of this product.</li>
<li> AND it&#x27;s extremely messy &amp; stains.</li>
<li> When I was finished I blow dried</li>
<li> The bottle may look small but it goes along way.i would deff.</li>
<li> i was terrified since I&#x27;m pale as a wall!</li>
<li> /ashier, I tried Clairol Shimmer Lights and Aveda Black Malva with no luck, tried a toner and made things worse...</li>
<li> but this was bad enough</li>
<li> I was so desperate to get out a bad hair coloring job that I used it about three times in the same week, for 45 minutes each time.</li>
<li> Disappointing to say the least.</li>
<li> Bad .. Does not work.</li>
<li> Awful packaging and leaked all over the place!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does not mute as much of the red tones as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m 18 with natural hair that i had previously had heavily blonde highlighted. I dyed it brown with no problems, and when i went to dye it a darker brown my hair dresser used a dye that turned my scalp to fire truck orange. The next day she proceeded to dye it brown without a color correcter which turned it purple. I had another hair dresser attempt to take the red out with ash, but it only helped so much. I lived with it for two weeks, and decided to box dye it myself to a cool brown. The picture on the left was after the cool brown, and you can see the red in the scalp. The picture on the right is after two uses. Just leave it on for five mins, follow it with shampoo and conditioner and you&#x27;re all set!!</li>
    <li> When my colorist removed the black permanent dye from my hair nothing I have done since has been able to eliminate the aggressive red undertones in my (now) medium brunette. Red does not work for my skin tone and I have been trying to get the color cooler/ashier, I tried Clairol Shimmer Lights and Aveda Black Malva with no luck, tried a toner and made things worse... then I tried this stuff. It&#x27;s actually easier to get off my skin than the Black Malva Conditioner and does a much better job, but as with any toner/color corrector it&#x27;s not a miracle worker. I would say I see about a 75% reduction in the red color of my hair when I use it once a week.</li>
    <li> Have used it twice. My hair is the same.</li>
    <li> Bad .. Does not work. Awful packaging and leaked all over the place! Do not buy this product! I never write reviews but this was bad enough</li>
    <li> Red Out works wonderfuly when you follow the directions. Sometimes you may need to apply it a second time, but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> It sort of works. It does nothing for the brass tones and it severly stains the skin for a day. I would suggest this if nothing else works to get the red tones out of the hair.</li>
    <li> Made me break out in hives.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo- although it didn&#x27;t work for me.  My brassiness is just so stubborn.  This might work well for others with a small amount of red in their hair.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine, medium brown dyed hair.  This stuff works great!!!  This is the first time I have ever been able to get most of the red out of my hair.  I do not need to use it often either.  I just get in the shower, with gloves; put it in my hair; leave it for about 5 minutes while I shave, etc...  rinse, then put a detangler on and rinse</li>
    <li> I am glad I read the prior reviews so I would know not to leave this on. I color my hair blond, sometimes brown, and it always comes out reddish. This seems to be getting worse as I become more gray. This product solved the problem. First. I use a heavily moisturizing shampoo to cleanse, this counteracts some of the drying effect of this product. Then I shampoo with this product, but don&#x27;t leave it on more than a minute or two, scrubbing it into the scalp hair and through to the ends. Within four or five applications, I get beautiful chestnut at the roots, and a nice neutral golden blonde for the rest of the hair. No blue in sight.</li>
    <li> Loved it I over bleached my $375 wig which is really expensive, the roots were really brassy and in other places they were blonde when I tell you this stuff works that is a understatement. This stuff saved my money so glad i found it.</li>
    <li> Noticed no change in my hair AND it&#x27;s extremely messy &amp; stains.</li>
    <li> Make sure you put on protective gloves before you use this product, it has a thick deep blue color.  Lathers really well and given a few minutes sets up very quickly.  Shampoos clear, and gets rid of that brassy root color - amazing!</li>
    <li> Bought this based on a YouTube review, and am so very happy with this product. I search high and low and finally found it on Amazon! Works better in getting out the brassiness after bleaching knots on closures. Tried other brands that claims to do the same without  having the same results of Red Out.. This works like magic. Nothing compares!</li>
    <li> THis product helps to tone down the red in your hair, but does not make it a true brown.  There is still a lot of red in the hair.  I tried it the way the directions state and there was not much difference in my hair.  A friend told me to add it to the hair color as you are coloring your hair.  That worked better.</li>
    <li> This did nothing to get my red hair out. I did feel it damaged it a little (hair). Would never recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I use this product to remove the brassiness from bleaching hair closures and i worked great! This is better than shimmer lights</li>
    <li> I have long, medium-brown hair that is pretty thick, and there is some orange-brassiness from box hair color that has faded.  I used this shampoo every day for a week and there was zero difference.  Also, it will turn your hands blue in the shower and takes a while to scrub off.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo on a Swiss lace Brazilian closure from [...] and it got all the brassyness out! I love this shampoo treatment it works great!</li>
    <li> I used this twice and it didn&#x27;t even get rid of the red in my hair a little. Disappointing to say the least.</li>
    <li> I really like how this works for me.  When my hair is colored dark brown it sometimes fades to a coppery red color.  This helps ease that up a bit.  I really like it!</li>
    <li> Like other reviews said, you can leave it in way longer than the processing time! I was so desperate to get out a bad hair coloring job that I used it about three times in the same week, for 45 minutes each time. I used a great conditioner in between, and it worked like a charm!!! Rinse it out when in doubt, but it&#x27;s not going to make your hair fall out or turn it blue. ;)</li>
    <li> It works! Try it and you will be so happy. I used it on my closure unit. Came out perfect!</li>
    <li> I naturally have long dark ash blonde hair. About 6 months ago I dyed my hair the darkest auburn possible with my hair stylist. She warned me that red fades and that it wouldn&#x27;t last long. Well she was right. So 2 months later I dyed my hair again only to end with a faded copper look. I really loved the auburn but realized that the maintenance and damage were costly and had to make a decision. Spoke to my hair stylist about dying in back to my natural. She said other than bleaching it all she could do is cover it up with a dark brown and I would have to let the red slowly over the course of a year wash out. So I thought I was able to do this, but Im not much for patience apparently. I started googling and etc. not much luck at the time. So I went to the store, grabbed two boxes of medium ash blonde, and dyed my hair again. When I was finished I blow dried my hair noticed that only my roots turned out ashy but the rest of my hair looked had an orangey. Still being inpatient, I went and grabbed 2 boxed of \\&quot;oops\\&quot;. It&#x27;s supposed to remove unwanted hair dye previously added and restore your hair to its original color. Its safe to use it up to 3 times in one day, and I did it once and still ended up with red in my hair and an orangey tint. So then I went ahead and I bought another 2 boxes of medium ash blonde dye and applied it to my hair. Again the same results. Finally I started doing my research I found this red out. I read the reviews and decided to try it anyway. Amazing I&#x27;m so happy with the results and I&#x27;m cracking</li>
    <li> This product works wonders i love it...i use it on my lace front bc i over processed my lace and it was very brassy...but i was it with red out about 2x and it washed right out...the shipping is decent i ordered it tues...and received it by sat....</li>
    <li> This product neutralizes bronze/brass/red tones as stated. I had no issues working the product into the hair and removal is easy. love it!</li>
    <li> My first lace closures I buoght that I bleached the knots on resulted in an ugly unrealistic brassy look, I used the RED OUT toner shampoo to tone down the brassiness and it worked better than I expected, it completely eliminated the brassiness!</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders for getting the brassiness out of my closure! I bleached the knots and it came out orange! i was terrified since I&#x27;m pale as a wall! lol i highly recommend this stuff! Shipping was super fast! Ordered it March 27th and received it March 29th! I will upload before and after pics.</li>
    <li> okay so im into doing my own hair weave extensions and all that. I desided i wanted to bleach my knots on a virgin closure that i purchased. which was in a natural 1b. im not sure if i left the bleach in for too long or not long enough but what i do know is my knots and hair thats closest to the look alike scalp on my closure was a bronzey orangey kinda red color. i paid $190 for a closure to do my sew n.and i thought the money was a waste till i came across a how to fix your bleached hair video on youtube long story short this stuff works well i would use gloves when using because the shampoo treatment is blue. i think it took me just 2 washes to get it the color i wanted. The bottle may look small but it goes along way.i would deff. reffer this product to someone and purchase again. hope this helps. check out my youtube channel for more tips. melony23mj is my channel</li>
