      <li>Thanks Boottique!</li>

      <li>However, this isn&#x27;t really that big of a deal</li>
      <li>They are a little stretched around the calves, but still comfy and cute.</li>

<li> A little bit small</li>

    <li> Very nice and dressy. I have gotten many compliments on these leg warmers. These warmers add an extra boost to your wardrobe.</li>
    <li> A little bit small but they are definitely cute. The picture shows more buttons than what they have, but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these! Warm, thick, and adorable! I have to leave one or two buttons undone and have the lace peaking out from boots. I get tons of compliments.</li>
    <li> Loved them! Very classy. Bought them for a Haloween outfit but will definitely wear them with other things. Good buy.</li>
    <li> So beautiful on my legs and even better, they are so warm!!!! I love them and am 90 percent happy with my purchase here. The only thing I did not like is the ruffle at the bottom is hard to keep in place because it flips up. However, this isn&#x27;t really that big of a deal</li>

    <li> These leg warmers are adorable. You should Definitely should get a pair they go with everything. Must gave gonna order them in the other colors as well</li>
    <li> Just ok, the lace is ichy and cheap. They just aren&#x27;t made well splitting at the seams on the top of one of the warmers so had to repair them which is not something you should have to do with a new item. Thankfully I used Amazon point to buy these therefore not paying full price. If I had paid full price I would have returned them.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would repeat this phrase from the 80&#x27;s, but I love my leg warmers.  I wear them with leggings and riding boots.  People stop me all the time asking me about where I bought my leg warmers  aka BOOT SOCKS!</li>
    <li> Love these leg warmers! I bought them for my sister for Christmas, and I wish I bought an extra pair for myself! So cute with leggings and either flats or heels, just like in the picture with the lace at the bottom. Or with the lace at the top as a boot sock. Very versitle, and a great way to accessorize.</li>
    <li> Love these! I have bigger calves. They are a little stretched around the calves, but still comfy and cute.</li>
    <li> The idea is great and the warmers are super cute but they&#x27;re tight at the top and I don&#x27;t have large calves.  I&#x27;ll keep them and probably wear with one or two buttons unbuttoned.  Not a total deal breaker but not the look I was after.....</li>
    <li> The wool felt OK when I first put them on, but when I wore them for more than five minutes, the itchiness started to build and I took them off.</li>
    <li> Cute and versatile. Can be worn with leggings, jeggings or alone lace going up or buttons up. Fast delivery, I would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Love these. Will buy more as Christmas gifts and stocking stuffers</li>
    <li> I am very impressed on how quickly I received my order. I absolutely love my leg warmers. I will defiantly recommend them to all and will be placing another order soon. Thanks Boottique!</li>
    <li> not only are they cuter than in the pictures, but they are nice &amp; thick too!  Buttons make them versatile for wearing lace up or down &amp; folded or not.  Can&#x27;t wait for the temps to dip so I can wear these great buys!</li>
    <li> Good quality and nice product. Not as quality as the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; but still very good. I would recommend these based on having both the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; and this brand.</li>
    <li> These are adorable good quality.  Lots of compliments!!  I wore them with my over the knee boots they are So Cute!!</li>
