    <li> Have started making my own facial products.  This was listed in a recipe and that&#x27;s why I bought it.  Had never heard of it before.  Very nice oil that goes into the skin and is not greasy.  I use it in all my homemade potions now!</li>
    <li> I am loving this product. I did some research on it and found nothing but great things about it. Evidently it is being incorporated into face creams now but just by itself it is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and great service!</li>
    <li> This is a nice. Neutral oil that is just what I needed for blending.  I recommend this formulation....smooth and not too thick or too thin.</li>
    <li> I moved from SF to Denver where the air is DRY! I mix a drop or two of this with my regular Neutrogena moisturizer and it provides the *PERFECT* balance. I have super sensitive skin and my skin looks awesome with just this moisturizer blend. It also works wonderfully with my bare minerals powder, WAY better than their primer that clogs my pores.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my skin and it keeps me very soft.  This is absorbed very well and doesn&#x27;t lay on your skin like some oils do.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have ingredients listed, proper labeling is missing! How can you tell it&#x27;s the right product if u don&#x27;t label it right. Prove it to me. Scared to use it, coz don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s real Meadowfoam Seed Oil Organic, or any oil like vegetable oil or canola oil?</li>
    <li> This is a good product</li>
    <li> Love it!! Not greasy or oily.. just perfect!</li>
    <li> Again, I am 60+ and folks think I am in my 40&#x27;s...heredetary OR MSO?</li>
    <li> Such fast shipping-Awesome oil.  It&#x27;s light and soaks in quick-No smell and only slight color.  I&#x27;ve already reordered!  Thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> I did extensive research on oils.  The Madowfoam oil really does get below surface. I have seen an improvement. Less dry and by massaging it in thoroughly it leaves a perfect platform for foundation. In my opinion every thing else I have tried is far inferior. I also tried it on my hair. Just be sure to leave it on for awhile and shampoo thoroughly.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this oil, leaves my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> arrived as promised - was a described - nicely packaged</li>
