      <li>&lt;br /&gt; - you don&#x27;t have to use it twice a day, once is fine.</li>
      <li>I have fine frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>Did not do for my fine hair what the advertising says it will.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Here is what I do to help my limp fine thinning hair look the best it can</li>
      <li>No frizz smooth hair.</li>
      <li>I also use the hair spray, it holds very well without feeling sticky, or stff, very easy to comb thru.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s never as full as I want it.</li>
      <li>Helps make hair look twice as full as when I use nothing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad product at all</li>
      <li>its awesome leaves my hair very soft and healthly looking without making it look greasy like it did when I used it wet.</li>
      <li>Volume Spray Super Hold Finishing Spray&lt;br</li>
      <li>hair is naturally beautifully wavy but syst disregarding my parents lectured on straightening it for many years it is thin and damaged.</li>
      <li>I do not think it really did anything for my super fine hair, I am going to keep looking.</li>
      <li>I really did like this product!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually quite amazing.  </li>
      <li>I will buy this product again and would recommend it to someone looking for a more natural looking volumized style</li>
      <li>pricy but worth it</li>
      <li>/&gt;Also might be worth trying a shower head that uses a carbon filter.  </li>
      <li>the older version of the mousse was like fine hair</li>
      <li>Did not find this particularly helpful for my fine hair, but gave it a try based on others reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Does a nice job of adding volume to my fine hair, not sticky or heavy.</li>
      <li>I am making this part of my daily routine and start having the volume that I love.</li>
      <li>I love this spray, it definitely makes a difference in adding volume to my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always looking for products to smooth, de-frizz, add body and volume, make hair soft, and never weighed-down.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different ones.</li>
      <li>Now, be aware that the amount of volume you get from any product, including this one, is proportional to the length of your hair.  </li>
      <li>It was just like spraying water on my roots and did just as much!</li>
      <li>tried this recently and was pleased how it gave my hair nice cleanliness and bounce even when skipping my other</li>
      <li>I do have fine hair that wants to frizz near the crown.</li>
      <li>It increases the volume of my fine hair, calms and repairs the rough and broken ends of my hair, and aids in detangling and straightening my hair quite perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft but full.  </li>
      <li>, I end up with soft, full hair.  </li>
      <li>Now i have to wait a year for my long previously good conditioned silky hair to all grow back.  </li>
      <li>and i assumed since it was only a 7 day treatment it couldn&#x27;t be too strong ....</li>
      <li>however when shopping for something for one night on their sample size bottles I came across this fine to fill spray and it sat for several days before I used</li>
      <li>I have medium-length, fine, blonde, naturally-wavy, thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>I am very high maintenance on my hair care products.</li>
      <li>My hair is medium fine, but i have used other straighteners over the years, like keratin smoothering ones, professional treatments which worked fine.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>and I can tell a real difference when I spray this on my hair.  </li>

    <li> Best hair product I have ever used.  No frizz smooth hair. Will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I do not think it really did anything for my super fine hair, I am going to keep looking. a</li>
    <li> This product holds hair in place all day.  It is great for the Florida weather in the summer since we have a lot of rain</li>
    <li> Does a nice job of adding volume to my fine hair, not sticky or heavy.</li>
    <li> I love this spray, it definitely makes a difference in adding volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> I think when you first use it, you might think that there&#x27;s not much change before and after use. However, I noticed the difference after a long day at work. I used to get very flat hair at the end of the day but ever since I used this product before drying my hair, I get the nice volume to stay in my hair until the end of the day. I don&#x27;t typically give myself a dramatic volumized hair so don&#x27;t expect to get huge hair, but it definitely holds some volume in.</li>
    <li> I have fine frizzy hair.  When I use this product before I round brush blow dry my hair, I end up with soft, full hair.  I have tried lots of products, and this one is so far the best!</li>
    <li> For starters... I had ZERO expectations... I was in CVS and was sleeping at my boyfriends that night and just needed sample size stuff because I had extra full bottles of what I would normally use on hand at home and had just my over night bag... I am very high maintenance on my hair care products. Normally no parabens, no sulfate  $30.00 a bottle  (trust me it&#x27;s a total waste) however when shopping for something for one night on their sample size bottles I came across this fine to fill spray and it sat for several days before I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally beautifully wavy but syst disregarding my parents lectured on straightening it for many years it is thin and damaged. I tend to wear it curly more often now but it&#x27;s never as full as I want it. I wash my hair,  get out of the shower, brush,  toss in some antifriz  and then saw this sitting on my floor and flipped my hair upside down and as my hair dried IT TURNED INTO SUPERMODEL HAIR. IT IS THE BEST MY HAIR HAD LOOKED IN YEARS. I AM IN LOVE.</li>
    <li> I liked this when I first dried and flat ironed it in, but after the treatment, upon washing the 2nd day, while drying hair, it started vreaking off in chunks in my brush!! I was horrified!  My hair is medium fine, but i have used other straighteners over the years, like keratin smoothering ones, professional treatments which worked fine. This is the worst breakage and experience with a smoothing treatment or even a perm that I have EVER had. This product should be off the market in my opinion. I have a prof cosmotology license and i assumed since it was only a 7 day treatment it couldn&#x27;t be too strong .... Well BUYER BEWARE! Now i have to wait a year for my long previously good conditioned silky hair to all grow back.  I contacted the company for a refund and got no response-</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair and this product helps to add volume</li>
    <li> I have very fine thinning hair. This product along with the shampoo and conditioner work wonders on my hair. I&#x27;ll never use anything else. I also discovered buying it from amazon saves me money. I have been using it since I first saw the commercial for it on TV. The stores where I live don&#x27;t carry the VOLUME products  and some that do , have a heafty price on them . I also use the hair spray, it holds very well without feeling sticky, or stff, very easy to comb thru. I just love all the VOLUME products. Trust me, If you have fine or thinning hair , you&#x27;ll love using all the Volume products. I&#x27;ve tried many different ones.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff..........it makes my hair look full but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and it isn&#x27;t sticky like a lot of products.</li>
    <li> Wow! Thank the lord I gave this product a chance. I had used the John Frieda Volume shampoo. I didnt see results. But then I saw this spray. I thought, let me give this a try...I can return it if it doesnt work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is AMAZING. I have fine, limp hair. You spray this stuff on towel dried hair and blow dry. It blow dries clean and there is volume!!!! My hair feels silky! My hair looks like it just came from the hair salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say that I was expecting this product to make my hair feel sticky. Absolutely not. I will buy this product again. and I will give the other products in this line a chance as well! I am sooo happy!</li>
    <li> It does give your hair loads of volume but it&#x27;s not practical to use every day because of the size and price.</li>
    <li> I found no discernible benefit from using this product.  It made my hair stiff and when I used the blow-dryer and a half round brush my hair broke off alarmingly.  Even after that, my hair fell flat even though the humidity was not that bad.  I tried it three times, thinking I was at fault.  The rest of the product ended in the trash and I went back to Redken Body Full Amplifying Spray, a sadder but wiser consumer.</li>
    <li> Only works on dry hair, give more volume to thin/fine hair and holds for 6+ hours when used with the root booster and finished with the volume hair spray, easy to blow dry, unlike mousse which gets your hair to tangle on the rollers or combs.  I give 1 star less because it doesn&#x27;t work well just by itself, especially on towel dry or wet hair.</li>
    <li> This product does the job promised. I had a couple of issues with it making my hair a little staticky.</li>
    <li> This product does not work.  I have fine hair and it would be better using nothing.  Do not know how anyone could rate this as a good product.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work any better than any other hair spray to increase the volume. I will use it up but not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Even on days that I do not fully blow out my hair, I use this product to tame frizz and detangle. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to boost my über fine Scandinavian locks. Most &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; products just leave a gummy, sticky film that weighs my hair down vs adding body. This product really works. It boosts volume, leaves my hair silky and gives me that just blown out at a salon look without much effort.  I also tried the partnering John Frieda Luxurious Volume Building Mousse which also adds volume but my hair lacks the silkiness this blow out spray gives.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for volume, do not order this product.  It flattened my hair and if possible made it feel more fine than it already is.</li>
    <li> This product smells nice and sprays evenly. I like that it made my hair flexibly voluminous with no crunchy feeling like some others I have tried. I will buy this product again and would recommend it to someone looking for a more natural looking volumized style</li>
    <li> I just spray on my just washed thin fine hair and use a rounded heat brush to dry and style.  Helps make hair look twice as full as when I use nothing.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> perfect for those of us with thinning hair</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It does give your hair volume, without being salty or sticky.  It&#x27;s actually quite amazing.  While it doesn&#x27;t necessary give you fuller body, it does LOOK like fuller body when you blow dry your hair and set it.  It&#x27;s so good, I even told my hairdresser about it.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Did not find this particularly helpful for my fine hair, but gave it a try based on others reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair to Die For by Peter Thomas Roth&lt;br /&gt; - you don&#x27;t have to use it twice a day, once is fine. it adds instant volume and encourages hair growth. pricy but worth it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Styling Foam by Giovanni&lt;br /&gt; -this is my favorite mousse. 3 pumps adds great volume on my almost dry hair...blow dry with a round brush for even better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kenra Volume Spray Super Hold Finishing Spray&lt;br /&gt; - this I did try based on a recommendation on Amazon and was very pleased at the hold and volume it gave me.  The can i received is HUGE and this will likely last well into 2015 and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alterna bamboo abundant volume shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;- tried this recently and was pleased how it gave my hair nice cleanliness and bounce even when skipping my other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also might be worth trying a shower head that uses a carbon filter.  It removes the chlorine and other chemicals which can help your skin and hair.  Recommended by a doctor when I had a cold and I&#x27;ve noticed skin is less dry, water feels cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but my hair is extra fine and thin, so it didn&#x27;t give as much volume as other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Lots of body without stiffness. Leaves my hair soft but full.  Size of bottle makes it easy to hold .</li>
    <li> I love this product!  To say I can&#x27;t live without it is an understatement.  Every morning I was my hair and apply a good amount of this product all over my hair.  I section of my hair and blow dry in section.  Minutes later, I have bouncy beautiful hair.  Now, be aware that the amount of volume you get from any product, including this one, is proportional to the length of your hair.  In other words, the shorter your hair, the more volume; the longer your hair, the less volume you&#x27;ll achieve becuase your hair is heavier.  Also, you&#x27;ll need to use the John Freida volumizing shampoo and conditioner for better results.  A good quality blow dryer does not hurt either.</li>
    <li> This works Great with the Conditioner.  I think they are the best products on the market that I have tried.  I am impressed that my hair feels and looks thicker. Worth the money!  :)</li>
    <li> This producbe delivers.. it makes my hair full of volume for the entire day! I am making this part of my daily routine and start having the volume that I love.</li>
    <li> SO EXPENSIVE!! BUT SO AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> I really did like this product!! I was able to style my baby fine, thin hair!! I was thrilled!!! And then.....a hot flash ended  that!!! so, I won&#x27;t use it again, but I will pass it on to my stylist so she can use it.</li>
    <li> May 2013:  I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much of this product... but I liked it more than I thought I would.  And, I only have to use this one product in lieu of a detangler and a mouse or volumizer.  So, overall, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 2013 Update:  I have to say, in the months since I first started using this product, my opinion of the quality of this product has only escalated.  I used to interchange this product with others... using this one on one day, and using other products on the alternating day.  Now, I have found that this product is the ONLY product I need on any day.  It is absolutely my favorite hair product to use for every issue I face with my hair.  It increases the volume of my fine hair, calms and repairs the rough and broken ends of my hair, and aids in detangling and straightening my hair quite perfectly.  Now, I have to wrap up this update so I can order some more of this fantastic John Frieda Luxurious Volume Fine to Full Blow Out Spray!</li>
    <li> I have finally found an affordable solution to my fine limp hair.  I have spent so much money on so many products that made promises it just did not deliver.  Here is what I do to help my limp fine thinning hair look the best it can look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to make a note that I also use the john frieda luxurious volume Shampoo AND Conditioner (I don&#x27;t usually use conditioner but this stuff rocks) AND I use the Infinity Spinning Air Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shampoo and conditioner leave my hair shiny and soft.  The blow out spray in conjunction with the Infinity Spinning Brush gives my hair a very nice PUFF.  The heat and spinning brush against my roots (which have been sprayed with the blow out spray) gives my hair added volume that gives the illusion that I have beautiful and LOTS of hair.</li>
    <li> I was seriously disappointed in this. I have long, fine, thin blonde hair and that pretty much comes along with limp and bone straight. I am always trying new products in an effort to give my hair some volume. This product unfortunately, did nothing for me, as in I really couldn&#x27;t see a difference in the volume when I blow out my hair with this product than I do when I blow out my hair with absolutely nothing in it. As I said, I was seriously disappointed. Now, I will note that in all my years of searching, I have only found a few products that will give me decent volume. I keep looking because out of those, I haven&#x27;t found one that doesn&#x27;t make my hair at the roots feel sticky. Unfortunately, I will need to continue to look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, this does smell pleasant and my hair was &amp;#34;touchably soft&amp;#34;, as it advertises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. Hopefully if you decide to try it out, it will give you better results than it did for me.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and was easy transaction...  I think this product will live up to my expectations, as it does increase volume of your hair...I have long hair and it made it look fuller and thicker...and to the touch there is no sticky residule... Im rating the product a 5 star.....but the shipping charges were alittle much....I&#x27;d rate them a 2  but everyone is in this to make money and I guess this is the price you pay</li>
    <li> Works for me! I have a lot of hair so it&#x27;s heavy and difficult to find a product that actually does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used almost an entire bottle of this product. During the time I&#x27;ve had this bottle, I&#x27;ve used other products. I&#x27;ve found my hair looked better on the days I used the other product (Joico Body Luxe Volumizing Foam). I will not be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> I have medium-length, fine, blonde, naturally-wavy, thinning hair.  I&#x27;m always looking for products to smooth, de-frizz, add body and volume, make hair soft, and never weighed-down.  I bought this based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad product at all (meaning, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling worse with it on), I just don&#x27;t see what it does.  It works very well as a detangler, right after coming out of the shower, so that skips one other product, but as far as styling goes, I just don&#x27;t get it.  Whether I air dry or blow dry and style with various brushes, I just don&#x27;t see it doing anything other than maybe smoothing flyaways.  It gives me no additional body or volume.  And I&#x27;m even using it with their volume shampoo (which I find totally ineffective for volume too).  I like that this stuff sprays on in a fine mist and doesn&#x27;t dry crunchy or sticky.  And it has a great scent.  But I wouldn&#x27;t bother buying it again.  I need a styling product that has some oomph.</li>
    <li> Did not do for my fine hair what the advertising says it will.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair and I can tell a real difference when I spray this on my hair.  It works best if you spray each strand before rolling, curling iron or whatever.  It does add body and doesn&#x27;t leave you hair stiff after a comb out</li>
    <li> This spray gave me good volume without drying it out. I have dry chemically processed hair and it msde it very soft</li>
    <li> I only gave this 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t like it when I put it on wet hair and blow dried my hair. I thought I would see what it was like on dry hair and its awesome leaves my hair very soft and healthly looking without making it look greasy like it did when I used it wet.</li>
    <li> good product, good value, would buy again</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It provides volume that lasts for hours.  In humidity, some fullness is lost, but my hair doesn&#x27;t  flatten down like it  would without using Frieda Volume.  I especially like that it leaves the hair soft, not stiff and sticky.  This is now my go to, flat hair, problem solver.  It is easy to use and a plus is that you can do touch ups on dry hair.  Just spray and dry with the hot dryer to renew fullness.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product! It didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for my fine, flat hair! It was just like spraying water on my roots and did just as much! Would not recommend and now I&#x27;m stuck with something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Works great with the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> My second bottle. Works great for my thin locks. I apply on wet hair and blow dry.</li>
    <li> Works well to add body to limp hair.  Use wet or dry. Like it especially between shampoos and to redo hair for evening</li>
    <li> This really did not do much for me personally. I do have fine hair that wants to frizz near the crown. It did not stop the frizz nor did I feel like it gave me any real volume or style help.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but lots of it, so it tends to be limp and heavy.  I have tried tons of products for fine hair! I really like this product, although I can&#x27;t say it gives a ton of volume. But it does make my hair feel thicker and healthier as well as shinier and softer.  I use a root spray (Aveda) with it to increase lift at the roots and also a heat protectant spray (Nexxus). It leaves my hair fuller for the entire day, but not staticky or greasy. (When I use too much, it does feel \\&quot;overcoated\\&quot;.)I am giving it 4 stars just because it does not give crazy volume, but instead just gives my hair more heft. It is now my everyday product.</li>
    <li> I like all of John Frieda&#x27;s hair products and this one is no exception..very nice product... I&#x27;d recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> the older version of the mousse was like fine hair nirvana  this is ok at best  gives some guts to baby fine hair without the gunky feeling but i was hoping for more</li>
