      <li>The cologne comes in a grey box which is sort of neat but tends to break since it isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>

      <li>Great subtle citrusy scent</li>
      <li>I was excited, but skeptical because of the great price for a 3.3 ounce.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance burns off really fast, in under a hour.</li>
      <li>My favorite colone, I constantly reorder more, it&#x27;s really hard to find a male cologne that scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
      <li>so I went back to paying more than double at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly and exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I do not think it is the exact same one you can get in the store.</li>
      <li>Chip off the old block!</li>
      <li>My twelve year old son actually had this in his collection first.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if these are old tester bottles or what.</li>
      <li>only complaint is that the scent doesnt last long.. but smells great</li>
      <li>When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it was 100% brand new with outside wrapping intact.  </li>
      <li>that strong that it will give you a headache, for those delicate noses.</li>
      <li>I barely smelled this after 3 hours, inside with no air movement.</li>
      <li>Not too strong, not too subtle.  </li>

    <li> My favorite colone, I constantly reorder more, it&#x27;s really hard to find a male cologne that scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
    <li> Great smell and happy to find it after all the department stores and fragrance shops were out of stock.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what my son wanted for his birthday.  He loves it and wears it on special occasions.  The scent is powerful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently a freshman and college and began using this cologne when I was given a sample at Macy&#x27;s. Ever since it has become one of my favorite colognes to go out. The cologne comes in a grey box which is sort of neat but tends to break since it isn&#x27;t very strong. Next the cologne itself inst that strong that it will give you a headache, for those delicate noses. Yes! we all have probably smelled a cologne that has given us a headache at least once. But this cologne give off a medium smell. Not to soft and to strong. I&#x27;ve received compliments from both genders asking me what cologne was it. I&#x27;ve also had girls come up to me and smell to the area in which I had sprayed it on.&lt;br /&gt;  HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE, MAKES AN EXCELLENT GIFT FOR YOU BF,SON, ETC</li>
    <li> Great subtle citrusy scent</li>
    <li> This is a manly fragrance, not overpowering.  Light and fresh</li>
    <li> this is such a great scent. one of my favorites. best deal on the internet. cant go wrong at this price</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff smells and what a great price! It is a great purchase and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get my husband his favorite cologne for the summer and it was so hard to find at any department stores.  I didn&#x27;t want to give up just yet and that&#x27;s when I discovered PLAY at Amazon.  I was excited, but skeptical because of the great price for a 3.3 ounce.  I was left pondering if it was used or a knockoff while waiting for delivery.  When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it was 100% brand new with outside wrapping intact.  Amazon will be my go to source for hard to find items now.</li>
    <li> Yes, i confirm what i quoted is that you are looking for</li>
    <li> THE SMELL DOESNT LAST LONG!</li>
    <li> Fresh, clean citrus scent that is not overpowering and really lasts well. This is a great scent for the warmer months. Perfect for daytime wear at the office or poolside.</li>
    <li> My twelve year old son actually had this in his collection first.  He has good taste.  Chip off the old block!</li>
    <li> I like this cologne.  This is also a great price.  I travel a lot and this is even cheaper that Duty Free prices.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Quality in this version is very questionable. I do not think it is the exact same one you can get in the store. The fragrance burns off really fast, in under a hour. I got Azzaro Chrome at Macy for $80 and It literally stayed on me all day and after a shower. I barely smelled this after 3 hours, inside with no air movement. Best to save your money and  buy it in the store, trust me its worth. Going to give this to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what its worth, I may just go get the one in the store and add on to this review to show the difference in quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for a dear friend&#x27;s birthday and believe me, his other friends got a lil jealous over it coz&#x27; it smelt fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> A great scent.  Not too strong, not too subtle.  Other colognes can be overwhelming, and really irritating, but this is perfect.  This was my second order.  Please do not buy this so that I can be the only person with this scent :-&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> The worst! Has no smell at all, must be water. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after smelling a bunch of colognes at the department store.  It has a nice light citrus-y scent.  Good for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> its not strong .. only complaint is that the scent doesnt last long.. but smells great and i ditched my  AE and very sexy cologne for this stuff and glad i did...  only issue was that the shipping info didnt seem to update so i was left in the dark as to when it arrived but im happy not very critical of minor issues</li>
    <li> excelente producto, muy bueno y llego justo a tiempo.</li>
    <li> I love it.....got here just in time for Father&#x27;s Day.  My husband loves this fragrance</li>
    <li> Great scent for summer - exquisite lime note.</li>
    <li> Cologne is such a personal matter ... but that being said ... I had several samples of this cologne from Macy&#x27;s and I really liked the fragrance and it stayed with me all day and had some nice compliments. The cologne I received isnt quite right. It smells fine in the morning but by the afternoon, it made me smell like i stepped in dog c***. I literally was checking my shoes. I thought maybe I was having an off day. But i wasnt it was the cologne. Anything I wore had to be washed because it was stinking up my closet. Maybe it was a practical joke from someone in the manufacturing of the bottle but I had to throw it out. Fortunately it didn&#x27;t cost much from amazon. I had bought Chanel from amazon several times too and the quality is inconsistent so I went back to paying more than double at Macy&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t know if these are old tester bottles or what.</li>
    <li> A little sweet but has a good smell.</li>
    <li> arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
