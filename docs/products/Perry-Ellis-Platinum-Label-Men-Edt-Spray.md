      <li>I bought this cologne for my husband 2 years ago and he loved it.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>You - I Love it !</li>
      <li>My boyfriend tried this scent at Macys and he really liked it, which says alot because he is so picky when it comes to cologne.  </li>
      <li>I kind of wish i hadn&#x27;t bought it.  </li>
      <li>and I liked it, a safe scent that I don&#x27;t find would be offensive.  </li>
      <li>and I liked the fragrance it has as many others have complimented also.</li>
      <li>is my favorite scent .And</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably end up giving this bottle away or selling it and getting something else :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fresh fragrance without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>So when I found it here on amazon for such a great price I had to get it.  </li>
      <li>Nothing fancy, nothing special.</li>
      <li>It smells little more &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; first 5min, and then its beautiful sweeter then &amp;#34;perry ellis 360&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I love the scent and the price, would highly recommend Perry Ellis Platinum.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an ok Cologne for a normal guy to wear maybe after a midday shower.</li>
      <li>It was about $50 more back then</li>
      <li>I received it today, sprayed some on the back of my hand and have kept smelling it throughout the day because it smells very familiar....</li>
      <li>this fragrance smells very much like Perry Ellis 360 Red / Acqua Di Gio but a light version.  </li>
      <li>so much cheaper to buy it here</li>
      <li>I looked it up on basenotes and couldn&#x27;t find much information on it.  </li>
      <li>he really likes it.</li>
      <li>Doubt it will get much attention...</li>
      <li>Price, Fast Delivery,&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
      <li>not as strong as i would like bought for my husband as a gift seems to be watered down</li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband based on other reviews and was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;d say pass on this, if you want a more subtle version of it then this is what you are looking for.  </li>
      <li>My first bottle was faulty in the spray mechanism .I received a replacement the other day no questions asked .This</li>

<li> it&#x27;s just an average joe.</li>
<li> Just 2 little sprays on the wrist and your set...</li>
<li> Was a waste of money and my husband doesn&#x27;t use.</li>

    <li> Im happy with the product and delivery time great fragance i got it as a gift for my brother he really likes it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok Cologne for a normal guy to wear maybe after a midday shower. Nothing fancy, nothing special. Doubt it will get much attention... it&#x27;s just an average joe.</li>
    <li> Awesome, Awesome scent....but it lasts for about 30 minutes. I would return it but threw out the box since i had tried it at the store. The amazon purchase did not last on my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, price, and delivery time.</li>
    <li> Note:  It smells little more &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; first 5min, and then its beautiful sweeter then &amp;#34;perry ellis 360&amp;#34; smell&lt;br /&gt;-Smells the same as any products at the mall...-&lt;br /&gt;Better Price, Fast Delivery,&lt;br /&gt;Thank You - I Love it !</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my husband 2 years ago and he loved it. It was about $50 more back then so I bought him a bottle this year!</li>
    <li> Well I tested this out at Macy&#x27;s and I liked it, a safe scent that I don&#x27;t find would be offensive.  I looked it up on basenotes and couldn&#x27;t find much information on it.  I received it today, sprayed some on the back of my hand and have kept smelling it throughout the day because it smells very familiar....this fragrance smells very much like Perry Ellis 360 Red / Acqua Di Gio but a light version.  I like this fragrance but now that I know I have something so similar to it I kind of wish i hadn&#x27;t bought it.  If you have 360 Red or ADG i&#x27;d say pass on this, if you want a more subtle version of it then this is what you are looking for.  I&#x27;ll probably end up giving this bottle away or selling it and getting something else :)</li>
    <li> My boyfriend tried this scent at Macys and he really liked it, which says alot because he is so picky when it comes to cologne.  At macys it could range from $65 &amp; up.  So when I found it here on amazon for such a great price I had to get it.  Also its a good size.</li>
    <li> Quality cologne for the low price, at the store it costs almost double!  It gives off a great odor that attracts the ladys guys!!!</li>
    <li> Appears to be the same, however having bought this product in the past the bottle and or cap to the bottle is not legit.&lt;br /&gt;But the fragrance is the same, or at least close to the same.</li>
    <li> This product did not smell the same as the one in the store . Was a waste of money and my husband doesn&#x27;t use. But your not allowed to return the product.</li>
    <li> I use it for two years. Very good fragance</li>
    <li> Just ordered another bottle. This was given to me as a gift and I liked the fragrance it has as many others have complimented also. It&#x27;s a fresh fragrance without being overwhelming. Just 2 little sprays on the wrist and your set...</li>
    <li> My first bottle was faulty in the spray mechanism .I received a replacement the other day no questions asked .This is my favorite scent .And so much cheaper to buy it here</li>
    <li> The sent is so heavenly</li>
    <li> just what i wanted , price was great</li>
    <li> Love it! Great fragrance!</li>
    <li> not as strong as i would like bought for my husband as a gift seems to be watered down he wears it for me</li>
    <li> one of my favorites. I keep around 5 different smells, this being one of my &amp;#34;good ones&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> somehow looses the scent after an hour</li>
    <li> I love the scent and the price, would highly recommend Perry Ellis Platinum.  It is one of my husband&#x27;s favorites.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband based on other reviews and was not disappointed. I would highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
