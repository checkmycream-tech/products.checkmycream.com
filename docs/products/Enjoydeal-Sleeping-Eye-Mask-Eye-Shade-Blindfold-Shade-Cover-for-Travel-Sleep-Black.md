<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> nice haven,t used yet</li>
    <li> I have a small head and it doesn&#x27;t fit and the nose part is so big I see light don&#x27;t buy this find somthing better only thing nice is it&#x27;s comfortable</li>
    <li> 3 of them for this price? Its a great deal. they are thick and block out all the light.  Can be molded nicely around the face and eyes because they are thick and high quality.</li>
    <li> I love the way these fit and with the ability to adjust the tightness is a plus! The only downside I have found with 2 of them so far is after one wash the bottom area around the nose has come apart and is a little annoying but nothing that is too unmanageable. In all great buy! Will be getting more too!</li>
    <li> Great mask and super comfortable! A very minimal amount of light leaks around the nose, but it&#x27;s extremely minimal so not an issue. Very happy with this! Also, I learned it holds up well in the washing machine. I didn&#x27;t realize it got mixed up with our bed sheets when I was doing laundry, but it came out good as new!</li>
    <li> Pretty good, fits almost perfectly. It gets the job done, worth the price.</li>
    <li> Works great and it got to me 2 weeks early!</li>
    <li> This face mask is too stiff, making it uncomfortable to sleep with if you are a side sleeper.</li>
    <li> it will do. took a long time to get to me. did not say it was coming from China but did. Good for the money I paid.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift. Great quality, and was very well accepted by my recipient.</li>
    <li> too small for a larger than average 30 y/o male head.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased them I only opened one and used it for about a week or so, after that the inside started to detach from the eye mask, I though maybe it was just the one but after opening the second eye shade the same thing happened , and also with the third. For the price I cannot complain , but would not recommed this product for someone looking to own a sleeping mask longer than 1 month.</li>
    <li> While they look kind of funny, they are very comfortable and soft and put you right to sleep!</li>
    <li> Got these for my dad for a Christmas happy. They are adjustable but they still don&#x27;t fit. My dad isn&#x27;t a big man but they don&#x27;t let out far enough. If the straps were just a little longer they would be perfect!!</li>
    <li> I only receive one piece.</li>
    <li> The mask is too large for my face. But it was cheap. Might fit a fat person face better. It shoulda been made smaller for normal size faces.</li>
    <li> Good price...long delivery and they let a little light in through the bottom.</li>
    <li> I received only one piece, instead of three!</li>
    <li> Love them. Fits comfortably and stays put.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Keeps the light out so I can get some sleep.</li>
    <li> Shipped promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at getting 3 eyeshades for this money.  They are great for day-sleepers like me since I work overnights.  Comfortable, adjustable, and complete block out the light if they are aligned corrected.</li>
    <li> Comfy fit, not too tight or loose. Small gap that allows light in nose area but barely noticeable. Great buy! 3 for the price of one and free shipping! Got here way quicker than I expected too.</li>
    <li> Have to sleep during day and tried many different sleeping maks.  This brand is the best so far. Fit is perfect and stays on while sleeping.</li>
    <li> received three masks for the low price, blocks the light pretty well (slight amount of light does get in through the nose, but very minimal), and super comfortable!</li>
    <li> This was my choice for early morning sleep ins.  No sun in my eyes, I love it.  The only problem may be in the summer, it could hold in too much body heat.</li>
    <li> This is my first eye mask.  I wanted to black out the TV light while listening to the sound lulling me to sleep.  There is a little light seepage around the nose with this mask, but when I wake up in the mornings and remove the mask, I am surprised by the amount of light in my room, even though I have blackout shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway… this mask is like an eye “bra”..it cups the eyes and is padded and shaped.  Very comfortable to wear.  It has elastic side straps that have Velcro ends which fasten behind the head.  It fits me fine, with my hair bonnet and all, but  the elastic straps are not adjustable like bra straps (1 star lost), but shouldn’t take too much effort to shorten them – a little thread, or a safety pin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sleep has gone to a new, better level.  It took me a few days to realize this.  It’s subtle …like I am resting  “more” of my brain than I was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying this mask – and you get three of them in the pack.  They&#x27;re unisex..not too girly for men.</li>
    <li> I know what you&#x27;re thinking. 3 of these for 4 dollars? They must be the flimsiest eye masks out there. NOT SO FAST MY FRIENDS! I&#x27;ve bought all kinds of eye masks for years, as I am a light sleeper (I also sleep with earplugs). I have paid way too much for all of them. They either wear down, have bulky straps or stain your sheets with black dye. And yes, many have been flimsy. These are the lightest, most comfortable, EFFECTIVE masks I&#x27;ve had. And you do in fact get 3 of them for one price. The mask is light, the eye portions are concave so the mask doesn&#x27;t press against your eyelids, and the strap is light and doesn&#x27;t have a bulky buckle or velcro straps so it doesn&#x27;t dig into your head or ear. So let&#x27;s say the elastic band on one wears out after...oh...6 months. Oh well, I have 2 more! Stop looking at other masks and get these.</li>
    <li> And at a great price. I had low expectations of quality because of the price, but was pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s comfortable, it works, and there&#x27;s 3 of them...  Regarding the headband, apparently they used to sell them with non-adjustable bands, but mine are adjustable using velcro closures.</li>
    <li> They work great.  I really like them.</li>
    <li> Now this is an eye mask that really works: comfortable, well-padded but lightweight and blocks out all unwanted light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it comes in a set of three - a great bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> This mask would be great except for one tragic flaw that makes it unusable. I wake up with black smudges all over my face, apparently from the dye coming off. I tried washing it in but the problem persists. I don&#x27;t know what chemicals are in the dye, but I have now developed rashes and clogged pores wherever the dye comes off. These masks are sold at an amazing price, but unfortunately, I can&#x27;t use them at all due to this problem. Use at own risk.</li>
    <li> The sleeping eye mask is perfect for blocking out any light and is very comfortable to wear. Perfect for my headaches</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re also comfortable and will stay on your head all night. If you like things really dark I would suggest these.</li>
    <li> So incredibly uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> So far they work grate. Of course you get what you pay for.... But at the end its a good value.</li>
    <li> slow to arrive but worth the wait</li>
    <li> When I sleep, just a little light can wake me up- and keep me up. These blindfolds are great, but I have only a few complaints. First, the gap for the nose was a little wide, so there was an opening on either side of my nostrils. Second, I recommend you wash them first before using them because they give off a weird smell when you first use them. Lastly, I find that they slip right off me when I wear them. I don&#x27;t know if this is just with me or because of the masks, but nonetheless I&#x27;m slightly perturbed at this inconvenience. Besides these issues, I recommend these sleep masks and enjoy being able to sleep longer.</li>
    <li> These sleep masks are quite comfortable and successfully block out the light. I&#x27;m thinking about getting another set and keeping them in storage for future use.</li>
    <li> Excellent Quality,great value.I have slept with eye shades for decades.These were an exceptional find.They do not allow any light to penetrate through.They are superior and do not create any sweat under them because of the design(contours),they are form fitting.I would definitely recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I like that 3 came in the package.  That way if I loose one I have a spare.  I also let my husband borrow one from time to time. It&#x27;s a comfortable fit and wear, and keeps all light out which in turn keeps me sleep.</li>
    <li> The eye mask came in a pack of three for 6$ total which is fairly cheap for the quality! The material is smooth and soft. It is blacked-Out so nothing can be seen when worn. Also, it is fitted to the eye and nose area which is convenient.</li>
    <li> Nice eye covers. Bang for buck good. Took a little while to receive, but was within their delivery date window...</li>
    <li> The sleep mask seems to fit great.  Someone had complained about the elastic but I think if all 3 masks wear out, it would be easy to attach a new piece of elastic to get even more wear out of them.</li>
    <li> Great quality mask, I love that it doesn&#x27;t rub on my eyelids. I feel ridiculous, but I sleep better!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and easy to sleep in. I work overnight so this is perfect when I need to sleep during the day</li>
    <li> All 3 of these fell apart. I had to throw them out and buy a different brand.</li>
    <li> These keep the light out and stay on my head just fine. The only downside is that two of them have started to fall apart. The fabric that covers the foam part is coming off. Other then that problem they fit my needs just fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent fit. Sturdy, soft, does not interrupt sleep. Very good coverage. Odor dissipates after 24 hours on a hanger.Ships very fast - about a week.</li>
    <li> Nice and comfortable. You can open your eyes when you have them on because of the shape. For the price I paid, I dont have complaints. Nice and soft, and the elastic has been pretty durable.</li>
    <li> After a few months, the inner side of it fell off</li>
    <li> The value is tremendous since these are so inexpensive.  They shipped air-mail from China but took longer to arrive than most purchases.  The nose size is good for China. If you have a big nose you will have to slit and touch the wound with fabric glue. You&#x27;ll see the foam inside, plenty of padding.  They look well-made and perhaps hand-made. The straps can rub on the upper ear stalks. You&#x27;re lucky if you&#x27;re a back sleeper. Sleeping on the side or stomach is OK (the mask is fine but can shift) but a pillow is highly advised to keep fluid from filling the skin around your eyes. Wearing a mask can put subtle pressure on the the skin around the eyes, scrunching and incubating wrinkles for middle-aged folks.</li>
    <li> Great price and way better then the masks i have gotten before. i didnt feel like my face and eyes were getting smuched.</li>
    <li> These sleep masks are very comfortable. The first night I wore it I fell asleep so quick. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is amazing, especially for the price! I can sleep during the day and even though there is the tiniest bit of light that shines through at the bottom from the nose piece, you&#x27;re in complete darkness. Also I didn&#x27;t have any skin irritation issues from the material.</li>
    <li> I sleep longer, later than I had previously.</li>
    <li> They kept extending the delivery date. First it was 2 weeks (which I accepted because I didn&#x27;t really need it) then it was extended to a month and a half. I seriously think they would have strung me along forever</li>
    <li> Well made and form fitting. No light seepage, comfortable. Great price fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great mask to help block out light so you can sleep.</li>
    <li> too big for my face. they need to offer this in different sizes</li>
    <li> For the price of one Dreamweaver eye mask, I can purchase three of these! I had purchased a Dreamweaver eye mask very similar to this but the unfinished edges of that mask separated the cloth from the foam after less than a year of use. These eye masks have seamed edges so they&#x27;ll never have the same issue. I love the cups over my eyes so my face doesn&#x27;t feel suffocated. The elastic band is about a centimeter wide and fits nicely. It would be a luxury if the band was adjustable for those with larger/smaller heads but it&#x27;s no issue to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing was that shipping took a while from China. Every part of my order arrived at least two weeks earlier than this and I started to consider that maybe the package had gotten lost in the mail. It finally did arrive in a small padded envelope and it&#x27;s not a big enough issue to affect my rating.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re alright. I mean ya, they cover your eyes, but a lot of light comes through and be ready for your family to call you Batman!!</li>
    <li> I like that these are not right against your face.</li>
    <li> Only came with one mask. It says 3. Good mask though and keeps out almost all light and is very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Kinda hurt the ears but other than that I love them</li>
    <li> Not enough padding.  Lets light in around bottom edge and nose.</li>
    <li> Works great! Such a great deal with three masks in one pack.</li>
    <li> I just received my order today and it only had one sleep mask rather than the 3 advertised.</li>
    <li> 3 of these little beauties for such a low price. i gave the extra 2 to my daughters who like to sleep in past sun-up. there may be a little gap around the nose where light comes in, otherwise these are very much worth the money!!</li>
    <li> WOW! My daughter and I love these sleeping masks. Since they are form fitting on the face, and have an adjustable Velcro closure on the back, they are very comfortable and keep the light out! This was such a great buy, allowing my daughter and me to both try one, and she kept the third one as a back-up, just in case she ever lost one, and leaves one in her suitcase for when she travels. They are very well made and of high quality. We will definitely be purchasing more of these as needed! They would make excellent gifts for those in your life that travel a lot or have a hard time sleeping without having the room pitch black.</li>
    <li> They stained my white pillowcases and sheets with purple dye.</li>
    <li> very soft but some light can still be seen</li>
    <li> The sleep shades fit comfortably but I did have them slip off my face the first night.  However, I may have removed them myself while sleeping  The only negative comment I have is that you can see a little out the bottom around the nose area, but they may have been designed that way. The shades seem to work well even with the nose area issue.</li>
    <li> Dye rubs off on pillowcase! At first we thought the blue ink stains were my husband&#x27;s wrist band for carpel tunnel. After some serious standing we realized otherwise. It&#x27;s these darn masks. What a mess. (The attached pic is one of the least damaged pillowcases).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a couple of times, and I&#x27;m really disappointed that the nose portion lets light come in from the bottom. I don&#x27;t use this for sleeping, which is it&#x27;s intended purpose, so I give it three stars, because I&#x27;m sure this is a great mask to sleep in. It&#x27;s comfy, the concave eye part of the mask is pretty neat. I think if you&#x27;re looking to use this mask for something other than sleeping, maybe find another product.</li>
    <li> Great price, great design, just what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> worth the price.  Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Nice item but it was added to my order and I didn&#x27;t order it, but was charged with and paid for anyway.  To much trouble to return.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting three of these, but only came with one. That was disappointing. They are pretty good quality and block out light. Would recommend. Just bummed because I thought I was getting three for the family.</li>
    <li> Works great, for those nights when my husband wants to watch TV, and I want to get some sleep.</li>
    <li> At first, because this mask was so inexpensive, I was dubious as to whether or not I would like it, but I am no longer in doubt.  I have arthritis in my back and cannot sleep longer than six hours without having to get up for an hour or more before going back to be to finish my night&#x27;s sleep.  This means that during the weekend, I am sometimes still in bed when the sun comes up.  I have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside so I use a mask.  This one works very well.  It is the first one I have ever owned that is sculpted over the eyes and nose and I thought this was probably just a gimmick, not so!  This mask works very well.  I am now a believer and will order more when they wear out.</li>
    <li> I ordered the set of 3 eye masks on Dec. 15 and they arrived today Jan. 6.  The product was shipped from China via Airmail.  I have found that the moulded eye and nose sections, seem to work best for me.  One reviewer stated that the mask was too large.  It seems to be a normal, standard sized face or sleep mask!  The concave eye sections allow you to open your eyes and allows for rapid eye motion while sleeping!  Many sleep masks do not cover the nose and allow in more light than this mask will!&lt;br /&gt;The only part I would change is the elastic used to hold the mask in place.  It is one piece and does not allow for any adjusting,  It does fit very well right now.&lt;br /&gt;If you are not in a hurry to get these sleep masks, you can&#x27;t beat this deal!</li>
    <li> These are too big for me and they pop up when I change positions. And they are not soft. I don&#x27;t like the feel of this fabric. My husband finds them good but does need them as often as I do.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy again.  I would prefer old airplane ones that are floating around the house.</li>
    <li> They work as good as you would think.</li>
    <li> These leave black marks all over pillow cases. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d leave black marks on face too, but I put a napkin under the mask. They are made in China. Many people who reviewed had same comments. That&#x27;s why they are so cheap. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> The eye shade fits well and allows full eye coverage for great sleep. Shipping took 3 weeks but since I knew this ahead of time, that was just fine.</li>
    <li> they are okay. If you dont have enough hair in the backside of your head they Velcro can be annoying. The elastic band should be broadened and cover with soft cloth because it feels uncomfortable. the lower edge of the mask could be elastic so it hugs the cheeks near nose and doesnt let light through the gap or atleast attach a soft cotton or velvet net that closes the gap.</li>
    <li> I am surprised at how light weight yet effective this mask is.  And for the price!!  Whoa!!  The only problem I have is that there is the slightest bit of light that creeps in through the bottom, but for a non-custom mask, this is fabulous.</li>
    <li> They took a while to get here direct from China, but earlier than their estimated delivery date.  The quality for the price is amazing.  I don&#x27;t know how long they will last, but at this price it doesn&#x27;t need to be long to be well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Very confortable, very nice, soft and perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;Im very happy and my husband too. We really like it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Thought we were getting a great deal....but if you sweat your in for a rude surprise. The black bleeds off, despite multiple washings and soaks,  onto your face leaving you to scrub your  face every morning. But not only does the black dye stain your face it was caused terrible headaches. These headache were only treated with prescription meds. Multiple test later and eventually fed up with mask stopped wearing and headaches are gone! Doc says it is possible the dye was causing a reactions from constant absorbing into blood stream. Very dangerous!</li>
    <li> like it, don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> Has good coverage and keeps it very dark.</li>
    <li> I been working at night for 8 years and since I purchase this I have been able to sleep a lot better , good buy for the money , some light does sip through the bottom but it&#x27;s minimal you get 3 for a great price</li>
    <li> I love them to ,Keeps the light out and you can actually open your eyes with theses on and not see a thing. Great deal on the price.</li>
    <li> I am not sure it is just my nose or the construction of the product but it doesn&#x27;t effectually block out rays of light around my nose.  My nose is not particularly big or small or oddly shaped.&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to receive this order, so much hit and miss with this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;The material is very nice and light.&lt;br /&gt;The elastic band and velcro strips on the back were too small for my head.  I had to adjust the straps so that only the minimum amount of overlap was set.  I do have a big head, but I have seen plenty bigger too.</li>
    <li> I do not know if it fits all people but my dad is 6&#x27;2 and I am 5&#x27;6. I got these for my dad who has a fluctuating schedule.  They work very well.  3 are in a pack.  There s a dimple over the eye area so nothing touches your eye.  The nose is comfortable. For us at least no light gets in, even in a very bright place. Aloha Joe</li>
    <li> great feel, super price</li>
    <li> I WAS JUST EXPECTING ONE AND I GOT 3 WOW WHAT A DEAL THIS WAS&lt;br /&gt;WAS A LIL CONFUSED ABOUT THE DATE IT GOT HERE BUT I DID A CONTACT AND INQUIRY&lt;br /&gt;THIS TOLD ME AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE AFTER THAT WAS A LITTLE LONG IN THE TOOTH&lt;br /&gt;FOR SHIPPING BUT THATS OK SOMETIMES THINGS TAKE TIME&lt;br /&gt;SOME BETTER THAN OTHERS; BUT THIS WAS GREAT I GIVE AN A+++++++++&lt;br /&gt;OOOOOOOOOOOH TY TY TY TY</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to wear and I love that it completely blocks the light</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this. It blocks out light but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my face and I end up waking up when the sun comes up anyway. I prefer the one I made from the extra fleece I had from when I made a tie blanket. It&#x27;s super cute, matches my blanket, and I was able to make it the shape I wanted so it stays put all night.</li>
    <li> Definitely keeps the light out!!!</li>
    <li> Des not block the light; comes on from the bottom. Thought this was thevsame one I lost two years ago but it&#x27;s not. That one made it pitch black but this one lets in 20-15% light....will have to keep looking.</li>
    <li> It took a veeeeery long time to be delivered, was only 1 piece (not 3 pieces as advertised) and has a bit of a smell. Blocks light well-ish, but not super comfortable.</li>
    <li> At first I was surprised at the apparent quality of these sleep masks, considering the rock-bottom price.  But after using for a few nights, I noticed the material was rubbing off on my face.  Even after washing my face with an exfoliating scrub there were still tiny black particles clogging many pores right above my brow.  I&#x27;m going to try washing it a few times and see if it still sheds, but I will probably end up looking for a product made of natural materials instead of risking my skin-health to this product.</li>
    <li> Good job fellows. The package was received OK. Thanks very much</li>
    <li> The material is a bit stiff and so, depending on the shape of your nose, light may come in through the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t sit on your eyelids but allows for a bubble around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Good price. But I would like to have seen either an adjustable nose piece or a softer material that closes the gap underneath, like many eye masks have. (this one has no such material beside the nose piece that rests on your cheeks).</li>
    <li> Only one instead of three</li>
    <li> These eye shades are on the large side.  The elastic band is not adjustable (one single elastic strip).  Those who have smaller faces and heads will likely find it on the looser side and not very snug (as I do).  It will also allow a little bit of light as a result.  But on the upside (and what I like about it), there is no annoying buckle or clasp poking at the back of your head or side of your head when you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers note that it is not color fast.  This is true. If it falls off your head and you roll on it, it will likely leave a black mark on your sheets.  But on the other hand, you get three shades for (at the time of this writing) under 4 dollars (!)</li>
    <li> These contoured shades eliminate the problem of flat masks touching your eyelashes. The contoured shape looks odd, but works great. They block out essentially 100% of the light. I&#x27;ve been able to sleep for a couple of hours after sunrise in a bright room. One negative - since they ship from Hong Kong so it takes a couple of weeks to get them. If you need them at the last minute you are out of luck.</li>
    <li> cover the face well, they will stain your pillows if you sweat at all, wash them thouroughly.</li>
    <li> It has a fitted nose piece, which many may like but I prefer a little pressure on my eyes to help me fall asleep</li>
    <li> comfortable. stay mostly in place during sleep.</li>
    <li> These eye masks saved me last summer when I traveled to Estonia and Norway where the sun really doesnt fully go down at night.  So if it wasnt for these I would never had fallen asleep.  My only complaint was that occasionally they would shift while i was wearing them and allow some light to come in.</li>
