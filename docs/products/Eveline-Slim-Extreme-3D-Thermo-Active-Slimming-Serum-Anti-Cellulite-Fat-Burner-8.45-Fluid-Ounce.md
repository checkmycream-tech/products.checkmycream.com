    <li> I love this product!!! I ordered the item on Sumday and it arrived to me by Friday. This is very different than other creams I&#x27;ve used.

    <li> Holy shiz this is hot!!!! will post later to tell if it works......Update, I really love it. But u do need to use it for about a month before you can see the difference but you can see the difference. It also isn&#x27;t quite as hot after the first time you use it.

    <li> Love this product I&#x27;ve tried it with a waist trainer and you can feel the slight burning sensation. I have also tried it without the waist trainer and I can&#x27;t really feel the burning sensation therefore I always put my cream on with the waist trainer in the morning and at night before bed. I have noticed results but apart from putting the cream I&#x27;ve been eating right and exercising.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a good product. I would buy it again. I found out it will work even better if you use cling wrap with it</li>
