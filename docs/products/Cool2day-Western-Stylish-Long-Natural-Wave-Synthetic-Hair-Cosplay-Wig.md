      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more platinum than what is pictured.</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d buy another for sure.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>and this one was definitely the best.</li>
      <li>needs a better pictures.</li>
      <li>I ordered this mostly for the color and the bangs were what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>The color is more yellowish than it appears to be on the website.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased with my purchase of this wig, It looks exactly like the photo.</li>
      <li>For the price, definitely not bad!</li>
      <li>No tangles, the flyaways are easily tamed with smoothing cream, and no issues with the wig cap.</li>
      <li>tangles, the flyaways are easily tamed with smoothing cream, and no issues with the wig cap.</li>
      <li>Also pleased the wig was shipped quickly and came sooner than the anticipated date of delivery.</li>
      <li>The hair is very soft and once it&#x27;s styled according to your face shape, it should look good.</li>
      <li>No styling necessary and great price</li>
      <li>cheap; you get what you pay for</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t quite fit me the way I&#x27;d hoped, but that&#x27;s the risk you take when you buy it online without tying it on.</li>
      <li>You could see the netting section underneath the hair which made it look cheap and un-natural.  </li>
      <li>this one was cheap though</li>
      <li>/&gt;After several uses, the wig still looks great.</li>
      <li>Worth the money, quality, and I will be looking for more Cool2day manufactured wigs.</li>
      <li>He enjoyed it very much ....</li>
      <li>On the positive side, it&#x27;s not shiny like most cheap wigs.</li>
      <li>The Cool2day wigs I have are actually some of the most lightweight ones I own.</li>
      <li>The rest feel very synthetic, but I enjoyed this one.</li>
      <li>The only thing this would be good for would be maybe a Halloween costume to be worn once.</li>
      <li>but my brother put it on top of my air infuser and the hot tip of it literarily melted the hair onto it!&lt;br /&gt;Cheap cheap cheap.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty.</li>
      <li>I tried to play with it for a long time but no matter what I did it just didn&#x27;t look good at all.  </li>
      <li>The wig in the picture looks like it has darker lowlights and seems more natural.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it.</li>
      <li>However, they did not give me a return stamp and just sent me their address in China (which would not be worth the shipping..).</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t even worth sending back.&lt;br</li>
      <li>a little shorter then i expected but good quality and good fun!</li>
      <li>Daughters loved it for high school musical.</li>
      <li>I have bleached blond hair right now myself but this color just did not go with my skin tone</li>
      <li>Product hairstyle was beautiful only neg is product hair was literally white</li>
      <li>The coverage is great; I have long black hair that was easily hidden with a wig cap and the bonus wig cap that comes sewn into this wig, which is one of the best parts about it.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s great for small headed women &amp; those who don&#x27;t have a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very much like pictured</li>
      <li>It looks very natural and is easily mistaken for real hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.this is the second one  </li>
      <li>The Cool2day wigs I have are actually some of the most lightweight ones I own.er.     </li>
      <li>looks so pretty in the picture</li>
      <li>Exactly what i wanted</li>
      <li>It is long and looks as if curlers were used to make it cute and wavy.</li>
      <li>Its way more blonde than white looking in this pic which is exactly like I was hoping!!</li>
      <li>The color and such are pretty accurate.</li>
      <li>Shiny and the texture of the hair was very realistic.</li>
      <li>For the money, this is a pretty high quality wig.</li>
      <li>and now i know its just a cheap play wig for dress up play or something, not something you would want to be seen in in public.</li>
      <li>Real looking and very inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The picture is light blonde, probably 613.</li>
      <li>The emails I received were very polite and they do take returns.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered wigs before and this was the closest one I have had that felt somewhat real.</li>
      <li>I bought several of these cheap wigs (going through treatment for breast cancer</li>
      <li>The bangs for the one that I received were a lot longer then pictured; almost as long as the wig itself; but it was an easy fix.</li>
      <li>The one I received is very similar to the picture aside from the length of the bangs and slight color change (mine is a shade darker) but it makes it look more natural and the styling is even better then pictured, it was ready to wear straight from the bag.</li>
      <li>I have had much better luck with other products</li>
      <li>Not something for everyday but, very cool for alone fun time with my man.</li>
      <li>At this point, I will most likely toss it out because now the wig cap is showing in the front and back.</li>
      <li>I wish I could pin them back further because I don&#x27;t normally like my hair touching my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It looks cute plain and down but super adorable in a low side ponytail.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend buying this item.</li>
      <li>The other wigs are very shiny (I will work with them) but this wig, right out of the bag, looks very real.</li>
      <li>I use normal smoothing cream on it and non-aerosol hairspray to keep it in place.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not like the picture at all!!! Ended up giving it to someone else!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t liked doesn&#x27;t want I see</li>
    <li> Not as good quality for price.Fringe to heavy.</li>
    <li> cheap; you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the color is a bright neon yellow and it is clearly made of some sort of plastic material.  Was going to try and send it back but my brother put it on top of my air infuser and the hot tip of it literarily melted the hair onto it!&lt;br /&gt;Cheap cheap cheap.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
    <li> The blonde color you see is not what you get, the wig i got was like a white blonde and shorter then picture</li>
    <li> Its so soft and pretty a little darker then the picture but it is awesome ! Came in a month because it came from china</li>
    <li> Eh. I ordered this mostly for the color and the bangs were what I was looking for. Unfortunately, the color in the picture is a little darker than in real life. The actual color is closer to white blonde, or like a Marilyn Monroe kind of color. Very pale. The wig in the picture looks like it has darker lowlights and seems more natural. This wig is all one color and does not really look so natural. But the hair is soft and moves like natural hair. Unfortunately you have to be super careful with it because it tangles easily. The length comes to my mid back, just like in the picture. It looks cute plain and down but super adorable in a low side ponytail. The bangs sort of hang in my face and keep flopping in my eyes. I&#x27;m scared to death of cutting them in case I mess up, so I will probably pin them back with a bobby pin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual wig seems very durable. I&#x27;ve only worn it twice for a short amount of time, but the construction seems like good quality considering some of the wigs I&#x27;ve previously owned. I am not a wig expert, I only wear them for costumes/cosplay, but I like this one. The net actually has some kind of covering on it between itself and the hair, which is flesh colored like a pale skinned scalp. It fits well, I don&#x27;t think it will fall off, slip, or blow away. But it doesn&#x27;t quite cover my baby hairs on the side of my face (most wigs won&#x27;t) so I need the side bangs. I wish I could pin them back further because I don&#x27;t normally like my hair touching my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to update my review after using this wig several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several uses, the wig still looks great. I am very careful with it but I have styled it many times and it still looks great. I use normal smoothing cream on it and non-aerosol hairspray to keep it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig hairs are a little slippery and bobby pins tend to slide out after 30-90 mins. I either have to keep fixing them or spray the bobby pins with hairspray to help them hold better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No tangles, the flyaways are easily tamed with smoothing cream, and no issues with the wig cap. It is kinda heavy and started to hurt my neck after wearing it for a long time but that seemed pretty normal with a lot of wigs I&#x27;ve used. The Cool2day wigs I have are actually some of the most lightweight ones I own.er.     No tangles, the flyaways are easily tamed with smoothing cream, and no issues with the wig cap. It is kinda heavy and started to hurt my neck after wearing it for a long time but that seemed pretty normal with a lot of wigs I&#x27;ve used. The Cool2day wigs I have are actually some of the most lightweight ones I own.</li>
    <li> The cap only fits the crown of my head. The wig itself is super cheap feeling and looks fake too. It is near white in color and straight. Good length though</li>
    <li> The color isn&#x27;t natural, it looks like a pale lemon yellow color, not a natural blonde. The hair is very soft and once it&#x27;s styled according to your face shape, it should look good. The only thing that gives it away is its color. On the positive side, it&#x27;s not shiny like most cheap wigs. Be VERY careful when you brush it out! I would brush it a little every time before putting it on and hair would fall out! It has only lasted me 3 weeks. At this point, I will most likely toss it out because now the wig cap is showing in the front and back.</li>
    <li> Not something for everyday but, very cool for alone fun time with my man. He enjoyed it very much ....</li>
    <li> it is actually quite realistic considering its a synthetic wig. I was pretty impressed. only negative thing I would say is its not nearly as long as the picture shows. its probably about as long as it shows the hair in the front of the mannequin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.this is the second one  that I had bought.the customer .service was great.I love it.thank you.</li>
    <li> The worst wig i ever bought!! I only wore it one time and i was sick of it!! The hairs were falling out everywhere and the color was extremely light which made the wig look really fake!! The feeling and texture was soft, but you can only use one style and thats the style it came with. I know the price is not bad, but don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
    <li> Horrible quality.&lt;br /&gt;Was not the right color.&lt;br /&gt;I am not aware of any way to receive a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Was not pleased at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig thinking it would be pretty fake looking when in fact it&#x27;s a lot of natural looking than my other two wigs (which I&#x27;ll review). The other wigs are very shiny (I will work with them) but this wig, right out of the bag, looks very real. It&#x27;s a very long wig though. I&#x27;ll post pics when I have some time. Worth the money, quality, and I will be looking for more Cool2day manufactured wigs.</li>
    <li> Very full and looks good. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Product hairstyle was beautiful only neg is product hair was literally white didnt look platinum blonde was literally white I personally didnt like the color but some of u might...</li>
    <li> The color and such are pretty accurate. Doesn&#x27;t quite fit me the way I&#x27;d hoped, but that&#x27;s the risk you take when you buy it online without tying it on. I bought several of these cheap wigs (going through treatment for breast cancer so I got more expensive wigs from an actual shop) and this one was definitely the best. The cut in the picture is how it came and it came styled like the picture. I have some others that had slightly carrying cuts or came with crimps or folds you can&#x27;t get out because they aren&#x27;t heat tolerant so they&#x27;re basically useless. For the price, definitely not bad!</li>
    <li> I ordered a completely different wig and I logged in to check on the status.. I noticed the picture had changed AND the wig number AND the delivery/shipping dates. I&#x27;ve ordered enough products to know that when you make an order, NONE of that info/images change m</li>
    <li> The packaging is in a plastic bag not a box like in the picture and surprise surprise, it bends the hair in weird ways and its bent now for good and i cant wear it without it looking like a wig. The hairnet type wrap that goes underneath is ridiculous and unable to close it or keep it in place without bobby pins. I thought i would wear when i was having a bad hair day and now i know its just a cheap play wig for dress up play or something, not something you would want to be seen in in public.</li>
    <li> I would give it a five but the cap was not laced it&#x27;s a Good quality  and fit good u can cover the  front hairline of cap.  with the bangs  it&#x27;s very much like pictured so it&#x27;s a great deal for the price I&#x27;d buy another for sure.</li>
    <li> For costume and distance theatre, yes! For up close - the hair is thin and sparse and you can see the cap significantly.</li>
    <li> Looks really fake like a barbie, this wig would never pass as real hair, its too shiney in a bad way.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive ($12 with shipping? Yes) wig that didn&#x27;t look quite as fake as a halloween costume wig so taht I could see how my hair would look blonde. This definitely did the trick. It&#x27;s long, and the color is quite pretty in person. Doesn&#x27;t have that unreal shine like a lot of wigs do. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I might not use it for every day wear, but I think I could if I wanted to.</li>
    <li> Daughters loved it for high school musical.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and a fairly big head. I am not able to put my hair in a wig cap  and put on this wig. It just will not fit no matter how much I try to stretch it (and it&#x27;s not very stretchy). I think it&#x27;s great for small headed women &amp; those who don&#x27;t have a lot of hair. I have to put my hair in a low pony tail and pin it at the base of my neck for it to work. And, it is still tight. Otherwise, the wig looks good on. It does need some training. It&#x27;s a bit more platinum than what is pictured.</li>
    <li> Very pretty. Shiny and the texture of the hair was very realistic. I usually prefer a longer length but this piece made up for the length in quality and style! Thank you!</li>
    <li> My wife got this and wasnt very pleased she says its small dont look very real I have had much better luck with other products this one was cheap though so I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Real looking and very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;My mom needed a wig and I bought her this was and she was very pleased.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my purchase of this wig, It looks exactly like the photo. I highly recommend buying this item.</li>
    <li> Worst wig I have ever bought in my life. Never again</li>
    <li> This is very nice. It is long and looks as if curlers were used to make it cute and wavy. It is a natural looking dirty blonde, not old white or stripper platinum. Cap was included too. Did not take long to receive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the worst wig I have ever purchased</li>
    <li> Be careful when ordering from this company. It&#x27;s always risky when ordering wigs online, but I had hoped the wig I ordered would match the image. The picture is light blonde, probably 613. The wig I received (after waiting 4 weeks) was 30 highlighted with 613, so a very dark blonde, and I had ordered specifically for the color pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put in for a return request. The emails I received were very polite and they do take returns. However, they did not give me a return stamp and just sent me their address in China (which would not be worth the shipping..). I also sent a picture of the wig I received and they said I got the correct wig. But the image on the site definitely is not a match.</li>
    <li> For the money, this is a pretty high quality wig. I have a few wigs (purchased elsewhere) that cost more and aren&#x27;t as nice. Very pleased!!! Also pleased the wig was shipped quickly and came sooner than the anticipated date of delivery. All around a good experience. Thanks!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this wig! I have bought tons of wigs in the past online, and this is by far my favorite (I have the same in 2 other colors). It looks very natural and is easily mistaken for real hair. The coverage is great; I have long black hair that was easily hidden with a wig cap and the bonus wig cap that comes sewn into this wig, which is one of the best parts about it. The adjustable cap inside allows it to stay in place perfectly and prevents see-through spots. The bangs for the one that I received were a lot longer then pictured; almost as long as the wig itself; but it was an easy fix. I got mine from a US warehouse that had it in stock for a store based out of China, so I think the changes mentioned in other reviews between color and length, and the slight differences from the picture are just due to the product coming from several different locations. The one I received is very similar to the picture aside from the length of the bangs and slight color change (mine is a shade darker) but it makes it look more natural and the styling is even better then pictured, it was ready to wear straight from the bag.</li>
    <li> as described  l can&#x27;t wait to wear</li>
    <li> Its way more blonde than white looking in this pic which is exactly like I was hoping!! The curls are perfect!! The length is perfect!! &amp; everybody says it looks amazing on me!! Deff would recommend!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered wigs before and this was the closest one I have had that felt somewhat real. The rest feel very synthetic, but I enjoyed this one. Color of the wig is as pictured. I haven&#x27;t worn it too many times to give it a wash in warm water or style it, but I thought it was a great purchase for the price!</li>
    <li> I just  got my wig and I love it. However, you can see the underneath...people will know it is fake. Why is it like that? what can I do to hide it?</li>
    <li> Horrible wig it doesn&#x27;t stay on my head. It sheds horribly. So if you want a good wig don&#x27;t but this one because its a costume wig.</li>
    <li> not what it looks like.... i didn&#x27;t like it at all! needs a better pictures. this isn&#x27;t a good wig.</li>
    <li> Very poor wig. And the customer service on the cool2day end was awful if it wouldn&#x27;t cost me to send it back I would but for now I&#x27;ll keep the balding wig. Yes its bald in the back.</li>
    <li> This wig was crap and is now in the trash. I cannot honestly understand the great reviews??? The hair itself felt great and looked great,but the issue was that the wig cap kept showing through. The hairs were so thin in the back of the wig, there was no way to cover the cap. And the cap also was showing through in the front by the hairline, and no way to cover that up. Piece of crap :(</li>
    <li> I tried it on and threw it into the garbage can. It wasn&#x27;t even worth sending back.&lt;br /&gt;It looks so pretty in the picture but it is so badly made that you cannot fir it on your head.&lt;br /&gt;It will not comb and you can&#x27;t even use your hands to fix it. Total waste of money</li>
    <li> This wig was really poor quality.  You could see the netting section underneath the hair which made it look cheap and un-natural.  The color is more yellowish than it appears to be on the website.  I tried to play with it for a long time but no matter what I did it just didn&#x27;t look good at all.  I have bleached blond hair right now myself but this color just did not go with my skin tone and I doubt it would go with anyone&#x27;s skin tone.  The only thing this would be good for would be maybe a Halloween costume to be worn once.</li>
    <li> a little shorter then i expected but good quality and good fun!</li>
    <li> very nice product and great price</li>
    <li> My granddaughter picked this out for her Halloween costume and she said it will be perfect! Even came with a wig cap.</li>
    <li> Do not give up on this wig! Brush it out , styal it in a low poney with a flower bow or headband and it truly looks good and is comfortable on. Any time you get a new wig do not just throw it on your head. Make it yours and mess with it. I was really pleased with this one!</li>
    <li> No styling necessary and great price</li>
