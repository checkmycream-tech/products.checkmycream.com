<li> They take slightly longer to work  </li>

<li> Hopefully we don&#x27;t find out in another 5 years that it does something horrible to your heart and hastens an early death.</li>
<li> It would be difficult for me to advise whether one should buy it.</li>
<li> There were some mornings I had taken these when I woke with a particularly bad one.</li>

<ol>
    <li> This really helps me when I get minor anxiety .  I am so glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my mother,she said it&#x27;s nothing to talk about.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a family member. She reported good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE FEB. 2016: My family member still thinks this product has some merit, but she seldom uses it. It would be difficult for me to advise whether one should buy it. Based on her ambivalence, I am reducing my rating from five stars to three stars.</li>
    <li> These worm really well, without leaving the groggy hangover of other sleeping pills.</li>
    <li> The product gave me an upset stomach.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help me sleep but it did not help me sleep at all so I will not be purchasing this in the future.</li>
    <li> excellent product does the trick for me never have to worry about not sleeping again!</li>
    <li> I have bought Calms for years and it has helped ease an active mind when trying to fall asleep.  I wonder if this is a different formula than it used to be?  I don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;you&amp;#34; but I buy this because I want it to be a Drowsy formula.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Hopefully we don&#x27;t find out in another 5 years that it does something horrible to your heart and hastens an early death. It really helps me sleep.</li>
    <li> Wow - this works really well - have to be careful how much I take - knocks me out - even give 2 to my dog (35 lbs) to manage his anxiety at night - helps him sleep through the night! and me, too!</li>
    <li> I worked graveyard for 5+ years and refused to take a prescription to help me sleep.  I finally listened to a friend of mine who had told me about this product.  Boy, was I glad that I did.  A totally natural way to help me sleep.  Nothing addictive in this product.  And I slept like a baby.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years. I first purchased it because I was a nervous wreck going through a bad break up and it was the only thing that would calm me. Also, being that I always had problems sleeping and could not fall asleep because I was constantly thinking that I was not going to be able to go to sleep, I would take 3 tablets and it would relax me enough that I would fall asleep no problem. I did not stay sleeping the whole night but it kept me relaxed enough that I could go back to sleep. You can also take a few more if you can&#x27;t go back to sleep and it would not have any affect on you the following morning.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast service</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 3 months.  It helps me relax naturally to prepare for a restful sleep without any side effects.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this and also Alluna (NOT TOGETHER!). I like these because they are in a compact bottle.They take slightly longer to work  but they do work. I do suffer from morning headaches and I need to keep a chart.  There were some mornings I had taken these when I woke with a particularly bad one. If I find a definite pattern I will update this review as I will probably discontinue them.  However,in their favor, sometimes if I have a long day and evening to get through, if I take one and lay down for an hour they are very relaxing even if I don&#x27;t sleep. With these products everyone reacts differently so you almost have to try a couple products.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have to worry about it being addictive. Will put you too sleep if you take it a couple hours before your ready to sleep. Ready liked it.</li>
    <li> Love these tablets... They really work to give you a good nights sleep.. These pills are safe without any harmful drugs..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always worked for me and helped me get to sleep faster.</li>
    <li> I use this regularly &amp; prefer it over other OTC sleeping aids, even though it is not as strong.  I don&#x27;t wake up groggy, even if I&#x27;ve taken a couple at 3 a.m. I like that I can keep &#x3D;them bedside &amp; don&#x27;t require water as they dissolve under your tongue. They don&#x27;t dissolve as easily as Hyland&#x27;s Nerve tonic (for day use) but perhaps the sucking/dissolving process is part of the process that helps you get to sleep! It arrived on time &amp; undamaged.</li>
    <li> Did not help me sleep or relax.</li>
    <li> I gave these to my children years ago to help them settle down to sleep, and now I take one each night to help me drop off to sleep. Mild and effective.</li>
