      <li>It&#x27;s a very good scent for someone who wants to be noticed, but not overpower the&lt;br /&gt;colognes of men or women.</li>
      <li>This is a great first aftershave, potentially a great first cologne, and honestly there&#x27;s a reason some people will stick with it.</li>
      <li>, the scent is awesome, not too strong but still noticeable, and chicks dig older guys...</li>
      <li>Love these, purchase as a gift for my husband</li>
      <li>This splash-on is very impressive, with lasting fragrance that is not overpowering or too</li>

      <li>Have been using Brut for close to 20 years or more.  </li>
      <li>This is aftershave (and for that matter cologne) 101, and generally a really safe bet.</li>
      <li>I love this cologne</li>
      <li>Product was taped over the top.  </li>
      <li>Will be purchasing more when I run out.</li>
      <li>Have worn Brut for years and it is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Nice clean smell.  </li>
      <li>Almost all shaving lotions are overpriced these days, but this is a pretty good buy in that context.</li>
      <li>Generally a good product at a more than reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Very soft and smell great.</li>
      <li>I like this lotion &#x27;cause it is easy on your skin.</li>
      <li>Splashes on easy.</li>
      <li>Good buy on an old favorite.  </li>
      <li>I used to use this when I shaved my head, and it kept my scalp smooth and free of itching.</li>
      <li>nice and reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>but it is a very fresh scent.</li>
      <li>The order was placed, knowing they are not making the original scent anymore</li>
      <li>Is ths original scent i remembered.</li>
      <li>so they never bothered me like they do some people), but my first recommendation for most others in either category would be Brut.</li>
      <li>Overall, 5/5 rating… excellent and affordable fragrance that can be used anytime, anywhere and never gets old!</li>
      <li>aftershave is Pinaud Clubman, and my first choice for a &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; aftershave is Gillette, but those both burn more than this (I&#x27;m used to alcohol bases aftershaves plus my skin is on the oily side</li>
      <li>YOU COOL FRESH  </li>
      <li>Does the job well and it worth the money.</li>
      <li>An old standby, I use it for daily shaving when not needing or wanting the good stuff.</li>
      <li>If I was going to put together a grooming kit for a teenager who was just about to start shaving for the first time, this would be part of it.</li>
      <li>Me, my first choice for an &amp;#34;available anywhere&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Is this stuff supposed to smell EXACTLY like the stuff they use at barbers and mens haircut places?</li>
      <li>Will recommend to anyone interested in this product.</li>
      <li>Ok, so I may be getting up in years, but I think that gives me the pleasure of getting back to the stuff that I used to use.</li>
      <li>Great smell and long lasting!!!!</li>
      <li>The same old nice fragance.</li>
      <li>(It is extremely easy to accidentally use way too much if not careful).</li>
      <li>(so the &amp;#34;Essence of a Man&amp;#34; tagline is a pretty reasonable description).</li>
      <li>Also, this is really, really inexpensive, even by the standards of the supermarket.</li>
      <li>The scent is very durable.</li>
      <li>I am from Colombia and here is so difficult to find this kind of product in such a good price.</li>
      <li>,SO WOMEN CAN ALSO ENJOY THIS LOVELY SCENT.A TOUCH BEHIND THE EAR</li>
      <li>If I wanted classic scent, I would of ordered classic scent.  </li>
      <li>Its not my personal standby anymore because it has a scent note that I think is really funky, but I&#x27;ve never met anyone else who notices that particular scent note, so I would generally recommend this first to someone who wants to add an aftershave (or a splash on cologne for that matter) to their grooming regime for the first time.</li>
      <li>Personally, I&#x27;m not capable of describing the scent better than I just did above (ok, I should also have added &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; to the list of adjectives) because I have no idea what else smells like Brut, and there are no distinct scent ingredients listed on the label just &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I just wish it was sealed like it was new.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not really expensive and doesnt dry out your face too much</li>
      <li>In my opinion, I find this best for casual, everyday use and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as harsh as many perfumes/colognes.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to smell fresh and clean in a subtle manner, without having to use very strong and/or expensive colognes/perfumes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite gentle (for an alcohol based aftershave), and it contains a couple of obvious moisturizing ingredients.</li>
      <li>Completely keeps my face clear of bumps.</li>
      <li>i always feel completely refreshed using it</li>
      <li>It has a nice fresh and classic/natural smell and feel to it with a slight cooling effect, and a little goes a very long way with this product</li>
      <li>and it last me almost a full year using it every other day.</li>
      <li>PERFUME.HUBBY &amp; DAD WILL ONLY USE THIS BRAND,&amp; IT IS LONG LASTING FRESH SMELL,IN THE BATHROOM</li>
      <li>Classic Brut long lasting fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cool, fresh, and green without being the least bit girly</li>
      <li>but I can get a nine ounce bottle of geeric that smells the same at Dollar General for a buck seventy five.</li>

<li> but I can get a nine ounce bottle of geeric that smells the same at Dollar General for a buck seventy five.</li>
<li> This is not original scent as pictured, they sent classic, told them to take it off the website.  </li>
<li> my girlfriend always makes fun of me for smelling like a grandpa, but im seriously</li>
<li> you only will find imitation.</li>
<li> Was not new.  </li>
<li> Brut Splash-on Lotion, 7 Ounces JUST A LITTLE ,GOES A LONG WAY</li>
<li> Brut fragrance is manly, and works well with other products like deodorants and hair gels/&lt;br /&gt;tonics.  </li>
<li> The 7 oz bottle (which would last me for months) is usually around $4 where I am.</li>
<li> The smell is assertive without being overpowering, and unlikely to offend anyone unless you really douse yourself in it.</li>
<li> Just buy one small lotion</li>
<li> and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
<li> and I will never get tired of it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 40 years, but have noticed it&#x27;s very difficult to find during the holidays.</li>

Overall, 5/5 rating… excellent and affordable fragrance that can be used anytime, anywhere and never gets old!</li>
    <li> I have been using Brut splash on for over 30 years. This is the best splash on the&lt;br /&gt;market. Please continue to produce this product.</li>
    <li> Love these, purchase as a gift for my husband</li>
    <li> Ok, so I may be getting up in years, but I think that gives me the pleasure of getting back to the stuff that I used to use. This product is great!!!! Great smell and long lasting!!!! Now if I could only find a sixer of Michelob for $2.50, I&#x27;d be in like Flynn!!!</li>
    <li> Brings me back to the 80s!  Nice clean smell.  I scored within an hour of applying the Brut.  Woo Hoo!</li>
    <li> This splash-on is very impressive, with lasting fragrance that is not overpowering or too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;The Brut fragrance is manly, and works well with other products like deodorants and hair gels/&lt;br /&gt;tonics.  It&#x27;s a very good scent for someone who wants to be noticed, but not overpower the&lt;br /&gt;colognes of men or women.</li>
    <li> Was not new.  Product was taped over the top.  The fragrance seems good and I don&#x27;t have any problems with it.  I just wish it was sealed like it was new.</li>
    <li> Brut Splash-on Lotion, 7 Ounces JUST A LITTLE ,GOES A LONG WAY WITH BRUT.I SAY THAT IT&#x27;S ALSO UNISEX,SO WOMEN CAN ALSO ENJOY THIS LOVELY SCENT.A TOUCH BEHIND THE EAR WILL TURN HEADS AS THEY COMPLIMENT YOU COOL FRESH  PERFUME.HUBBY &amp; DAD WILL ONLY USE THIS BRAND,&amp; IT IS LONG LASTING FRESH SMELL,IN THE BATHROOM ALSO AFTER USE.</li>
    <li> Good buy on an old favorite.  Almost all shaving lotions are overpriced these days, but this is a pretty good buy in that context.</li>
    <li> Good product  as all of the Brut items are.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift. My dad loves it!!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion &#x27;cause it is easy on your skin. Very soft and smell great. I have been using this lotion from time to time all my life and I will never get tired of it. I guess you have to try it yourself in order to understand what I am trying to say over here. Just buy one small lotion and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
    <li> this product has a solid amount of burn/irritation relief combined with perfume.  my girlfriend always makes fun of me for smelling like a grandpa, but im seriously, the scent is awesome, not too strong but still noticeable, and chicks dig older guys...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, it&#x27;s not really expensive and doesnt dry out your face too much</li>
    <li> Brut is great. Completely keeps my face clear of bumps. I used to use this when I shaved my head, and it kept my scalp smooth and free of itching. I even get tons of compliments of women. No need for cologne.</li>
    <li> great smell of brut. smells like a man not a sissy. clean refreshing and at these prises a great value. splash it on and br prepared to feel great!</li>
    <li> This is my post shower &amp;#34;splash on&amp;#34; that I use every evening.</li>
    <li> It is good but I can get a nine ounce bottle of geeric that smells the same at Dollar General for a buck seventy five.</li>
    <li> Classic Brut long lasting fragrance. Does the job well and it worth the money.Have been using it since a month now and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Grest price.  The same old nice fragance.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! excellent price! i have some many time without buy this after shave cologne, this bring me some many memories. I am from Colombia and here is so difficult to find this kind of product in such a good price.</li>
