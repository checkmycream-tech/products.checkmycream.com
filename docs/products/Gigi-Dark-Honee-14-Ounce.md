      <li>perfectly--</li>
      <li>Works perfectly on any hair type, just don&#x27;t use it on your face or neck.</li>
      <li>How&#x27;s the best way to apply it?  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s the best consistency?  </li>
      <li>Well I must say my Brazilian looks fantastic!!!!</li>
      <li>Also it heats beautifully, btw this honey needs strips.</li>
      <li>great price, and great product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>The price is good on amazon so I will probably order from here.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t know if I liked it,  </li>
      <li>great product, it arrived fairly quick.</li>
      <li>By far the best wax I have used.</li>
      <li>I have no idea how anyone would be able to use this without the warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been waxing for some time, so the hair in those areas is more sparse than it used to be, so that may be an issue to consider as well.</li>
      <li>I have been waxing for some time, so the hair in those areas is more sparse than it used to be, so that may be an issue to consider as well.</li>
      <li>The more you wax the more tolerant  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I was able to wax my legs and bikini area (brazilian)</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s my product of choice for most body hair.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I stuck through with it.</li>
      <li>I like it even better than the &amp;#34;All Purpose&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It comes off surfaces and skin easily with baby oil.</li>
      <li>It will, however, come off easily with oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>just fine.</li>
      <li>Apply wax in the direction of the hair and you should be fine-- if you are not then</li>
      <li>and it works fantastic.</li>
      <li>one get one free</li>
      <li>Great product for home use and coarse hair!</li>
      <li>The most important thing is not to get it too hot.  </li>
      <li>I am getting ready to get more, and i guess this huge canister of GIGI wax is going in the trash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to waxing,  I&#x27;ve gotten use to the all purpose honee wax, so I&#x27;ve grown to love it,  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing wax especially for think hair.</li>
      <li>anywhere you put this wax and with the right technique, leaves</li>
      <li>I have had great results with the brand NADS microwaveable hard wax.  </li>
      <li>this was the first time I&#x27;d tried waxing my legs.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I re-read most of them and it seems like some people do not know how to use to product properly</li>
      <li>How hot does this have to be?  </li>
      <li>The wax seeps through my epilating strips and gets all over my hands so oiling your hands is a must with this product, overall I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>The first time I waxed</li>
      <li>so I waited until my hair grew back more, and I was absolutely amazed at how well it worked.  </li>
      <li>Not messy, dries quick and no muslin strips are needed.  </li>
      <li>The only problem is it sticks to the knife and the body and doesn&#x27;t come out easily.</li>
      <li>They have a line for Facial Hair (which I&#x27;ve used)  and Fine Hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After doing a bikini wax with this stuff for three days in a row, I (gently) sit to write this review....</li>
      <li>Bad:&lt;br /&gt;Yes, very sticky.  </li>
      <li>How much do you use?  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much Gigi.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t like having to buy multiple types of wax, so I usually use Gigi&#x27;s all purpose honee, with great results.</li>
      <li>I have been giving myself a Brazilian for about 5 years now and have been using the GiGi All Purpose Honee with decent results.</li>
      <li>One of the main complaints is that the wax is sticky--</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sticky so the wax stuck more to my skin rather than the few hairs I was trying to pull, so if you&#x27;re new like me just tweeze those hairs off if they don&#x27;t all come off.</li>
      <li>but I wanted to try something that would work a little bit better.  </li>
      <li>Oiling your hands will help and be sure to apply a little to the area to be waxed.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS NOT A HARD WAX-- unless it&#x27;s specified on the jar you will need to use strips with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is strip wax, not hard wax.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is as awuful as the other reviewers make it sound.</li>
      <li>--I&#x27;m relatively new to it and</li>
      <li>If you want to use this on leg hair, especially the light hairs above the knee, then this stuff works like a dream.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you use baby oil on your hands and VERY little on the area that you want to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I usually use the Gigi all purpose honee, and I love it, but this stuff was cheaper</li>
      <li>It did not hurt as much as the APH has in the past and made my skin sooo smooth.</li>
      <li>It will get everywhere and make a huge mess.  </li>
      <li>okay, however he is going to try out the Brazilian hard wax.</li>
      <li>I might buy this product again if it were offered at a great sale price; but otherwise, I will be sticking to the regular, all-purpose honee (sorry for the pun).</li>
      <li>Wow, I had to review this product immediately after buying it at Sally Beauty.  </li>
      <li>It is extra sticky which for me really grabs the hairs and doesn&#x27;t let go until pulling out the root.  </li>
      <li>Really works well with coarse hair.</li>
      <li>No complaints so far.  </li>
      <li>As long as its not too hot, it holds well.  </li>
      <li>; that is because it is not a hard wax and will not dry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a little surprised that I had a good experience with this product, given the negative reviews.  </li>
      <li>This wax isn&#x27;t more or less sticky than other waxes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was so perplexed that this product had so many bad reviews.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t until recently that I&#x27;ve felt that the hair grows back extremely fast when I use the Gigi APH</li>
      <li>I was surprised by the low rating, so I wanted to add my 2 cents.  </li>
      <li>It would not be an exaggeration to say that putting a dropcloth or old sheet on the floor is necessary.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised last night when everything came out</li>
      <li>(Only professional waxing worked)</li>
      <li>just like everyone says, very sticky, does not dry fast at all ,and I am not an amateur at this either</li>
      <li>The other products did not remove much of the hair.  </li>
      <li>It is less painful than the all purpose, and seems to pull many more of the shorter hairs than the</li>
      <li>I always use Gigi dark honee because it really get rid of course hair.</li>
      <li>Also, when you press the cloth onto the wax, really rub the cloth down so that it adheres well to the wax.  </li>
      <li>When I saw this dark honee, I thought it might work even better on my thick, course hair.     </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wow, I had to review this product immediately after buying it at Sally Beauty.  I previously tried moon, nads, and numerous other products for waxing my legs and had almost given up.  The other products did not remove much of the hair.  (Only professional waxing worked) After one try with this and the muslin strips I was amazed.  Not one hair left!  It is extra sticky which for me really grabs the hairs and doesn&#x27;t let go until pulling out the root.  The price is good on amazon so I will probably order from here. Thank you so much Gigi.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing wax especially for think hair. I usually use this for the bikini area and I love it. Take all the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave a remainder. Actually is less pain that normal honey wax, because when you apply, get cold and solidified, be less sticky.</li>
    <li> Great product for home use and coarse hair! Rarely do I have missed or broken hairs and it&#x27;s my product of choice for most body hair. For bikini area, I prefer a hard wax. Clearly some of the reviewers are treating it as though it&#x27;s a hard wax, which it&#x27;s not, it should not be allowed to harden. It&#x27;s meant to be applied in a thin layer and then immediately removed with a muslin strip. If the packaging instructions are mislabeled, that&#x27;s a different issue.</li>
    <li> By far the best wax I have used. I use this on my legs, underarms and for the Brazilian. Yes it is sticky (it is called dark &amp;#34;HONEE&amp;#34; for a reason) but it get ll the hair in those areas. Reading some of these reviews I couldn&#x27;t help but chuckle. People saying things like &amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t dry fast&amp;#34; or &amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t harden&amp;#34; that is because it is not a hard wax and will not dry. You have to dust the skiing with powder and use a cloth strip and it works fantastic. It comes off surfaces and skin easily with baby oil.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly on any hair type, just don&#x27;t use it on your face or neck. I like it even better than the &amp;#34;All Purpose&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> after spending a fortune on brazilian bikini waxes all the time, I decided to try this service out at home.  So needless to say I have purchased several different kinds of wax, and this by far is the worst one.  UGH- just like everyone says, very sticky, does not dry fast at all ,and I am not an amateur at this either so I know it is the poor product.  I have had great results with the brand NADS microwaveable hard wax.  Not messy, dries quick and no muslin strips are needed.  I am getting ready to get more, and i guess this huge canister of GIGI wax is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the low rating, so I wanted to add my 2 cents.  I don&#x27;t think this product is as awuful as the other reviewers make it sound. I agree that it is stickier than other waxes, but I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems some of them encountered. It sounds like some of the complaints are due to confusion over what type of product this is supposed to be, rather than there being a problem with the product itself.     Gigi does make a hard wax specifically designed for brazilians. But I don&#x27;t like having to buy multiple types of wax, so I usually use Gigi&#x27;s all purpose honee, with great results. When I saw this dark honee, I thought it might work even better on my thick, course hair.     Results: The product works. I was able to wax my legs and bikini area (brazilian) just fine. No stray hairs, no skin irritation. The only problem I encountered is that, due to the stickiness, it seemed to get everywhere and I had to keep pausing to \\&quot;unstickify\\&quot; my hands. This slowed the waxing process down unnecessarily, which is why I rated it only 3 stars. I might buy this product again if it were offered at a great sale price; but otherwise, I will be sticking to the regular, all-purpose honee (sorry for the pun).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to waxing,  I&#x27;ve gotten use to the all purpose honee wax, so I&#x27;ve grown to love it,  but I wanted to try something that would work a little bit better.  I would always have left over stray hairs from using that wax so I got the dark honee wax. I do have thick hair,  I&#x27;m half black and half white.  When I got this wax I had just waxed a few days prior but I was hoping to get some of the left over stray hairs, BIG MISTAKE!  It&#x27;s very sticky so the wax stuck more to my skin rather than the few hairs I was trying to pull, so if you&#x27;re new like me just tweeze those hairs off if they don&#x27;t all come off. Of course I didn&#x27;t want to blame the product when I knew I was the one who used it improperly so I waited until my hair grew back more, and I was absolutely amazed at how well it worked.  It literally takes blood,  sweat and tears to master waxing. The more you wax the more tolerant  you are to the pain, and you&#x27;ll know what to expect the next time. It gets easier,  I promise it does.  The first time I waxed I was so patchy and I didn&#x27;t know if I liked it,  but I&#x27;m so glad I stuck through with it. I gave this 4 stars  because it&#x27;s SO sticky.  The wax seeps through my epilating strips and gets all over my hands so oiling your hands is a must with this product, overall I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Really works well with coarse hair. The only problem is it sticks to the knife and the body and doesn&#x27;t come out easily.</li>
    <li> I always use Gigi dark honee because it really get rid of course hair. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised that I had a good experience with this product, given the negative reviews.  I&#x27;m not a waxing expert at all--I&#x27;m relatively new to it and this was the first time I&#x27;d tried waxing my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;Yes, very sticky.  It will get everywhere and make a huge mess.  It would not be an exaggeration to say that putting a dropcloth or old sheet on the floor is necessary. [WD-40 will remove it from tile floors if you make a mess.] It will stick to you, the floor, and the area you intend to wax.  Oiling your hands will help and be sure to apply a little to the area to be waxed.  I&#x27;m going to try wearing latex gloves next time.  This will not wash off with soap and water.  It will, however, come off easily with oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to have a wax warmer for this to keep it a constant temperature.  I have no idea how anyone would be able to use this without the warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The learning curve is a bit steep.  How hot does this have to be?  What&#x27;s the best consistency?  How much do you use?  How&#x27;s the best way to apply it?  Do I have to stand on my head? After working with this was for a while, I did get the hang of it but there was a lot of frustration in the meantime.  Be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is strip wax, not hard wax.  It requires strips to remove. I way underestimated the amount of strips and wax I&#x27;d need.  Being a beginner, I wasted a lot of wax.  I&#x27;d guess with some practice, one can would serve for two waxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax seemed to irritate my skin way less than any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Awesome:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes off thick hair anywhere you put this wax and with the right technique, leaves very few strays!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using this again!</li>
    <li> I usually use the regular honee wax so this dark honee is something i am learning to use.  As long as its not too hot, it holds well.  No complaints so far.  I like the product and it arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> great product, it arrived fairly quick. Also it heats beautifully, btw this honey needs strips. great price, and great product.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews on the product I had to come and defend it. No I do not work for the company!!! I purchased this product at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and was a little skeptical because I&#x27;ve never used it before. I have been giving myself a Brazilian for about 5 years now and have been using the GiGi All Purpose Honee with decent results. It wasn&#x27;t until recently that I&#x27;ve felt that the hair grows back extremely fast when I use the Gigi APH so I decided to try something else for coarse hair. Sally&#x27;s was having a sale on the wax -- buy one get one free so I bought my usual Gigi APH &amp; Gigi DH. When I was reading all the negative reviews I was soooo scared to try the Dark Honee but I figured if worse comes to worse I can just use the All Purpose Honee to finish the job. Well I must say my Brazilian looks fantastic!!!! I&#x27;m so pleased with the results. It did not hurt as much as the APH has in the past and made my skin sooo smooth. I was so perplexed that this product had so many bad reviews. I re-read most of them and it seems like some people do not know how to use to product properly that&#x27;s why they are having trouble. One of the main complaints is that the wax is sticky-- I will concur only because ALL waxes are  sticky to me. This wax isn&#x27;t more or less sticky than other waxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Make sure you use baby oil on your hands and VERY little on the area that you want to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. DO NOT USE Muslin Waxing Strips!! The worst! I always use Cloth Epilating strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Do not overheat the wax to where it is extra liquidy-- this can cause it to burn you especially in the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply wax in the direction of the hair and you should be fine-- if you are not then that&#x27;s where pulling the skin comes in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Do not use if you do not have coarse hair. For God sakes it say&#x27;s \\&quot;For Coarse Hair\\&quot; on the product-- They have a line for Facial Hair (which I&#x27;ve used)  and Fine Hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.And Finally DO NOT USE without strips!! THIS IS NOT A HARD WAX-- unless it&#x27;s specified on the jar you will need to use strips with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope these are helpful tips. I feel bad that this product has been rated so low due to people not using the product correctly. I hardly ever review products but I had to with this one! I was pleasantly surprised last night when everything came out perfectly-- and a little annoyed that people can be misleading.</li>
    <li> After doing a bikini wax with this stuff for three days in a row, I (gently) sit to write this review.... I usually use the Gigi all purpose honee, and I love it, but this stuff was cheaper and I decided to try it.  If you want to use this on leg hair, especially the light hairs above the knee, then this stuff works like a dream.  It is less painful than the all purpose, and seems to pull many more of the shorter hairs than the all purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there is a learning curve with this wax, and now its the only one I use.  The most important thing is not to get it too hot.  When it&#x27;s thin, it doesn&#x27;t remove hair as well as when it goes on thick.  Also, when you press the cloth onto the wax, really rub the cloth down so that it adheres well to the wax.  I have been using it on my bikini area and underarms, and its working well.  I have been waxing for some time, so the hair in those areas is more sparse than it used to be, so that may be an issue to consider as well. It also gives me less problems with ingrown hairs, so it gets five stars from me.ng it thickly, and its working well.  I have been waxing for some time, so the hair in those areas is more sparse than it used to be, so that may be an issue to consider as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband that has curly dark hair.  The product works okay, however he is going to try out the Brazilian hard wax.</li>
