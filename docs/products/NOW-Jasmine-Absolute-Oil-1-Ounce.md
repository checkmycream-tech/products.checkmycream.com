      <li>Very nice product , shipping was super fast , I would definitely buy from this seller again !</li>
      <li>I have tried Now products before and have not been all that impressed; the price seems a little high and the aroma a bit deflated...</li>
      <li>This is the third bottle of oil I have ordered and it by far superior to the others.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast, packaging was adequately protective</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve had real jasmine oil before</li>
      <li>I have bought real jasmine absolute before -</li>
      <li>but I expected a more vibrant aroma at 7.5%.</li>
      <li>I sprinkle a few drops of this on hot, damp towels when I&#x27;m giving facials and my clients love it.</li>
      <li>The oil turned into a really sweet, deep rich fragrance that lasted until the next morning.</li>
      <li>and I know this is far from pure</li>
      <li>Give this a few minutes after use and you&#x27;ll be in love.</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>I expected it to smell a little more like the jasmine flower than it did.</li>

<li> one smell so bad, not even close, absolutely not natural, what a waste.</li>
<li> When I smelled the open bottle I was disappointed but decided to put some in my hair.</li>
<li> you women are so silly!</li>
<li> The jasmine smells terrible.</li>
