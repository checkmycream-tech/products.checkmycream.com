<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  I have always had terrible razor bumps/rash when ever i shaved my kitty.  Not a pretty look. I had researched for years trying to find out what others do to prevent this unattractive result from shaving. I came across Coochy Body Rashfree Shave Creme.  At the same time i found their other product  Coochy After Shave Mist.  I purchased both and used them both during the same shaving session.  I WAS AMAZED!!!!!  I was almost in tears that I did not break out at all.  I can not say that it was the after shave mist or the rashfree shave creme because i used them both  during my shaving session.  All i know is my kitty is smooth and soft and rash free for days.  I could not be happier. So i will continue to use them together forever.  Thank you the Coochy product line.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! For the majority of people that use it,it really does what it says it does. A total steal for how much you&#x27;re getting for the price!</li>
    <li> Makes my prickly minge nice and smooth. Highly recommend for those with irritated vadge.</li>
    <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t work well on me. I&#x27;ve tried a non scented one in the past and even this. I sill get razor burn.</li>
    <li> favorite!!  Forever favorite!!!  Only choice for shave cream!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me AT ALL. I have very sensitive skin and thought this would be helpful. It wasn&#x27;t. I ended up tossing it after 5 uses - waste of money.</li>
    <li> I really like this product- smells great (make me Blush scent), no cuts or nicks, &amp; my skin is very silly.  Down side is I&#x27;m not crazy about the pump design. Hard to pump with one hand because it keeps twisting to the lock position &amp; the spout is very short</li>
    <li> Works great for people that get shave bumps. I like it especially for my armpitts. Fair price and it was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff I shave everything with it</li>
    <li> Product works - no razor rash.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised when I opened the package and saw the size of the bottle. Its HUGE! I knew it was 16 oz but I didnt really think it would as much as it was. My husband and I use Dollar Shave club and I have been buying their shave butter ($8) for months. I was running out but did not get my order changed in enough time for the month to be able to add it to my next box so I thought I would try something else meanwhile. Did a bit of research since I have sensitive skin and this seemed like the best option. Its probably triple the size of my shave butter so its a much better buy and its works really well! I also love that it can be used as an extra conditioner too because it smells great! I only gave it four starts because the lid was all busted up when I got it and I dont know if it was from the shipping or if it was just sent that way.</li>
    <li> Great product, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, like me, this is the product to use.....I have been using this for over a year now, and have not gotten the slightest rash !</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe this shave creme could actually work as it says, however I was pleasantly surprised. I have very sensitive skin and I always get razor burn. Each time I have used this creme, no matter where on my body I am shaving, I have not experienced razor burn. It is very expensive but has proven to be worth it to me!</li>
    <li> Saw this stuff recently at a local adult shop and decided that I had to try it....So, I just got this yesterday and have only used it once and I must say I am thoroughly impressed.  No razor burn, no irritation, no bumps just smooth skin and an uber close shave.  I used it everywhere too, not just the who-ha. As a matter of fact, by suggestion on the back of the bottle, I even tried it as hair conditioner.  Also great, but I will stick to my regular hair stuff.  I think this is an excellent price for this size bottle, should last a few months even with my husband using it for his face.  The scent, while it is good, it is a bit sweet-strong.  Might try a different scent with the next bottle.</li>
    <li> Most amazing shaving creme I have ever used!!!! Does everything is claims and smells lovely!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving cream for at least 8 years.  Wasn&#x27;t sure about their new container....but I love it now....saves over dispensing, so it lasts longer.....</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as the Coochy from Pure Romance.</li>
    <li> best shaving creme ever!  The first time you use it, you will not believe how soft your body is.  The only negative is a close shaver means a more likely chance to get ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> Love this shaving cream! Leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft. A little goes a long way. Very smooth shave, with no irritation, even in sensitive areas. I will continue to purchase this!</li>
    <li> Got here fast, pump works perfect, a lot bigger than I expected. Really close smoothshave, I finished with the after powder and my skin has never felt softer! I have very sensitive skin so I was unsure but I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money as well. I just use it as regular shaving gel now because I still get really bad hair bumps. A lot of other reviews said it helped them out. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
    <li> i used to get horrible ingrown hairs, razor burn and pimples from shaving bare or with other female shaving creams or foams. i tried a sample size of coochy cream and have been touting its wonderfulness to anyone who will listen. seriously, try this, it smells amazing and makes your skin silky soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this brand and size (3 different scents) twice from Amazon, and once from an Athena&#x27;s representative. All three times the pump never worked or took hours to get open and hours to use each shave. Also, all three times, from Amazon and Athena&#x27;s they arrive either big plastic over cap off and cream (not a ton but a shower&#x27;s work at least) an over the bottle and in the bag which is amazing since that would make you think the pump was open or working but no, they must jam pack the bottles so the air pressure of the cap breaks the pump!! They air bag / bubble wrap the heck out of the boxes so you&#x27;d think they wouldn&#x27;t arrive clear cap off but wonders never cease. Oh and of course I&#x27;m completely addicted to the product especially for the price. AND I always wait until I&#x27;m almost or completely out or I&#x27;d have sent them back... Coochy Cream &#x3D; miracle product, but next time it might be better if I just ask them to dump it straight into the bog the bottle comes in, and I&#x27;ll just buy a generic pump. Somehow though, I feel like they&#x27;d make that a disaster as well.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff I shave with.  Works great, always smooth.  Sometimes my legs itch after shaving but as long as I apply lotion right away, its fine.</li>
    <li> The scent is amazing. Makes your skin smooth too.</li>
    <li> Product is okay, but not worth the&amp;#34; hype&amp;#34; and additional expense. The transaction itself was flawless.</li>
    <li> What is great is that there is a huge amount of shave cream in there!  It has great &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; to it and I don&#x27;t get nearly the amount of razor burn I used to.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin silky and I do not have to shave every day. Love the scent! You can also use it for your hair and my husband uses it to shave his face as well.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite shaving cream. I won&#x27;t use anything else. The price is also great given the size of the bottle. I love the pump</li>
    <li> I was excited that there was a scent I did not know of before but when I used it the first time, realized it smelled like mosquito repellant...is this just me that thinks that? Otherwise, I still love coochy cream. Just not this scent.</li>
    <li> This is the only shaving cream my wife will use while shaving her most sensitive areas! She has very sensitive skin and this leaves her silky smooth with no shave bumps later on!</li>
    <li> Love this, I have sensitive skin but this is so worth the price. No razor burn and its been 3 months not even half way through it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take long to get...</li>
    <li> Works great leaves wherever you shave with the smoothest feel 👍🏾</li>
    <li> GOOD deal on a HUGE bottle. I don&#x27;t know what is in this but it helps with my razor burn and itchy underarms. This &amp;#34;Blush&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t really smell like much (which is fine with me).</li>
    <li> This is the only shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t leave me with razor burn or ingrown hairs.  And the bottle is huge so it will last for quite some time.  I am impressed with this stuff!</li>
    <li> This was a great deal, a lot for the price. Not the same as Coochy sold by Pure Romance but is ok.</li>
    <li> This Product is Perfect for Women and Men!!!</li>
    <li> Ty for the huge bottle at a great price. I am so pleased as this came highly recommended for my itchy legs!  I am so glad the scent is not overwhelming!</li>
    <li> Great product, leaves my skin amazingly smooth, havent had razor burn since I started using it. However, pump is non functional. (Thats the only reason I gave it 4 stars)</li>
    <li> After using this product it still left me with bumps and a rash. I won&#x27;t order it again and have given it to my daughter.</li>
    <li> Great for bald head shaves too. No coochy should be without coochy. Big can and a little goes far. You will not ever use cream or soap again.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine was raving about the coochy shaving cream that Pure Romance puts out, so I decided to see if Amazon sold it or anything similar.  I came across this product and I LOVE IT.  I mostly use it just for my bikini area but it works amazingly, haven&#x27;t had razor bumps since I started using it.  It does seem that I don&#x27;t need to shave as often but don&#x27;t expect your body to still be hairless and silky smooth the next day, at least in the bikini area.  However, it does appear to soften the hairs on my legs for longer periods of time so even if it does start growing back, they aren&#x27;t prickly!  I would definitely recommend this product, smells good, and can also be used as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. I didn&#x27;t realize it was twice the size of my first one, for the same price, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This stuff is awesome for your bikini area!!! I like the original scent better but this one is also really nice.</li>
    <li> Great price! Super fast shipping! Product as described.&lt;br /&gt;Best transaction ever! Thank you 😃</li>
    <li> Works wonders and the bottle lasts forever!</li>
    <li> Helps with razor burn and makes it so much easier to shave.</li>
    <li> Not as good as it use to be</li>
    <li> Best product on the market of its kind. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!!  Gives me no rash no matter where I use it!  I&#x27;ve even converted the hubby and it&#x27;s all he uses to shave his face anymore.  This particular scent was a little too feminine than he likes but still a great product.</li>
    <li> This product is the holy grail of shaving.  I have very sensitive skin that is prone to razor burn.  I have used regular shaving creme, which makes my legs hairless but results in bumpy skin. I have used oil which is nice, glides easily but the residue left behind made me feel gross and greasy. With this product I have no worries, but smooth, sexy, soft skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awesome! It makes my legs very smooth and silky feeling. However i was under the impression this stuff was for the bikini area. I did get a rash on the bikini area, and it was no different than shaving with anything else. I do have very sensitive skin so maybe this this stuff would be ok for someone else without a sensitive bikini area. But like i said in the beginning, it makes my legs feel awesome so i will continue to use it until its gone.</li>
    <li> The best shaving cream out there! I have gone back and forth between this and drugstore ones and I ALWAYS come back to this! Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this that when it came I jumped in the shower to try.  This feels like conditioner but is more moisturizing.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and really makes my legs very smooth.  More smooth than anything I have used before, without the need to go over the same spot more than once. I&#x27;ve never had razor bumps so I can&#x27;t comment on that.  No clogging of the razor at all. Washes of very clean and does not dry out my skin. The best way is to do a sugar or salt scrub before, use a dorco razor and moisturizer afterwards.  My wife loves my soft, smooth and sexy legs.</li>
    <li> GREAT product!!!  SO much less expensive than in specialty stores.  Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> It works awesome! Would definitely recommend !!</li>
    <li> This is just ok. It does NOT prevent bumps and I grown hairs. It does provide a smooth shave but itsnt worth the cost. There&#x27;s a shave cream at Walmart for $7 that does the same thing.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this but after I used it, I didn&#x27;t notice anything different. Still had ingrown hair and shaving bumps. I compared it to my regular shaving cream and they had the exact same results. Not happy.</li>
    <li> Best shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I will never use another shaving cream again. This lasts a long time, saving tons of money, and it makes my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff; I only wish that the name wasn&#x27;t so prominent on the bottle, as I shower at the local Y often and I&#x27;m always secretly worried that some old lady is going to give me the stink-eye for having a &amp;#34;vulgar&amp;#34; product at the gym. In a pinch, sure you can use hair conditioner to do Coochy&#x27;s job, but it&#x27;s not the same! I have very sensitive skin and this stuff is a must-have for me when it&#x27;s bathing suit season.</li>
    <li> Love Coochy shave cream! Wouldn&#x27;t shave without it, my husband even uses it now.</li>
    <li> My skin has never been so good after shaving! No mored red blotches or rashs. Sp much better than any shaving cream I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> I am a bargain shopper and I love the Coochy brand, always have. So I bought this because it was less expensive than the former scent I have used for years, Pear Berry. It is a bit soft and girlie, my husband was not happy initially because he uses it. But, he got used to it and still uses it himself.</li>
    <li> If you have really sensitive skin like I do then this product is the best!! It smells great and leaves my skin feeling amazing too!</li>
    <li> I noticed this time around the cream feels a little thinner, but it still does a great job. I hope this company decides to keep the high quality standards that first attracted me to continue purchasing their products.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is literally the best stuff I have ever used. Im a female and I have very coarse body hair (bikini, &amp;#34;happy trail&amp;#34;, pits, facial hair) due to PCOS. Very embarrassing shaving and getting lots of ingrowns. It made the hair very soft as said and I get a very close shave. It also saves your razor! I used the same razor for my pits bikini and legs and the razor didn&#x27;t get dull or dry (I use schick quattro) when I usually have to use two razor heads in the same sitting. I don&#x27;t get any ingrowns or bumps anymore - if I do they&#x27;re not big and they don&#x27;t happen often. Use along with the product Tend Skin and your inguinal areas will thank you! Ahhhh love this stuff! Wish I had known about it way sooner.</li>
    <li> I love the product but the pump did not work.  I was able to find a pump that fit (sort of) and so I did not return it.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but does not prevent razor bumps for me:(</li>
    <li> Honestly, nothing really special.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of people complaining in their reviews about little things. This product works. Whether you dump it in your hand, pump it out etc. I am on my 3rd bottle. This is the 3rd scent i have tried (pear berry is the best so far). Each bottle lasted me a year. That&#x27;s with shaving EVERYTHING 1-3 times per week as well as my boy friend using it once a week on his face and nethers. Works great for men...he never gets razor burn anymore. I get it occassionally but only when I shave the same area more than 2 times a week and that&#x27;s my fault. This product comes in a very large bottle and will last a long time, just play around with the amount you need to take care of business. The pump works for me, everytime. Ships in a priority mail envelope wrapped in a sheet of bubble wrap to keep it safe. Nothing fancy but it always gets here in one piece. I would recommend this product to women and men. Can&#x27;t really mess it up, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It is the best product I have found for shaving the bikini area. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it is better than other products I have tried.  It is very heavy and creamy feeling and does not irritate or sting. I like to apply a small amount of vitamin E oil first and then use the Coochy Shave Creme.  The pump is handy in the shower too.</li>
    <li> Works well and moisturizes!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with this product.  Everyone is different, but it didn&#x27;t do anything more for me than normal shave gel would.</li>
    <li> This works so well!  It is creamy and soft and protects me from any nicks and cuts in my sensitive area.  The pump doesn&#x27;t work well however, and I have to just leave the cover off.  Still gave it a 5 because the formulation is so good!</li>
    <li> LOVE this, keeps things smooth!</li>
    <li> My favorite shave lotion! After using this product I can no longer use any other shave lotions! A+++++++ On my frequent purchase list. ;)</li>
    <li> My wife will only shave with this stuff. And I must say. It works great. Leaves a nice smell behind.</li>
    <li> PERFECT!! Love it!! Quick delivery!!</li>
    <li> I still had razor burn/slight irritation. Although not as bad as using normal shaving cream. Doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to it, so I&#x27;m not sure what everyone&#x27;s complaining about :P</li>
    <li> Love this product!! :-)</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream ever!</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used,  but I&#x27;m not sure that on its own it extends the time between shaves.</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves the skin smooths and fresh. It arrived promptly when I ordered from Classic Erotica but when I ordered from HealthTime I waited 6 days just to cancel my order I was supposed to receive in two days!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my sister...she absolutely love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves your skin smooth. However the first time I used it I broke out all over my legs. I have slightly sensitive skin, so I would not recommend this for someone who is really allergic to scented products.</li>
    <li> Yes ma&#x27;am. Loooovveeee it !!!!!</li>
    <li> As someone who shaves everything at least once a week, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin much smoother and much less shave bumps/irritation!&lt;br /&gt;MUCH cheaper on here than in the local stores!</li>
    <li> No more little red bumps!!!!!</li>
</ol>
