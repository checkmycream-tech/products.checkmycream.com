<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Feels and smells great</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the review -- but didn&#x27;t really believing it would make a difference.  It did and I&#x27;m really surprised. I am in my 40s and have dropped quite a bit of weight (yay!) but now have the ugly saggy turkey neck which is a bummer.  I put this on over a week - not every night but almost.  And then I looked in the mirror and was like...what the ?!  My spouse agreed that it wasn&#x27;t just wishful thinking.  I&#x27;ve continued to use it and even starting to put it on my shin and places on my face where there is lose skin.  So far it&#x27;s looking good!  It&#x27;s not a miracle cream but it definitely has improved the skin tone and tightness on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I&#x27;d say is that this is a super small amount of cream for the price.  But, given the results, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I really love this uplift cream!  It really did more than I expected.  It goes on so smooth and feels so good on my face and neck.  But more than that, I see results already and will continue to use!</li>
    <li> I have used this product long enough to see and feel results. The compliments keep coming on my skin as of recently which make me fill like a million. This is a true blue product that you should not pass up. After all, we must do some things for ourselves once Ina while.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for something to use on my neck because honestly that&#x27;s an area I have neglected...I just don&#x27;t think much about it.  I have noticed that my neck looks smoother...and I like it.  I didn&#x27;t really notice it before but now that I&#x27;ve been using this I&#x27;m paying more attention and it really does make a difference.  I&#x27;m sold.  Thanks.  Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> This came in the mail yesterday. I put it on as soon I got it. My skin felt so smooth. I used it again this morning and I am amazed at how nice my skin already looks and feels.. This was for sure a great find!!!</li>
    <li> My Skin feels suppl and looks vibrant , Even My Husband says I Look years younger as I use this Product, I can see the fines lines smoothing out, Non Greasy,has a nice sent, does not dry out, Pure Beauty in a Bottle.This product was received for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review</li>
    <li> I have ordered the Epicure 4 different times and plan to use it forever. I was disappointed when the price was raised and the shipping is no longer free.</li>
    <li> This works pretty good. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it does leave my neck a little sticky after I use it. I was excited to use this, because I have started to notice that my neck is looking a little double chin like in a few photos. I am not overweight, guess I just have some weight in unwanted areas. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in using this product. I&#x27;m not 30 yet, so I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, I was just hoping that it would tighten my skin up a little. Maybe it works better for different skin types.  I received this product for instructional purposes in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I have been using Uplift firming cream for about two weeks and have seen noticeable tightening of my neck skin.  I&#x27;m in my late forties and started getting \\&quot;stringy\\&quot; looking vertical folds at the top of my neck under my chin.  I bought this product to save me going to full blown \\&quot;turkey neck\\&quot; and was delighted to see tighter skin so soon.  My neck also looks smoother and less crinkly.  I plan to start using it on my face and decolletage also.  The scent is really fresh and soothing.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom, not because she has shown any sign of a &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; in the making, but because quite a few of her friends have, so I thought it would be nice to get her something to prevent it from developing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mom told me that she has been applying it to her neck and she really likes how it smells and feels.  Her neck looks very smooth.  I am glad this retinol cream will help her to continue to look years younger than most of her friends of the same age!</li>
    <li> I have tried many firming products and am very happy with Uplift firming cream.  I have been using it daily for a month and still have some left in the bottle, they give you a good amount of it.  When I look at my profile in the mirror I can see more definition in the jawline.  It also looks like some of the sun damage is fading from my neck.  I give this product two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about a week now. I must say..I see a slight difference in my face and neck. I hope to see a bigger difference as I continue to use it. Love the way it feels on my face as well.</li>
    <li> Lemony fresh scent &amp; texture is lovely. I use it twice daily. Below my makeup &amp; on freshly washed skin at night. The skin on my neck is firmer &amp; less noticeable age related elasticity is much improved. My face is soft &amp; supple...yes I said supple. Not what a 45 year old woman would say about her skin without plastic surgery or botox. I still have fine lines but they are improved. I love this product. It&#x27;s not a miracle in a bottle but wow...with consistent use it helps a great deal!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This felt great on my skin and within a week my skin is looking smoother. Great product!</li>
    <li> Lovely cream that feels great and smells wonderful. The reviews made me want to give it a real try.  I did and my skin feels ten years younger.</li>
    <li> This product was ok. I used it for a month. I didn&#x27;t really notice any changes to my skin but mabey just my age. I would say over 40 would benefit better.</li>
    <li> I actually got all of the facial creams in this line and decided to wait at least 6 weeks before reviewing&lt;br /&gt;All of these work well, I have increased skin clarity and noticed less fine wrinkles. My skin appears brighter and as a result any makeup I use looks better and I use less.&lt;br /&gt;I usually have some breakouts with skin products but not with this line, will continue to use as my skin gets better over time</li>
    <li> The pump stopped working on the bottle very soon after I opened the package, so I couldn&#x27;t get to the product.  The bottle is totally sealed, so there is no way to get the cream out if the pump doesn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t like it when things are sealed like this, because then you can&#x27;t use the entire bottle.  I sent it back.  The other annoying thing was that someone from the company started emailing me incessantly (4+ times in 10 days) asking if I liked the product, and could I please leave a review.  Imagine if someone emailed like that for every product you bought.  Kind of cloying, and very annoying!  Also didn&#x27;t leave me with a confident feeling about this company- made them seem desperate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this skin cream for the past week and already notice a difference in my skin.  I have very dry skin and even after having the cream on for several hours, my skin feels elastic and smooth.  I especially like the scent, which is subtle but refreshing.  I&#x27;m normally pretty lazy about using skin products, but a friend of mine suggested I try this one, and I&#x27;m glad I listened--I actually like the feel and scent of it so much, I look forward to putting it on each morning!</li>
    <li> Refined the skin on face and neck but I did not see any improvement in firmness.</li>
    <li> Some time ago,  I developed a turkey neck, but didn&#x27;t attempt to do anything about it.  My husband was so sweet and always said that he loved me just the way I was so i was lazy and just lived with it.  Then I lost him and after a time passed, decided I would do something just for me and see if i could rid myself of the turkey.  I knew it was along shot, but wanted to try.&lt;br /&gt;I researched several products on line and decided to try Epicura Uplift Cream.  Not being naive enough to think it would work alone I used it along with facial exercises, also found on line.  A combination  of exercises and the cream seemed logical as my skin cannot be considered young.  The first container is almost gone and I can see a definite improvement!  It hasn&#x27;t totally disappeared, of course, but the the change is noticeable  enough that it makes me want to keep up the treatments..  If it can help an &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin, imagine how dramatic it would be to a younger person.  Oh by the way, did I happen to mention that I am 89?</li>
    <li> I saw results within the first several days. I live in CA so a good moisturizer is a must and this fits the bill.  I have been using it for over a week and my skin is noticeably smoother and firmer.  The pump bottle makes application easy.</li>
    <li> There has to be something better.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product a few weeks ago and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference. My face is softer, smoother and more radiant. I put a bit around my eyes and mouth every morning and night. Someone recently told me that my face was glowing.\\&quot;This is perfect if you have a wedding or special event to go to and you want to look absolutely flawless. If you want to lighten dark spots, tighten .I have combination skin and usually break out from a cream. However, the other serums I have tried are either sticky, smelly or feel filmy after application. This product does not. I bought a few bottles and I like it as much now as when i started.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for close to a month and I also notice the fine lines around my eyes starting to fade!&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that the dark sun spots on my cheeks are stating to fade, YAY!!&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice light scent and glides on smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;It boost collogen and fights fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;And has great ingreadiants Like Argireline and green tea.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels so much better alread! firmer and more radiant!!&lt;br /&gt;Love the packaging and this shipped very fast!</li>
    <li> I have been using Epicura for several days. I love that you can actually feel the firming action! It makes my skin feel very soft and also smells very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I never order beauty products, but I started sagging around my cheekbones now @ age 43.  My cheeks sagged, my jaw line gave way....I was a mess!  I got depressed as I have always been an attractive lady &amp; this devastated me as I became aware I couldn&#x27;t fight the effects of time.  NOW I HAVE FOUGHT &amp; WON!  I waited to write this review....my 1st 60 days is almost up....&amp; I had to let everyone know I feel beautiful.  My cheeks and jaw line has lifted &amp; so has my whole self confidence....THANK YOU.  I am now on my way to see what you have for eyes &amp; to order me another order of this miracle cream.  I have ordered from Amazon several times but this is the 1st review I&#x27;ve ever written on this site.  I am amazed!  I advise every woman who is experiencing this aging thing to give this a try.  Nice light non lingering lemony fragrance, not oily, Slight drying/tightening feeling, but I use Vit E oil daily as I always have.  Give this a try for the same price you pay for Olay that doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> I have deep wrinkles on my neck and this is working :) yeahhh</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical before I tried this but the results have been amazing! Some of my friends think I&#x27;ve had some work done! I will definitely use this again!</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t seen much of a change in my skin&#x27;s elasticity, this cream is very hydrating! I enjoy the nice refreshing feeling it gives my neck when I apply it. I am happy I received it in exchange for an honest review, because in these winter months my skin gets very dry. This cream has definitely helped me with my chapped skin. (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> This skin care line is amazing; I&#x27;m seeing softer more radiant skin in just a few days. It&#x27;s got a light scent and feels silky smooth on my skin. In my opinion this cream works better than the high priced creams. It boosts collagen and fights wrinkles and contains all natural ingredients like green tea extract, best of all its made in the USA!</li>
    <li> This cream is filled with ingredients great for my skin. It goes on smoothly and soaks right in. I&#x27;ve got normal skin currently, but have had oily to dry skin in the past. I think this cream would work for any skin type. Smells great and the ingredients that smell good are also good for your skin, so that&#x27;s win-win. Nice packaging that keeps cream sanitary as you use it, but is easy to dispense and use. Skin feels great especially around neck area since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I love Epicura Skin products, so I was pretty sure that I would like this product too and I do! I like that it is made with all natural ingredients and does not contain parabens. I like to try to use only natural products on my skin. As I get older, I notice more and more wrinkles and so I am trying to find products to help diminish the wrinkles and firm up my skin. I applied this cream to my face after I used a toner and serum. I only used one pump and that is enough to cover my entire face and my neck. It went on very easily and smoothly. It feels very light on my skin and does not make my face feel or look greasy even after wearing it all day. I also like the light lemon scent that it has. I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and I have noticed that my skin looks more smooth and slightly more firm. I am looking forward to seeing more results, the longer I use it. I enjoyed trying this anti aging cream for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I thought description said frangrance-free. Does not smell good.</li>
    <li> I must say I was a bit nervous to try something new. I like the moisturizer very much. I have noticed my skin feels a  bit more firm after just 3 weeks of use. I went for my monthly facial today and my esthetician did notice a difference :). I just placed an order for another bottle.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference. I used another product from this brand that had different ingredients... Supposedly... And was meant for the eye area.  I swear this is the same stuff with a different label. Feels, smells and looks the same. I don&#x27;t care for the packaging that doesn&#x27;t allow you to see how much product is in there. You cannot open it or remove the label. I like to open pump jars when you get to the end so you can get every bit of product out.  The bottle looks large but there is not much product in there. Moisturizes fine. But no better than any run of the mill cream. Oh and they will bug you immediately to provide a review. And they will continue to bug until you opt out. I mean really? How can I review a product like this when I  have only had it a day! You need time to see if there are results first. I have had this a month now. It&#x27;s officially just a typical moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Best cream I had tried so far. This is my second jar and I love it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this face and neck firming cream.  Its light and creamy and feels good on my face and neck and makes my skin look good.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend just loves these products! The eye gel works great and this product is just as wonderful!</li>
    <li> This cream is exceptional. I use it only on my neck where the skin is getting crepy. I&#x27;ve tried other super expensive creams that do not work as well and their scents smell terrible. This has a pleasing smell.  I have sensitive skin as well. I think at this point ive purchased 10 bottles.  so happy I found this product!!</li>
    <li> Only used it for a short time but I can already see some results. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> nothing special about this &#x27;aging cream&#x27;.. didn&#x27;t really notice any difference.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product, but leaves your face very dry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but I decided to give this a try anyway. I do have acne so I was worried it would break my face out but it doesn&#x27;t! I was very pleased. Also it smells and feels great.</li>
