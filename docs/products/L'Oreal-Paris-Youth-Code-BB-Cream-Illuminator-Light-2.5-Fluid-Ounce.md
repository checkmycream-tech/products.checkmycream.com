      <li>It goes on smooth, and it soaks into my skin nicely.</li>

      <li>I bought light and medium to make my own shade, great going on but made my skin dry and itchy.</li>
      <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
      <li>Before I tried it I thought the coverage would be really light and would rub off easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was exactly what I wanted. I was very pleased</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty thick. It smells nice. I use it pretty sparingly. Seems to give nice light coverage if you don&#x27;t put a ton on. Not sure that I would buy it again because I&#x27;d like to try other products.</li>
    <li> Really doesn&#x27;t offer any coverage. Feels like there&#x27;s nothing on your skin and it looks like there&#x27;s nothing on there (meaning - no coverage)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible, wouldn&#x27;t use it again even if it was free.</li>
    <li> Vrry light and blend well.  I wish they are a bit darker.  The light is a bit light for skin, and their medium is too dark..there should be a shade in between for Asian skin.</li>
    <li> kinda greasy--low coverage--would wear as spf</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Good coverage while not being to heavy.</li>
    <li> Loreal products are what I use but the BB cream doesn&#x27;t give me the coverage I need.  Otherwise it is nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 80 year old mother and she loves it. She said in all the years she has been using cream and moisturizer this is the best one she has ever used. She has dry skin and it helps give her a natural looking glow. I would recommend anyone looking for a skin cream to try this if you want younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> I have used pricier BB creams and I always find myself coming back to this one. The texture is a bit thicker and it offers medium coverage, which is why I like it. Plus the amount of product is more than BB creams that cost 3 times as much. Definitely my first choice in BB creams!</li>
    <li> This products has a scent that I dont really care for but I like the coverage and it didnt make my face break out.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, feels light on your skin while giving an even tone all over.  Fresh-faced look all by itself or under a mineral powder to polish it off.</li>
    <li> Best BB cream I&#x27;ve found. Actually absorbs into the skin and isn&#x27;t greasy. I switched from Garnier because their BB cream just sits on the skin, rubs off and is so so greasy even with powder and set spray.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my face look even, young and fresh.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff daily. I was bummed when I couldn&#x27;t find it at my local department store any longer.  Thankfully, I found it at Amazon.  Its light, goes on smooth and I don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;orange face&amp;#34; like I do with other comparable products. I have very fair skin and needed a little extra coverage under my mineral powder.</li>
    <li> Even &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; was not light. It was kind of orange oxidized to be oranger, still.disappointing. It also smells terrible!</li>
    <li> This was actually my second tube. I was happy with my first tube, but gave it to my granddaughter when she she and her family visited at Christmas. This second tube is MINE! I&#x27;m 69 years old and I really like the finish it gives to skin.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It makes your face look youthful, with its illuminating touch.  I recommend this product.  It also can take away some small dark spots, great product.</li>
    <li> Of the many creams spouse uses, this is one of her favorites. Main reason she continues to buy it and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Nice feel although not great coverage. Very similar to my CC cream.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst beauty products I&#x27;ve tried. It made my face look oily, it didn&#x27;t blend well so my face looked multi-toned and it was way too dark.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It is a nice match to my skin tone and good sun protection.  I use a pressed mineral powder over it.</li>
    <li> I gave this 2 stars because I like the ingredients. They contain sunscreen and are non-comedogenic. I am EXTREMELY acne prone, and after a few weeks of use this hasn&#x27;t caused me any new breakouts. I took away stars for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- More of a tinted moisturizer than a BB cream - the consistency is very thin and provides minimal coverage at best. It also makes my skin look shiny if I don&#x27;t follow up with a matte powder.&lt;br /&gt;- The &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; color is NOT light enough for fair skinned people and even made me look a little orange&lt;br /&gt;- Has a perfumey smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you have very few flaws and a mostly even complexion and want this more as a moisturizer/sunscreen, it might be for you. If you have any type of blemishes, look for a BB cream with better coverage.</li>
    <li> To start off, I&#x27;m 20-something, and I was in search of a decent BB cream that wasn&#x27;t too pricey. I also have oily skin so other creams made my face oily beyond belief by mid-day. I stumbled across this Youth Code BB cream at the local drug store, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months now. I still have about half the product left. Pretty decent price for such a long-lasting product. For me, it has done the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually moisturize with Physicians Formula hydrating &amp; balancing moisturizer underneath, to combat the oiliness of my skin. I use about a dime size of my BB on a cotton pad and work it in my skin. It goes on smooth, and it soaks into my skin nicely. The only problem is that the color is slightly too dark for me. I&#x27;m fair skinned, and I&#x27;ve found that the color is great for me during the summer when I&#x27;ve tanned a tad. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this product in the winter time when I&#x27;m pale. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with breakouts or irritated skin. It does smell slightly of your regular sunscreen, but it is not strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the weekends, I only use this product, and I feel it has great coverage by itself. Other times, I usually put a little blush and powder over my face to \\&quot;set\\&quot; everything. Makes my skin look flawless (hides my small acne scars, and with a little concealer underneath the BB cream for serious redness or pimples, it&#x27;s perfect). This lasts me the entire day without re-touches. Importantly, by the end of a hot summer day, my face doesn&#x27;t look oily. Overall, a decent BB cream for the price</li>
    <li> I have tried a few BBs and this is by far my favorite.  Im 29 years old and suffer with adult acne. I have oily skin and this gives me a nice healthy glow and It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. The coverage is just enough to even my skin tone while still being sheer. It also doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes to water like some similar products.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It looks amazing under some pressed powder.</li>
    <li> this BB cream is amazing for oily skin types. it leaves your skin looking fresh, not shiny, it looks as if you are not wearing make up, it covers well the imperfections, and it does not clog your pores at all. PLUS has SPF 15.</li>
    <li> Perfect for moisturizer and foundation in one</li>
    <li> I just bought some of this a few days ago and really like it! My skin actually does look a bit more luminous and on me, it looks light and rather mattifying both at the same time. I&#x27;m almost 44 and one thing that I&#x27;m happy to see is that it is not settling into pores and fine lines, if anything, they don&#x27;t look quite so pronounced. We&#x27;ll see how the bb cream continues to perform, but so far, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I bought the light color and this B+B cream is wonderful. It feels heavenly to put on and wear. What they are doing with these new type of creams is nothing short of amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend. The person who complained of itchy skin must have an allergy to something in the product not necessarily the alcohol. I have sensitive skin so we&#x27;ll see how I do with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I tried a sample in a magazine and I loved it.  The actual product has a thicker coverage than the sample which is fine (it does not take much product to cover).  I am very fair and I was concerned that even the light would be too dark but it blends in nicely.  It also has a light scent that I really like. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it evens and smooths my skin without looking like I&#x27;m wearing any make up! It looks like m skin is naturally clear. Granted, I don&#x27;t have any acne, just some spots, redness and larger pores I&#x27;d like to cover up. This product works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this moisturizer. It&#x27;s very light so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve caked anything onto your face. It&#x27;s just enough color to even out your skin tone, without feeling like you&#x27;re painting your face on in the morning. And it doesn&#x27;t really rub off onto clothes or anything, only if you&#x27;re sweating. I only wish I could find this in the stores!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! Before I tried it I thought the coverage would be really light and would rub off easily. This is not the case at all! While obviously the coverage doesn&#x27;t compare to a foundation it covers most minor imperfections easily and lasts several hours! Also it doesn&#x27;t rub off easily on clothes. Lots of times if I am just running errands rather than put on full makeup I just apply this quickly (like I would a moisturizer) and it dramatically improves my appearance. Even when I am doing full makeup I often start out applying this all over my face, as it is a great moisturizer and sets a great base). I have noticed when I use this as a primer I use much less traditional makeup.</li>
    <li> For the life of me, I cannot understand the new obsession with BB creams. What was so wrong with tinted moisturizers that we had to throw in eighty-five more ingredients? The product SUCKS, this one especially!! I tried two BB creams, Loreal Youth Code Light and one of the Asian brands (M Perfect Cover No. 23). Both of them made my skin break out nasty style. I&#x27;m talking strange, strange breakouts with large bumps (not quite poppable, not quite the under-the-skin kind) and teeny whiteheads that I had never seen before and didn&#x27;t quite know how treat. I ended up with at least three noticeable scars on my face, and I otherwise have very clear skin. Yeah, I&#x27;m pissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, either of these BB creams will make your skin look smooth, even, and dewy. Before the breakouts, I was VERY impressed. The Youth Code was noticeably heavier than the M brand, and felt as such on my face. It came off onto my collared shirts, which was super annoying. And gross. I&#x27;m not sure how others complained of light coverage because this stuff is like paint. Coverage is certainly not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to try a higher end brand of BB cream, but the reviews tell a similar story across the board: looks amazing, feels heavy, causes breakouts. Bottom line, if you are blessed with impermeable skin, knock yourself out. I&#x27;m sticking with my trusty tinted moisturizer and a bit of sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I had just learned about BB creams and purchased this one first. I put my normal Olay moisturizer on and let it soak in. Then I used the BB cream. It feels heavy going on, too orange for my fair/pinkish skin (even though I got the lightest one), and although it made my makeup stay nicely in place/hydrated, by the end of the day my face looked greasier than it has since I was in middle school! I had high hopes for this because of the price.</li>
    <li> feels great, applies easily, love it love love it....&lt;br /&gt;i put it on before I head out gardening or doing day time errands chores - for when you don&#x27;t want a lot of makeup on but want to look &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; - great but transparent coverage - smells good, feels good, does the job -</li>
    <li> this product makes my wife&#x27;s titties a lot more firm! I am a very happy husband. thank you BB cream.</li>
    <li> So I have tried several different bb creams (all korean products) to see which ones were the best. I purchased this loreal one this morning and tried it, and it really doesn&#x27;t compare to any of the korean ones I have tried (even the korean ones that I didn&#x27;t really like). The consistency is too thin, and the coverage is weak. I know that it is for \\&quot;light\\&quot; skinned people, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it should just be completely translucent. I am Korean and have fair skin and I think from now on, I will be sticking to  my favs Skin79, hanskin, or skinfood.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE. It has caffeine in it which makes me jittery. Plus it makes your face look SOOO greasy! I swear I had a couple of whiteheads after one day of using it. I returned this item because it was horrible! STAY AWAY!</li>
    <li> I have used other BB creams and this one is good. I can wear it alone or with powder on top. It is light coverage.</li>
    <li> This has an odor which bothered me too much to use it. The smell reminded me of sunless tanning lotion. It was also too dark for my fair skin although I purchased the light color. I had to return it.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this may not be enough coverage, it&#x27;s more like at tinted moisturizer versus a BB cream BUT after using it awhile, I love it. I am going to stick with this stuff. Seems like it will last long and the price is right. I have pretty sensitive skin and I break out easily and this does not bother my skin at all. Great product!</li>
    <li> Product is moisturizing but it makes my skin look pasty- like spackle. Was a really odd texture and look to it once it dries. I tried using less, then more, and still had the same \\&quot;clown makeup\\&quot; look to it. I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin. Maybe this product is better for oily skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many bb creams and I really wanted to like them, but there was always something (texture, irritating, etc) that I didn&#x27;t like about them. Youth Code BB is different. I consider it more like a tinted moisturizer with better coverage. My skin glows when I wear it; seriously, I get compliments all the time. I tried the medium first and it was too dark, I will probably use it in the summer. The light is perfect for light-medium skin tones.</li>
    <li> I have very light &amp; clear Irish skin. Im 33, so I have to use some sort of a primer/bb cream to get that flawless look to compete with the natural glowing skin of the countless 20-somethings running around the streets of Philadelphia (enjoy it while it lasts Bs!!) I have tried several different higher end BB creams including Boscia (my absolute fave), Too Faced &amp; Smashbox. All are VERY nice... but I&#x27;m not thrilled with the price at almost $40 a pop; After the very last drop out of my Boscia tube was squeezed out, I neglected to replace it, and instead decided to venture into uncharted territory-a drugstore! (gasp!). Well, I never really got around to it until one lazy Sunday afternoon when I was strolling around my local grocery store, I came upon the L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code BB Cream. I thought to myself \\&quot;Hey, I need some youthfulness AND BB cream! This is totally cheap at 15 bucks--Im going to try this out. I&#x27;m so smart &amp; frugal. Look out younger generation--I&#x27;ve got yr code now!!! YOLO!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I sort of wish I had made up that last statement for the purposes of this review, but unfortunately, that is my actual thought process/what I possibly said out loud.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, in a sleepy haze I started to put on my daiy makeup. When I remembered I had the product, I fished it out of the grocery bag, ripped open the box, squeezed out a pea size amount &amp; rubbed it into my face in an upwards motion. It applied easily enough &amp; had a bit of slip to it (plus?), but overall it just kind of sat there and didn&#x27;t really absorb into my pores. Eh, no bigs, I wasn&#x27;t expecting the same quality as the products I&#x27;ve used in the past. I felt younger already-sort of like when you buy your first bottle of foundation and you look like a quasi-nutball until you find a shade that makes you look like you&#x27;re not wearing nutella. Other than that, makeup went on fine, didn&#x27;t really see a difference during the day either-kinda just felt a little thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to the end of the week after wearing the BB Cream about 4x. This was when I truly found out what L&#x27;Oreal means by Youth Code...hint-It&#x27;s pimples. Seriously, broke out on my chin, on my cheek, and just for laughs, the tip of my nose. Do you have any idea how ridiculous a pimple on the TIP OF YOUR NOSE looks? ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I immediately discontinued using &amp; slam dunked it into the trashcan. Im half-convinced this product was secretly made by Proactive to get you to buy their stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, isn&#x27;t it totally ironic that I had to spend extra money on buying pimple cream/face wash because I didn&#x27;t want to shell out the cash for a quality product in the first place? Goes to show you, just do it right the first time.  Not all is lost, I do feel a lot younger having to purchase Oxy products while fighting the strange urge to find some Electric Youth perfume &amp; watch Weird Science.o the end of the week after wearing the BB Cream about 4x.

    <li> awesome seller A++++++++</li>
    <li> I tried this when I was on a trip and then just had to have another one because I&#x27;ve given up my old favorite expensive foundation for this ....it&#x27;s wonderful...goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling and looking great. I just need to put on loose powder over it and I&#x27;m ready for the rest of the day...!</li>
    <li> Yup I am too white for a perfect match with the lightest color they have. However, it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, irritate skin or go weird when you sweat. I do find I prefer to wear it over my moisturizer rather than alone because my skin generally starts feeling dry mid day without it.</li>
    <li> The cream looks great once it&#x27;s applied but it still has a makeup feel to it and made me break out :( I will stick to my philosophy brand!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  No other makeup needed.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised with this face cream, it is so light, it covers all my imperfections and my face looks flawless. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Much better than the more expensive Tarte Amazonian BB clay, great texture, light coverage - I have to use it in conjunction with other cover up, but use it daily for casual looks and looks much better with it than without as it helps even my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I buy the light and medium shades and mix them in my palm for the perfect winter tone. In the summer I use the medium shade by itself. This is the first thing I put on my face when I apply my make-up. Then when I apply my foundation, I only have to concentrate on applying it around my eyes and on my nose and chin.  Lastly, I finish with a dab of mineral powder allover, applied with the e.l.f. kabuki face brush. I really brush it out! My face is going to stay good all day now and I can apply whatever color I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using the Garnier BB cream before and I didn&#x27;t like it because it had a very fine sparkly look.  I think they call it light reflectors.  That&#x27;s not for me.  I like to keep my look natural.  Youth Code BB cream evens out my complexion, moisturizes and protects from the sun.  My complexion has improved and my wrinkles are diminished too!  Yay! I&#x27;ll keep using this one.</li>
    <li> If you are really fair skinned like I am, this may not be light enough in color for you. It is heavier than I thought it would be. I also thought it would be more like a moisturizer, my liquid make-up has a lighter feel. Of course, this is just my opinion, it may work better for others.</li>
    <li> Goes on light and creamy. Not a foundation. Love what it does. Smooths the skin, adds a slight coloration, and evens the tone.&lt;br /&gt;Wear with or without other products. Feels great.</li>
    <li> This cream is so wonderful!  I wear it around the house if I&#x27;m not going anywhere, and when I am going someplace, this cream is great.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a makeup base not a primer and it works wonders. It gives my skin a clear flawless look without looking like I have anything on. I am fair skin with loads of freckles and its perfect.</li>
    <li> I use the youth code serum for moisturizer day and night and thought I would try the BB cream. I use it over the dark spot corrector serum and it goes on smooth with just a small amount of cream. It matches my Irish/German skin and helps conceal my splotcy, uneven skin tone. The only reason for 4 not 5 stars is because I wish it covered alittle better so I would not need further foundation although if I am just hanging around the house this is  all I wear. Skin feels good all day and the price is right</li>
    <li> This product has a strong and unpleasant fragrance (&amp;#34;sickening&amp;#34; in my opinion).  I washed it off immediately and threw out the tube.  No great loss, since I found the texture rather sticky, dragging on my skin, and the tone-enhancing properties utterly invisible.</li>
    <li> love this, sometimes, like today I have this on with no foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again!  Any more colors?</li>
    <li> The best thing about this product is all the hype. Basically, as the tube says, its \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; SPF 15 to \\&quot;help prevent sunburn.\\&quot; It has a tinted creamy texture going on so you look like you have light make-up on--hence the \\&quot;illuminator\\&quot; claim. It contains several forms of alcohol, which of course dries your skin. I bought light and medium to make my own shade, great going on but made my skin dry and itchy.</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this, and that it has sunscreen.  It also does not have an offensive smell like some face creams.  However, I have very fair skin with a pink undertone. This cream is yellowish (the fair) and just made my skin look greasy. I tried it alone &amp; under my foundation, and it looked horrible both ways.  I prefer the L&#x27;Oreal primer (pale pink).</li>
    <li> If you want pretty, luminous skin without a heavy buildup of products: GO for this. However do not be fooled by the name: BB cream. This is a tinted moisturizer with sunscreen, and a little bit of the youth code serum in it. It is not a BB cream. A true BB cream, the Korean Product,contains many anti aging products, moisturizers, serums, and nice buildable coverage. The idea was that, many years ago, Korean woman would spend hours on their skin making sure that it was properly balanced. So wouldn&#x27;t they also try to use makeup products that would aid in their skin care regimen? Yes, and thus the popularity of BB creams. This is why many oriental woman look so youthful, like my 36 year old Professor who looked younger than half of her students, no lie. Western versions of BB creams do not hold a candle to the actual ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual product here is heavy when squeezed out of the tube. The box instructs you to apply with fingers, probably to warm the product up and let it dissolve into the skin better. I personally do not like that application: I prefer to use a flat top brush and buff it gently into my skin. This helps sheer it out, as otherwise it would go on with a medium coverage. It does a great job in the luminosity area, and helps fade the look of my skin issues: My general issues are old acne marks. Usually I also require a little concealer on top just because some of the marks are darker. It is also very moisturizing, cool to the touch, but easy to rub off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product because in the winter my normal Revlon Colorstay looks thick and cakey, and I hate the idea that my skin looks perfect, yet when I take off my makeup, there are clearly some issues. I wanted a sheer tint of color that would make me look good, but also not hide my true skin. I however am a MAC NC-15 in concealer, and am as pale as a ghost in the winter time. This product, in the light, comes off a little yellow. This is due to the sunscreen oxidizing in the air,turning it a different color. If you&#x27;ve ever kept a close eye on your cosmetics you will notice that with age they turn pink or yellow in the bottle, again this is the amount of sunscreen being exposed to the air time after time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited as of 3/2/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started noticing that after a while, the BB cream has oxidized on my skin:( It turns about one shade darker on me than my skin shade. I&#x27;m super pale in the winter, so it is hard to find a light enough anything. This will be better for me once I get some sun, but for now it is oxidizing too much!</li>
    <li> My facialist and dermatologist both recommended I discontinue using due to breakouts.  But the coverage is very smooth - you get very even skin tone and excellent color.  Bummed about the breakouts or else I would still be using this product.</li>
    <li> This Youth Code BB Cream Illuminator is a very good product. It goes on easily and moisturizes very well. I would purchase this item again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I had heard such great things about this BB cream, so I ought I&#x27;d try it.  Well, it&#x27;s a little greasy in my opinion.  I feel like it goes on and I either have way too much or not enough, but I feel greasy with it on.  The color is a fine match for my light skin, but it feels way to heavy.  I think I would rather have a tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting. The color is a little odd for me. I am olive complexion, but very light, and this is called &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; but is a sort of orangey color. It also goes on sort of greasy and leaves a shiny finish. I have to finish with powder. Do not think I would go out of my way to use this again after I finish the tube.</li>
    <li> Tried this because Consumer Reports recommended it, and it works great. I spend a lot of time outside and end up with very uneven skin tones on my face, and this product evens it out nicely. Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this cream a few days, but I like it so far.  Guess I&#x27;ll wait to see if there&#x27;s any break out like other reviewers have mentioned.  For now--I use my regular moisturizer first and then put on the BB Cream.  It covers nicely &amp; looks really good.  You only have to use a little, so maybe the person who complained about the clown mask was wearing too much.  I think I&#x27;ll be wearing it all the time, not just when I put on make up for going out of the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/20/13  I&#x27;m upping my rating to 5 stars.  This is a very nice product, and I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems others have mentioned.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this BB cream. I have always hated wearing anything but powder foundation and the cake-y feeling of liquid foundation. As I hit my mid-30&#x27;s I needed something that provided a little moisture. I use a wet make-up sponge to apply and it dries, leaving a nice glow. This is better than anything I have used in the past. If I could give it 6 stars I would.</li>
    <li> Hi. Not sure about the product because I ordered it from Amazon but the wrong shade came. And the box was missing. And the was a big sticker on the product. So all in all not happy and will be returning. It wasn&#x27;t Amazon who sold it just bought it on the Amazon site.</li>
    <li> This is the one of the few BB Cream I tried that didn&#x27;t cause acne.  I tried the Korean brand Missha which was pretty good but much harder to find and more expensive.  This is affordable and goes on well.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I  don&#x27;t wear foundation makeup any more.  Just this product, looks so natural and keeps my skin looking young!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but I am getting a bit older now and wanted sheer coverage.  The product goes on smooth and even with good coverage and the added bonus of sunblock.  I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for my skin tone</li>
    <li> Rubbed off on my coat... charming. The color wasn&#x27;t quite right. I see how they sold it so cheap. Doesn&#x27;t remove cleanly.</li>
    <li> it is cheap, good and I like it. I wil buy it next time from the same place. that&#x27;s it</li>
</ol>
