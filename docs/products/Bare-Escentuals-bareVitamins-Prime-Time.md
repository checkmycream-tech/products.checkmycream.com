### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is best with mineral makeup.</li>
      <li>It was the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done!</li>
      <li>And my friend who was with me laughed, but she agreed that it looked that excellent.</li>
      <li>you honestly don&#x27;t even feel it on the skin!  </li>
      <li>The rest of the day I felt so good about my complexion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve watched the BE instructional dvd and never could get my make-up to look as good, and I realize now</li>
      <li>I really love this product!</li>
      <li>I thought it was because I don&#x27;t have flawless skin, but the primer really does lay the foundation for the foundation and everything else.</li>
      <li>This makes the product also kind to your purse.</li>
      <li>She gave me a hand mirror, and my honest to goodness reaction was, \\&quot;It looks just like in the video!\\&quot;</li>
      <li>this is the most amazing stuff ever  </li>
      <li>However, if this were some kind of miracle treatment, I&#x27;d be able to justify the $21+ shipping to myself.     </li>
      <li>This product is an excellent prep-step to applying your Bare Escentuals products.  </li>
      <li>Today is my second day with it on and it looks great!  </li>
      <li>I have heard about using Monistat chafing gel as a primer, and it seems to be safe, so I might try it since it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it as a sample &amp; didn&#x27;t purchase it myself.  </li>
      <li>My makeup also appears to be staying in place a bit better.  </li>
      <li>Prime Time has solved those problems and more.</li>
      <li>And as others have said in their reviews, it helps the mineral foundation go on better.</li>
      <li>really well i love it!!  </li>
      <li>It does take some time to develop your own \\&quot;techniques\\&quot; for applying the make-up quickly, but stay with it</li>
      <li>I think it is okay, but isn&#x27;t anything fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t sound too healthy.</li>
      <li>yeah, this stuff sets your makeup and it feels really good, kind of greasy, but once you have all your makeup on, you won&#x27;t look like a big grease-bag, I promise.  </li>
      <li>The Primer goes on easily and makes my skin feel silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply (after the initial learning curve), provides great coverage and doesn&#x27;t become oily looking or rub off.  </li>
      <li>It makes your mineral makeup go on evenly and makes your skin look smooth.</li>
      <li>Gives a silky smooth finish in seconds.</li>
      <li>It goes on so smooth</li>
      <li>So this is a must for those who are having problems with your makeup looking smooth.  </li>
      <li>My face looks smooth all over.</li>
      <li>it makes your face silky smooth and sets the BE makeup</li>
      <li>although I could definitely see Prime Time working for someone who has imagined-imperfections and is trying to achieve the PERFECT face rather than the \\&quot;hey, no one can see my acne today if I stand near shadows!\\&quot; face.     </li>
      <li>I like Prime Time because it really helps my makeup stay on, and look better.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my face from looking dry and crusty, and my face feels good to touch, too.</li>
      <li>Ten hours after I applied my foundation and powder, my makeup looked almost as good as it did when I first put it on.</li>
      <li>Well, the esthetician who did my consult put it on me first (my face felt like silk, no joke!)</li>
      <li>I use a couple different kinds of makeup, including BE, and the primer made every kind turn color.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough that the biggest benefit of using Bare Escentuals is the fact that you don&#x27;t feel it on your skin and it looks beautiful.  </li>
      <li>Prime Time is a great primer that is much more affordable than some of the other brands on the market, which is a big plus.</li>
      <li>I am a true BE fan and love their foundation but do not like to purchase items that are not necessary.  </li>
      <li>The first day, I did not put enough own because I thought it may make my face too oily.  </li>
      <li>I love Bare Minerals makeup.  </li>
      <li>, that the first ingredient listed for Prime Time (cyclopentasiloxane) is the same first ingredient in a hairspray that I own (which claims to protect hair from heat).  </li>
      <li>This may be a good primer for people with normal or dry skin, but definately not oily skin types.</li>
      <li>It reminds me a lot of Smashbox primer, only probably a bit thicker and more gelatinous, but it&#x27;s clearish and smells like Smashbox, like gasoline or something.  </li>
      <li>When I first started wearing it, I noticed that it didn&#x27;t wear well,</li>
      <li>At first you will wonder \\&quot;Am</li>
      <li>and I was hooked from the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>yet this sinks into my skin so quickly that I end up having to use more.  </li>
      <li>I got a sample of this with my order of BareMinerals starter kit, its a sheer soft gel that the skin absorbs right away, its so light and gives a silky  feel to the skin, and its not oily at all!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everyday minerals, and I love their blushes and their prices, but I love the way Bare Minerals looks on my skin.  </li>
      <li>The only complaint I had was that the eye shadows didn&#x27;t seem to stay put and would build up in the crease of my eyelid and that tiny crows feet became a bit more prominent after even a very light application.  </li>
      <li>Very unimpressed with this product.    </li>
      <li>Although, it doesn&#x27;t do much to minimize my pores.  </li>
      <li>and it looks much smoother on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed: I may as well spread a thin layer of baby powder over my face instead of spending this much money on such a product.    </li>
      <li>I know they sell a touchup kit with mineral veil, but who really has the time to do that?  </li>
      <li>A tiny amount does a fantastic job of setting foundation and powder.</li>
      <li>The other benefits of using Bare Escentuals are that even if you think you&#x27;ve applied to much, it blends beautifully and is literally mistake-proof (try that with regular make-up).  </li>
      <li>The first time I applied this make-up I was amazed at how natural it looked and felt.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely be using the product consistently!</li>
      <li>This make up primer didn&#x27;t do much for me as far as keeping my make up on.</li>
      <li>ALL of my first purchases are 4 years old, and the only item that I&#x27;ve ran out of was the foundation (and that lasted almost 2 years before I had to buy a new one)!    </li>
      <li>At first I was worried I would use it all up in a short amount of time.</li>
      <li>After going back and forth with Clinique foundation some days and the BE foundation others for about a year, I decided to go and have a consultation done at a local salon and spa place which sells all the BE products (they had a special on foundation).</li>
      <li>Needless to say, I was in for a pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>Be sure to use only 1 pump of this product and let it dry for several minutes before you apply your make-up.  </li>
      <li>If you have obvious pores or large pores, you are in need of this product.</li>
      <li>I have never been allergic to any beauty product, and do not have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>With it my skin stays oil free a lot longer and pores and unevenly colored places on my face are smoothed out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll use a few more times with another foundation and come back to edit my review accordingly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Bare Escentuals makeup for the past 2 years and have really enjoyed the product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a tiny bottle for $21, and at first I thought I had been ripped off, but I use it pretty much every day for the past 3 months</li>
      <li>If you use too much, or don&#x27;t let it dry enough, you will notice that it can \\&quot;grab\\&quot; too much of the Foundation \\&quot;powder\\&quot; and can look cakey.  </li>
      <li>Remember that with Bare Escentuals their statement of \\&quot;less is more\\&quot; is definitely true in this case.      </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so silky smooth during application, isn&#x27;t tacky or oily and has even eliminated the look of small pores on the nose area.  </li>
      <li>I got a sample of this with the Bare Minerals Face Kit.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant to try this, as I abhor Bare Esentuals mineral foundation.</li>
      <li>It creates a wonderfully smooth base for your Foundation to go on top of.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Bare Escentuals products now for the last 4 years</li>
      <li>Buy a few starter kits (one for the face, and one for the eyes) - you really won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
      <li>really like it, I never used a foundation primer before, I just use a sunscreen or any other cream for my face before makeup, you know it works the same EXCEPT that this gel is not oily and doesn&#x27;t come up to he surface later on the day!</li>
      <li>The small amount of primer from just one pump covers the entire face and smooths the skin so that Bare Escentuals foundation (and probably any other foundation as well) goes on smoothly and stays on longer.  </li>

<li> and then she did my Light foundation, a little Warmth, Clear Radiance on the apples of my cheeks and a little on my nose and then Featherlight Mineral Veil (which has a slight shimmer to it).</li>
<li> A small amount is enough to cover the whole face, &amp; it glides on like silk.  </li>
<li> My pores did not shrink, my dry skin did not smooth over much (I could&#x27;ve put water on the dry parts to achieve the same effect), and my face actually felt drier than it had before.  </li>
<li> I have combination skin that is not very sensitive.  </li>
<li> It smooths out my skin and my makeup stays put all day long</li>
<li> And I mean they really run.  </li>
<li> It goes on as a clear, lightweight gel, and you only need a very small amount (the size of a pea or a dime) to cover your entire face.</li>
<li> (I&#x27;ve never noticed this before,) or if it is Prime Time, but my skin LOOKS a little dried out (even if it doesn&#x27;t feel that way who wants to look it?)  </li>
<li> After a few hours, I notice that my make-up runs a little bit &amp; my skin starts to look very oily.    </li>
<li> oh-so dry and magnetizes even the tinest imperfection.  </li>
<li> I have sensitive (not ever oily or acne prone) skin that can dry out at times and look uneven due to my keratosis pilaris.</li>
<li> I have extremely pale skin and have always had trouble finding makeup that conceals the inperfections without making me look like I&#x27;m ready for Halloween everyday of the year.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s also hard to touch up on Bare Minerals throughout the day.  </li>
<li> My skin is peeling due to an acne medication I&#x27;m using.  </li>
<li> I still gave it 4 stars, because other than that, the product does what it is designed to do, and I have not read any other reviews where the product had this reaction on anyone else.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard some say if you have oily skin you should stay away from gel like primers. Well, I have oily skin and this gives me no problem what so ever. It&#x27;s every silky and there&#x27;s no smell and no sensation when you put it on.  I tried out the Rimmel primer but I found my makeup was blotchy after a while. This product is best with mineral makeup.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this with my order of BareMinerals starter kit, its a sheer soft gel that the skin absorbs right away, its so light and gives a silky  feel to the skin, and its not oily at all! &lt;br /&gt;I really like it, I never used a foundation primer before, I just use a sunscreen or any other cream for my face before makeup, you know it works the same EXCEPT that this gel is not oily and doesn&#x27;t come up to he surface later on the day! &lt;br /&gt;Try to get a sample and see how you feel about it, I like i!</li>
    <li> I was so skeptical about this product, but a Bare Escentuals rep gave me a sample and I was hooked from the first time I used it.  The small amount of primer from just one pump covers the entire face and smooths the skin so that Bare Escentuals foundation (and probably any other foundation as well) goes on smoothly and stays on longer.  I definitely notice the difference when I forget to use it.  With it my skin stays oil free a lot longer and pores and unevenly colored places on my face are smoothed out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Escentuals makeup for the past 2 years and have really enjoyed the product. It&#x27;s easy to apply (after the initial learning curve), provides great coverage and doesn&#x27;t become oily looking or rub off.  The only complaint I had was that the eye shadows didn&#x27;t seem to stay put and would build up in the crease of my eyelid and that tiny crows feet became a bit more prominent after even a very light application.  NO MORE!  Prime Time has solved those problems and more. It&#x27;s so silky smooth during application, isn&#x27;t tacky or oily and has even eliminated the look of small pores on the nose area.  Will definitely be using the product consistently!</li>
    <li> this is the most amazing stuff ever  it makes your face silky smooth and sets the BE makeup really well i love it!!  it is non-oily and doesnt rub off during the day  if you have BE this is a must purchase item</li>
    <li> I recieved a generous amount of samples of Prime Time primer. I&#x27;ve never heard of this primer until I order some products from Apothica. I did NOT like it at all. It had a funky smell and orange. Before I applied my foundation, my face already had a grayish tint. I looked like an Oompa Loompa! I tossed all of it in the trash. Maybe it was defect sample or whatever. It still left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not purchase again so they can make a case.</li>
    <li> Prime Time is a great primer that is much more affordable than some of the other brands on the market, which is a big plus. This primer is also a lot lighter than some of its competitors. It goes on as a clear, lightweight gel, and you only need a very small amount (the size of a pea or a dime) to cover your entire face. I definitely noticed a big difference when I used this primer. Ten hours after I applied my foundation and powder, my makeup looked almost as good as it did when I first put it on. I would definitely recommend this product and may buy the full-size version once I use up my more expensive bottle of Urban Decay primer.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! At first I was worried I would use it all up in a short amount of time. Truly, one pump does  your entire face. If you have obvious pores or large pores, you are in need of this product. It makes your mineral makeup go on evenly and makes your skin look smooth. It lasts me over a month and use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This product is an excellent prep-step to applying your Bare Escentuals products.  It creates a wonderfully smooth base for your Foundation to go on top of.  I have even gone without the Foundation and used this by itself when I&#x27;ve been in a rush.  Prime-Time feels like silk when it is applied.  It goes on so smooth you honestly don&#x27;t even feel it on the skin!  For me, I&#x27;ve noticed that it evens out my skin tone and also helps to reduce oil build-up on my skin.  Be sure to use only 1 pump of this product and let it dry for several minutes before you apply your make-up.  If you use too much, or don&#x27;t let it dry enough, you will notice that it can \\&quot;grab\\&quot; too much of the Foundation \\&quot;powder\\&quot; and can look cakey.  Remember that with Bare Escentuals their statement of \\&quot;less is more\\&quot; is definitely true in this case.      I have been using Bare Escentuals products now for the last 4 years and I refuse to use anything else.  At first you will wonder \\&quot;Am I doing this right\\&quot;?  Not to worry, you can&#x27;t possibly do it wrong!  It does take some time to develop your own \\&quot;techniques\\&quot; for applying the make-up quickly, but stay with it and you won&#x27;t regret it!  I have extremely pale skin and have always had trouble finding makeup that conceals the inperfections without making me look like I&#x27;m ready for Halloween everyday of the year.  No matter what make-up products I tried, I always had the same result: washed-out skin that felt suffocated.  The first time I applied this make-up I was amazed at how natural it looked and felt.  I can&#x27;t stress enough that the biggest benefit of using Bare Escentuals is the fact that you don&#x27;t feel it on your skin and it looks beautiful.  Your skin can breathe through the make-up and you CAN go all day without having to do touch-ups.  The other benefits of using Bare Escentuals are that even if you think you&#x27;ve applied to much, it blends beautifully and is literally mistake-proof (try that with regular make-up).  Also, you may think that it is expensiveto \\&quot;try\\&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t.  ALL of my first purchases are 4 years old, and the only item that I&#x27;ve ran out of was the foundation (and that lasted almost 2 years before I had to buy a new one)!    Buy a few starter kits (one for the face, and one for the eyes) - you really won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> After going back and forth with Clinique foundation some days and the BE foundation others for about a year, I decided to go and have a consultation done at a local salon and spa place which sells all the BE products (they had a special on foundation). It was the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done! I had tried the Prime Time primer before, but I never bought it. Well, the esthetician who did my consult put it on me first (my face felt like silk, no joke!) and then she did my Light foundation, a little Warmth, Clear Radiance on the apples of my cheeks and a little on my nose and then Featherlight Mineral Veil (which has a slight shimmer to it). She gave me a hand mirror, and my honest to goodness reaction was, \\&quot;It looks just like in the video!\\&quot; And my friend who was with me laughed, but she agreed that it looked that excellent. I&#x27;ve watched the BE instructional dvd and never could get my make-up to look as good, and I realize now it was because I didn&#x27;t have the primer. I thought it was because I don&#x27;t have flawless skin, but the primer really does lay the foundation for the foundation and everything else. I have acne on and off, and it works even on my problem skin. It keeps my face from looking dry and crusty, and my face feels good to touch, too. The rest of the day I felt so good about my complexion. I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because it&#x27;s a lot to pay for just 1 oz.</li>
    <li> This make up primer didn&#x27;t do much for me as far as keeping my make up on. It made my skin feel oilier and broke me out.</li>
    <li> I like Prime Time because it really helps my makeup stay on, and look better.  Yet every time I put it on, my nose and eyes immediately start to run. And I mean they really run.  I have never been allergic to any beauty product, and do not have sensitive skin.  I still gave it 4 stars, because other than that, the product does what it is designed to do, and I have not read any other reviews where the product had this reaction on anyone else.</li>
    <li> Very unimpressed with this product.    First of all, the size of the product is unbelievable.  The bottle is tiny! And the bottle claims that \\&quot;less is more,\\&quot; yet this sinks into my skin so quickly that I end up having to use more.  However, if this were some kind of miracle treatment, I&#x27;d be able to justify the $21+ shipping to myself.     I noticed virtually no difference after having had applied the product.  My pores did not shrink, my dry skin did not smooth over much (I could&#x27;ve put water on the dry parts to achieve the same effect), and my face actually felt drier than it had before.  However, my skin did feel \\&quot;silkier\\&quot;... superficially.  It did not feel moisturized, just smoother. I wasn&#x27;t impressed: I may as well spread a thin layer of baby powder over my face instead of spending this much money on such a product.    I have combination skin that is not very sensitive.  And I suppose this just isn&#x27;t the product for someone who has actual skin problems...although I could definitely see Prime Time working for someone who has imagined-imperfections and is trying to achieve the PERFECT face rather than the \\&quot;hey, no one can see my acne today if I stand near shadows!\\&quot; face.     Oh. And by the way, I just happened to notice (since I&#x27;m an ingredient scanner, and odd-sounding ingredients stick in my head), that the first ingredient listed for Prime Time (cyclopentasiloxane) is the same first ingredient in a hairspray that I own (which claims to protect hair from heat).  I&#x27;d be guessing that this gel merely chemically shields the skin from outside products, rather than actually helping the skin.  And, anyway, even if this is not the case, I personally wouldn&#x27;t want to put hairspray on my face and walk around like that all day. Would you? Doesn&#x27;t sound too healthy.</li>
    <li> A tiny amount does a fantastic job of setting foundation and powder. Gives a silky smooth finish in seconds.</li>
    <li> I decided to try Prime Time recently after seeing a review.  I am a true BE fan and love their foundation but do not like to purchase items that are not necessary.  Today is my second day with it on and it looks great!  The first day, I did not put enough own because I thought it may make my face too oily.  My skin is peeling due to an acne medication I&#x27;m using.  Today you can not tell that my face is peeling.  My face looks smooth all over. So this is a must for those who are having problems with your makeup looking smooth.  And as others have said in their reviews, it helps the mineral foundation go on better.</li>
    <li> I like some BE products, but this is one that I will not buy again.  I used it sporadically over a period of a couple months, and I noticed that when I used the primer, my makeup turned a darker, orangy color.  I use a couple different kinds of makeup, including BE, and the primer made every kind turn color.  I did not like this product at all.  It did, however, keep the makeup on longer than average (I have oily skin and makeup usually disappears by mid-afternoon w/o a primer).</li>
    <li> I have sensitive (not ever oily or acne prone) skin that can dry out at times and look uneven due to my keratosis pilaris. I was hesitant to try this, as I abhor Bare Esentuals mineral foundation. It makes my skin look oh-so dry and magnetizes even the tinest imperfection.  Needless to say, I was in for a pleasant surprise. It made my liquid foundation glide on like a dream and it made my cheeks feel smoother. My makeup also appears to be staying in place a bit better.  That said, 1 lippie off because I&#x27;m not sure if it is my foundation (I&#x27;ve never noticed this before,) or if it is Prime Time, but my skin LOOKS a little dried out (even if it doesn&#x27;t feel that way who wants to look it?)  I&#x27;ll use a few more times with another foundation and come back to edit my review accordingly.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this with the Bare Minerals Face Kit.  I&#x27;m glad I got it as a sample &amp; didn&#x27;t purchase it myself.  I think it is okay, but isn&#x27;t anything fabulous.  My skin is combination oily &amp; this primer just doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up after a few hours of wear.  A small amount is enough to cover the whole face, &amp; it glides on like silk.  Although, it doesn&#x27;t do much to minimize my pores.  After a few hours, I notice that my make-up runs a little bit &amp; my skin starts to look very oily.    This may be a good primer for people with normal or dry skin, but definately not oily skin types.</li>
    <li> I have used several foundation \\&quot;primers\\&quot; from big brand name makeup companies and I always return to BE.  My foundation stays put for hours, without caking.  The Primer goes on easily and makes my skin feel silky smooth.  It only takes a couple of pumps to do my entire face.  This makes the product also kind to your purse.</li>
    <li> I love Bare Minerals makeup.  I&#x27;ve tried everyday minerals, and I love their blushes and their prices, but I love the way Bare Minerals looks on my skin.  When I first started wearing it, I noticed that it didn&#x27;t wear well, so by the end of the day, it looked like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any makeup at all and you could see all the imperfections in my skin.  It&#x27;s also hard to touch up on Bare Minerals throughout the day.  I know they sell a touchup kit with mineral veil, but who really has the time to do that?  wouldn&#x27;t you rather just not worry about it?  So yeah, this stuff sets your makeup and it feels really good, kind of greasy, but once you have all your makeup on, you won&#x27;t look like a big grease-bag, I promise.  It&#x27;s a tiny bottle for $21, and at first I thought I had been ripped off, but I use it pretty much every day for the past 3 months and it still feels like I have a lot in there.  It reminds me a lot of Smashbox primer, only probably a bit thicker and more gelatinous, but it&#x27;s clearish and smells like Smashbox, like gasoline or something.  It smooths out my skin and my makeup stays put all day long and it looks much smoother on my skin.  I have heard about using Monistat chafing gel as a primer, and it seems to be safe, so I might try it since it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
