      <li>Best stuff ever, and doesn&#x27;t destroy my hair.</li>
      <li>Unless you have light hair it won&#x27;t show up well.</li>
      <li>BUT - if I tell you how great it is, you&#x27;ll buy it and there won&#x27;t be any left for me!</li>
      <li>I was happy to get my hair done before valentines day, and its lasting too, well fading gradually</li>
      <li>In certain lighting it would look red and in others it would look more purple, but i loved the color</li>
      <li>Looks cool.</li>
      <li>It looks cool</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for full blown purple hair this won&#x27;t do it.</li>
      <li>It really does sound like a cool product.</li>
      <li>I let her do it all on her own the 2nd time.</li>
      <li>and it came out of the bottle as orange and did nothing but turn my hair more red</li>
      <li>It was pretty though.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I wanted though.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t last as long as others claimed but was great while it did.</li>
      <li>The color fades with every wash but found it easy on the hair after multiple uses.</li>
      <li>I used to use this years ago and loved it back then, but since this product seems to have sat on a shelf for that long, it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>She had a blast with these, and they were so gentle</li>
      <li>She really wanted to this product and will not stop asking me to color her hair</li>
      <li>This product leaves a Nice shine and a bit of a color which lasts a few washes!</li>
      <li>but I would recommend it to anyone looking for a little change :)</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s hard to explain honestly.</li>
      <li>My natural hair color is a medium shade of ashy brown, in between brown and blonde, and this turned my hair into a pretty reddish shade</li>
      <li>My hair is more than halfway down my back</li>
      <li>i was surprised...</li>
      <li>Looks really vibrant and my friends think I&#x27;ve been going back to the salon!</li>
      <li>and i love how i can pretty much decide if i want it to last for a few days or a few months just by leaving the mousse in my hair for different amounts of time.</li>

    <li> I used color pulse at least 3 times over the years until my local stores stopped carrying it. I&#x27;m happy to find it on amazon. I used the chilled plum color once and loved it. If you&#x27;re looking for full blown purple hair this won&#x27;t do it. I have dark brown hair and in the sun was when you saw a purple glow. It was exactly what I wanted though. It lasts maybe a bit over a month depending on how often you wash your hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok lighter then I wanted</li>
    <li> I usually use wella color charm profound violet demi permanent color and sallys was out so i saw this and thought hey why not it should be quicker....and it was i was surprised...it ended up shining a little bit magenta. It was pretty though.I was happy to get my hair done before valentines day, and its lasting too, well fading gradually but thats what is to be expected.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Honestly i was a little bit concerned that i would have either red hair or some sort of crazy purple color, but i figured it was only temporary color and with a name like chilled plum(which i thought was very cute) how could i go wrong? My natural hair color is a medium shade of ashy brown, in between brown and blonde, and this turned my hair into a pretty reddish shade, it&#x27;s hard to explain honestly. In certain lighting it would look red and in others it would look more purple, but i loved the color and i love how i can pretty much decide if i want it to last for a few days or a few months just by leaving the mousse in my hair for different amounts of time. And the mousse smells really good, not at all chemically or nasty. The bottle said something about needing two bottles if you&#x27;re hair is longer than shoulder length, so not true. My hair is more than halfway down my back and i&#x27;ve done my hair two times. I love this stuff and use it whenever i feel like i need a hair change up, oh and whenever i use it i get lots of compliments&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I bought a few different colors of this brand, as my daughter had gotten to the age where she wanted to dye her hair, but I wanted her to see how much hassle it was without exposing her to harsh chemicals or a longer-lasting color. She had a blast with these, and they were so gentle I let her do it all on her own the 2nd time. Good color, fades well, and won&#x27;t stink up your house!</li>
    <li> It really does sound like a cool product. It looks cool and i heard many great things about it however I did not receive my product. I ordered from iSpotBeauty if you were wondering. I&#x27;m not sure if it was bad on their end or the shipping end but it says that it was delivered however I did not receive it. They think my neighbors took it but I doubt it since all of my neighbors are good friends with me and we all look out for everyone. I am not satisfied at all though.</li>
    <li> Wish you still made this L&#x27;oreal .</li>
    <li> I love this hair color. It is so easy to use the mousse is awesome. The color is very intense and it smells great. It does last longer than the box says. I had a hard time finding a store that carried it which is why I bought it on Amazon. I have only tried the chilled plum and I use it on the underside of my hair (I work in a conservative environment) but I would recommend it to anyone looking for a little change :)</li>
    <li> I used to use this all of the time, but for some strange reason, Loreal decided to discontinue this! Best stuff ever, and doesn&#x27;t destroy my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years now and I can no longer find it in retail distribution (drug stores) so I happily buy it exclusively online - through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> BUT - if I tell you how great it is, you&#x27;ll buy it and there won&#x27;t be any left for me!</li>
    <li> The color of this product is nice. It added a pop to my current color. It was just messy to use and not worth it for temporary. I probably will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite temporary hair dye out there and it is a bummer that they no longer make it. I had to buy it by the case to make sure I would have a lot of it for a while.</li>
    <li> If you want a purple look do not get this. I wanted a dark purple/plum look. The base is mainly red. So my hair looked darker with a red hue. If you do not mind red then this is for you, but if you want black/purple then do not get this. Good thing is non-permanent! If you do not like this then you can always wash is out. It does not last that long.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t last as long as others claimed but was great while it did.</li>
    <li> I used to use this years ago and loved it back then, but since this product seems to have sat on a shelf for that long, it didn&#x27;t work at all. My hair was slightly darker for a day and then was completely gone.</li>
    <li> I was upset when i got the funky purple color and it came out of the bottle as orange and did nothing but turn my hair more red, i will stick with this chilled plum color it is amazing</li>
    <li> This product leaves a Nice shine and a bit of a color which lasts a few washes! I will by it again!</li>
    <li> I like using this product - it&#x27;s easy to apply, it doesn&#x27;t stain your scalp and it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. I do wish it lasted a little longer, but it&#x27;s not too bad. I use this rather than a permanent die as those seem to require you bleach your hair and this just covers my white. I have black hair and so this product does not affect the rest of my hair - just the white patch in front. Looks cool.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware--this product didn&#x27;t work on my hair.  All I can imagine: it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf somewhere for years and the chems don&#x27;t work any longer.  I remember using these years ago when you could find them in Walgreens--it worked for me then, but not now.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.    Update: iSpotBeauty blames the manufacturer for the issue and won&#x27;t refund my money.  Just another reason not to trust this seller with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I get burgundy and purple highlights and they wash out after a couple of weeks. I use this mousse every 1-2 weeks in between salon visits and it does the job. It works better on bleached or color treated hair. Unless you have light hair it won&#x27;t show up well. I have brown black hair and the color only works on the highlights. Looks really vibrant and my friends think I&#x27;ve been going back to the salon!</li>
    <li> Love the color and it is easy to use. The color fades with every wash but found it easy on the hair after multiple uses.</li>
    <li> She really wanted to this product and will not stop asking me to color her hair she is working on my last nerve</li>
