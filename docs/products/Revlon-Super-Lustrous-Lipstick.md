<li> I find myself reaching for it everyday.</li>
<li> A present for my mom who has been eying this cold for a while.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in stores</li>
<li> Very disappointed with Revlon!</li>

    <li> I love this color! Looks great and can wear with anything! Long lasting and adds just enough color without overpowering your face Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this primrose shade.  It gives me just enough color without looking overdone.  My lips stay moist while retaining that matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish the lipstick would stay on longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done Revlon!</li>
    <li> Pretty summer color. Love it!</li>

    <li> I love Revlon lipsticks they are great quality and are very affordable. Primrose is a gorgeous color it is a beautiful pink for every day.</li>
    <li> I thought this is either rosy or slightly rosy like so it blends into the skin of my lips.  Instead, it is super powdery white with slight tint of rose.  It looks like we put chalk on our lips!  My teens will not even touch it!  Very disappointed with Revlon!</li>
    <li> The Primrose is a little more pink in person than it is in the picture but no complaints, still a very pretty light nude pink also goes on nice. It does stay on for a decent amount of time I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing it somewhere you&#x27;ll be for a while without taking it with you and re applying it though 😳 other than that it was a pretty good product and shipping was way faster than promised!</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick it&#x27;s my &amp;#34;my lips but better&amp;#34; nudie pink and I love it! I find myself reaching for it everyday.</li>
