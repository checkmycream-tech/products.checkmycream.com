      <li>It smells good</li>
      <li>Good size and price, though.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and will add this product permanently to my skin care regime.</li>

      <li>That&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s getting everything and more out of your pores!</li>
      <li>I got hooked and love it!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Great price for the huge amount you get.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather or anything, but it exfoliates amazingly.</li>
      <li>This item is not anywhere as effective as their charcoal sugar version.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
      <li>and it is still effective.</li>
      <li>I have a nice fresh glow to my skin after every use!!!</li>
      <li>Leaves my face feeling smooth from the exfoliation and it smells AMAZING!</li>
      <li>This products claims to be exfoliating but in my opinion is more like a face polish (in a good way), it leaves my face squeaky clean without over drying it.</li>
      <li>then I was supposed to, excited and very pleased with service.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a face wash.</li>
      <li>Love the scrub.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d buy them more often.</li>
      <li>I love smell of this</li>
      <li>After buying this product in a sample size I fell in love, I looked (hunted) for this product in every drugstore I can think of but never found it</li>
      <li>It was an okay product.</li>
      <li>Like others, I got the sample size and fell in love.</li>
      <li>The scent is refreshing, too.  </li>
      <li>However, the Yes To product has a better smell and texture.</li>
      <li>For the price and quantity, this is much better.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not my favorite, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
      <li>They are pretty good for an inexpensive price.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s better to pat it into the skin before massaging it lightly in upward strokes.</li>
      <li>I love Freeman products, so I was really excited to try this.</li>
      <li>This one is very nice, doesn&#x27;t scrape your face off, has a very pleasant citrus scent, and rinses clean without leaving any residue or lotion behind.  </li>
      <li>It has a fine granulated feel so as you wash</li>
      <li>Great product overall.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a man and enjoy exfoliating with a good facial product.  </li>
      <li>Now, when I rinse it off, that feeling immediately goes away and my face feels fairly clean, but the experience during is just the weirdest thing...</li>
      <li>My face didn&#x27;t feel clean at all afterwards.</li>
      <li>:) love it sooo much after the first time i used it i could see results so um yeah</li>
      <li>and I was really looking forward to something that would have a refreshing feeling and aroma.</li>
      <li>but you should always be gentle while scrubbing just to stay on the safe side.</li>
      <li>My face felt so soft and clean after I used this!!</li>
      <li>When I think scrubs, I expect the product to be super exfoliating, this is not.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;d add that to the high column for sure.</li>
      <li>This is such a refreshing scrub!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not very picky though, so this scrub is good.</li>
      <li>The price is well worth it as well.  </li>
      <li>smells really good, and the micro beads are not harsh to even my sensitive skin, good product and a plus is that its pink &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and wasn&#x27;t expecting to be able to use an exfoliating product, but the grapefruit scrub is gentle.</li>
      <li>This product smells good, and leaves my face feeling clean, but it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel as clean as other facial scrubs I&#x27;ve used, it doesn&#x27;t become foamy or leaves any sign that it&#x27;s helping my complexion</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more runny than traditional scrubs</li>
      <li>Pretty Scent &amp;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves Skin Feeling Clean,Refreshed &amp; New!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I first got one of the trail sized packs in a spa in a jar kit for Christmas.</li>
      <li>My skin felt softer and brighter after the first use.  </li>
      <li>The texture is a bit runny, which is okay, but the exfoliating grains in it are too fine and few to do much exfoliating at all.  </li>
      <li>In addition, it bottle came only one-third full and Amazon doesn&#x27;t have a way for me to contact the seller!</li>
      <li>I think this product is only appropriate for people with dryer or normal skin (mine is oily).  </li>
      <li>I have combination skin and was hoping this scrub would be gentle for winter.</li>
      <li>Not so much.  </li>
      <li>(Freeman&#x27;s website wants you to pay 7 dollars just for shipping).</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say my face was softer after washing this off</li>
      <li>It was too gentle.</li>
      <li>(Better price on Freeman&#x27;s site or other online drug stores, though.)</li>
      <li>Other reviewers report that they love the grapefruit scent.  </li>
      <li>It cleaned my face, but I didn&#x27;t get that deep clean</li>
      <li>Great fragrance, scrub is not too harsh so doesn&#x27;t cause your skin to feel dry.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find the facial scrub full sized products in stores</li>
      <li>A sweet grapefruit scent that manages to relax yet energize at the same time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true</li>
      <li>The scrub from this comes from sugar which is less abrasive than walnut shells but more abrasive than jojoba beads.</li>
      <li>( I don&#x27;t think this particular product is sold in store, YET</li>
      <li>Will buy more, and highly recommended over other facial scrubs if you&#x27;re looking for a quality exfoliater for the right price.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I use it every other day on my face and have noticed my skin looks more soft and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I like the grapefruit exfoliating scrub because it leaves a clean feeling on my face and is not oily after use, nor is my skin dry.</li>
      <li>This had almost no small at all....where&#x27;s the grapefruit scent???</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t suck out all the natural oils in my skin</li>
      <li>you feel like your getting a professional treatment.  </li>
      <li>Generally I like Freeman products.</li>
      <li>The beads are a little large, which might be a problem for sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t find it to be an issue.</li>
      <li>My skin is so much softer and my acne scars actually seem to be fading a little.</li>

<li> A little goes a long way so it should last quite a while.</li>
<li> Helped me with my dry skin from the harsh winter, but left my skin a little pink for a while.</li>
<li> I tried Freeman for their Pineapple Enzyme Face Mask and branched out to their other products.  </li>
<li> The Other Freeman Stuff.</li>
<li> but it makes my skin feels a little dry after using it though,</li>
<li> After every use the my skin feels really tight.</li>
<li> What I like least is that, as I&#x27;m washing my face with this product, my face feels very heavily greasy, like I&#x27;m washing with petroleum jelly and not a facial wash.  </li>
<li> will finish this tube in the winter when my face is a little dryer, but I won&#x27;t use it now in the summer or purchase it again.  </li>
<li> but i guess that&#x27;s how it should feel because it&#x27;s getting rid of dead skin haha&lt;</li>

    <li> Generally I like Freeman products. They are pretty good for an inexpensive price. This scrub was a big disappointment. It&#x27;s not exfoliating at all and I was really looking forward to something that would have a refreshing feeling and aroma. This had almost no small at all....where&#x27;s the grapefruit scent???</li>
    <li> This Freeman Product Is Wonderful Like All&lt;br /&gt;Of The Other Freeman Stuff. Pretty Scent &amp;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves Skin Feeling Clean,Refreshed &amp; New!&lt;br /&gt;I Puffy Heart All Of Freeman&#x27;s Stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great but I think its making me break out</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and was hoping this scrub would be gentle for winter. It was too gentle. My face didn&#x27;t feel clean at all afterwards. Tried it for 3 weeks and broke out</li>
    <li> After every use the my skin feels really tight. That&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s getting everything and more out of your pores! Great scrub and it smells delicious!</li>
    <li> the stuff WORKS !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love Freeman products, so I was really excited to try this. It&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s not my favorite. When I think scrubs, I expect the product to be super exfoliating, this is not. It&#x27;s more of a face wash. It cleaned my face, but I didn&#x27;t get that deep clean that I thought I would. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but I will always be a fan of Freeman products.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter loves this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t burn her face like all of the chemical based acne medicine.</li>
    <li> it feels very different from what i thought, but it seems okay.&lt;br /&gt;i cant tell if it works... but it makes my skin feels a little dry after using it though, but i guess that&#x27;s how it should feel because it&#x27;s getting rid of dead skin haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways &#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;ll buy this again. i like their masks though!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Leaves my face feeling smooth from the exfoliation and it smells AMAZING! I first got one of the trail sized packs in a spa in a jar kit for Christmas. I got hooked and love it! Can&#x27;t find the facial scrub full sized products in stores so I have to order online, and amazon has them at the best price (Freeman&#x27;s website wants you to pay 7 dollars just for shipping). Doesn&#x27;t lather or anything, but it exfoliates amazingly. Will buy more, and highly recommended over other facial scrubs if you&#x27;re looking for a quality exfoliater for the right price.</li>
    <li> had an allergic reaction</li>
    <li> I like the grapefruit exfoliating scrub because it leaves a clean feeling on my face and is not oily after use, nor is my skin dry. Also gives a tightness to my skin! I rated it a 4 because it is kinda hard to use with a sponge but can use it without one and it is still effective. I will order this product again!</li>
    <li> Wow!  scrubs off dead skin, but a little on the harsh side if you have sensitive skin, so don&#x27;t use it often. Helped me with my dry skin from the harsh winter, but left my skin a little pink for a while. Be sure to follow up with a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The texture is a bit runny, which is okay, but the exfoliating grains in it are too fine and few to do much exfoliating at all.  I would have thought that the grapefruit element would help in exfoliation...meh.  Not so much.  Other reviewers report that they love the grapefruit scent.  What grapefruit scent?  I get a hint of it when I open the tube, then nothing.  What I like least is that, as I&#x27;m washing my face with this product, my face feels very heavily greasy, like I&#x27;m washing with petroleum jelly and not a facial wash.  It isn&#x27;t a pleasant feeling!  Now, when I rinse it off, that feeling immediately goes away and my face feels fairly clean, but the experience during is just the weirdest thing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will finish this tube in the winter when my face is a little dryer, but I won&#x27;t use it now in the summer or purchase it again.  I think this product is only appropriate for people with dryer or normal skin (mine is oily).  I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true St. Ive&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Love the scrub. It has a fine granulated feel so as you wash you feel like your getting a professional treatment.  My face looked brighter and smoother.</li>
    <li> This item is not anywhere as effective as their charcoal sugar version.  It smells great but there are hardly any scrub grains in it so it does not exfoliate well.  In addition, it bottle came only one-third full and Amazon doesn&#x27;t have a way for me to contact the seller!</li>
    <li> My face felt so soft and clean after I used this!! The best face product I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> I use this facial scrub and the Yes To Grapefruit facial scrub. For the price and quantity, this is much better. However, the Yes To product has a better smell and texture. I&#x27;m not very picky though, so this scrub is good. The beads are a little large, which might be a problem for sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t find it to be an issue. The smell is a little artificial, as to be expected. Good size and price, though. (Better price on Freeman&#x27;s site or other online drug stores, though.)</li>
    <li> smells really good, and the micro beads are not harsh to even my sensitive skin, good product and a plus is that its pink &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It was an okay product. It smells good but if you get really bad acne like me it makes it worse</li>
    <li> Once again got the product faster then I was supposed to, excited and very pleased with service.  Will definitely do business with them again.</li>
    <li> This product smells good, and leaves my face feeling clean, but it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel as clean as other facial scrubs I&#x27;ve used, it doesn&#x27;t become foamy or leaves any sign that it&#x27;s helping my complexion, it&#x27;s not my favorite, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> Like others, I got the sample size and fell in love. This is such a refreshing scrub! It exfoliates and brightens and smells divine. I sometimes use it just for the smell, it&#x27;s that good. A sweet grapefruit scent that manages to relax yet energize at the same time. It&#x27;s a bit more runny than traditional scrubs so it&#x27;s better to pat it into the skin before massaging it lightly in upward strokes. My skin is so much softer and my acne scars actually seem to be fading a little. Another winner from Freeman!</li>
    <li> After buying this product in a sample size I fell in love, I looked (hunted) for this product in every drugstore I can think of but never found it( I don&#x27;t think this particular product is sold in store, YET I hope. After giving up I went onto the Freeman website and compared the price to the price on Amazon and it was somewhat cheaper. This products claims to be exfoliating but in my opinion is more like a face polish (in a good way), it leaves my face squeaky clean without over drying it. Great product overall. Great price for the huge amount you get. Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> I adore this face scrub, it smells great and it works. Freeman does not test on animals nor do they use any animal products in their ingredients. The scrub from this comes from sugar which is less abrasive than walnut shells but more abrasive than jojoba beads. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man and enjoy exfoliating with a good facial product.  I tried Freeman for their Pineapple Enzyme Face Mask and branched out to their other products.  This one is very nice, doesn&#x27;t scrape your face off, has a very pleasant citrus scent, and rinses clean without leaving any residue or lotion behind.  The price is well worth it as well.  I wish all their products fell into the &amp;#34;free supersaver shipping&amp;#34; category and I&#x27;d buy them more often.</li>
    <li> :) love it sooo much after the first time i used it i could see results so um yeah i recommend</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way so it should last quite a while. The scrub isn&#x27;t hard on the skin but you should always be gentle while scrubbing just to stay on the safe side. I can&#x27;t really say my face was softer after washing this off but it didn&#x27;t suck out all the natural oils in my skin so I&#x27;d add that to the high column for sure. All in all I really like this scrub for everyday use. I have combination/dry skin by the way.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and wasn&#x27;t expecting to be able to use an exfoliating product, but the grapefruit scrub is gentle. My skin felt softer and brighter after the first use.  The scent is refreshing, too.  I&#x27;m very pleased and will add this product permanently to my skin care regime.</li>
    <li> I love smell of this it compliments my cocnut pinkgrapefruit lotion I made which is great!!! I have a nice fresh glow to my skin after every use!!!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, scrub is not too harsh so doesn&#x27;t cause your skin to feel dry.  I use it every other day on my face and have noticed my skin looks more soft and refreshed.</li>
