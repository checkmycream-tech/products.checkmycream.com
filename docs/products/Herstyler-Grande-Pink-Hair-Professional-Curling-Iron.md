      <li>I have never been able to curl my hair, until now.</li>
      <li>The one thing I do not like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a light or any kind of warning that its on</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m sure they ripped her off for it, because you cannot beat this price.</li>

      <li>and it takes me a good 45 mins to hot roll it.</li>
      <li>I recommend this to a friend easy to use better than the olds ones</li>
      <li>okay, Not as good as the real thing.</li>
      <li>On top of that I got 75% off on the herstyler serum which smells soooo gooood and also got free shampoo and conditioner.</li>

      <li>i would recomend this product to any women out there who wants nice curly hair</li>
      <li>it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>and it feels cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll assume it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>so if you have sensitive hair, good luck.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, it is outstanding!</li>
      <li>All in all, I recommend this product  if you want pretty prom hair every day or if you want a more relaxed look after running a brush thru the curls.</li>
      <li>Perfect curls that hold for 48+ hours in my past shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>However it did look cool.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Hard to use but got A LOT of compliments at work. Just need more practice. I have shoulder length hair that is hard to style, so I&#x27;m sure it will be easier to use when it grows out :)</li>
    <li> my wife bought these for my oldest daughter she was very happy with them</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING to say the least. I have long, fine hair that NEVER holds a curl and it takes me a good 45 mins to hot roll it. Plain awful. I bought this product because it was cheap and I heard great things. Sure enough, it is outstanding! My hair takes less than 10 mins to curl and it usually stays a good 10 hours without hairspray...NEVER happened before this product. With hairspray, I can easily wake up with the same beautiful hair lol. Buy this! It will save you time. I only recommend that you buy a thermal spray because this thing is hot as hell! Also, I found it was best to watch a youtube video on how to use it. I was a pro before I even got it in the mail lol</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling wand. Your curls will last for days . But be carful cause it gets super hot !!! I won&#x27;t use nothing else on my hair any more . Shipping was fast .</li>
    <li> Just like the ones they used to sell at the mall! Satisfied</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this product after I saw my friends gorgeous curls &amp; asked her what iron she used! She mentioned she bought this wand at the mall &amp; I&#x27;m sure they ripped her off for it, because you cannot beat this price. It makes nice ringlets reminiscent of Taylor Swifts hair circa 2009. Unfortunately that&#x27;s not the look I was really going for- I prefer more beachy relaxed wispy curls but I solved the Taylor Swift problem by brushing out the curls a bit &amp; they looked nice! And they looked even better the next day.  As other reviews mention, no hairspray necessary. This wand also cut my styling time in half because it&#x27;s so hot and makes curls quickly- and I have very thick, long hair. All in all, I recommend this product  if you want pretty prom hair every day or if you want a more relaxed look after running a brush thru the curls.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say that I bought this for $80 at a state fair when a lady used it on my hair. I bought it because my hair can&#x27;t hold a curl, but when she did my hair, the curls wouldn&#x27;t come out no matter how many times I ran my hands through it, I was thoroughly impressed. I wish I had checked amazon before throwing away my money, but oh well. This wand is so amazing I love it soo so much. You only have to hold your hair on there for a few seconds and presto, beautiful curls! I&#x27;ve used my friends&#x27; wands like the remington one and my curls fell out within a few hours, but this one could last days, WITHOUT hairspray. That&#x27;s right you can have day-long curls without crunchy hairspray, you can even play with your curls, you don&#x27;t have to guard your hair from touch. When I bought the iron I had waist length blond hair and I could curl all of it; it took me about the same time as when I straightened it.Now I have shoulder length hair and all I can do is waves because it&#x27;s so short but it still works and holds. It&#x27;s amazing, buy it, it&#x27;s only like $25 you won&#x27;t regret it I promise.</li>
    <li> My Grand daugther love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because a friend had purchased one and her hair looked magazine worthy after using the herstyler.  HOWEVER, the product I received wasn&#x27;t the same thing that I ordered.  I ordered the Herstyler Grande Pink...pink handle, pink barrel.  What I got was a pink handled curling iron with a black metal barrel.  Not the same as pictured. It took forever to heat up and there isn&#x27;t a clear indicator to let you know if it is off or on.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This Curler is the best curler i have ever used. It heats up immediately. It is what my local salon uses so I decided to purchase it. Glad I did, it comes with a glove and that helps since this is a professional curler and it gets super hot. Curls last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting either a curling iron or curling wand for a while, and then I stumbled upon this wand.  The price was cheap enough, so I went ahead and bought it.  I absolutely love this curling wand!  My hair is very long, and the curls stay in my hair for about 3 days.  The only con, I believe, is that there is no button to tell you when it is hot enough, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.  Also, I would recommend watching a video on YouTube on how to curl hair with a curling wand, because I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to curl at first, and was going to return the wand.  Highly satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Such a great buy!!! Works great and heats up fast, i would so purchase this curling iron again!!! Works wonders on all hair types!</li>
    <li> Works amazing for price, good quality and super cute.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for my grand daughter. She loves it. Just be careful because it gets very hot. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I always had a hard time getting curls to stick in my hair and gave up for years. When my new hair cut ended up way to short, I decided a little curl would help. Based on reviews of Herstyler products, I picked this one on Amazon. I love that it heats up the second you turn it on, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the hair clip that old curling irons always used. Using the heat glove (it helps a lot but you CAN feel the very high heat through it after a few seconds) I just grab a small section of hair, twirl it quickly around the wand and hold for 10-15 seconds. Perfect curls that hold for 48+ hours in my past shoulder length hair. I can do my whole head in under 30 minutes, and that is with little practice.</li>
    <li> Love this curling wand. But be careful, it gets extremely hot...I have definitely burned my fingers/hands a few times. But it works so good for such a great price!</li>
    <li> Not sure about these other users... I have thick hair and this could not even help me hold a curl.&lt;br /&gt;Feels super cheap... should have purchased the more expensive one.</li>
    <li> This curling wand curls my hair and holds the curl so well! I have fine thin hair that wouldnt even hold a curl for more than a few moments but with this wand my curls not only stay all day but I can wrap it up and may hair still has a lot of curl to it the next day I am a believer everyone compliments my hair! I love this thing. The product barrel is black and not pink like above but the product could be any color its amazing!</li>
    <li> The curls are beautiful and hold not just through that day but can be slept on and are still curly the next day!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try my new wand out, so I immediately plugged it in and when I switched it to ON, all the lights in my house flickered and smoke and sparks began coming out of it...along with a burn mark on the barrel of the iron! I am so thankful the thing wasn&#x27;t in my 2 year olds hair when it decided to blow up!</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  Professional, hot iron that heats up very quickly and works like a charm.  Great price!</li>
    <li> THE PRICE IS GREAT! THE SIZE, COLOR, BOX. EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS WONDERFRUL. COOLS AND HEATS UP QUICKLY. THE GLOVE WORKS VERY WELL. IVE SAVED TONS OF MONEY BY DOING MY OWN HAIR AND GET LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> this curling iron is wonderful and works very well. it is just what i pictured and i love it this is a  must have</li>
    <li> This item heats up super fast and does exactly what a hair wand should. There are no temperature controls so if you have sensitive hair, good luck. It turns magma hot and will burn your hair if you aren&#x27;t careful. Also, the larger sections the better otherwise you will get some seriously held small curls. The wire is able to go any direction out of the base which makes it even easier to use, and there is a glove to protect your wrapping hand.</li>
    <li> This wand works fantabulous! I even have curls that stay in my hair when its humid! Culing irons do no justice for my strait hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that there wasn&#x27;t a clip to hold the hair in place.  It is tricky to use to say the least.  The ends of the hair keep slipping off the rod. I would prefer the old fashioned ones with the clip.</li>
    <li> I have tried different brands of curling irons and usually my hair looses the curl after a few hours. With this curler, my hair stays curly for 2 days. It also takes less than half the time to curl my hair with this compared with other brands. Only negative point is there is no light to tell you if it is on or off.</li>
    <li> My all time FAV curling iron. Allow you to have te most luxurious curls and you have to love that it&#x27;s pink!!!</li>
    <li> I slept on my head of curls and woke up and I still had them!  My hair is hard to curl so it was hard to believe the curls were still there after I slept on them.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it a 5 is because it feels cheap and I hate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a heat/ ready indicator light on it.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the mall and paid way too much!  I am so glad that I have found this on amazon.  I have two daughters so the price is right for me since I have to buy in multiples.  Works great just have to be careful not to burn yourself!</li>
    <li> Works well. Once you teach yourself how to use it, it works easier and better than a standard curling iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of all the rave reviews, unfortunately, we couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it.  However it did look cool.  We returned it.</li>
    <li> Not a real herstyler product. Curls okay, Not as good as the real thing. save your money for a real one.</li>
    <li> Works well, but part of the handle gets really hot and will burn you if you touch it.  Curls well if you can use it.</li>
    <li> It gets really hot so it&#x27;s best to use the glove until you are adjusted to how it should be held.  My curls last an entire day, even without hairspray.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and works as stated. The only thing I would change is that you can&#x27;t change the heat settings.</li>
    <li> Used this the day I got it and it was amazing. 2 days before I ordered this curling wand, I bought a Herstyler Flat Iron in the color of pink at the mall. It was a little bit expensive for a student like me but since I love doing my hair so much, I knew It was going to be worth it. It was supposed to be 200 dollars but I only paid 150 because I got a student discount. On top of that I got 75% off on the herstyler serum which smells soooo gooood and also got free shampoo and conditioner. I loved it so much, so I came here on amazon and purchased this curling wand and 2 more herstyler serum for a lot less. I am so happy and I feel like doing my hair more and more and more😊😊😊</li>
    <li> The handle near the barrel gets extremely hot. There is only one temperature setting, which is also extremely hot. Overall, it curls my hair, but I think I prefer curling with a straightener over this because it somehow takes much longer.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting much out of this iron because I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything and my hair refuses to hold a curl. This literally takes 10 minutes to curl my super long hair and I can sleep on it and the curls still look amazing! I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair before! My 2 sisters actually ordered one because they loved what it did to my hair! Love love love!!</li>
    <li> I am in love with my wand! I wish I would hVe purchased it sooner, I have had it for about a month now and I have no complaints at all</li>
    <li> I agree with A. Taylor. I love the curling iron. It works amazingly but I didn&#x27;t get the product I was expecting. The iron isn&#x27;t pink on the barrel just on the handle, it doesn&#x27;t have a red light to tell you if it&#x27;s heated up all the way and it doesn&#x27;t have a temperature control. I love the product itself but just wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
    <li> Makes really nice curls and they last for days.  I did not put a 5 star since it burns your fingers if you dont know how to use it and it does not have a regulation botton for the heat.  Other than that it is ok.</li>
    <li> I JUST got my wand yesterday and used it right away &amp; OH EM GEE it is fantastic. I loveeee it. I didn&#x27;t even use hair spray and today my hair woke up with the curls. And I&#x27;m a Latina, I have curly hair and I usually flat iorn it and use my regular clip curling iorn but I have to use hair spray for the curls to stay for atlst 2hrs. I am obsessed with this wand. Totally recoment it. I have pictures of my hair on Intragram @xo.gloryy :)</li>
    <li> This is incredible! Curled my super straight hair that never curls and it lasted all night!!!! And it&#x27;s looked natural and very shiny!</li>
    <li> We bought one of theese for our daughter for Christmas from the mall. She loved it and so did my wife. My wife quickly told me she wanted one for herself. After some shopping around I was amazed to find it on Amazon for  this price. When it arrived I did a side by side comparison and this one is identical to the one they sell in the mall for $130! Also, herstyler does warranty this purchase as well. This is the best price by far of anyone out there. Yes, this is for real! Buy it!!</li>
    <li> First time I ever write a review but I loved it. its not a fake and only bad thing is, long hair? watch it or you&#x27;ll do major burn marks with the curling tip. does really cute curls. depending on how u do them, you can get bouncy fun curls or soft fancy curls. i love this curling iron and cant wait to get the matching flat iron for it :)</li>
    <li> This product is ok. The problem with it is that it get&#x27;s so hot. I gave it too my daughter, but she can&#x27;t do it by her self, because it gets so hot.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I wanted to see how long my curls would last and they lasted up to 3 days! It came in on time and i was very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I have never been able to curl my hair, until now. I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;They people in the Herstyler stands at the mall will try and tell you that these are fake in order to sell you THE EXACT same thing for $200.&lt;br /&gt;Dont listen to them.&lt;br /&gt;This product is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Very good my daughter love it I recommend this to a friend easy to use better than the olds ones</li>
    <li> my hair is baby fine &amp; blonde it doesn&#x27;t keep the curl but the curler does an amazing curling job :)</li>
    <li> i would recomend this product to any women out there who wants nice curly hair i got this for my girlfriend and she loves it</li>
    <li> love love love these products! Works Very hot and very fast!&lt;br /&gt;We own three Herstyler products  in our house now.</li>
    <li> It was easy to curl my hair and when I slept on it my hair was still wavy the next day!  The one thing I do not like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a light or any kind of warning that its on and it feels cheaply made.</li>
    <li> This was a Xmas present for my daughter and she loved it! She is 13 and she said it was easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister and she absolutely loves it. It holds a curl much longer than a curling iron. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It stopped working for a little while but it is back to normal now! Best curling iron ever and it super cheap!</li>
    <li> Well first of all I brought this for my thick short hair that is growing out from a pixie cut i had gotten in May I believe. Come to find out the barrel is too big to curl my short hair so I had gotten very upset and decided to return it. Then I ended up keeping it and using it on my sisters hair whose hair is much longer than mine. It curled very well and easy. The curls did not last but it was only because we went to this concert that was held at a HOT club so you can only imagine what her hair looked liked after that. Overall I think it creates beautiful curls and recommend this to anyone who loves to wear curls every now and then. BUT if you are going to a place with alot people in one room and no air conditioner wear hair spray. (P.S. if you dont know if itll be hot bring some hair spray and stuff that wand in your purse its light weight so you can carry it around.) Good luck!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I used my friend&#x27;s all the time. This is an excellent product! It heats up almost instantly, works great, easy to use. And such a great deal! So much better than a clamp curling iron.</li>
    <li> I bought for my sister and she loved it, all of my sister&#x27;s steal it from her to use it , but sometimes I hear her say &amp;#34;it&#x27;s not heating up&amp;#34; and sometimes &amp;#34;I wish it had heat settings&amp;#34; but she rarely says that.</li>
    <li> PERFECT! In love with this curling iron, there&#x27;s nothing I have bad to say about it. Be cautious when you are using it so you don&#x27;t get burns!!</li>
    <li> Item as described. Fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> still getting used to it - it does a great job me not as good</li>
    <li> Cheap!! Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love this. It works really well, though I&#x27;m not sure if mine is defective. The handle gets too hot.</li>
    <li> This is the best curler ever. I love it my hair has beautiful bouncy curls and the price OMG!. Please don&#x27;t let the price fool you this curler is excellent. I highly recommend it,</li>
    <li> I also haven&#x27;t opened this yet I&#x27;ll assume it is fantastic. I already know I like the brand</li>
    <li> Came on time and works really well.. ☺</li>
    <li> The product works really well, and gives me the kind of soft curls that I like. My only complaints would be that you can&#x27;t chose the heat setting, and there is no light on the product to indicate whether it is on or not, so you have to be mindful about that.</li>
    <li> I like this, but it took some getting used to.  I&#x27;ve never used an iron like this before.  My curls looked nice.  A little disappointed that it came with a black barrel instead of pink, but not a huge deal.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it!  Lots of sassy looking curls. Came with the glove, too.  This was not mentioned in the description.</li>
    <li> Curls hair quickly. Use curl locking spray when curling and long spiral curls last til next day. Cuts getting ready time in half.</li>
    <li> Received super quick.  Fantastics curls that last a long time.  Included glove is a blessing - iron does get very hot.</li>
