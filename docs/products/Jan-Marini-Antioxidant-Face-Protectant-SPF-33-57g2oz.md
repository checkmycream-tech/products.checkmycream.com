<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I usually hate putting on sunscreen because it&#x27;s thick or sticky. As such, I usually rely on the sunscreen in my makeup... But this sunscreen is amazing! It&#x27;s light going on and even has a nice scent. Needless to say, I&#x27;m a fan and this will be my go to sunscreen from here on out!</li>
    <li> Good price, delivered on time, easy to order. The moisturizer is light and provides 30 SPF which great since I am outside a lot of the time</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so this product is a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;I wear under my makeup daily for the spf protection and it actually controls oil unbelievably.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy and Amazon has the best price by far!</li>
    <li> It is not greasy or oily and has a very pleasant scent. I am thrilled to see it on Amazon for less than what I usually pay at my beauty supply. A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t let the small size fool you as I use it daily and it lasts for months.</li>
    <li> Use this every day on too of Jan Marini C-esta facial emulsion.  It keeps the sunburn away and I love the feel and aroma.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and has a very light scent. The SPF protection is a huge plus.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am 54 and have combination skin.  But  am not nearly as oily in the T zone as I used to be.  I started having micro-dermabrasion for some dark spots on my face and my esthetician recommended this sunscreen for daily use on my face.  I bought 1st tube from her for $48.  I love this product.  Love the smell and the way it leaves my skin feeling hydrated but not oily or slick.  It&#x27;s a great base for my mineral makeup.  I bought my next tube from Amazon for $25.99.  That makes me like it even more!</li>
    <li> I had to purchase this product at one time due to having a face peel.  I loved it and have found it better than other sunscreens.  Smells great ad goes on light.</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;m on vacation every time I put this on!  The smell is amazing.  Love the texture.  One of the few sunscreens I can wear that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t your &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; SPF. It moisturizes while it protects. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Best I&#x27;ve ever used, period.</li>
    <li> Jan Marini Antioxidant Face Protectant is an absolute must have! I&#x27;m VERY pleased with my purchase and will definitely purchse again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a very small tube of sunblock so I use it sparingly.  It works well and does not go on greasy.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time outside and it really works!  Goes well under makeup and I love the scent too.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 3 years ago, suggested my a skin care professional. I use it all year long, not only as a face protectant but also as my make-up base because I buy the tinted version. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product during a facial. I liked the smell so much, I purchased it. One tube lasted a year using it on my face and décolletage.</li>
    <li> This is exactly the Marini Antioxidant Face Protectant I get from my doctor, but it is so much more convenient!</li>
    <li> Summer is coming and this product has the protection that I need and smells so good....that is a bonus!  Try it out</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 1995. It is the first thing I put on my face every morning and some days it is the only thing. It never feels greasy and is a great sun protectant.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It smells like heaven and it doesn&#x27;t make your face feel greasy at all! I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years!</li>
    <li> Clearly the best antioxidant face cream with SPF in it!  I have been using this product for more than ten years .  It is non greasy, absorbs into skin, perfect for under your foundation.  Keeps skin looking healthy with a rosy glow!</li>
    <li> Nice light non greasy lotion with light pleasant smell. Does not make me breakout. I add a mineral powder foundation with 30 SPF on top every day for extra sun protection. Between the two, my fair skin does not burn even out on my boat for hours. You do have to reapply like anything else.</li>
    <li> I used to have to get this special from the dermatologist office. This arrived new in the box and is a great facial skin protectant. Really good for fair or sensitive skin. The savings was also great. This was my first Amazon purchase and I look forward to shopping here again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the only thing I will use on my face.  Not greasy and keeps blemishes away.  Perfect product.  Came super fast in the mail too.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different face products, but by far this one is the best.  I continue to purchase it, as it not only hydrates the skin, but protects it from the sun.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> While looking for something to use on my face, but not break it out...again...I found Jan Marini products.  The reviews looked good, and I was so tired of trying OTC products like Aveeno - products which are NOT supposed to be facial zit-producers...but they were.  The protectant goes on easily, absorbs well, I&#x27;ve never had a facial sunburn with it on, and it gives a nicely moisturized feel to my face.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Nicely scented but too feminine for a guy. Ok for me to use when I go running trails in the sun, but not good for the office or social settings. Not matted enough. I have combination skin so I was still shiny.</li>
    <li> I have been using JanMarini products for many years and trust them for my skin.  I&#x27;m a believer in sunscreen (especially) on the face.</li>
    <li> Seriously, there couldn&#x27;t be a better sun cream for my face.&lt;br /&gt;It is moisturizing and it&#x27;s very light.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;I swear it makes my skin look and feel much better.</li>
    <li> Great product !!! Been using this product for awhile and it&#x27;s fatastic!!!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist, and it&#x27;s the first sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Love this sunscreen!! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years and Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years because it does all the things I expect it to. Excellent daily sunscreen and antioxidant.</li>
    <li> The best antioxidant on the market!  Dave yourself the trouble of searching and just try this product!  Lightweight, makes my skin glow, and has hoed clear up my complexion.  Bonus:  it has 33 SPF in it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Living in Australia means SPF products are a must. This face protectant is not oily, smells great and offers SPF 33. I only wish it came in a bigger tube.</li>
    <li> I only trust Jan Marini for my face protectant.  It is non-greasy, with a light scent.  Coverage lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Like that it is light weight not greasy feeling and how it blends real well with my powder make-up. love that it has spf 33</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s the best lightweight, most pleasant smelling, non-irritating sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been a faithful user for many years. I wear it under my makeup or alone and always feel confident that it&#x27;s providing the protection I need for my very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great daily sunscreen. I use it daily and it wears well under makeup. It&#x27;s very lightweight and has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Awesome cream. Absorbs well and does it&#x27;s job by keeping the sun out.</li>
    <li> Love the product  IT is great.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday in sunny, hot southern California! It has NO residual &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell; in it&#x27;s place it has a light scent. In addition, since the formula is a pale yellow, it leaves no white residue and absorbs easily. I use it as a moisturizer and sunscreen in one, and it is works great!</li>
    <li> Love it. Not greasey. Good smell. Great protection.</li>
    <li> Love the product, light and effective.  I hate the way most sunscreens smell and feel but not this one.  I was turned on to this product by my esthetician.</li>
    <li> I found it to be too greasy.  I would not buy again.  The SPF was only 33.  I am used to a SPF 50.&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl T</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years as my daily AM day cream/sunscreen. It works well to keep you protected, smells great, and gives your skin a beautiful dewy, hydrated, glow. Also works great under makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product several times. This particular one that I received is &amp;#34;water resistant&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;. I know there is a difference and I&#x27;ve seen both - the picture and description when I ordered said &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;. Either I received the incorrect item or it was mis-advertised.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a good, quality moisturizer with broadspectrum SPF. Purchased Jan Marini antioxidant face protectant based on customer reviews.  Product smells nice, is creamy, though tends to roll if glide finger over semi-dry product or re-apply over still damp product.  Product leaves skin slightly shiny.  Offers SPF and antioxidant though is technically not a moisturizer so need a separate moisturizer - which means one more step to do in the morning - thus the 4 star rating.  Haven&#x27;t used it regularly due to this fact so don&#x27;t really know long-term results. A bit pricey.</li>
    <li> great day time face and sunscreen ! works great over vit. C serum!!</li>
    <li> I have used this item for about 2 years now and really like it.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered from this supplier from day one and have&lt;br /&gt;never been disappointed with the time period for arrival&lt;br /&gt;or the Jan Marini that I received.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Mattifying for oily skin, and I never burn.  Stays put, foundation goes on right over it and doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite daily sunscreen, also recommended by my dermatologist.  will buy again.</li>
    <li> Received the product on time and have been using it for two days now. Love it. Its so light and no greasy. My esthetician recommended me and also told me not to buy it online but the price difference was way too much for me to not order it. So far so good. The other moisturizers like olay, cetaphil with spf 15 would water my eyes but this one is just perfect. Yet to see if this is the one I will stick to for long term.</li>
