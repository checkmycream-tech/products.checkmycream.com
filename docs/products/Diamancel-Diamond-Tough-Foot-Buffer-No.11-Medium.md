      <li>I bought all three, because my feet will go from nice to downright blah, depending on the time of year.</li>
      <li>Its a nice item to show off.</li>

      <li>If you have a ball of the foot callus, you might want to read on below for more thoughts, but if you just want to know if this buffer will work on a terminal stage callus, the answer is heck</li>
      <li>During super-dry times of the year, I&#x27;ll use Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut foot cream (more of a gel) and slap on a pair of socks after my soak.  </li>
      <li>My feet are smooth and callus-free!</li>
      <li>I was told that it worked better than the pumice stone I was using.</li>
      <li>I have used products that work much better than this one.</li>
      <li>Most of the stuff files your skin, or acts like a cheese shredder.  </li>
      <li>I love it, and have bought others.</li>
      <li>What more could you want?</li>
      <li>In fact, I find this works better than the #20 when it comes to severely cracked or flaky skin.</li>
      <li>My mother uses this one, but she rarely has problems and takes good care of her feet.  </li>
      <li>It will eventually tackle roughness, but it&#x27;ll take a lot more work to do so.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely pleased.  </li>
      <li>This foot buffer is fantastic!</li>
      <li>This product is used extensively at spas because it is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>It is much better than ped egg.</li>
      <li>I love it and would recommend it to any one.</li>
      <li>I love it and it smooths skin better than anything.  </li>
      <li>As suggested, it&#x27;s best to use it on dry skin.</li>
      <li>do a lot of yoga and notice the tips of my toes get dry and look not the best.  </li>
      <li>This buffer has the finest grain, which covers the entire buffing area, and is ideal for smoothing.</li>
      <li>This is honestly the best foot file I&#x27;ve ever used and the idea of using diamonds in a file adds an entire new dimension of luxury to this item.&lt;br</li>
      <li>- Make sure to clean it.</li>
      <li>Well made and easy to use.</li>
      <li>and maybe it wouldn&#x27;t break as easily as cheaper plastic files.</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t see that happening - not even with the #20 which, for some reason, is made of a strong plastic-type material.</li>
      <li>Works well and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Never wears out, handle is sturdy, easy to clean with soap and water.</li>
      <li>Indispensable part of maintaining your footcare</li>
      <li>think I need something more powerful than something that makes one&#x27;s heels smooth.\\&quot;    </li>
      <li>&quot; They are as smooth as satin sheets,</li>
      <li>They now are smooth- toe tips, heel, etc.  </li>
      <li>I am a footcare nurse and so it has been used countless times and it is still in great condition and works like a charm.</li>
      <li>It can be ideal for smoothing or for individuals who don&#x27;t have a tendency to get overly rough feet and thickened heels.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled to report that I have normal looking feet again -- for the first time in years!!</li>
      <li>I always do it before I shower on clean feet</li>
      <li>It has a very similar-looking grain to the #11, but with more diamond stuff on it.</li>
      <li>Ok, so I normally don&#x27;t read the instructions for these types of items.  </li>
      <li>When I first used this, I did it every day for about a week and a half, but also made sure to use a good cracked heel lotion.</li>
      <li>I bought mine about 2 years ago from Bliss and they&#x27;re still the same as the day I received them in the mail, and that&#x27;s pretty good</li>
      <li>The buffer itself is well crafted, very sturdy and cleans up easily.  </li>
      <li>Good for in between pedicures if you have very dry feet.</li>
      <li>This may be ideal for those who have slightly thick heels and feet that are scaly, flaky and cracked.</li>
      <li>This buffer is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Left to its own devices, that callus would allow me to tap dance</li>
      <li>Then that part of your foot hits the ground before the ball and takes the pressure in the right path.  </li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m in a real germaphobe moment, I&#x27;ll steam clean them.  </li>
      <li>The buffer can be used on dry or wet feet, either way it is the best foot buffer that I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t mar your feet, but rather smooths them, similar to the other two, just not as effectively (still nice, though).  </li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend this to someone! :)</li>
      <li>It is really effective and does what it is supposed to do with minimal effort.</li>
      <li>I run mine under hot water and will scrub with a cheapy toothbrush and some antibacterial soap, although you could also just soap and rinse.</li>
      <li>I have had the first file for seven years -</li>
      <li>It looks pretty.</li>
      <li>Its pure magic and does in 5 minutes, what the above buffer will do in 2 weeks!  </li>
      <li>The name pretty much says it all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought many an item over the years to try and keep the dry skin off my feet.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t go nuts and buff to the new skin right away, or you might have some tender feet afterward.</li>
      <li>You will also save money by creating your own little spa at home.</li>
      <li>It works very well without doing damage.</li>
      <li>if it didn&#x27;t hurt so much.  </li>
      <li>None of the reviews here at the time of my purchase really answered what I wanted to know.  </li>
      <li>My feet have been the bain of my existence for years,and they are finally baby smooth.  </li>
      <li>It will also achieve the task much faster than the #10 or #11.</li>
      <li>my feet are so much smoother now.  </li>
      <li>, I launched in on researching new implements and suggestions for getting pretty feet online.  </li>
      <li>Make sure to use this on DRY FEET NOT WET!!!!  </li>
      <li>I think the answer for me might be to get a full foot length insole and cut away most of the toe area, leaving just the big toe area down to aside of the ball, and shift it from shoe to shoe.  </li>
      <li>The difference between these and the other types is that they don&#x27;t wear out (seriously), are very well made, can be cleaned and I feel they&#x27;re much more effective as well.  </li>
      <li>Here are the differences between the three:  --The #10 Classic--  </li>
      <li>This one has a slightly thicker grain and one that&#x27;s more dot-like, giving it a little more oomf.</li>
      <li>High quality</li>
      <li>However, for the steep price, I can&#x27;t highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>the diamonds keep it sharp and keep your feet soft... but its not painful to use.. thank you for this useful foot file</li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the money and will last forever.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Well made and easy to use. Very effective as well. The only drawback; it&#x27;s pricey.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I normally don&#x27;t read the instructions for these types of items.  Make sure to use this on DRY FEET NOT WET!!!!  Useless on wet feet, unbelievable on DRY FEET!!!  My feet look fab!</li>
    <li> I thought this product might be the answer, but it&#x27;s not, at least not for me.  Maybe I should have bought the related product that states it&#x27;s specifically for calluses, but some of the reviews indicated this product worked well on calluses.  I don&#x27;t find that it does.  It works well on the heel area, but not anywhere else on the bottom of my foot.  The buffer itself is well crafted, very sturdy and cleans up easily.  However, for the steep price, I can&#x27;t highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I still love my Diamancel No. 5, that I use on the rough spots on my fingers, but it was no match for the rough spots on my feet.  The No. 11 really does the job on my feet, and it will never get worn down.  What more could you want?</li>
    <li> This is the second file  I have purchased. I have had the first file for seven years - I am a footcare nurse and so it has been used countless times and it is still in great condition and works like a charm. I just needed another one for disinfection purposes. This brand is the only one I will ever buy!</li>
    <li> I had a hard time spending the money on this thing, but it is worth every penny!!!  My feet have been the bain of my existence for years,and they are finally baby smooth.  Love, love, love it!!!</li>
    <li> Use it after callous remover. Works well and easy to clean. High quality</li>
    <li> This is a well built professional quality tool which works as it should and will last a lifetime.  I love it, and have bought others.</li>
    <li> None of the reviews here at the time of my purchase really answered what I wanted to know.  I&#x27;m reading about \\&quot;rough heels\\&quot; and thinking \\&quot;I think I need something more powerful than something that makes one&#x27;s heels smooth.\\&quot;    Still, I was torn between this, the Diamancel #11 and the #20 callus device.  The ball of my foot has a major callus that I&#x27;ve tussled with all my adult life.  The #20 looked like it might be akin to a cheese shredder and I already have devices like that- they do work, but leave your skins ripply and ripped up looking.  Maybe #20 was not as unkind as that, but maybe the #11 would be quite enough.  For those who want to cut to the chase, yes, this baby was able to work on a serious callus in pretty short order.  The UPS truck dropped it off and I literally sat right down and got to work with it.  Honestly, 5 minutes later and both calluses (the other on the outside of the foot, below the pinkie toe) were about halfway gone.  I can plainly see this works very quickly and will have these painful thick spots gone with a little more work, and leave my skin in much better shape.  If you have a ball of the foot callus, you might want to read on below for more thoughts, but if you just want to know if this buffer will work on a terminal stage callus, the answer is heck yeah.  - - - - - - - - - -   The recurrent callus on the ball of my one foot is the result of a Morton&#x27;s toe.  Not to bore you, but when you walk, the pressure gets transferred forward from your heel up to your big toe.  If that transfer doesn&#x27;t happen correctly, you end up moving the pressure to the ball of the foot.  The foot then responds by building up dead skin, and mine gets thick quickly.  Left to its own devices, that callus would allow me to tap dance barefoot if it didn&#x27;t hurt so much.  Since the transfer is sending pressure away from the big toe and outwards, I&#x27;ve also developed a callus on the outside of the foot below the little toe, like a little tripod balance.  Isn&#x27;t nature wonderful?   I have a freaking collection of files, rollers with blades, a flatter thing with a Solingen steel blade in it, a PediEgg, a knockoff of a PediEgg, acid laced callus discs and so on.  All have their merits and failings.  Most of the stuff files your skin, or acts like a cheese shredder.  For efficiency, the bladed items couldn&#x27;t be beat.  Yes, the blades have cut me a few times, but they have been the go-to tool to cut off thick skin quickly.  Unfortunately the ball spot had gotten to the point where the skin was so smooth and hard that even the blades couldn&#x27;t get ahold of anything, and slid right off.  That&#x27;s why I turned to this \\&quot;buffer\\&quot; - which is an innocuous name for a file that works seriously well.   If you get calluses on the ball of your foot, you might have a Morton&#x27;s toe too.  A lot of places incorrectly say it&#x27;s when your second toe (next to the big one) is longer than the big one, but this is wrong.  It&#x27;s an internal thing that has to do with bone lengths and is not always visble.  The ball of your foot hurts, so your instinct is to put padding where it hurts, as I did for a long time myself.  The answer actually is to put the padding NEXT to the callous - along the big toe down to the side of the ball of the foot.  Then that part of your foot hits the ground before the ball and takes the pressure in the right path.  I did this with thick moleskin and couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference it made.  The thing is, it&#x27;s easy to get lazy about doing this, as the moleskin gets wet with daily showering, doesn&#x27;t stick properly, and is unsightly.  It&#x27;s also expensive enough that you may not want to replace it daily.  I think the answer for me might be to get a full foot length insole and cut away most of the toe area, leaving just the big toe area down to aside of the ball, and shift it from shoe to shoe.  Anyway, if that doesn&#x27;t work well, no biggie, because this buffer is going to do a terrific job keeping the ball callus away.  Best wishes to fellow sufferers!  [If any issues arise regarding the longevity of the buffer, I&#x27;ll come back and edit.]</li>
    <li> I have used products that work much better than this one. It is overpriced considering how hard you have to work at buffing your feet.</li>
    <li> I have one of these and have had the same one for 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had to replace it and it still works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money and will last forever.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything -- creams, balms, microplane, ped-egg, etc... and nothing has come close to giving me the results that this product does. I am thrilled to report that I have normal looking feet again -- for the first time in years!!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd one in the last 6 years.  I love it and it smooths skin better than anything.  I use it on dry skin.  It smooths all rough skin and callouses.</li>
    <li> The beauty shop used this foot buffer when I went for my pedicure - Works great - now I can use it in between my pedicures.</li>
    <li> Bought it based on comments of other reviewers. It does the job of removing rough skin on my feet. As suggested, it&#x27;s best to use it on dry skin.</li>
    <li> gr8 wonderful.. the very best.  my feet are so much smoother now.  I didnt think anything could be as good as this file.  my friend has one and she said it never dulls for years..the diamonds keep it sharp and keep your feet soft... but its not painful to use.. thank you for this useful foot file</li>
    <li> I bought mine about 2 years ago from Bliss and they&#x27;re still the same as the day I received them in the mail, and that&#x27;s pretty good considering how my feet get. Sadly, I paid $20 more a piece, so now I&#x27;m a bit bummed! Ah well. I was surprised by some of the negative reviews, so wanted to throw my 2 cents in. Basically, it comes down to common sense and understanding the difference between the three.  This is the same as the foot buffers you&#x27;d get from Dr. Scholl&#x27;s or similar. In fact, I found these when I went on the mad search of trying to find the old-school Dr. Scholls buffers that were white and had an oddly shaped head with fine grain on it, because nothing else worked on my feet. What they offer now, such as the type with the pumice-like head and blue handle (least back then) tore up my feet, while others only lasted a few weeks, if I was lucky, and barely made a dent. The difference between these and the other types is that they don&#x27;t wear out (seriously), are very well made, can be cleaned and I feel they&#x27;re much more effective as well.  Because these are similar to a regular buffer, that does mean it&#x27;ll take some elbow grease, especially if you have rough feet. They&#x27;re not a shaver and they feel exactly like a traditional buffer. However, there are three different types that do different things. I bought all three, because my feet will go from nice to downright blah, depending on the time of year. I also tend to slack and don&#x27;t buff regularly, which inevitably catches up with me (like now, which is what fueled this new review).  Here are the differences between the three:  --The #10 Classic--  This buffer has the finest grain, which covers the entire buffing area, and is ideal for smoothing. This reminds me of fine grain sandpaper, such as what you might have seen with the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s flat, white buffer that had a black sandpaper-ish buffer. It can be ideal for smoothing or for individuals who don&#x27;t have a tendency to get overly rough feet and thickened heels. It will eventually tackle roughness, but it&#x27;ll take a lot more work to do so. I use this when my feet are feeling spiffy and after the other buffers, if need be. My mother uses this one, but she rarely has problems and takes good care of her feet.  --The #11 Extra Strength--  This one has a slightly thicker grain and one that&#x27;s more dot-like, giving it a little more oomf. This helps to tackle regular-type dryness and thickness, and I tend to compare it to the old-school Dr. Scholl&#x27;s. I use this the most, even when my feet are so bad during our arid, Santa Ana weather that they crack and become painful. This may be ideal for those who have slightly thick heels and feet that are scaly, flaky and cracked. In fact, I find this works better than the #20 when it comes to severely cracked or flaky skin. Although it will get through somewhat tough skin, it still leaves your feet soft.  --The #20 Callus Conqueror--  The name pretty much says it all. If you are looking for something to treat very thick heals or calluses, then this one is for you. It&#x27;s not going to miraculously cut through everything in a single swoop, mind you, and you&#x27;ll have to put some work into it if your heels are bad, but it&#x27;s been the most effective thing for me to date. It will also achieve the task much faster than the #10 or #11. It has a very similar-looking grain to the #11, but with more diamond stuff on it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt and won&#x27;t tear your feet up, unlike some of the roughly grained pumice stones, but it won&#x27;t hurt you like a shaver might. Just don&#x27;t go nuts and buff to the new skin right away, or you might have some tender feet afterward. It doesn&#x27;t mar your feet, but rather smooths them, similar to the other two, just not as effectively (still nice, though).  All in all, if I were to pick two of these bad boys, I would do the #11 and the #20, because I am prone to thick heels and calluses (when I&#x27;m not up on buffing), but also like #11 for regular maintenance and some of the tough stuff that the #10 won&#x27;t get as quickly. The #11 is sort of the middle man, so to speak. If I had to pick one, I would stick to the #11.  Tips:  - Must use on dry feet. I always do it before I shower on clean feet (I wear socks, so not as dirty). It will not be as effective if you do it after a shower, when the feet are still softened.  - Have a towel or do it over the tub, because powder-like dry skin will be everywhere and will keep coming, even if you think you&#x27;re about done.  - Make sure to clean it. This will prevent possible foot infections and it helps to keep it working like new. I run mine under hot water and will scrub with a cheapy toothbrush and some antibacterial soap, although you could also just soap and rinse. If I&#x27;m in a real germaphobe moment, I&#x27;ll steam clean them.  - If you&#x27;re feet are really bad, it may take a few tries to get them to look their best. When I first used this, I did it every day for about a week and a half, but also made sure to use a good cracked heel lotion. Now, I find that doing a nice, warm foot soak with coconut oil and warm water helps more (coconut is also anti-fungal/bacterial, etc. and it penetrates into those hard-to-reach cracks), followed by a good lotion. During super-dry times of the year, I&#x27;ll use Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut foot cream (more of a gel) and slap on a pair of socks after my soak.  I&#x27;ll try to post pictures when I have time, but definitely recommend these. Yes, they&#x27;re expensive, especially for my part-time, slave-labor earnings (I&#x27;m a typist who works at home), but very well worth it. Plus, you don&#x27;t have to run out to buy more. If anything were to wear down, it would be the handles and well before the actual buffer portion. However, I don&#x27;t see that happening - not even with the #20 which, for some reason, is made of a strong plastic-type material. The other two have metal handles that are covered in a comfortable, padded, rubber-like material.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Never wears out, handle is sturdy, easy to clean with soap and water.</li>
    <li> This does not work any better than other items of the same type I have tried.  Cost for item does not match results.</li>
    <li> This product is great! It is much better than ped egg. It got so much skin off my feet, especially out of the shower. Would definitely recommend this to someone! :)</li>
    <li> Good product. It is really effective and does what it is supposed to do with minimal effort. The buffer can be used on dry or wet feet, either way it is the best foot buffer that I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Its a nice item to show off. It looks pretty. However it is is useless!. Yes, it can scrape a bit of callus here or there but it takes LOT of time, energy and patience.  After using it for 2 weeks, I started using [[ASIN:B004BHHN1W Bario Electric Callus Remover]]. Use this machine. Its pure magic and does in 5 minutes, what the above buffer will do in 2 weeks!  I am returning the buffer to amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always buying my wife products for her feet.  She&#x27;s constantly buffing them, etc.  I researched this product and bought one for her.  She says it&#x27;s the best one she&#x27;s used before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now and both times it immediately left my foot and heel feeling softer and smoother. As another reviewer has mentioned, if you have very cracked feet, it will take you a few extra times of buffing before you smooth it all away, but it does work quickly. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Works well, just takes a little time and effort.  Good for in between pedicures if you have very dry feet.</li>
    <li> Since my husband promptly stole my last foot file, I had to order myself another one and decided to try this brand. This is honestly the best foot file I&#x27;ve ever used and the idea of using diamonds in a file adds an entire new dimension of luxury to this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price seemed somewhat steep in comparison to other items, but then I figured maybe it would last longer than files that needed replacement files and maybe it wouldn&#x27;t break as easily as cheaper plastic files. So, the advantages are a longer lasting item that works at least twice as well and the results are very apparent within five minutes of using this product. My heels could now be described as \\&quot;silky.\\&quot; They are as smooth as satin sheets, almost unbelievably smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a Spa Girl at heart, this product will completely impress you. You will also save money by creating your own little spa at home. This doesn&#x27;t just remove dry skin it polishes your feet. The file rinses very easily, it&#x27;s nice and sturdy and is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be a 100 star product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> This product is used extensively at spas because it is an excellent product. It works very well without doing damage.</li>
    <li> I use this probably 3-4 times a week before I get into the shower.  As a result my feet are never calloused.  When I get pedis the women always comment on how nice my feet are.  This buffer is worth the price.  Quality is great and it lasts forever!</li>
    <li> When I had a pedicure at a spa this product was recommended for removing rough and dead skin from my feet.  I was told that it worked better than the pumice stone I was using. The pumice stone tears skin, dead and some live, off of feet rather than just removing the dead skin. I have used the Diamond Tough Buffer #11 for over a month ~ my feet have never been softer and happier!</li>
    <li> This is the best buffer that I have ever found! I love it and would recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> I have been at odds with my dry, rough feet for years.  And I&#x27;ve tried scrubs, pumice stones, and even microplaners.  Either the effects were so shortlived to not even be worth all the work, or in the case of the foot microplaner, it either took off too much or too little skin, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do a lot of yoga and notice the tips of my toes get dry and look not the best.  None of the other implements could get the dry skin off the tips of my toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I launched in on researching new implements and suggestions for getting pretty feet online.  After a lot of reading, I found the Bliss Foot Buffer.  Although it&#x27;s far more expensive than what I had wanted to pay, the results are completely worth it.  I have finally found the tool that has transformed my feet.  They now are smooth- toe tips, heel, etc.  The bliss takes away the skin painlessly, and the effects last for quite a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely pleased.  This is a tool that I will have for years to come.  Although expensive, for the cost of 1-2 pedis, I now have a way of really giving myself a good pedicure and saving myself hundreds of dollars.  I was never happy with my diy pedis, now I am.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> Indispensable part of maintaining your footcare</li>
    <li> I HAD TO BUY A SECOND ONE FOR OUR HOME IN THE SUMMER. THERE IS NO PRODUCT ON THE MARKET THAT WORKS AS WELL!</li>
    <li> This foot buffer is fantastic! I&#x27;ve bought many an item over the years to try and keep the dry skin off my feet. I love pedicures in theory, but hate taking the time out of my schedule (and money out of my wallet) to sit there every few weeks and have someone else tend to my feet. This lets me take care of things on my own timeline, easily, and effectively. My feet are smooth and callus-free!</li>
