      <li>A handmade Kent comb, they just don&#x27;t make them any better.</li>
      <li>fits perfect in my back pockett</li>
      <li>There was one more place to check for my lost comb - the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>what more can I say.</li>
      <li>I use this for my beard, its the perfect size and feels solid like i&#x27;ll have it for years.</li>
      <li>I will buy more and recommend them to friends.</li>
      <li>I love these combs.  </li>
      <li>it came, I was impressed with the quality, with the fact that it was well finished and smooth with no seams and didn&#x27;t seem likely to break at all.</li>
      <li>I can comb my hair easily without tangles using this comb.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to carry around.  </li>
      <li>This is hands down the best pocket comb ever.</li>
      <li>All Fine Pocket Comb, but who&#x27;s pocket</li>
      <li>Fine, smooth teeth.</li>
      <li>After going through about three or four of the cheap $3 combs at rite aid I read up about these combs.  </li>
      <li>Over the years I have tried different combs and this is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Is it worth that much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The comb is fine, but suited for a mustache not for an Adult with a full head of hair.  </li>
      <li>Should I stop at CVS or the grocery store to get a cheap scratchy comb for now until I can order new Kents and get them delivered?</li>
      <li>The comb is very gentle on the scalp.</li>
      <li>Great comb, have managed to fit it at least one pocket in all of the outfits I&#x27;ve worn so far after buying it.</li>
      <li>I needed a set of combs and decided to go first class this time.</li>
      <li>The actual length of this comb is about 3 inches and could easily be placed in a wallet to be carried, not the pocket.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle on the scalp.  </li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t collect the static like other plastic combs out there.</li>
      <li>Great comb, a little shorter than I expected</li>
      <li>I tried one (I forget the brand) that seemed okay, but it broke in half within a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of desperation, I ordered these.</li>
      <li>Gave this to my hubby for his moustache comb and bought another for my own hair, which is very fine, (I still use Johnson&#x27;s No more Tears after every time I wash my hair, and my hair is long, just because my husband likes long hair on women.</li>
      <li>I ordered a comb, got exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoother than the traditional plastic Conair, doesn&#x27;t get hung in knots, and produces less static.</li>
      <li>Ordered teh next size available but that one was way too big, now I have 2 combs that dont work fo rme .</li>
      <li>So I was very pleasantly surprised at the craftsmanship of this comb, Since it is handmade, each of the comb&#x27;s teeth are straight and polished at the ends, so there is NOT a plastic demold irregularity; like one finds with lesser quality combs which are mass produced in molding shops.</li>
      <li>A product of this size should have listed an actual photo because the photo that is listed is very deceptive.</li>
      <li>but it has been redirected to my 3 year old grandson.</li>
      <li>Suited for grooming a Barbie Ken doll, not an adult.  </li>
      <li>This is durable and soft on the scalp.  </li>
      <li>The price is a little high compared to cheep drug store combs but definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>Although, I think it could be a bit smaller and have no negative impact.</li>
      <li>The comb is small enough to fit into my pocket.</li>
      <li>If you are hesitant about buying this comb dont be it is well worth the little extra money it costs.  </li>

    <li> fits perfect in my back pockett</li>
    <li> I use this for my beard, its the perfect size and feels solid like i&#x27;ll have it for years.</li>
    <li> Excellent comb , made to last and very comfortable to the scalp .&lt;br /&gt;If I was ordering again , I would get one a little larger .&lt;br /&gt;No comparison to the drugstore combs, This one you will&lt;br /&gt;use a very long time unless you lose it .</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried different combs and this is by far the best.  It is sturdy but small enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my pocket.

    <li> My son loves his pocket comb!</li>
    <li> found a good dealer who covers a kent protucts. dont have to wait till i go to florida to pick one up.</li>
    <li> I love this comb! Not a lot to say about it. It&#x27;s well-made and does it&#x27;s job. It was so nice I even bought 2 so I could give one as a gift.</li>
    <li> This product fails to list the size of the product.  Listed as a Kent FOT All Fine Pocket Comb, but who&#x27;s pocket a Barbie Ken doll? The comb is fine, but suited for a mustache not for an Adult with a full head of hair.  The actual length of this comb is about 3 inches and could easily be placed in a wallet to be carried, not the pocket.  The actual teeth of the comb is about less than a half of an inch.  The comb is very tiny.  Suited for grooming a Barbie Ken doll, not an adult.  Would have been nice if the product had demissions listed regarding the length of the comb. A product of this size should have listed an actual photo because the photo that is listed is very deceptive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent my life with the plastic pocket combs.  Never again.  This is durable and soft on the scalp.  I will buy more and recommend them to friends.</li>
    <li> Great comb, a little shorter than I expected but it practically glides through my beard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too fancy.  This comb does its job and it&#x27;s easy to carry around.  Nuff said.  It also doesn&#x27;t collect the static like other plastic combs out there.</li>
    <li> Good product, well built looks duerable but way too small to be a pocket comb for a man.  Ordered teh next size available but that one was way too big, now I have 2 combs that dont work fo rme .</li>
    <li> It is a Kent...what more can I say. If you do not understand, you are a Philistine and there is hope for you!</li>
    <li> For fine hair these are the best.  I love these combs.  Small enough to fit in a pocket or small purse.  Good for a man,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing a review of a comb? I never thought I would do that, until a small crisis occurred yesterday. I thought I lost my Kent comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible flashbacks started - memories of trying to find a replacement for my Ace comb and realizing that they since had become cheap seamy scratchy crap. And then trying every comb I could get my hands on locally and realizing that they, too, were all cheap crap compared to the old Ace combs. I tried one (I forget the brand) that seemed okay, but it broke in half within a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of desperation, I ordered these. I swallowed hard and paid seven bucks...for a comb?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came, I was impressed with the quality, with the fact that it was well finished and smooth with no seams and didn&#x27;t seem likely to break at all. In fact, unlike any other comb I had except for the old Ace combs, it has not lost a tooth or an end, and never feels scratchy to the scalp. But still, seven bucks for a comb? Is it worth that much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer came to me yesterday as I thought I lost it and found myself in a panic searching all over the house, the couch, the chairs, the cars, the porch...everywhere. I broke down and borrowed one of the kids&#x27; combs. YUCK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to work after an hour drive with all of those flashbacks. Those flashbacks. Should I stop at CVS or the grocery store to get a cheap scratchy comb for now until I can order new Kents and get them delivered? I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do it. There was one more place to check for my lost comb - the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there it was under my chair where it must have fallen out of my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what did I do today?  Ordered spares, of course, so as to never have those flashbacks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven bucks for a comb?  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> After going through about three or four of the cheap $3 combs at rite aid I read up about these combs.  This thing is by far the best comb you will ever get.  It is well made sturdy and I dont think you could break a tooth off this comb if you tried.  If you are hesitant about buying this comb dont be it is well worth the little extra money it costs.  It takes a little longer to get coming from England but it got to my house in about a week and a half.</li>
    <li> The comb is very gentle on the scalp. Does not scratch. I bought it for me but it has been redirected to my 3 year old grandson.</li>
    <li> A handmade Kent comb, they just don&#x27;t make them any better. I needed a set of combs and decided to go first class this time. I am not disappointed !! Buy Kent Combs.</li>
    <li> Great comb, have managed to fit it at least one pocket in all of the outfits I&#x27;ve worn so far after buying it. Although, I think it could be a bit smaller and have no negative impact. Fine, smooth teeth. Perfect for my beard.</li>
    <li> My scalp deserves the most gentle of combs, and I hate combs that scratch when used. So I was very pleasantly surprised at the craftsmanship of this comb, Since it is handmade, each of the comb&#x27;s teeth are straight and polished at the ends, so there is NOT a plastic demold irregularity; like one finds with lesser quality combs which are mass produced in molding shops. I can comb my hair easily without tangles using this comb. The comb is small enough to fit into my pocket. Now I just need a convertible car...</li>
    <li> Gave this to my hubby for his moustache comb and bought another for my own hair, which is very fine, (I still use Johnson&#x27;s No more Tears after every time I wash my hair, and my hair is long, just because my husband likes long hair on women. Whatever.</li>
    <li> I ordered a comb, got exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoother than the traditional plastic Conair, doesn&#x27;t get hung in knots, and produces less static.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best pocket comb ever.</li>
