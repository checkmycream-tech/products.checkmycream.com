    <li> I love the Magic Erasers but this grip thing needs work. The refills are too thin! They run out right away. I won&#x27;t use this gripper any more. Much easier to just use the regular ME.</li>

    <li> I use these all the time to clean my tub and shower.  The handle makes the cleaning easier.</li>
    <li> It works, it really does....I am from the old school of using cleanser and elbow grease to get marks off....well when I tried this eraser I have put my cleanser away....this truly does work with very little elbow grease.  I am so glad I bought these nifty lil erasers.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to attach to the handle and cleans pretty well.  Keep in ind that the pad that comes with this already has a cleaner on it.</li>
    <li> These are only $4.97 at Wal-Mart for a 4 count refill pack. I can not believe my eyes. Not worth paying double.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Cleans great.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I have used everything on my doors and tub to no avail... used this and in 10 minutes everything sparkled. I was embarrassed by how much dirt this got off and I didn&#x27;t even scrub hard.</li>
    <li> We have a &amp;#34;Venetian Bath&amp;#34; all tile shower.  We use a rubber squeegee for easy maintenance.  However, the squeegee left black marks on the cream tile floor in the beginning.  I tried scrubbing with Baking Soda and Vinegar, my go to cleaner....nothing.  I read on-line to use Hydrogen Peroxide...nothing.  I picked up the bathroom magic eraser at the store and gave it a try.  By the time my husband came back in from taking the dog out, I had our whole shower floor cleared of all the black rubber marks!  I will be keeping these on-hand from now on!!</li>
    <li> The Magic does a great job and I&#x27;m very pleased with being able to purchase refills for the eraser.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> You can really only use was pad once, so for the cost, I&#x27;d rather just use a normal Magic Eraser.</li>
    <li> MR.CLEAR MAGIC ERASERS ARE THE BEST!!!!!!  A MUST HAVE:)</li>
    <li> This product is easy to attach to the handle and cleans really well.  I was quite pleased!  I didn&#x27;t realize that the pad had cleaner already in it so that is a plus!</li>
    <li> I only wish the sponge was thicker.  Other than that I can use them all day long.  They don&#x27;t have a strong odor as is often the problem with solutions.  And if you have a sensitive nose, as my husband  does, they are a great way to keep things clean without poisoning your loved ones.</li>
    <li> Really works in my shower.</li>
