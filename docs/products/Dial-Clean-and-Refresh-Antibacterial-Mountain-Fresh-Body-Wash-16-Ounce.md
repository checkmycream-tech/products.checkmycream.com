<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used a different scent of this Dial Antibacterial body wash for a while and decided to give this one a try. It smells great, but not too strong to be overpowering. It lathers well and rinses clean. Everything I ask for in a body wash.</li>
    <li> First of all the smell is terrible.  I feel like I&#x27;m washing myself with smelly chemicals rather than soap.  I&#x27;m used to using bar soap like Dove and Lever 2000. Those smell so much better.  Also I don&#x27;t feel like the body wash rinses off clean.  I still feel soapy and I&#x27;m never sure for how long to rinse off.  I thought changing to body wash might be better but I think I&#x27;ll stick with bar soap.</li>
    <li> Nice refreshing scent that doesn’t come across as overpowering.  It’s light enough that it neither bothers my allergies, nor can I smell it within minutes of drying off, even when trying to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers well and you immediately feel the moisturizing effect when you are done.</li>
    <li> As expected - good product.</li>
    <li> Great product and I love Dial soaps. So grown up now.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend. I bought this for my teenage boys because they&#x27;re in the acne stage, and it has really helped.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what a difference this stuff would make. My skin feels significantly better/different than it did before I started this body wash.</li>
    <li> Great smell ... and it was cheaper than the local stores .. that only have it once in a while</li>
    <li> i loooove dial body wash its&lt;br /&gt;the bomb!&lt;br /&gt;i use it for my body and lever 2000 soap&lt;br /&gt;for all my other parts ;)</li>
    <li> By far THE best body wash I have EVER used.&lt;br /&gt;It smells absolutely amazing. I go through body wash in about 2 weeks, so I am constantly buying new ones. But I ALWAYS come back for this. It also is GREAT at actually cleaning my body. It helps with any breakouts on my skin. And doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this so much!</li>

    <li> IM ABOUT 6&#x27;1 AND VERY LITE LITE 230 LBS DO YOU WANT ME TO GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS BEHIND A CLOSED SHOWER CURTEN?&lt;br /&gt;WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SHOWER STAYS IN THE SHOWER .. IM JUST SAYING</li>
    <li> Love the antibacterial for the gym and it&#x27;s cheap. I wouldn&#x27;t really describe the smell as Mountain Fresh; more of a fruity kind of smell to me.</li>

    <li> Good smell, good price, I love amazon. To buy this else where for me I save $3.00 by buying this on amazon. I have tried the spring scented body washes and like them as well but I wanted to try something else.</li>
    <li> Good.love this and only use this soap in the shower. Different scents are good my favorite is the blue one more.</li>
    <li> Excellent product because of wonderful smell and always refreshed feeling after using product.  This scent however is now not always in  stores because it was discontinued. Was replaced by another scent and is not as nice.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this Dial product, and thankfully I just bought one to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid is really thick - almost green-slime looking. As for the smell; it&#x27;s okay, but way too strong for my liking. I had been using Old Spice products over the years and figured I&#x27;d give this a shot. (After all, Dial is a known brand so how wrong could I be). Well, I shot... and I missed. Won&#x27;t be buying any more in the future.</li>
    <li> Being a Huge Dial fan, and Amazon fanatic, I jumped at the chance to get this Mountain Fresh Body Wash at this price! As an avid Amazon buyer and comparison shopper, I could not beat this price...I am considering the automatic ship to save even more! Just a dab will do ya! lol, lasting suds if you use a poof! I have 5 people using this and not a  dent in it in a week!</li>
    <li> Very good price and good product. I use this brand for a long time and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> It has a great refreshing smell. I would definitely buy more. It shipped fast even though it came from Florida to California.</li>
