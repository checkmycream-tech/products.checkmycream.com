      <li>Very handy, but it can only hold up to 6 tips though.  </li>
      <li>Worth getting!</li>
      <li>Good storage for extra tips.</li>
      <li>Good for holding extra attachments.  </li>
      <li>This is good if you have a lot of pieces or if the waterpik machine is used by multiple people than everyone can keep their pieces separate and be hygienic.    </li>
      <li>It is a great little plastic case that says Waterpick in the front.</li>
      <li>I love having the choices available for the different pics.</li>
      <li>Pretty darn cool design for a tip holder.  </li>
      <li>An assortment of tips fit well inside and there are aeration openings on top, back and below by the &amp;#34;kick stand&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Sturdy, easy to open and easy to see what you have stored inside.</li>
      <li>Yes, that sounds about right.  </li>
      <li>This product has taken that clean feeling after oral hygiene to a new level.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed for my Waterpik Flosser tips.  </li>
      <li>It creates an easy access to change the different waterpiks.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a nice little case to keep your tips organized in, I like the size and convenience of not rummaging through a drawer.</li>
      <li>This works really well...</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I really needed this holder and I still wonder why Conair doesn&#x27;t include it when you buy the machine.  </li>
      <li>It is very durable.</li>
      <li>This is a much needed case for storing the Waterpik tips while traveling or just for storage at home.  </li>
      <li>So much easier than flossing.  </li>
      <li>Well I got the super jumbo one with a ton of extra tips.  </li>
      <li>I added four double-sided adhesive pads on the back and placed it on the bathroom tiles right by the WaterPik.  </li>
      <li>New in package, just as described in the description.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a case, but the design and clear plastic store my tips and allow me to see what is in the case.</li>
      <li>But there were no other options.</li>
      <li>So I bought this, which is holding all but one of the extra tips, and works perfectly so far.  </li>
      <li>The plastic is a little thin and it is a little weird the way you have to open it, but honestly, I am just happy to have someplace to put the things.  </li>

<li> Now this only holds 6 waterpik tips, but I only have 4 I may purchase another but do not really need it.</li>

<li> Some of the replacement tips do not fit in this case.</li>
<li> Not sure how it will do when the tongue cleaners are placed in it.  </li>
<li> Case fits the tips as described, but is a bit difficult to open and made in expensively.  </li>
<li> She annoyed me into getting a waterpik?  </li>
<li> Received the wrong item.</li>
<li> but it opens weird</li>
<li> also this item is impossible to find in Canada</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this to hold the tips I use.  It holds the tips securely.  Not sure how it will do when the tongue cleaners are placed in it.  I will follow up when the tongue cleaners are delivered.  The blue plastic lid seems a little flimsy.</li>
    <li> Received the wrong item. I was expecting a Storage Case, and instead received a WP-900 Flosser Handle.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little case to keep your tips organized in, I like the size and convenience of not rummaging through a drawer. I am glad I made this purchase along with my waterpik, it&#x27;s a shame they do not put one of these in the kit!</li>
    <li> Good for holding extra attachments.  I wish it had a longer stand as it is easy to knock over</li>
    <li> May or may not need this, but I have found it to be handy.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Sturdy, easy to open and easy to see what you have stored inside. Excellent</li>
    <li> Good case and well designed for holding the assorted piks. Liked it so much I bought one for a friend.</li>
    <li> Some of the replacement tips do not fit in this case. It is a bit flimsy as well. But there were no other options.</li>
    <li> great product, arrived on time and just what we needed.</li>
    <li> Finally a place to put my different waterpik attachments so no more misplaced tips!  also this item is impossible to find in Canada</li>
    <li> it is what I thought it would be&lt;br /&gt;it holds my extra tips</li>
    <li> This case was meant to hold attachments for Waterpik machine and it does that well. It&#x27;s transparent so it&#x27;s easy to locate any attachment. The case is slim which makes it easy to store in my sink drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the case, great storage for the different waterpiks.  I added four double-sided adhesive pads on the back and placed it on the bathroom tiles right by the WaterPik.  It creates an easy access to change the different waterpiks.&lt;br /&gt;If I were to give a suggestion it would be  to create the case having holes to hold the waterpiks instead of slots to push them in, since I have found that at times when opening the case some of the waterpiks will fall out of the slots.</li>
    <li> Great case for my different tips.  Excellent for traveling</li>
    <li> Good storage for extra tips.</li>
    <li> Pretty darn cool design for a tip holder.  It even has a slide out &amp;#34;kick stand&amp;#34; so to speak which allows the container the ability to stand upright on a flat surface!  An assortment of tips fit well inside and there are aeration openings on top, back and below by the &amp;#34;kick stand&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Case fits the tips as described, but is a bit difficult to open and made in expensively.  Will probably serve the purpose overall.</li>
    <li> The dental hygenist made me get a waterpik.  Well, maybe it is strong to say she made me.  She annoyed me into getting a waterpik?  Yes, that sounds about right.  Well I got the super jumbo one with a ton of extra tips.  But then there was no place to put the tips.  So I bought this, which is holding all but one of the extra tips, and works perfectly so far.  The plastic is a little thin and it is a little weird the way you have to open it, but honestly, I am just happy to have someplace to put the things.  I have to change out to use the orthodontic tip and this way I can do it with no fuss or muss.  Price was good as well.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect item to go with my traveling waterpix.  It keeps all my different ones in one spot and they click properly into slots with no issues.  Great product to have.</li>
    <li> Great case. It is very durable. New in package, just as described in the description.  Would purchase again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love having the choices available for the different pics. I use many of them as I need to get into and in between my teeth and not every one works that way, so this gives me more choices than the ones that came with the Waterpik unit itself.</li>
    <li> Nice for Waterpik Tip Storage</li>
    <li> now everyone in the family has their own pick and a neat storage container</li>
    <li> Perfect for the slew of floss tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Waterpik toothbrush and water floss for six months now. This product has taken that clean feeling after oral hygiene to a new level. Happiest moment during flossing is when I see food debris dropping on the sink. My dentist approves.</li>
    <li> it say what does, it just hold floss pik accessories. if someone needs something to hold your floss pik then this is the pik holder for you</li>
    <li> Good price and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> We purchased this storage case for a family of four tooth-brushers. It works wonderfully to keep our many waterpik tips clean and organized. It is so easy to pack when traveling, too.</li>
    <li> It keeps everything nice and tidy for storage, but the waterpik comes with storage on the machines cap.  This is good if you have a lot of pieces or if the waterpik machine is used by multiple people than everyone can keep their pieces separate and be hygienic.    It has a sliding piece at the bottom to let water drip out.  The case isn&#x27;t fully enclosed, it has air holes.  I give it three stars because I use it to hold my extra pieces that I am not using, so I don&#x27;t need the vent holes, and the vent holes allow dust and whatever other particles that this may be around in.  Otherwise it keeps my pieces organized.</li>
    <li> It does the job it&#x27;s marketed as but it opens weird</li>
    <li> This case is sturdy and fulfills its purpose. It&#x27;s just a case, but the design and clear plastic store my tips and allow me to see what is in the case.</li>
    <li> This great to hold all of your different heads to your waterpik. Worth getting! Keeps them clean as well!</li>
    <li> the only thing that could be improved on is to include double sided tape for wall mounting.....but performs as intended to</li>
    <li> Now this only holds 6 waterpik tips, but I only have 4 I may purchase another but do not really need it. It is a great little plastic case that says Waterpick in the front. Keeps them all together and if you go away somewhere just put them in with your Waterpick. It opens from the top and the tips slide in real easy and real easy to get them out.</li>
    <li> never used as i did not like waterpik</li>
    <li> great case for tip storage</li>
    <li> I really needed this holder and I still wonder why Conair doesn&#x27;t include it when you buy the machine.  All those attachments can&#x27;t just sit in a drawer or on a counter.  It&#x27;s just not sanitary.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed for my Waterpik Flosser tips.  Very handy, but it can only hold up to 6 tips though.  Wish they made one that could hold up to 10 or 12 tips.  This works really well...now I don&#x27;t have to lose my tips and to buy them again...very expensive to get more tips.</li>
    <li> Goes great for my waterpik items.</li>
    <li> I purchased this case to put my additional piks in.  It should have been cheaper.  It is not that great and the qaulity is just not here.</li>
    <li> This is a much needed case for storing the Waterpik tips while traveling or just for storage at home.  Sure helps to keep the tips clean.</li>
    <li> Like the waterpik. Use it everyday before brushing.  So much easier than flossing.  I would recommend this product to use in addition to your regular brushing.</li>
    <li> The case serves it&#x27;s purpose... but it is missing a slot for one of my piks. I guess I&#x27;m suppose to just leave one pik on the machine at all times.</li>
    <li> The case closes tightly and holds my extra Waterpiks. It is as described</li>
    <li> This product should be included with Waterpik.  It is wonderful and necessary.  Great quality.  Get it......</li>
    <li> Great especially for travel</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Stores replacement tips.</li>
    <li> We received the unit rapidly. It has been a very handy way to keep our tooth brushes hygienic and accessible.</li>
