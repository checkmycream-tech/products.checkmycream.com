      <li>It is very authentic and lovely.  </li>
      <li>There is a sleight hint of sandalwood, but it isn&#x27;t smooth and pleasant as it should be.     </li>

      <li>My Obachan (Grandma) is pretty happy with this incense for her hotkesama (shrine).</li>
      <li>Nice smell but not to strong.</li>
      <li>Others have been too strong, but this is a nice &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; sandalwood.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because of the reviews, but I have a sensitive nose, and I was able to easily tell that this was not the best quality.  </li>
      <li>and this is one of my favorite brands of Sandalwood.</li>
      <li>its better to buy the \\&quot;Hem\\&quot; brand.</li>
      <li>and they give off a better smell.</li>
      <li>Then I noticed that while being a dollar more, it contained 300 sticks to the Morning Star&#x27;s 200.</li>
      <li>My favorite incense and what&#x27;s even better is my fianc&amp;eacute; loves it too.  </li>
      <li>Not smoky like most Indian incenses.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to need to order more soon because I&#x27;m running out of it.</li>
      <li>But it smells truly wonderful and that&#x27;s about the only criterion I can think of for judging incense.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite incense.</li>
      <li>The boxed version seems to hold the scent better before burning.</li>
      <li>I also like MorningStar, but this one has a more mellow undertone to it.</li>
      <li>This is such a great incense!</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t say don&#x27;t buy these, you might love them.</li>
      <li>I love this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>this is my favorite incense (and I have burned a lot of incense in my time)  </li>
      <li>I love this smell.  </li>
      <li>You can find better  &amp;#34;Sandalwood&amp;#34; incense than these.  </li>
      <li>I love sandalwood and this is my favorite lower priced option.</li>
      <li>And the price is fantastic!</li>
      <li>It is very clean and spicy, but with more floral notes than the Indian Sandalwood that I had been used to.</li>
      <li>it has a clean warm scent--somewhat like the smell of burning leaves in the autumn with sandalwood.  </li>
      <li>First the good.</li>
      <li>Smells okay, not too strong.</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly, and is such a great fragrance that I will probably have to order more soon!</li>
      <li>its easy, not smoky, does not take over -  if you burn incense, you know what</li>
      <li>Not too strong</li>
      <li>I love this type of incense (no \\&quot;stick\\&quot;, just the incense itself) and have been a loyal shoyeido fan and customer for years, but I decided to branch out and try Nippon Kodo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a daily burner and this stuff is great for that.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for individuals who are already using this product and they are pleased with it, individuals who are pleased with this particular fragrance or brand, and individuals who are seeking a sandalwood aroma but who do not wish for the aroma to be strong and pervade one&#x27;s home.</li>
      <li>I light one every day, the scent is so calming.</li>
      <li>A very nice traditional sandalwood stick.</li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful although somewhat mild, it is not overpowering, harsh and synthetic like some, perfect for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Tried a Morning Star Japanese incense assortment of twelve varieties and liked most of them.</li>
      <li>Such clear excellent fragrance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now, I might have a western \\&quot;over-sensationalized\\&quot; nose or something, but the fragrance, while generally pleasant, subjectively does not elevate.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;sandalwood based&amp;#34; more than pure sandalwood.</li>
      <li>Those looking for the true sandalwood scent should avoid this product.</li>
      <li>I was looking for the woodsier true smell of sandalwood.</li>
      <li>Too flowery, sweet.</li>
      <li>Not a bad stick and need to burn 2 at a time to get my living area aroma going.</li>
      <li>But one reviewer suggested this brand, it being only a dollar more (Nine-ninety-five)and much better quality.</li>
      <li>This has a scent that is both sweet and woody, a rare combination.</li>
      <li>This is a great-smelling everyday Japanese incense, perfect for all occasions, not overpowering like the big sticks from India or Tibet, which are lovely, but this one, most people enjoy.  </li>
      <li>I find that it is becoming increasingly harder to find, so good for Amazon for locating a vendor with a very competitive price.</li>
      <li>However, as an incense it has a very well blended, light, spicy scent.</li>
      <li>Scents are triggers for me and this scent (even when its not burning) puts me into a calm and semi-meditative place.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice but the sticks are so fragile if you look at them sideways they break.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a box to fill out an order to get free shipping, and thinking of a more basic sandalwood incense.</li>
      <li>But even mail order is worth it.  </li>
      <li>My dorm room always smells fresh and foresty, the way life&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
      <li>It is my favorite by far.  </li>
      <li>The smell is fine and it lights easy enough.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a beautifully executed scent if traditional Japanese sandalwood is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
      <li>Very subtle and delightful sandalwood scent.  </li>
      <li>so I am very accustomed to the aroma of various incense of this kind.  </li>
      <li>Reasonable and shipped quickly and arrived intact...</li>
      <li>Consistent in quality and memorable in its&#x27; scent, it brings back memories of my travels abroad and my pursuits in the US.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d purchased for 12% higher price.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Up to this point, I had only tried East Indian incense. I like the gentle background scent this Japanese incense gives. I have some burning right now and it is definitely one of the more soft scents I&#x27;ve tried. The slight scent is perhaps because the sticks are so thin, so not as much substance is burning, as compared with the kind that have a wooden stick in the middle. I enjoy it, and it gives a very different feel to the room than my Indian incenses.</li>
    <li> it was just what l wanted.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite incense (and I have burned a lot of incense in my time)  its easy, not smoky, does not take over -  if you burn incense, you know what that means.&lt;br /&gt;enjoy!</li>
    <li> The best sandalwood incense!</li>
    <li> this fabulous incense is made in Japan and have the wonderful smell of sandalwood with aloeswood. It&#x27;s combination creates a light smell in your home that will facilitate any spiritual discipline.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for in this product. Sandal wood scent is great. The size, length, and duration of burn are all ideal.</li>
    <li> This packet of incense comes in a firm yellow box.  It is advertised as the traditional incense of the east - Japan.  I can&#x27;t attest to that.  I calculated that it was a \\&quot;good deal\\&quot;, as there were 50% more sticks than the last box of incense I&#x27;d purchased for 12% higher price.  Amazon seems to have promptly shipped the product and it arrived quickly, without incident, in very good, safe shipping materials.  I opened the box and I have burned several sticks.  While they are the same length of the sticks that I&#x27;d previously purchased, they burn a slight bit longer.  As my meditational periods can extend several hours, that can be helpful to me in reducing the times I am distracted by lighting up another stick of incense.  Now, I might have a western \\&quot;over-sensationalized\\&quot; nose or something, but the fragrance, while generally pleasant, subjectively does not elevate.  Likewise, I would approximate that the potency of the aroma is about 20% of that of the previous incense.  It is a fine product, but I believe that I&#x27;ll return to using the previous brand of incense.  If you are used to this product, brand, or fragrance, then I would not recommend a sudden change.  It is just a watered down fragrance that does not smell, to me, much like sandalwood.  I give everything a grade.  As aromas are very subjective, I&#x27;m very reluctant to assign a grade.  Overall, I believe that this product merits a grade of \\&quot;A-\\&quot;.  I would recommend this product for individuals who are already using this product and they are pleased with it, individuals who are pleased with this particular fragrance or brand, and individuals who are seeking a sandalwood aroma but who do not wish for the aroma to be strong and pervade one&#x27;s home.</li>
    <li> While I mainly burn [[ASIN:B000QSPDO4 Goloka - Nag Champa - Agarbathi (Stick Incense 100 Grams)]], I like to have a variety of incense. I was looking for a box to fill out an order to get free shipping, and thinking of a more basic sandalwood incense. My first choice sold out before I placed my order, and in reading reviews settled on [[ASIN:B001B6ALM4 Incense, Morning Star Sandalwood (200 Sticks)]]. But one reviewer suggested this brand, it being only a dollar more (Nine-ninety-five)and much better quality. It had only two reviews, but both were glowing. Then I noticed that while being a dollar more, it contained 300 sticks to the Morning Star&#x27;s 200. Done deal.     First the good. While being shorter than most sticks at 5.25\\&quot;(the length in the description is of the box), they do burn as long as the stated 30 minutes. In fact every time I&#x27;ve timed them, I got between 32-35 minutes. The quality of the sticks are very uniform and consistent. Something to keep in mind is that these are Japanese sticks and are pure incense compound, not paste rolled onto a stick, and that makes them more delicate and easily broken. I have read reviews of other Japanese style sticks showing up with half of them being broken. Mine came in a larger order, so they were pretty well protected and not any were broken. I&#x27;ve also read reviews of Japanese sticks were the reviewer took the absence of an internal stick (or wood handle as she called it) as a sign of inferiority and cheapness. Go figure. Anyway, at 300 sticks, burning at 30 minutes, that&#x27;s a good buy...   ...Except for the fact that they are not very fragrant at all. And when they are done, there is no lingering odor. Which is ok, because the little fragrance that it does give off is pretty acrid. Not much better that a burning a stick from the yard. There is a sleight hint of sandalwood, but it isn&#x27;t smooth and pleasant as it should be.     I was going to give three stars when I sat down to write this review, noting that maybe I gota bad batch, or, smells being somewhat subjective it just didn&#x27;t agree with me and others may love it. But to add insult to olfactory injury, I noticed that they have now dropped the price 2 bucks to seven-ninety-five. For 300 sticks. I won&#x27;t say don&#x27;t buy these, you might love them. But I will say you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I re order all the time!</li>
    <li> My Obachan (Grandma) is pretty happy with this incense for her hotkesama (shrine). It is more brittle and breaks easier than other brands I have purchased for her. The smell is fine and it lights easy enough. I&#x27;ll buy it again if my Obachan says she approves.</li>
    <li> I love sandalwood and this is my favorite lower priced option. The smell is wonderful although somewhat mild, it is not overpowering, harsh and synthetic like some, perfect for everyday use.</li>
    <li> dont buy these..they don&#x27;t smell like the real sandalwood..plus they don&#x27;t have a sticked end to place incent holder..its better to buy the \\&quot;Hem\\&quot; brand. all scented Hem incense come with a sticked end and they give off a better smell. it thought I would be good sense I burn incenses everyday and for the deal 300 for 10$  wow; but it turned out to be and oh hell naw.</li>
    <li> Very nice sandalwood - clean, fresh, subtle as should be expected from Japanese incense.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance.  Not too strong</li>
    <li> This smell good and not pungent like some incenses do. It also smells like good sandalwood, not chemically.</li>
    <li> Tried a Morning Star Japanese incense assortment of twelve varieties and liked most of them. Their Sandalwood closely matched the actual scent, but this one bears no resemblance at all.</li>
    <li> This is pretty much the standard incense for Temples both in the US and Japan. Consistent in quality and memorable in its&#x27; scent, it brings back memories of my travels abroad and my pursuits in the US. I find that it is becoming increasingly harder to find, so good for Amazon for locating a vendor with a very competitive price.</li>
    <li> I immediately opened these to burn when I got them.  They were a big disappointment and I have so much to use up!  These sticks are really thin and the scent is not as rich as another brand.  I am not sure if you can disclose other brand names, so I will just be vague.  You can find better  &amp;#34;Sandalwood&amp;#34; incense than these.  I purchased this product because of the reviews, but I have a sensitive nose, and I was able to easily tell that this was not the best quality.  The smell after you burn the incense is not pure either.  I would recommend going with a different brand.</li>
    <li> This has a scent that is both sweet and woody, a rare combination. And it isn&#x27;t too smoky to use indoors.</li>
    <li> This a quality product packed in a quality manner.  It was what I expected for scent and the burn time per stick has been about 30min. with a lingering scent much longer.  A real value.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like sandalwood. Too flowery, sweet. I was looking for the woodsier true smell of sandalwood. Not sure I&#x27;ll burn any more than the one stick already done.</li>
    <li> I love this!&lt;br /&gt;I use it every morning to relax. The best way to start your day!&lt;br /&gt;They shooed it fast and package was nicely done.</li>
    <li> I like sandalwood, and this is a very fragrant one for the low cost. Average length of burn time.</li>
    <li> Really nice scent. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;sandalwood based&amp;#34; more than pure sandalwood. It has a lush, rich scent of sandalwood perfume, that really evokes memories in me for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is not a pure sandalwood incense which has more of a dry scent, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Great! I light one every day, the scent is so calming.</li>
    <li> The sandalwood smells nice,  the sticks are on the small side but who cares, you get 300 in the box</li>
    <li> This incense is pretty standard, regular green incense for home or personal use. It has a pine-ish or cedar-y smell. Reasonable and shipped quickly and arrived intact...</li>
    <li> A very nice traditional sandalwood stick. Since other folks, and myself, seemingly came across this after trying the Morningstar sandalwood I&#x27;ll try to do a comparison of sorts. Smells less perfumey and more woodsy and natural than the Morningstar Variety (but nothing like a burning stick from the yard). The aroma is hard to describe, but as others have said it reminds me of the inside of buddhist temple. Very calming and subtle. The smell is much less sweet than the Morningstar variety and has a heavier musky background character to it, while the Morningstar is comparatively brighter and sharper. Both are very nice, and for the price I&#x27;d recommend trying both, but out of the two I prefer the heavier Mainichi-Koh. The Mainichi-Koh smells very traditional and has some notes that might strike modern western nostrils as a little off but it&#x27;s a beautifully executed scent if traditional Japanese sandalwood is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite incense. Nice smell but not to strong.</li>
    <li> My wife and I bought a box of this incense at the Byodo-In temple on O&#x27;ahu, and it lasted us over five years. So yes, there&#x27;s some sentimentality involved in my five-start review. But it smells truly wonderful and that&#x27;s about the only criterion I can think of for judging incense.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Very mellow scent</li>
    <li> I use this in my pet grooming shop...it is great!...it covers up the smell and smells like if you were back in the 70s!</li>
    <li> Scent fades pretty fast with this one, a good incense but not a great one.</li>
    <li> Very subtle and delightful sandalwood scent.  Best sandalwood I have used.  Only downside is the sticks are very fragile, but not a showstopper.  You just need to handle them carefully.  Truly reflects the Japanese cultural influence of a product that is delicate, beautiful and soul satisfying</li>
    <li> This is labeled as everyday incense, it is simple incense sticks not very complex it does smell natural not artificial, but the sandalwood needs more kick to it. It does have a wood type of aroma but not pure sandalwood it has other scents in it. Not a bad stick and need to burn 2 at a time to get my living area aroma going. I compare this one to Nippon Kodo Viva sandalwood very similar in some ways.</li>
    <li> Perfectly subtle.... One of my favorites.</li>
    <li> This is a great-smelling everyday Japanese incense, perfect for all occasions, not overpowering like the big sticks from India or Tibet, which are lovely, but this one, most people enjoy.  It is subtle and complex, always makes me smile.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to get yourself some, it is inexpensive and you get a large supply.</li>
    <li> Subtle, unassuming and lovely</li>
    <li> i burn this everyday. it has a clean warm scent--somewhat like the smell of burning leaves in the autumn with sandalwood.  i think this has green tea in it too so the slight burning leaf smell is expected.</li>
    <li> For me, this is the best. Others have been too strong, but this is a nice &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; sandalwood.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice but the sticks are so fragile if you look at them sideways they break. Very brief burning, highly fragile sticks of incense.</li>
    <li> Compare to morning star sandalwood, this one is more subtle and light, I wish the color of the stick is brown instead of green dye which doesn&#x27;t match the Chinese name&amp;#34;white sandalwood&amp;#34;  on the cover.</li>
    <li> Extremely high quality Japanese incense. The smoke is mellow, not harsh if you breathe it in, and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is my current favorite scent to fall asleep to. I love the delicate woody scent and this type of incense is never over powering or cloying. The sticks burn just long enough and being small sticks they do not make a major mess to clean up. A simple saucer catches all the ash. Nippon Kodo provides some of the cleanest incense I have ever encountered and they leave no residue scent afterwards like some incense. Walking into my home is not like walking into the local gas station, I enjoy the scent wen I want it and it does not stick to everything in the house for when I do not want to have it! Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.  Not smoky like most Indian incenses.  This is Japanese style, so it is more subtle, and the aroma lingers in the air long after it is burned.</li>
    <li> Excellent and on-time delivery.</li>
    <li> This is such a great incense! It is very clean and spicy, but with more floral notes than the Indian Sandalwood that I had been used to. My husband and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it. It costs a little more than some of the other incenses you can find, but you really can tell it is higher quality when you light one. We will buy again, for sure!</li>
    <li> I love this smell.  I grew up in Japan so I am very accustomed to the aroma of various incense of this kind.  I don&#x27;t like a lot of incense that uses wood core like some from India as I don&#x27;t want that wood burning smell.  This is a pure incense no wood stick.  I will buy them again.</li>
    <li> I love this type of incense (no \\&quot;stick\\&quot;, just the incense itself) and have been a loyal shoyeido fan and customer for years, but I decided to branch out and try Nippon Kodo. I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I did and wish I had tried them sooner. The Mainichi-koh is really a wonderful incense. It arrived very quickly, and is such a great fragrance that I will probably have to order more soon!</li>
    <li> This is NOT sandalwood, so I had to subtract one star. Those looking for the true sandalwood scent should avoid this product. However, as an incense it has a very well blended, light, spicy scent. The sticks aren&#x27;t terribly smoky, and the scent does not linger much after the stick is consumed. The product is well priced and a very good value considering how many sticks it includes. I would have given this 5 stars had Nippon Kodo simply marketed it as a standard incense rather than as a sandalwood.</li>
    <li> My favorite incense and what&#x27;s even better is my fianc&amp;eacute; loves it too.  He doesn&#x27;t like a lot of the incenses I burn but with this one,  he enjoys it along with me.  I&#x27;m going to need to order more soon because I&#x27;m running out of it.</li>
    <li> Smells okay, not too strong. Good deal for the price, you get a lot for the money. I like the fact that they&#x27;re a solid stick of incense without wood. Wish they burned longer however.</li>
    <li> I got this because it&#x27;s the incense they use at the local mediation classes. It&#x27;s quality stuff, never get tired of the scent. Isn&#x27;t the typical wood-stick type though, so make sure you have the proper holder - my long wooden box thing isn&#x27;t mean to hold this type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a daily burner and this stuff is great for that. My dorm room always smells fresh and foresty, the way life&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
    <li> Good quality sandalwood.</li>
    <li> Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;When it is used, the box can be re-purposed.&lt;br /&gt;This is similar,if not exactly the same as the Nippon Kodo, Viva sandalwood.  The boxed version seems to hold the scent better before burning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Sandalwood incense girl and this is one of my favorite brands of Sandalwood. I also like MorningStar, but this one has a more mellow undertone to it. And the price is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Great, mild fragrance. Really makes our space feel a little more peaceful and a lot less smelling of kids hanging around the house all day.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Nippon Kodo Sandalwood incense for over 40 years.  This sandalwood box of 300 sticks is the best for the money.  Nippon Kodo incense is the best on the market.</li>
    <li> This is another scent from my childhood. It brings me back to Buddhist temples, centering and mediation. I don&#x27;t use incense to cover up smells so I don&#x27;t know how well this works for that. Personally, I think mixing a scent like this with something you don&#x27;t want to smell would ruin this scent for me. Just my personal opinion. Scents are triggers for me and this scent (even when its not burning) puts me into a calm and semi-meditative place.</li>
    <li> I wish I could get this at the supermarket.  But even mail order is worth it.  Such clear excellent fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;the seller does a great job too.</li>
    <li> Great product. Nice gift.</li>
    <li> Beautiful sandalwood incense at a great price. I use them for meditation and in my bathroom. My home smells beautiful all the time. They don&#x27;t create a lot of smoke. I can&#x27;t recommend them any higher for a daily incense.</li>
    <li> delicious, a gentle joss stick not for masking possibly illegal smells, but for reverence.</li>
    <li> The incense smells wonderful. It is my favorite by far.  It is very authentic and lovely.  Highly recommended to purchase.</li>
