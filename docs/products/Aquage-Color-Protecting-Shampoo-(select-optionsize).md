      <li>it&#x27;s been a nice change - esp for my curls!</li>
      <li>Plus it a good shampoo overall...not drying at all.</li>
      <li>I knew I loved the smell and the results</li>
      <li>so I know a good shampoo.</li>
      <li>My mother requested that I get this for her, and it&#x27;s her very favorite shampoo...</li>

      <li>Thanx for making it easy!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite shampoo.  </li>
      <li>&amp; I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad you keep my product in stock.</li>
      <li>Okay, there I go, off topic again.  </li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>she&#x27;s already asking more more products, so I know I&#x27;ll be buying more...</li>
      <li>The best shampoo for fragile, color-treated hair.</li>
      <li>I love all Aquage products because they cleanse and protect the hair.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t like your wife, then you have much bigger problems to solve than what kind of shampoo to buy - good luck!</li>
      <li>I love the clean smell!</li>
      <li>Their SeaExtend products are fabulous but more than I wanted to spend at this time.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizing as well, and glad I found it on amazon in a bigger quantity!</li>
      <li>My color tends to fade easily anyway</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this product from a salon, the 32 oz.</li>
      <li>but it certainly has kept my hair in better condition.</li>
      <li>Well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and most shampoos weigh it down, but Aquage gives my hair body and leaves it silky and shiny.  </li>
      <li>is not the right shampoo for my hair.</li>
      <li>She claims that it always leave her hair looking and feeling healthy and shiny; never dry.</li>
      <li>It cleans well without stripping, lathers well without needing half of a bottle, and for my rather dry and sometimes frizzy hair does a great job, at least if used in combination with the conditioner, which is also excellent.</li>
      <li>Delivered fast!</li>
      <li>I have thick hair which often requires a great deal of conditioner.</li>
      <li>Some are better than others at not stripping red color, but this shampoo left my hair in better condition after one washing than I have ever encountered before.</li>
      <li>and I have been able to stop using conditioner entirely as a result.  </li>
      <li>Have highlighted hair and in hot South Florida sun constantly.&lt;br /&gt;Always used color treated shampoo but this leaves my hair silky and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>I love this gentle shampoo and continue to use it religiously.  </li>
      <li>so she always gets the large 35 oz.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really understand how important hair is, except for whether you have enough of it to cover your head and prevent a sunburned scalp.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t say I was able to detect much difference than any other cheaper shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought this shampoo through a local stylist.</li>
      <li>Really like this product; works well and you only need a small amount; smells great also.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other salon brands</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re EXACTLY the same product.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair so soft &amp; manageable!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m out the price of this large bottle and left with stripped and discolored hair.</li>
      <li>It cleans gently, has a soft smell, and works well with related Aquage products.</li>
      <li>NEW NOTE LATER-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not easy to find unless you go to certain hair salons (and now Amazon!!)</li>
      <li>It is sulfate free, which is hard to find.  </li>
      <li>this has really helped with keeping my hair from getting as frizzy from dryness that other shampoos cause.  </li>

<li> I have tried countless shampoos, whatever the cost, on my thick, dry, frizzy, color treated red hair and have found few that do much other than clean.</li>
<li> This has been my shampoo for a long time.  </li>
<li> I would recommend this for anyone with dry frizzy hair whether color treated or not.</li>
<li> my scalp became dry and i started getting boils on my head.this</li>

<li> I had to sit down and write a review.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
<li> I go ahead and buy this shampoo for her, even though it&#x27;s quite expensive and even though I personally use the &amp;#34;buck a bottle&amp;#34; stuff.  </li>
<li> unfortunately, it was packaged in a way that allowed the contents of the bottle to leak all over the package and smear all over the other items in the package.&lt;br</li>
<li> No more searching!  </li>
<li> Unbelievable value!!  </li>
<li> Any thing with Sulfate in it does not protect my color, so this shampoo is useless to me.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I was under the impression that all Aquage Color Protecting Shampoo would lack Sulfate.</li>
<li> very poor</li>
<li> My hair stylist tried this product on me in the salon, but it was way too expensive for my budget!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The only shampoo that I use, and cheaper than buying in a salon.</li>
    <li> Although I just used this for the first time and cannot attest to its ability to preserve color, I was so impressed with the effect the shampoo had on my hair I had to sit down and write a review. I have tried countless shampoos, whatever the cost, on my thick, dry, frizzy, color treated red hair and have found few that do much other than clean. Some are better than others at not stripping red color, but this shampoo left my hair in better condition after one washing than I have ever encountered before. My hair is incredibly smooth and shiny, which is remarkable. I would recommend this for anyone with dry frizzy hair whether color treated or not. FYI- I also used the conditioner.  NEW NOTE LATER- After using this product for over a month I find its ability to preserve color almost unbelieveable! In the past I have actually had to dye darker than I wanted knowing that within 2 weeks my hair would end up faded to the color I desired. This no longer happens and I am amazed. If there is any fading at all it is very minimal and my only complaint is that my roots now grow in long before my color fades! Really incredible. Plus it a good shampoo overall...not drying at all. It cleans well without stripping, lathers well without needing half of a bottle, and for my rather dry and sometimes frizzy hair does a great job, at least if used in combination with the conditioner, which is also excellent. It appears that my quest for the perfect shampoo/conditioner is over...finally.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using Aquage Color Protecting Shampoo for several years now and she refuses to buy anything else. She claims that it always leave her hair looking and feeling healthy and shiny; never dry. It&#x27;s not easy to find unless you go to certain hair salons (and now Amazon!!) so she always gets the large 35 oz. bottle. It&#x27;s a little pricey but there are just some places she refuses to skimp. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  I had been buying it at the salon where I get my hair cut, but they only carry the small bottle.  This is a great value.</li>
    <li> Great product for color treated hair!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for years and wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything else.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t say I was able to detect much difference than any other cheaper shampoo.  I&#x27;ll keep searching.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable value!!  I can&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;ve been paying in the salon!</li>
    <li> I love all Aquage products because they cleanse and protect the hair. They are especially good on color treated hair but can be used on natural hair as well. This was a great deal. Their SeaExtend products are fabulous but more than I wanted to spend at this time.</li>
    <li> They were very quick in shipping this to me!  I have used Aquage for several years now &amp; I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Have used this shampoo for years. It is great for color protection on highlighted hair. Great moisturizing as well, and glad I found it on amazon in a bigger quantity!</li>
    <li> But then, how would I know?  I just buy it because my wife tells me it&#x27;s the only shampoo she likes to protect her &amp;#34;frosted&amp;#34; hair - whatever that means?  Sounds like Betty Crocker hair to me.  Anyway, she likes this stuff, and since I like her I go ahead and buy this shampoo for her, even though it&#x27;s quite expensive and even though I personally use the &amp;#34;buck a bottle&amp;#34; stuff.  But then, I&#x27;m a guy so I don&#x27;t really understand how important hair is, except for whether you have enough of it to cover your head and prevent a sunburned scalp.  And even if you don&#x27;t have enough hair, there&#x27;s always hats.  Okay, there I go, off topic again.  Back to shampoo, in this case Aquage Color Protecting Shampoo.  If you like your wife, go ahead and buy it.  If you don&#x27;t like your wife, then you have much bigger problems to solve than what kind of shampoo to buy - good luck!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of allergies to cosmetics and this is the only shampoo that never gives me a reaction .  Plus it leaves my hair shiny and manageable.  I love the clean smell!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about eight months and find that it makes my hair silky and shinny at the same time protecting it against sun damage.</li>
    <li> my scalp became dry and i started getting boils on my head.this is not the right shampoo for my hair.</li>
    <li> Have highlighted hair and in hot South Florida sun constantly.&lt;br /&gt;Always used color treated shampoo but this leaves my hair silky and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I am cosmetologist so I know a good shampoo.</li>

    <li> I originally bought this shampoo through a local stylist. It cleans gently, has a soft smell, and works well with related Aquage products.</li>

    <li> Aquage is the best smelling shampoo I have ever used. Leaves my hair so soft &amp; manageable!</li>

    <li> this has really helped with keeping my hair from getting as frizzy from dryness that other shampoos cause.  it&#x27;s been a nice change - esp for my curls!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product from a salon, the 32 oz. I the purchase through this Amazon seller was the same price as the 16 oz. from the salon... and they&#x27;re EXACTLY the same product. Well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liz</li>
    <li> Excellent! I use this stuff all the time! I&#x27;m glad you keep my product in stock.Thanx for making it easy!</li>
    <li> The best shampoo cleans and softens my hair and protects my color.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great smelling and my hair is shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I was under the impression that all Aquage Color Protecting Shampoo would lack Sulfate. Any thing with Sulfate in it does not protect my color, so this shampoo is useless to me. I&#x27;m out the price of this large bottle and left with stripped and discolored hair. UGH!</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I can trust to keep the red in my hair.  It is sulfate free, which is hard to find.  It leaves my hair clean and soft.  I&#x27;ve tried many other salon brands but this is the best.</li>
    <li> Its shampoo what can I say. This about the only shampoo I ever purchase. Works great.</li>
    <li> Great price!  Delivered fast!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist tried this product on me in the salon, but it was way too expensive for my budget!  I knew I loved the smell and the results, I just had to find it at an affordable price.  I went onto Amazon and my problem was solved!  It&#x27;s the same exact product that was used in my expensive salon at a price I can live with.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended by my hair stylist and it is wonderful!  No more searching!  It works great on colored hair!</li>
    <li> I love this gentle shampoo and continue to use it religiously.  It doesn&#x27;t over-dry my hair and I have been able to stop using conditioner entirely as a result.  My color tends to fade easily anyway so I am not sure how much it helps with the color but it certainly has kept my hair in better condition.</li>
    <li> Love it. Best shampoo I have ever used. The larger size gives me enough for home and travel.</li>
    <li> My mother requested that I get this for her, and it&#x27;s her very favorite shampoo...she&#x27;s already asking more more products, so I know I&#x27;ll be buying more...thanks for making this easy to puchase; and the delivery time was great!</li>

    <li> wife loves this shampoo</li>
