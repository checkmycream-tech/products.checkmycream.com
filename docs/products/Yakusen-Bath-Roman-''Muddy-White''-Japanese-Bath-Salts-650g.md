      <li>I wasn&#x27;t even able to take my bath without my nose hurting.la change.</li>
      <li>I love these bath salts.</li>
      <li>prefer a bit of bubbly, so it isn&#x27;t at the top of my list --</li>
      <li>one of my favorite bath items.</li>
      <li>I love this brand of bath salts (replaces bubble baths)</li>
      <li>This salt isn&#x27;t grainy in the water at all :) it&#x27;s not like putting epsom salt into the tub-</li>
      <li>Nope, it&#x27;s mostly powder like, a bit grainy in appearance but it blends into the water perfectly&lt;</li>
      <li>but indeed it is a pretty good amount (and better be for $17!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.Size: The size of the canister is pretty good-</li>
      <li>The product makes you skins feel very silks and the aroma is pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Instead, it has a wonderfully pleasant scent that it very calming and not perfumy at all.</li>
      <li>They smell amazing and really keeps the water warm.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just very strong.</li>
      <li>Okay, I&#x27;m a huge fan of everything</li>
      <li>The inner ring inside of the lid is supposed to be the perfect amount for a full tub, and I would agree.</li>
      <li>bought this bath powder again excited to be able to use it after a hiatus from baths-</li>
      <li>It smells really strong and almost manly.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitivities to strong perfumes, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>This new bath powder does NOT smell good.</li>
      <li>but he said they do indeed leave his skin feeling silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>but I can tell you that the whole bathroom smells AMAZING when my husband is using them - and the smell lingers.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend, Japanese products are the BEST!</li>
      <li>makes a special bath.</li>
      <li>I opened the salts and first reaction was oh that is strong.</li>
      <li>I love this white color/fragrance, but my all time favorite is the &amp;#34;muddy blue&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>But even the person who translated it for me said there really wasn&#x27;t a huge difference between the three.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Finding a product that I can use that does not break me out and meets expectations and exceeds is rare.</li>
      <li>A bit pricy but worth it.</li>
      <li>It makes the bath water a cool milky white, which I love.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I really like this product, I&#x27;m more than sure it will last me a long time :)</li>
      <li>If I know I want a nice, long soak</li>
      <li>I have yet to give them a whirl myself, but when I do, I will make sure to have some windows open and a fan on.  </li>
      <li>I have enjoyed the Muddy White bath salts and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to give them as a gift to a fellow bath lover.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get the effect, although I did the first time...</li>
      <li>/&gt;1.Smell: at first I was a tiny bit put off by the near-citsry floral smell (not a fan of citrus) but once in the water it melded into a very floral scent that actually comes off as calming- very nice.</li>
      <li>They dissolve easily, and are completely unique (I&#x27;ve never seen or felt anything even remotely close).</li>
      <li>the smell is not overpowering, but strong enough.</li>
      <li>Very lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, you really must try these bath salts....</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very milky, and they really do help trap the heat in.</li>
      <li>I ordered this expecting it to really \\&quot;muddy up\\&quot; my bathtub.</li>
      <li>(depending on how much you put it).</li>
      <li>remember not to use too much each time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There really isn&#x27;t too much of a difference between the colors except for smell.</li>
      <li>I bought these salts for my mother, and she said they are very soothing.  </li>
      <li>Apparently the red one is supposed to be more beneficial for women (although I can&#x27;t remember why)?</li>
      <li>I love the salts, but this box will only last you like 4-5 baths.</li>
      <li>At first the powder floats on the top, then sinks into a cloud of white and spans out into the water by itself.</li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t really care if they make his skin soft</li>
      <li>then I found these amazing Japanese &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34; bath salts (they sounds dirty, but it&#x27;s NOT muddy at all..should be more like &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>Having sensitive skin I am very leery of everything.</li>
      <li>they are little pricey, but you get what you pay for (and really, how can you set a price an hour of relaxing bliss soaking with these lightly fragrant bath salts (they&#x27;re not feminine, or masculine...very neutral, but relaxing - like an aromatherapy).  </li>
      <li>The salts make the water completely opaque!</li>
      <li>It turned the water a milky white with only a small amount of product, which pleases me use wise.</li>
      <li>No issues with itching, and for those of you who are sensitive to bath products for feminine reasons, no probs there either.</li>
      <li>no foaming, no clogging, and certainly no messy ring around the tub when you&#x27;re done (like you get with bubble baths).</li>
      <li>, my tub has the air bubble feature (not jets, just small holes making the tub look like its at a &amp;#34;rolling boil&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;ve used these salts with the jets too) and these bath salts work just fine....</li>
      <li>I have a gigantic soaker tub, and I had used various bubble baths for years, but which all left a huge mess in the tub afterwards (and you generally need to rinse the bubbles off yourself in the shower</li>
      <li>It makes the bath water white and almost completely opaque.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is technically cheaper for me to buy these in a store (Mitsuwa near Chicago has them), but since that store is now 4 hours away from me, I consider the $5 increase on here as a shipping cost.</li>
      <li>So the smell was not exactly the same straight out of the can (thank goodness)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> and I&#x27;ve been wanting to go to an onsen for a long time, but because a trip to Japan isn&#x27;t feasible at the moment I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d give this a try</li>
<li> This stuff is expensive when it&#x27;s purchase price is almost doubled by shipping costs, but it lasts a long time, and I enjoy the fragrance when soaking on a Saturday morning.</li>
<li> It is what I expected.</li>
<li> I was tired to buying the little sampler pack of Japanese and Chinese bath salts and wanted to get a larger amount.</li>
<li> I was expecting a lot less</li>
<li> Not worth the price!</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t read the can, but someone who could said there are just some little suggestions for muscles, etc.</li>
<li> like how you end up with irritating salt grains left over at the bottom.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll grab one of these because they&#x27;ll prolong the heat by at least another 15 minutes or so than my other bath salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the &amp;#34;milky/muddy white&amp;#34; to start off, and then try some of the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
<li> Very disappointed in the formula change.</li>
<li> awful.</li>

It burned my nostrils :(&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but I could tell the formula had changed because the canister changed as well- rather than a regular finish- the canister was metallic- it had the same pattern but it&#x27;s metallic red and orange.

I feel like the Japanese Emperor when I&#x27;m soaking in these salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, my tub has the air bubble feature (not jets, just small holes making the tub look like its at a &amp;#34;rolling boil&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;ve used these salts with the jets too) and these bath salts work just fine....no foaming, no clogging, and certainly no messy ring around the tub when you&#x27;re done (like you get with bubble baths).

    <li> I ordered this expecting it to really \\&quot;muddy up\\&quot; my bathtub. It didn&#x27;t. Instead, it has a wonderfully pleasant scent that it very calming and not perfumy at all. Also, my skin felt soft as soon as I dried off and I did not even need a moisturizer. A great remedy after a stressful work day. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get the effect, although I did the first time... Now I used about 2 table spoons and it works just as well. A bit pricy but worth it.</li>
    <li> Having sensitive skin I am very leery of everything. I read the reviews and no one mentioned break out on any of the bath roman products so I took a chance. I received the item 3 days before date promised. I opened the salts and first reaction was oh that is strong. What I found however was that was not the fact when in tub. It turned the water a milky white with only a small amount of product, which pleases me use wise. The scent was pleasant with undertone of citrus and roses. I would not say it moisturized my skin, but pampered, less achy after a day doing yard work, and would say skin with my normal use of coconut oil after bath felt silkier. No break out after two uses. No issues with itching, and for those of you who are sensitive to bath products for feminine reasons, no probs there either. I am going to be getting more of these bath salts from Bath Roman. Finding a product that I can use that does not break me out and meets expectations and exceeds is rare. This is a treat I shall indulge in often!</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong. remember not to use too much each time.</li>
    <li> I bought these bath salts on a whim. I was tired to buying the little sampler pack of Japanese and Chinese bath salts and wanted to get a larger amount. This is definitely a larger amount. It comes in a cute tin and in my opinion smells great. It makes the bath water a cool milky white, which I love. My only gripe is the price but you DO get a lot for your money. It has a nice lingering scent after you get out of the bath.</li>
    <li> makes a special bath. one of my favorite bath items. feels simple but luxurious. the smell is not overpowering, but strong enough. I like the milky water...</li>
    <li> I love the salts, but this box will only last you like 4-5 baths. Not worth the price!</li>
    <li> This stuff is expensive when it&#x27;s purchase price is almost doubled by shipping costs, but it lasts a long time, and I enjoy the fragrance when soaking on a Saturday morning.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed the Muddy White bath salts and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to give them as a gift to a fellow bath lover.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a bit of bubbly, so it isn&#x27;t at the top of my list -- no fault of the bath salts, I understand that it isn&#x27;t bubbly.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a lovely relaxing scent and feels lovely on the skin.</li>
    <li> I bought these bath salts for my husband.  He loves to soak in the tub while reading the newspaper.  I have not personally used these bath salts in the tub but I can tell you that the whole bathroom smells AMAZING when my husband is using them - and the smell lingers.  I would love to have an incense that smells like this so I can fill the house with this smell.  My husband enjoys these salts as well.  He doesn&#x27;t really care if they make his skin soft but he said they do indeed leave his skin feeling silky smooth.  They make a great gift and the tin they come in is decorative and pretty.</li>
    <li> I bought these salts for my mother, and she said they are very soothing.  I have yet to give them a whirl myself, but when I do, I will make sure to have some windows open and a fan on.  They are FRAGRANT.  If you have sensitivities to strong perfumes, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just very strong.</li>
