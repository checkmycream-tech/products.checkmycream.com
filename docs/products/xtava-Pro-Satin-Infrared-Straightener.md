<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it!  Works as well as my previous flat iron, but at a third of the cost.  Besides the fact that it works great, it has many features that I really like:  Rubbery exterior onto top of the plates that makes it easy to grip as I pull it through my hair, variable temperature settings for different types of hair, swivel cord, lock to keep it closed when not in use, and especially the safety feature of the Auto-Off if I forget to turn it off and leave for work.</li>
    <li> The order is different</li>
    <li> It is arsome just perfect I interduce it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Works great and I have super curly hair.</li>
    <li> Works great my wife loves this.</li>
    <li> LOOOOOVE this but I do wish it could open a little bit more so it could handle more hair at once.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this flat iron.  She is off to college this fall.  She says it is the best flat iron she has ever had.</li>
    <li> i could tell you but I&#x27;d rather show you</li>
    <li> If you are ordering this product, make sure to read the product description first!  The title is for the straightener, the pictures are for the straightener but the description is for a 5-in-curler, which is what you will receive.  Very disappointing, especially since the following day I received instructions on how to care for my Xtava straightener.  I was bummed out, I don&#x27;t want anyone else to be too.  Returned the curler since that was the exact opposite of what I ordered, had to order another brand since I needed a straightener for an interview.  UPDATE 1: Within hours of posting this review the product description was changed to the flat iron.  Taking my chances and ordering this again.  Finger crossed I get the correct item, so hopeful!  UPDATE 2: Received the correct flat iron yesterday!  Very pleased with the PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> its a great product it leaves my hair straight I am happy with it</li>
    <li> This flat iron worked great for my curly coarse hair. I recommend that you comb the strands as you pass the iron it faster and efficient.</li>
    <li> This was my first time to try an infrared flat iron. I use a flat iron everyday on my hair because I have naturally wavy/curly hair. I have been using a ceramic straightening iron from a local beauty supply store. I have used a lot of different straightening irons over the years. My hair is very hard to get straight because it has just enough wave and coarseness that it&#x27;s hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about this XTAVA straightening iron and the infrared technology. The one thing I don&#x27;t like about my current straightening iron is that I feel like it really burns my hair (quite literally) and leave my hair feeling like straw. This one advertises that with the infrared technology it &amp;#34;seals the hair&#x27;s natural moisture, adds silkiness and shine that will last all day&amp;#34;. I wanted to try this and see if there was a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, a few things about the straightening iron. This is a 2 inch iron. My current one is 1.5 inches and that is what I typically use and prefer just because that is what I am used to. This straightening iron has an 8 foot cord. This is very very nice because I can move back away or stand where I need to stand and not have the cord pulling me back. It also has more options for temperature settings. The temperature settings range from 265 to 445 F. This gets much hotter than my current iron. The temperature setting is digital with a setting for every 10 degrees. The plates on this one squeeze together pretty tight. This is something I always notice on a straightening iron because I have tried so many in the past that don&#x27;t close tight enough on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that gives you an idea of what the iron itself is like. Now let me share my experience in using it. Most of the time with my other straightening iron I also use a heat protection spray. With this one I decided not to use it yet to see what my hair would be like. I have been using this on the hottest temperature. My hair is so thick, coarse and resistant to straightening. Here&#x27;s what I have found. It takes me about the same amount of time to straighten with this as with my other straightener. This I expected. What I didn&#x27;t expect is how my hair would feel after using this straightener. My hair does not feel like straw! It is definitely not as dry as with my other straightener and it&#x27;s a completely different texture than before straightening. I included a picture of before and after. Because my hair is so long right now, it is weighed down so not a ton of curl but you can tell from the first picture how fluffy it is and you can see some of that coarse texture even in a picture. The second picture is after straightening. I know it&#x27;s hard from pictures to really tell the difference in how my hair feels. I am surprised it didn&#x27;t feel burned since I use it on the highest setting and without protection. If you straighten your hair everyday, you may want to try this straightener for a healthier look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided in exchange for my evaluation and honest, unbiased review.e&#x27;s what I have found.

    <li> I absolutely love my Xtava Flat Iron. I will be ordering the 1 inch as well.</li>
    <li> My hair is somewhat straight, but gets a little wavy and annoying at times, so I use a straightener to make it sleek and tamed. This infrared flat iron from Xtava fits the bill and more! After separating my hair into sections, I was able to run the flat iron through each section just once or twice to get it to be super silky and sleek. I had to read the instructions to figure out that there is a button near the cord that opens the straightener wider. After opening it wider, I was able to take bigger sections of my hair and straighten in the same one or two passes. I love that the cord swivels, therefore I can move it around my head without having to put my arm at super weird positions. I am happy with the amount of heat the straightener puts out – it does not fry my hair which is really easy to do since it is so fine. This is a great product! I was given a chance to test and give my honest opinion on this product during a promotion.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  I&#x27;ve owned a Sedu for years but this one is excellent for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice.  Hopefully, this will be less damaging to my hair.  I like that it is wide, to cover a large area in a short amount of time.  Heats up very quickly, so far, EXCELLENT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use oil and shea butter in my hair, so we&#x27;ll see how well it holds up under these conditions.</li>
    <li> its just a little heavy, over all I think its a good product</li>
    <li> All the positive reviews are spot-on. I had another flat iron in my cart when I read the reviews on this one and bought this one instead. It&#x27;s a high quality, quickly heating iron that makes my hair look great. Strange that my hair looks healthier AFTER using a heading product, but there it is.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is a super incredible flat iron!!  The plate is much larger than my other flat iron, which I really like because that means less work for myself when doing my hair.  The plate size is 2&amp;#34;, so much larger than some flat irons out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron heats up fairly quickly, and with the infrared technology it means your hair is gonig to be much silkier than when using a traditional flat iron and also it looks pretty cool!!  It also helps to prevent dreaded frizz for those who suffer from coarse hair and have a tendency to get frizzy hair, I know my daughter has problems with frizz and so it will be nice having a flat iron to help on those days when her hair doesn&#x27;t want to calm down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digital Heat Setting: I love having control over the heat!  With ten different settings from 265-445, you really can customize the heat to whatever your personal needs.  I have extremely fine hair and so I will need a lower setting, where my daughter will likely need the highest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my hair and it was so super easy and worked really fast.  Using my smaller flat iron, it took twice as long to do my hair than with this flat iron!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a clip towards the bottom where you can lock it or unlock it for when it&#x27;s not in use!  At first I had a hard time unlocking, but once I was able to unlock it for the first time, it was easy to do each time after!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  THis is a really nice, sharp looking device that&#x27;s super functional and works wonders!!  I defintely recommend for those looking to purchase a new flat iron to take a look at this one!  It just has so many awesome features that most flat irons are lacking!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Review sample provided</li>
    <li> i bought this to replace my flat iron that wasn&#x27;t keeping my hair straight, and this flat iron is amazing, it gets very hot which is good because my hair takes a lot of heat... it heats up pretty quick, and only stays on for an hour, which is a good thing if you ever forgot to turn it off, but bad if you like me and take more than an hour to do your hair.. it locks so u can travel with it and it come with a travel bag that is really nice... so far i&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
    <li> Perfect and I have course thick hair</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron!! thank you</li>
    <li> This is my 1st infrared Flat iron. Im surprised how well this works. I have my thick and heavy hair. Straightening then is a pain and a tiring job. My arms and hands get tired when I am done with straightening my hair. This Flat iron is bigger and Straighten my hair pretty faster than the my older flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;Love this Xtava Flat iron because it not only straighten my hair but also makes my hair silky, shinning and frizz-free. The best part is the no frizz-free hair after straightening. With my old straightener my hair used to get frizzy and I hate to see fly aways on top of my head. Xtava Infrared Flat iron works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron cones in a pretty decent box. Im impressed with the packaging. It is great to be given as a present. The quality of flat iron is awesome. It has a button near the cord to lock it closed. It is quite bigger than my old flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this flat iron. I received this Flat Iron in exchange of my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different brands of heat styling tools and this is my first experience with Infrared Flat Iron. I was surprised by how much shine this iron added to my hair compared to my other flat irons I own. This New Infrared Flat Iron Infrared Flat Iron leaves my hair sleek, shiny and healthy looking, rather than dull, dry and damaged like other irons do. The XTAVA Professional Infrared Flat Iron is the wonderful hair styling tool. It has adjustable temperature so that if your hair is fragile, you can use it on a very low temperature. You can also straighten in a single pass. The plates are silky smooth and don&#x27;t snag. It heats up very fast. The iron heated up quickly and I was able to straighten my hair in half the time of my old straightener. It has auto shut-off feature, long 8 ft. power cord with 360 degree swivel system integrated, auto world voltage 100-240V in case you travel to Europe. It comes with travel bag. The reason I could not rate this item 5 stars is the location of the buttons on this item, I kept hitting these button without realizing it. However, this tool truly deserve 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Why the XTAVA Professional Infrared Flat Iron is great:&lt;br /&gt;Conventional styling tools provide infrared waves in the near and middle segments. These infrared rays have wavelengths that are not sufficient to penetrate hair for healthy styling. Because of non-penetration, these shorter infrared rays heat the air surrounding the hair and conduct the hot air to the surface of the hair. The hair is heated by means of conduction from the surface which causes frizzy, dry and damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;The XTAVA Professional Infrared Flat Iron uses infrared technology. The longer wavelength from IR technology generate deep penetrating heat. This penetrates directly into the cortex of hair cuticles, heating from the inside out. It creates an effect that relaxes and softens hair. The hair is heated evenly, giving a gentle drying process in half the time thereby reducing heat exposure. Water molecules on the surface of the hair break apart into smaller droplets and get absorbed into the hair. Moisture is then locked within the cuticles to give a protective barrier to reduce chemical and bacteria build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is great, inexpensive hair styling tool.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample to facilitate my review. Opinions are my own.g heat exposure. Water molecules on the surface of the hair break apart into smaller droplets and get absorbed into the hair.

    <li> I ordered the hair straightner for my wife and she has problems with it already.It keeps shutting off every minute and isn&#x27;t able to reach temperature  because of this.I will be returning  it go amazon and looking for a new one.</li>
    <li> So lightweight and easy to use!  Love how it makes me wavy hair straight without using too much effort!</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron! It keeps my course hair sleek and shiny and I only have to do one pass over my hair vs. multiple with my Remington pearl.</li>
    <li> I really really love this product.i use it on my daughter hair the other day and that&#x27;s the straightest I&#x27;ve ever got her hair and her hair is really curly. I would recommend this product and to think I was going to spend a $100 on one</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve lived without this. I can flat iron my hair in 1/3 the time and it doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair. The temperature is digital so you can see the exact temp. I have and expensive Hi flat iron that I paid over 150 bucks for that is a piece of crap compared to this one. Love it</li>
    <li> Soooo love this straighter!!! Takes me half the time to straight my hair then it did before!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, makes your hair shine, easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Been using this item for a few weeks now and am really likeing the results!</li>
    <li> I received the XTAVA Professional Infrared Flat Iron this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.  I have been using its predecessors for more than 5 years now and they are still doing a fine job, but not keeping their heat as good as new. I figured it was time for an upgrade. The XTAVA Professional Infrared Flat Iron combines Tourmaline Ceramic Plates with superior infrared technology to seal the hair cuticle and reduce frizz, delivering healthy, radiant results in one smooth glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fairly light iron, it heats up within a minute and glides smoothly through my hair, and straightens even stubborn curls with ease. This flat iron works quickly and easily to straighten my hair.  My hair was soft and glossy afterwards, and it didn&#x27;t take much time at all, and the effect lasts a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This XTAVA Professional Infrared Flat Iron features:&lt;br /&gt;- Infrared Technology&lt;br /&gt;- Tourmaline-infused ceramic plates&lt;br /&gt;- Digital LCD control display&lt;br /&gt;- Heating range between 250°F and 430°F&lt;br /&gt;- Ceramic heating element&lt;br /&gt;- One-hour auto shut-off&lt;br /&gt;- 360° rotating 8-ft/2.4m swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;- Auto world voltage (100-240V)&lt;br /&gt;- Travel case for easy storage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In summary: for the money, this thing is fantastic.  I&#x27;d recommend to anyone that wants to style/straighten their hair. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Works well once you learn how to use it.</li>
    <li> My hair came out the way I wanted - pure perfection and I was completely blown away.  The plates are wide, the heat temperature stays consistent and there is no snagging of your hair, the cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled (swivel head on product).  I Love It.  Have used other products like this and it has taken a long time to get my hair the way I want, I am really sooo happy with this product, heats quickly, cleans easily and  cannot think of anything I don&#x27;t like. Had to add more to this review. I have now used this product on myself three times and I really can not get over how easy it works and how fast. You don&#x27;t have to continuously go over the same section of hair to get the results you want.  The heat control keeps the product at a set rate and it doesn&#x27;t get hotter like other brands do. The product fits in your hand comfortably and even when you are doing the back of your head it is not cumbersome.  This product is a must and the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of really thick long hair. This flat iron is amazing. I&#x27;m really becoming a fan of XTAVA products. My previous flat iron took no less than an hour to straighten my hair, now I can get it done in less than a half hour. The paddles seem much larger than my old flat iron and heat up much more evenly and quickly. I simply take a shower at night let my hair dry while I sleep and within a half hour in the morning my hair is straight and sleek and soft. It stays that way all day long, and even the next day if I choose to skip washing my hair. I love LOVE LOVE the packaging it came in. The black box is really sleek looking and I was really happily surprised to see that the iron came with it&#x27;s own zipper bag to easily transport. This will be purchased as a gift for my niece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!! I have been using another brand for many years and I will admit, it took me about a week to adjust to this new one. It is bigger than my old one.  Now I know I won&#x27;t go back to the old brand. I love the Xtava packaging also. It&#x27;s not in one of those sealed plastic things that you have to cut open with scissors or something sharp and risk losing a finger. It even comes with a nice bag that has thermal material on the inside. Great for traveling! I love that it has the temperature display so you know how hot it is and you can find a setting that works best for you. It also has a little slide tab at the back that allows you to close it (not all the way closed). You just squeeze it together a little and slide the tab forward and it stays locked like that. So much nicer when you&#x27;re finished styling and it&#x27;s time to put it away. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great flat iron. I also bought the Allure 2200 hair dryer and love it just as much.</li>
    <li> It works good but not great by no means.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS FLAT IRON!  WOULD RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Its the second thing I have bought from XTAVA and I will continue to do so with pleasure.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron to help speed up my morning.  My hair has gotten extremely long and it is very thick.  This flat iron has made that process much easier.  I had to take it on the road and it comes with a thermal bag which allowed me to pack up the iron while it was still very warm.  My only issue is that I have unintentionally turned it off when I picked it up.  Once I became accustomed to where the buttons were I have not done that since.  I am extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I love the wide paddles, the ability to adjust to temperature, the lovely carrying case. It does an excellent job styling my hair.</li>
    <li> I had never owned a wider flat iron prior to getting this one and was really worried about how it would work but I actually really like it a lot!  I am super glad I got the chance to test this flat iron complimentary in order to give my honest opinion because I like it a little more than I like the smaller flat iron!  I have long, curly, thick hair so with the smaller flat iron I have to go through my hair 2 or 3 times to get the desired sleek, smooth, and straight hair but not with this one!  It only takes 1 time through to do the job and then I go back through all my hair a second time just out of habit but it makes me happy!  I love the look of this straightener and that it has the digital temperature thing so I don&#x27;t have to guess what temp my straightener is at!  I find myself reaching for this straightener instead of my 1 inch straightener!  Super happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I bought this one and didn&#x27;t spend a lot on another fancy, big named product. This works great and I really like the locking feature. My daughter burnt herself twice on our last flat iron. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one to anyone looking.</li>
    <li> I have sooo much hair and with this iron I can finish all my hair in no time. I really like it!!!!</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I love this product. The packaging is sleek and smooth. I love the digital heat reader unlike most irons you can easily get heat damage because there is no way to tell how hot the iron is going to get. I love the storage bag and box that it comes in as well. This is one of the best flat irons I have personally used.... my daughter is next up to use it and shes the flat iron queen</li>
    <li> I used this flat iron on my daughter&#x27;s hair three days ago and it looks like I just did it. She&#x27;s gotten compliments about her hair asking which salon she visits. I was a skeptic at first, but I am a believer and would highly recommend this flat iron to all that wants a frizz free finished look. Incidentally she has wavy hair and is multi racial.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron!!! XD It gets my curly hair straight! This flat iron is wonderfullll!!! I even talked my sister into buying one! :D Got to try it!</li>
    <li> I love the larger size... It takes much less time in the morning to do my hair.  You turn it on and  it&#x27;s immediately ready.  I am happy with it for sure.</li>
    <li> So far, this works wonderfully!  My hair normally takes about an hour at least. With this straightener it took a little over 20 min, which is amazing! Hair is left looking shiny and gorgeous!  I definitely recommend this, especially if you&#x27;re on a budget!</li>
    <li> Bought this item March 2015 and 5 months later the cord just falls out of the end.  I am past the availability to return the item.  I might have used this flat iron maybe 10  times over the last 5 months.  Nothing happened to make the cord fall out so this is not a product I would recommend.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t get to the roots, which I wouldn&#x27;t care if it got hot enough to do the rest of my hair.</li>
    <li> I saw where folks got the 5-in-1 curling iron, but thought it wouldn&#x27;t happen to me.  Delivered today, along with the email from XTAVA about the flat iron.  It&#x27;s the curling iron, disappointingly.  I need a new curler so I&#x27;ll keep it, but wish I had taken the advice of so many shoppers.  Amazon has disabled ordering, so hopefully they&#x27;ll start shipping (the correct product) soon.  BTW it&#x27;s a great curling iron, even if it&#x27;s not the flat iron I had paid for.  UPDATE: Ordered (a 2nd time) and received the flat iron.  It is SO fast and works great!  Both a good deal at the price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! I don&#x27;t feel like I am shredding my hair when I am using it... even the ends! At the end of the day my hair is still smooth, and I dare say it&#x27;s shiny as well. I am so happy with this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best flat iron I&#x27;ve had. It does go through the hair easy and leaves it soft but it doesn&#x27;t really straighten my hair. It didn&#x27;t help with frizz and if anything it added to it. It&#x27;s very light weight and heats up quick. It&#x27;s ok for the price but I&#x27;ve had better flat irons.</li>
    <li> This flat iron here is pretty awesome. I have shoulder length hair that is thick, wavy, coarse, and to top it off, it&#x27;s super frizzy. Yes my hair is a nightmare. I discovered what a flat iron could do for my hair in my mid twenties. I couldn&#x27;t believe that I could have straight, soft hair. I&#x27;ve been off and running since. I&#x27;ve owned several flat irons since then, and let me say, they are not created equal. I need very high heat. My previous flat irons required me to go over the same section of hair several times to get it straight, and frizz free. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a great, high heat flat iron, so when i was offered an opportunity to receive this Xtava infrared 2in flat iron to use, and keep, I was beyond excited. All I had to do was write about experience with it. Simple enough, right? The first thing I have to say about this product is that it shipped super quick. Bonus! This flat iron came in a cute little black carrier bag. Double Bonus! This flat iron has a long cord, and it swivels so that really helps when trying to flat iron the back of my hair. Most amazing to me it how super fast the Xtava infared flat iron heats up. I&#x27;m talking like 0 to 450 in less than a min.  This flat iron also has a lock, so when not in use, I can lock it closed, and store in the carrier bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all this is a pretty great flat iron. Not only can I do bigger sections of hair, I only have to go over each section once to get  the smoothness I&#x27;m looking for. This flat iron is pretty simple to use. I own several flat irons, but this Xtava infared iron has absolutley became one of my favorites. It&#x27;s light, easy to use, and due to its 2in heat plates, it&#x27;s a lot quicker for me when I flat iron my hair. The only qualm I have with this product is that one can easily, and unknowing turn the temperature down. I  ran into that issue a couple times, the first time I used this product, but with a slight hand adjustment, all was well.</li>
    <li> I love these. I was a little skeptical in the beginning because of the &amp;#34;infra-red&amp;#34;, however, they work better than any other straighners I own (I own 3). My hair is long, pretty thick and curly/frizzy if I don&#x27;t straighten it. My hair looked the best its ever looked when I had finished. Shiney and not dried out. I would recommend these for sure. And the price?  You can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, except to warn against a product. But I have to say how great this straightener is. I have thick, but baby soft hair. I have tried every kind of straightener, but they all tend to dry my hair out. This straightener not only straightens my hair in one pass, but keeps it feeling so soft. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This flat iron took a little while to get used to, but I like it a lot now.  It gives my hair a sleek, straight effect.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron ! I have thick curly hair and it gets my hair bone straight. The irons are wide so I&#x27;m able to straighten more hair much quicker . It also doesn&#x27;t snag my hair like other flat irons I&#x27;ve used in the past. Plus the the price was right! Excellent value !</li>
    <li> This iron is good for the price. I will say it&#x27;s very difficult to straighten bangs with this thing because it&#x27;s so large. That is kind of a bummer, but if you don&#x27;t have bangs - straighten on.</li>
    <li> Really like this one!</li>
    <li> I have been using for 1 week and I had to totally come on here and Rave about this flat iron! XTAVA sent me this Professional Infrared Flat Iron with Tourmaline Ceramic Plates (Silk Edition Black) and I have fallen deep and madly in love with it! Me and flat irons have not always seen eye to eye, and the one i have is half this size and first, takes so long to flat iron my waist long, very thick hair, that I have worn in a pony tail for the past 20 years, but I have been sent a few different hair products, and while some I have found difficult to use (Like those spinning curling irons, I have a hard time with that lol) But, this Flat Iron by XTAVA is very easy to use, and I am actually enjoying using this!!&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY long, VERY frizzy, wavy hair, that I refuse to cut, so up it goes, cause I don&#x27;t want to deal with it. When I first got this, i didn&#x27;t wash my hair, i just took it down and brushed it out and tried it because I didn&#x27;t want to wait! I plugged it in, brushed out my hair, and it was hot by the time I was done! Man is it pretty when it is all lit up! It has 10 different temperature settings ranging from 265-445 degrees and I of course, put it on the hottest setting, because my hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own! So, I took a side section, and took the bulk and put it around my opposite shoulder, took the section i saved to flat iron and stuck the iron up to the base of my head, and closed it and brought it down to the end of my hair, and let go and, it was completely straight and very shiney! So I brought another small section over, and flat ironed that piece, and same thing, completely straight the First Time! I didn&#x27;t have to go over it again! It took me about 20 mins to do my whole head that first time, and I have done it 3 more times since then and I can now do my whole head in about 12-15 minutes, so i&#x27;m getting better!!&lt;br /&gt;I have flat ironed my hair a lot before receiving this Flat Iron, and my hair has NEVER looked the way it looks after using this flat iron versus when I use mine that I have had! It must be the ceramic plates, I am not sure right now, as i have only had this a week, but i will be researching and adding that to my blog review, which I can&#x27;t to research this!&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a Flat Iron, that will make your hair straight on the First stroke, look no further than this Professional Infrared Flat Iron with Tourmaline Ceramic Plates, I PROMISE, you will not be disappointed!flat iron versus when I use mine that I have had! It must be the ceramic plates, I am not sure right now, as i have only had this a week, but i will be researching and adding that to my blog review, which I can&#x27;t to research this!&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a Flat Iron, that will make your hair straight on the First stroke, look no further than this Professional Infrared Flat Iron with Tourmaline Ceramic Plates, I PROMISE, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It really works well. Not too heavy which is important to me. Hair comes out nice and smooth. I would give it 5 stars if the temperature setting was not located on the side where my hand grips. I can change the setting without realizing it which gives me the wrong temperature.Trying to figure out how to hold it without this happening.</li>
    <li> So I put a bun in my hair last night when I got out of the bath and accidently fell asleep before I took it out. What a mistake as I woke up to a huge frizzy mess. Luckily, I had just recieved this awesome xtava infrared flat iron! This flat iron is a beast at tackling the biggest hair mess!  It heat high very quickly. It has tons of temperature adjustments settings! It was so fast to do my hair bc of the extra wide plates. The 8 ft cord swivels for easy use. No need to twist and turn the cord. Super easy to use and works fabulously! I am happy to recieve this wonderful flat iron to review. I recommend it! (Before and after pics included!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m actually a guy with long hair who has been using a flat iron for many years.  I love having my hair long but know that I need to be able to control it, as my hair is naturally super thick, coarse, and wild.  This way, I can pull it back into a neat tail to look presentable for work.  For a long time now, I&#x27;ve used a Jilbere iron; but it&#x27;s been on its last leg for a while.  So I decided to pick one of these up after reading all the good reviews.  I was skeptical at first with all the claims of infrared technology but figured all the good reviews must mean something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have not been disappointed.  The product seems well made.  It works better than my Jilbere iron did and took me fewer passes to get all my hair under control.  When I use a flat iron, I do it kind of hastily.  I don&#x27;t separate sections of hair or anything like that.  I tend to do it quickly, grabbing chunks of hair as I go that look like they haven&#x27;t been hit yet.  With this iron, I was able to completely finish in 20 minutes.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems hitting the buttons while holding it, because I just make sure that the I&#x27;m holding the iron in a way that the buttons are facing away from my palm each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line is I really like this iron.  My only hope is that it holds up for as long as my old one did.</li>
    <li> Ordering the smaller size to so in luv with them</li>
    <li> Once again Xtava has done it again. I used it on my daughters super thick hair and this time I timed it and it only took 21 minutes which is a first time for us. Straightening her hair is usually a lot of work and takes a long time but Xtava has proven to me that it doesn&#x27;t need to be one. First off upon opening the box their is an included bag that helps keeping it stored and not get damaged or dusty while not in use. I&#x27;ve never used an infrared flat iron and I am highly impressed at how well it worked. It didn&#x27;t damage her hair or leave her hair dry like other flat irons do. It actually looks healthy after using. It has a nice shine to it. I like that it has the temperature on it so I can adjust it accordingly depending on our hair type. This is a very well made and not cheap flat iron it is worth every penny. I am simply in love with this flat iron. I was given the opportunity to test out this product however the opinion and pictures are my own.</li>
    <li> I love this product makes my curly very straight and shiny</li>
    <li> Works great,heats up fast</li>
    <li> wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;My GF just don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s automatically turns of too fast after getting hot.</li>
    <li> I have *extremely* damaged hair, so I am careful about the products and tools I use.  When I broke my previous flat iron, I cautiously ordered a new one-- this Xtava infared flat iron.  I was impressed by the reviews, but was only cautiously optimistic because I was so concerned about how the heat could damage my hair.  Thankfully, I had nothing to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~ Infared vs. Ceramic and Hair&#x27;s Response---  All my previous flat irons were ceramic irons, which did a good job ironing my hair, but I didn&#x27;t like how I could hear my hair frying (even at a low temperature of 285*).  I don&#x27;t hear my hair fry with this iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~ Flattening Quality--- This iron does a great job ironing my naturally wavy hair into a smooth style.  My hair looks NATURALLY straight, not flattened straight.  I like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~ Heating Time--- This iron does seem to take a little longer to heat than my previous irons, but it is still ready within a more than reasonable time.  It takes approximately two minutes to heat to 285*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~ Cord Length--- This iron has a nice, long cord, so I can plug it in and easily maneuver around without difficulty.  I am no longer tied to one spot only inches away from the outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~ Storage--- The iron comes with a zippered bag that is lined in a heat-resistant fabric.  It is very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~ Overall impression--- I am very impressed.  My hair looks good, the iron is easy to use, and the manufacturer seems responsive.  This is a great purchase!</li>
    <li> This item is wonderful! I have tried a lot of flat irons and this one is the best so far and at a great price! I would definitely recommend this! My hair is very thick and a little wavy but it got it very straight.</li>
    <li> My Chi flat iron died recently so I decided to try Xtava. So glad I did!! I love mine. My hair looks great. It heats up quickly and smooths my curly hair perfectly at a fraction of the price of Chi.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair. Recently my hairdresser took a flat iron to my entire head of hair, and I was transformed!  Straight, smooth...wonderful. This was a look I wanted to keep. After researching flat irons, I settled on the XTAVA Professional Flat Iron with tourmaline ceramic plates.  It definitely is an investment in time to do all of my hair, but the results are fantastic.  It&#x27;s as close as I can get to the salon look. This product is wonderful and really does a great job on the most difficult hair (at least mine!). I highly recommend it. And I was NOT given this product as a sample for review.  I&#x27;m a true customer, through and through.  :-)</li>
    <li> Wide, has digital thermometer. Heats fast. Better than CHi</li>
    <li> This simply the best flat iron I have ever used  and I have tried many. I love that it is so light weight and easy to use, the cord does not twist as many others do it simply spins on a 360 angel so you do not have to worry about the cord twisting. I love that it takes less then half the time to use as my old flat iron. I have thrown the old in the rubbish. My hairs course and wiry and now it is sleek and straight. I am so happy with the versatility of this flat iron. If you want a professional grade style at home then this is for you. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PURPOSES OF A PRODUCT REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND THEY REFLECT MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION.</li>
    <li> This beats the 100 dollar straighteners by far</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the number of positive reviews because most had received the straightener free/with a significant discount, but I decided to give it a try anyway. It arrived in a really nice travel bag, on time. I used it on air dried hair, set to 355 degrees - my hair is what I would consider &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, not too thick or thin, with a distinct natural wave and some frizz, long - and it worked wonderfully. It instantly made my hair smooth and shiny, and the wider plates cut my straightening time in half. I would compare the results to that I would get from using a CHI, but it was even sweeter because it was less than half the price, and my hair didn&#x27;t smell burned when I was done. I straightened my hair two days ago and it&#x27;s still going strong. I have only gotten to use it once, so I will update if anything changes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. I have 3 other brands of flat irons and this one has took their place. First I love that it&#x27;s wide instead of narrow. My very first flat iron was wide and it was the best. Then they started comic out with narrow ones that take forever to flatten my hair. I have thick long hair so doing it alone is a job. But with this flat iron it didn&#x27;t take long at all. I set the digital temperature to where I wanted it to be. Instead of having only high/med/low to choose from. There was no smoke during or after. And no burning of my hair or smells of my hair burning. The flat iron is light weighted and very smooth. I recommend this flat iron to anyone looking for a better flat iron for their hair. I also used Xtava iconic hair dryer before flat ironing and it cut my drying time down 90%. I have attached pictures of proof of how good it works. I received this product for my honest opinion and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> It came at 2 PM and by 2.10 PM I was done straightening my hair and I have a thick set of hair (Curly and heavy)! So, it&#x27;s great that this iron made it effortless to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Used it only once so won&#x27;t be able to give more feedback, but so far I absolutely love the results. It didn&#x27;t feel like it was burning my hair. The part of the stick you hold on to doesn&#x27;t get heated up and is easy to press when doing a smaller section of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got this, keeping fingers crossed that it continues to amaze me!</li>
    <li> Love love love it. I have a chi to the cheapest one you can buy and this one is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> Unlike most of the other reviewers, I was not give this product free, but bought it to replace a chi that broke after many years. Even though this is much less expensive than a chi, I really see no differences in terms of performance.  I have been using it for about 2 months, and the only down side is that the on/off switch is easily turned off during styling. As others have noted, the long power cord is nice and even lower temperature settings work for my thick and curly hair. Not sure what the infrared mumbo jumbo is about.</li>
    <li> Amazing flat iron! I used to love revlon as a brand but I&#x27;ve definitely switched to Xtava!</li>
    <li> This works so well and doesn&#x27;t fry my fine hair because I can adjust the temperature.  My hair is shiny and has way fewer flyaways. It stays cool enough on the edges that I don&#x27;t burn my fingers. My hair has never looked so good on a consistent basis. Love this!</li>
    <li> I love love my new flat iron from XTAVA!!! Not sure how I managed my hair all those years before my recent purchase. I would highly recommend this wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> works very nice. I love the temperature settings and the bag it comes packaged in</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have ever owned.  Long cord, great width for medium or long hair, heats fast, does not burn hair and it does the job is supposed to well.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have very tight curls and this flat iron just melts them away. Two passes and it&#x27;s on to the next section. Flat ironing my hair is no longer a chore!</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice since receiving it a week ago. I am very happy with this purchase. It leaves my thick long wavy hair, smooth and soft. My hair feels and looks shiny, again.</li>
    <li> I purchased it with my own money.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good flat iron considering the $40 cost. My first time buying a iron of 2 inches. Does the job quick.&lt;br /&gt;The only down point is heat up time is too long. On mine takes over 2 minutes to be ready. I set it on 410 degrees and blinks constantly until reaches the desired temperature. Just be mindful about it. I plug it ahead of time while I&#x27;m drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It works well as a flat&lt;br /&gt;Iron and also as a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is colored hair, frizzy, tick, long.&lt;br /&gt;Live to know that portion of the purchase goes to a foundation. Good job !</li>
    <li> Of all my Xtava irons, this is my favorite for straightening.  I have shoulder length curly hair.  With a little heat protector spray I blow dry my hair (yes it&#x27;s very frizzy when I do), or let it air dry, then section out my hair and iron it.  The size of the flat iron makes it quick and easy start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron will leave you with smooth silky straight hair.  You would never know I have a full head of wild curls before ironing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using the Xtava product line, I&#x27;ve lost a lot less hair; this iron glides over your hair with zero pulling, zero breakage.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product! Arrived on time, great packaging. Comes in a heat proof carry case which is a plus for travel. Works. Great, heats quickly, easy to use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I had tried using a flat iron. My hair is long, to about the middle of my back and pretty straight all on it&#x27;s own so I never considered using something that would straighten it further. Then I received the XTAVA Infared Flat Iron to review.  Holy moly! What a difference it makes! I wouldn&#x27;t have believed I would love an appliance, or even my hair so much! I was totally surprised by how quickly I am able to go over all my hair and get great looking, great feeling results. I had seen flat irons with slender little elements, but I love the wider ones of this one.  It smooths my hair and tames the fly away strands, giving it a sleeker, much nicer appearance. It smooths without frying my hair too. I cringe when I think of all the years I spent trying to get my straight hair to curl, sizzling it with curling irons. Yikes... With this flat iron I am able to gently move it over each section of hair without over heating my hair. I am amazed that I can actually touch my hair right after running the flat iron over it and it doesn&#x27;t burn my hand.&lt;br /&gt;The cord is the longest I have ever seen on a hair appliance and you might think that it would cause it to tangle or get in the way, but it actually is a huge help. There is a swivel joint where it connects to the iron so as you move it around doing each section, each side, it moves with you and doesn&#x27;t tangle. I like that the control buttons are on the side of the handle. I find that I don&#x27;t have the problem of accidentally turning of the flat iron in the middle of using it since the buttons are not on top where the natural grip of the handle is.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this many time now and each time I marvel at how much I like it. It is great quality and it really does a great job on my hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. I have had a few over the years but this is the best iron ever. I have really thick hair and this iron allowed me to flat iron my entire head in less than 20 minutes. It allows me to wash my hair and let it air dry and then I flat iron it with this iron and it leaves my hair straight, silky and light. I have had so many compliments on how healthy my hair is and how good it looks from using this iron. This is the best investment you will ever make. It&#x27;s porcelain plates glides over ones hair effortlessly and it made my hair super straight, silky and shiny. It has different settings, so don&#x27;t worry about frying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, The iron works really well with hair extensions( silky, wet and wavy and body waves) and all types of coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very effective and inexpensive ( well not as expensive as the Chi&#x27;s and the FHI&#x27;s) product and it looks more expensive than it costs and more importantly does a superb job. Don&#x27;t hesitate to get it if you have long hair and cant stand using those itty bitty 1 inch contraptions.&lt;br /&gt;i received a free sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary XTAVA Professional Infrared Flat iron with Tourmaline ceramic plates for review/testing purposes and my review/feedback is 100% mine and unbiased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first impression I had when I received my XTAVA was that it was &amp;#34;hi-tech.&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t know much about how it would perform but since I haven&#x27;t tried any flat iron with infrared, I had to give this a go and see what results I would get once I have tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with it&#x27;s sleek design and look. It looks like a futuristic flat iron because of the infrared. Aside from that, it has digital indicator on top to show the temperature setting, the side of the handle has the + and - buttons for the heat settings and the on/off switch. Comparing the XTAVA to my generic brand flat iron I bought sometime back, the XTAVA has modern features. My old one was just plugged on the electrical socket and had no light indicator for the heat or temperature setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd thing that I liked about the XTAVA Professional Infrared Flat Iron with tourmaline ceramic top is that it has infrared! The infrared feature heats the hair from the inside out and helped seal my hair&#x27;s natural moisture so preventing further damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is a big factor too. It is around 2&amp;#34; wide so it had more coverage. My old flat iron would normally straighten my hair in several strokes. The XTAVA only straightened my locks for a max of 3 strokes per bunch of hair (I grouped my hair in a quadrant as I always do when straightening my hair). And because of the wider and larger plates, straightening my long and curly hair didn&#x27;t take long as I would using my old flat iron. It only took me 20 mins. max to finish straightening all of my locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish was smooth and shiny. It is as if I added protective serum but I didn&#x27;t. With my old flat iron, I usually use a heat protecting serum or an anti-frizz serum for added gloss. But with XTAVA, I have just allowed it to do its thing and it was fabulous! I don&#x27;t have to buy serums nor heat protector spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is big BUT it is lightweight. It weighs approx. 1 lbs., almost the same weight as my smaller and old flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t get too hot because of the regulated temperature control. The product came with guides on which heat setting is ideal for different types of hair. Mine was the fine one so I had to stay within the 250-300 temp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has swivel cord so it was easy to use around my hair. The cord is 8 ft long, long enough to use in my vanity area without having to plug an extension cord. And has an auto-shut feature with switches the unit off when not in use for 60 mins. That is such a big relief because I don&#x27;t have to worry or think if I had left it plugged and switched on. That&#x27;s a big SAFETY PLUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also came with a nice insulated bag to protect the product from dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very happy with this product and I think I won&#x27;t be using my other flat iron anymore because it pales in comparison with XTAVA. I am highly recommending this because of the performance, features and affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary XTAVA Professional Infrared Flat iron with Tourmaline ceramic plates for review/testing purposes and my review/feedback is 100% mine and unbiased.thing and it was fabulous!

    <li> Great iron! Only reason not 5 stars is placement of buttons. Easy to accidentally turn up/down or shut off without realizing.  Provides easy straightening, with a lot of hair at one time so I can finish faster.  Really easy to use to curl or hair too.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my wife an she loves it! Excellent product.</li>
    <li> First, my story of my straightener before the infrared. I have really thick, long, and curly hair with frizz and also in layers. layers is a bit more difficult to straighten when the person has curly hair. I am guilty of using the straighteners that are super bad for your hair. Regular metal plates and they destroy my hair, make split ends worse and decrease volume so it doesn&#x27;t look as pretty.I had to add serums to try to make my hair shine.&lt;br /&gt;I got the infrared and  love the new infrared Heat technology. This straightener I was excited to try. the company claims to have so many positives but what i was most concerned about was the maximum hair protection and if it actually left your hair silky using your own hair&#x27;s moisture and natural oils. Well with one stroke at the 410 degree, my hair was straight, super shiny and silky and most of all NO CREASES which really bother me when i spend an hour doing my hair. I was really impressed. The plates on the straightener are great. they will glide through your hair like butter. If you have the traditional straighteners, it will take a minute to adjust since like myself I had to pull the darn thing to straighten. Another huge positive is that it had an 8 foot cord. My other was maybe 3 feet max and it was so annoying that I had to re-position myself when I had to do the back of my head or it would not reach. Lastly, the Automatic turn off technology. I do sometimes forget to turn it off so it gives you a piece of mind if you go somewhere and think you forgot to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I got this product free of charge and reviewed it with my honest opinion. All opinions are my own and I only recommend products that are good for my audience and products I&#x27;ve had a positive experience with.</li>
    <li> When looking for a hair straightener I want one that does not damage my hair. I had never used an infared straightener until I found this Xtava one. I straightened my hair in about 30 minutes, which is half the time it usually takes.  I love that the straightener has different temperature settings, depending on the type of hair you have. My hair was not left dry and damaged, like it usually is after using a flat iron. My hair, as you can see in my pictures, was silky and shiny afterward. It was also very smooth and soft. I would definitely purchase this Xtava straightener again. I love the heat resistant bag that it comes with too. I turned it inside out and placed my straightener on it as I was straightening my hair. That is a great bonus when you buy this straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this Xtava straightener for anyone looking for a new hair tool. I did receive this complimentary to give my full and honest opinion, which in this case, is very positive.</li>
    <li> This is a good flat iron, but definitely not a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;The shine on my hair comes from the argan oil not from this flat iron, and it&#x27;s a little heavy to use.For short hair you cannot get very close to the roots, so that&#x27;s something to consider.The package is neat and it arrived on time only after they sent me a wrong product for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m happy with my purchase though.</li>
    <li> I bought it mostly for the good reviews I saw here (Amazon) even though I was hesitant since is inexpesive. But so far, I LOVE IT!! Not even my old flat iron (which was one of the high brand) left my hair so smooth like with this one. RECOMMENDED 100%</li>
    <li> This flat iron is one of the better ones that I have used. This iron gets hot quickly and does not snag my hair which is a good thing for me. I did not use irons daily because I could feel and hear my hair being pulled out every time I used one. After a couple of uses and me getting familiar with using this iron I found that sometimes (not often) that my hair would snag, but that my be a fault of my own I realized. The plates on the inside are sturdy and do not shift which I have found that some of the cheaper ones will do.&lt;br /&gt;This review was written from my perspective from receiving this product for free.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly! My daughter has very unruly curly hair and this flat iron easily straightened her hair. We have tried many different irons in the past.</li>
    <li> I am beyond impressed with this straightener! My hair has a mind of its own and after a while of being straightened with the straightener I have now it wants to wave back up. I don&#x27;t have curly hair it&#x27;s wavy and not a cute wave! The xtava straightener not only straightens it but keeps it straight. Also my hair looks super healthy and shiny!! I love this straightener! I recieved this as a sample to test and review!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, and great product!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality item with great customer service!</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best flat irons I have tried. It heats up really quickly and I can flat iron my hair in half the time due to I do not have to keep going over the same strand of hair several times. I have very wavy hair and it still takes me half the time to flat iron it with this flat iron. I also love the carrying case. Great product if you are looking for a good flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have tried. Trust me I am a junkie and I have a lot. The best part is the price and excellent customer service. Tres Chic looking! Dual Voltage is the plus! I personally loves the heat setting. I have wavy but fine hair and 285F straight my hair like magic! Don&#x27;t mis out on this great deal. It&#x27;s a steal! Thanks Xtava!</li>
    <li> I have to say this is the best Flat iron I have ever purchased. It&#x27;s easy to use, and leaves hair very silky. I use argan oil heat protector and this iron slides through my hair. I have longer than shoulder length hair and i am done in 10-15 minutes. I love the digital display. The only thing i would prefer is that the power and increase/decrease buttons were less sensitive. When I touch the side it either increases and decreases but I have found a way to use it where I do not touch it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i am super pleased with my purchase and for this price, this is an amazing little tool to make my hair look awesome:))))....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Xtava:)</li>
    <li> It glides through the hair like silk!. What I loved is it never snagged My hair like some straightners, product is amazing</li>
    <li> Wow!  I have thick,  spiral curl hair and this straightener makes my hair look naturally straight.  It also cut my straightening time about 7 minutes. Love this thing.</li>
    <li> I adore this flat iron. It heats to just the right temp, very easy and simple to use. It has left my hair super shiny. it has a long cord which allows me to plug in where ever i need to and not need an extention cord. It is also wider than most ceramic ones. All in all this is an absolutely amazing flat iron. Leaves hair frizz and damage free.</li>
    <li> This product did not work well for me at all. I could not get it to stay hot, and if the flat iron was not held just right, there was terrible frizz. I am returning.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same 1&amp;#34; flat iron I bought from my salon five years ago so I couldn&#x27;t wait to test this XTAVA flat iron for quality when I was given the chance.  I was impressed with this flat iron from the moment I opened the package.  First of all, it comes in a heat resistant storage bag which zips closed and has a carrying handle on one end.  The iron itself is fairly lightweight and quite wide.  It is more than twice the size of my current iron.  There are three buttons located on the side of the handle, on/off, + , and -.  Once you plug the unit in and turn it on, you can choose the temperature you want it to heat too.  I chose 300.  I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s not particularly thick.  It took about two minutes for the flat iron to heat to temp.  There is a digital display with the chosen temperature that will flash.  Once the temp is reach, the number becomes solid.  You will notice a red strip down one side of the ceramic heating plates.  This is an infrared light which is supposed to help seal in moisture and reduce frizziness.  It must work, my hair was perfectly straight and sleek after using.  What I like most about this is it takes me about half the time for me to straighten my hair due to the large plate size.  I can twice as much hair in each time as with my previous flat iron.    The cord is really long, 8 feet and it has a swivel connection to the base of the straightener so the cord won&#x27;t be tangling on itself.  It also has a shut off feature after 60 minutes which is nice if you are forgetful like I am.  I own several XTAVA products and I have not been disappointed by any of them.</li>
    <li> Good product it gets really hot, too hot for my fine hair type.  But good product for course and long hair</li>
    <li> Amazing product i advice all women to use it, it is so fast to flat my hair.</li>
    <li> Works well... Just what I needed. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying my flat iron.  It does a great job!!</li>
    <li> I love the convenience of the Xtava Professional Inrared Flat Iron.  Straight hair that stays straight even if I put it up during the day, when I let it down it&#x27;s still straight.  I get no flyaways with only about two or three minutes of straightening.  My hair is thicker than average so I set it to 330 degrees.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems doing a quick run through of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my usually average hair shinier and like a curtain of gleaming silk.  Honestly, I feel like I had a stylist do something magical with my hair, but it&#x27;s something I did.  I love that it&#x27;s customizable so if I feel like sharing my friends and family can get the same results with their hair.  The auto off is a life saver for when getting ready.  I&#x27;m not perfect and I feel reassured knowing that I&#x27;m not going to accidentally start a fire.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing !!!!!! I&#x27;ve owned a couple high end flat irons in the past  and this def gives them a run for there money. I am so impressed with the results I get from this iron . This iron gives my hair such a straight silky smooth finish , I don&#x27;t have to run it through my hair multiple times like some other irons I have used, just one pass through my hair and it&#x27;s perfect ! It also curls hair really nicely and there&#x27;s never any pulling or breakage. I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! when i use it my hair is shining and super soft, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like its burning muy hair at all!</li>
    <li> How did I survive all these years without this? I have the messed curly frizzy indian hair. This reduces the straightening time by half. In 20 mins My hair is all straightened out and perfectly flat and just the way I like it.</li>
    <li> Used for the first time the other day, this made my hair gorgeously straight and shiny and felt smooth and lovely the whole night through.  My husband and I had a blast at the Gala.  I wish the curling Iron set would get back in stock, I would buy it immediately.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love my new straightener!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many irons in the past all high end. Thought I would give this one a try because of the reviews and it being a 2 in. This iron takes several passes through the hair and even doing so it doesn&#x27;t do that well of a job. Uneven heat that I end up with kinks and waves.  Looks high end and great case but not a iron I suggest for someone with long, thick wavy hair. Another issue would be the button for the heat setting,  I&#x27;d constantly change the setting without knowing because of where it&#x27;s located.</li>
    <li> Just got it yesterday and it worked great! My hair was soft and shiny and I got tons of compliments on it. I had a Croc which promptly broke and they don&#x27;t sell replacement parts like I needed. I will update this review in a few months to let you know how it&#x27;s holding up, but so far so good 😋</li>
    <li> I like many other women own a plethora of different hair straighteners for different needs. Not all hair straighteners are built equally. I really like quite a few features on this one. I like how it has a digital screen to actually see the temperature you are at. It flashes green when it is not at that temperature yet but stays a solid color once it is at the desired temp. There is an on and off button which not all straighteners have some you just plug in and unplug to turn on and off. This has 3 buttons on the side power and an up and down button to change the temperature of your iron. This is an infrared iron and it is the first infrared iron I have ever owned. It works a lot better than others to help with frizz and static when you use it. It is easy to use but one of the down sides is I wish the mouth of the iron would open a bit larger so it would be easier to put hair in the iron. That is the only down side I see to this but so many other upsides. Like it has a very long cord and the cord has a 360 degree swivel to it so it is easy to use without the cord getting tangled. I really like the bag that was included with it. It is foil lined in case the iron is still a little warm when it gets put away. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
    <li> What an awesome flat Iron! Infrared?? seriously! what will they think of next. Infrared means its going to heat your hair from the inside out, so hair is going to maintain that straightness longer, and its not going to dry out, and fry your hair.  The straightener is Dual voltage, and switches automatically for you, which is really cool. You can change the heat settings, another thing I like the LCD display is brightly lit. The only thing I have to say is, for some reason my temp kept flashing. I don&#x27;t know why yet, the locking lever at the bottom is a cool feature, however I did find that I was using my nails to pull it down, instead of being able to use my finger to slide it.  It is wider than the other one I have, which is nice because I can grab more hair at once, than the other one. It is so sleek, and shiny, the hot plates on each side heat evenly, and quickly. 2 min and you&#x27;re ready to go. It only took me a couple of minutes to straighten my hair, I had thrown it up into a bun while it was wet, so it would be curly.  This straightened and added shine, my hair looked so sleek and healthy!  Keep in mind, I have VERY long hair,  so I was excited to try this, I can&#x27;t believe it,  it works so well. The swivel cord is quite a nice touch too. No tripping or getting tangled, and it is long enough that your not standing next to your counter leaned over trying to use it.  This is a high quality straightener, at a very affordable price. Sample received for review.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is well made, beautifully packaged and it works perfectly on my wavy hair. I would highly recommend this product.  I got it on sale so I feel like I got a real bargain.</li>
    <li> It is an amazing iron! one pass and your hair soft and smooth. Doesn&#x27;t damage or cut ends like how others do. very easy to use and feel different( sleek and smooth) on your hair as you style! I am definitely in love with XTAVA. I purchased few of their other products they have. I am absolutely amazed by the quality and the price. The packaging was wonderful as well( Clean and neat)  keep in mind I owned all kind of high end hair straighteners and curlers such shii and GHD. So, by far this is the best! I wish I knew about it earlier! I definitely recommend you wont regret! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I LOVVVVVEEEEE MY NEW FLAT IRON I WAS UNSURE AT FIRST BUT ITS THE BEST FLAT IRON I EVER HAD ITS ALSO GOOD ON AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR which i was not sure on but i loveeee it</li>
    <li> It turns off everytime i try to use it</li>
    <li> Love it! I tried Hot Tools for $52. It did nothing to straighten my hair. I also purchased a unit by Global Network-also a piece of junk for $80.&lt;br /&gt;This one is fabulous. The only thing i would change is having the unit open wider to grab the hair. But it works great. I woud buy another one.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect addition for any beauty routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start out by saying I have very long, thick, curly and coarse hair.  Anything I typically do with my hair takes forever.  I recently purchase a blow dryer from XTAVA that is amazing so I thought I would give this flat iron a chance too.  So happy I did!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was in the box?  The flat iron comes in a sleek black box.  Inside a carrying case along with a users manual. This is an awesome feature!  This manual will tell you which setting for your hair type too.  The Flat Iron features: Ceramic plate dimensions are 4.33&amp;#34;, dual voltage, temperature reading is lcd display, temp setting from 260 degrees to 455 degrees and automatic shut off in 1 hour. Also an awesome feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I would add product to my hair, blow dry and then flat iron.  For this purpose I did not add product to my hair but did blow dry.  Now, as I stated above I have long, curly and coarse hair. I am used to going through a section at a time, so thats how I started. I just went through only using the iron once before going to the next.  All in all it already saved me a couple of minutes.  I did not have any frizz even though I did not use any product.  I did not feel the need to go over any sections again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This amazing iron only. doing each strand of hair, finished my hair in a fraction of the time. I am getting out the door in record time! So do I love it enough to recommend?  Absolutely! This iron has so many uses for so many styles but still not take a lot of time doing it. I was so ecstatic when I was chosen to review this item and give them my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the XTAVA infrared flat iron, from the packaging to the usage and final look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the cushioned feel of the straightener as you grip it, very soft and easy to handle, no slip. The easy to read and adjust green led lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates are nice and smooth, with a slightly rounded edge. I love the width of the plates on this one. I usually use a 3/4-1 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You hair will pull through this with no pulling, nice and smooth process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine, so I section off the areas I want to straighten first and then continue until my hair is all straight. Smooth, shiny, silky finish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been very impressed with all the Xtava products I have been honored to test. I would have purchased this straightener over my GHD that was $225, any day. It works just as well!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this flat iron. It is a little on the heavy side, but heats up fast and works great.</li>
    <li> Best straightener ever bought!!!! I have very long, thick, curly hair that normally takes 2 hours to straighten and with this product only took me 20 minutes!!!!</li>
